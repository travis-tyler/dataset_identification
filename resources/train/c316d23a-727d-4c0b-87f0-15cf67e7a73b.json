Figure 1 shows that this trend is quite similar to that of the share of immigrants among workers with low education. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that economic analysis has paid comparatively little attention to the relationship between foreign and native labor within the market for these highly-educated workers.\nThis paper adds to the literature by exploring the substitutability of highly-educated native and immigrant workers. Borjas (2003 Borjas ( , 2006 and Borjas and Katz (2005) argue that workers with identical educational attainment (and experience) are perfectly substitutable. In contrast, papers focusing on less-educated workers by Manacorda et. al. (2006) , Ottaviano and Peri (2008) , and Peri and Sparber (2009) have argued that native and immigrant workers possess somewhat differentiated skills. This imperfect substitutability is important because it allows natives to specialize in occupations requiring tasks in which they have a comparative advantage, thereby mitigating possible wage losses from immigration. Although we do not estimate wage consequences of immigration in this paper, it is reasonable to assume that such effects for highlyeducated labor will also depend upon the substitutability of foreign and native-born workers.\nThus, we document the characteristics of occupations adopted by highly-educated native and foreign-born labor, and then analyze how native-born employees with graduate degrees change their occupations (and their associated skill content) in response to increases in the proportion of similarly-educated foreign labor.\nWe begin by assuming that highly-educated native and foreign workers provide two general skills in their occupations. First, they are responsible for performing interactive (or communication) tasks such as talking with supervisors, subordinates, or customers. Second, they also supply quantitative (or analytical) tasks such as performing advanced mathematical analysis, designing new products using the principles of physics, and diagnosing ailments or diseases.\nGiven that highly-educated immigrants, relative to native-born workers, will have imperfect language skills, knowledge of local networks, and familiarity with social norms, natives should have a comparative advantage in supplying communication skills, while highly-educated immigrants will have a comparative advantage in performing quantitative and analytical tasks.\nTo assess the potential for specialization among highly-educated native and foreign-born workers, we merge data on occupational skills and abilities from the National Center for O*NET Development with individual-level Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 2003-2008. Together, this allows us to measure the skills that native-born workers with graduate degrees used in both their current occupation and the occupation they held in the previous year.\nWe then use the 1990 Census and 2002-2007 American Community Surveys (ACS) to construct the foreign-born share of highly-educated employment for each year and occupation. After merging this information with the individual-level CPS and skill data, we analyze whether the change in occupational skills used by a highly-educated native employee over the course of a year is related to the change, since 1990, in the share of highly-educated immigrants in the occupation he/she held in the previous year. 1 We find that native and foreign-born workers with graduate degrees are imperfect substitutes. Immigrants specialize in occupations demanding quantitative and analytical skills, while natives specialize in occupations requiring interactive and communication skills. We then perform a series of regressions to assess the native response to migration. Our basic specification finds that individual native workers move to occupations with higher communication content in response to an increase in the share of immigrants within their original occupation. We interpret the effects as causal -omitted variables and reverse causality concerns are abated since our regressions control for an array of individual and occupation characteristics, and our explanatory variable of interest measures the lagged increase of immigrants. Moreover, we show that the response in skill specialization is larger for native workers than for immigrants and hence unlikely to originate from common occupation-specific demand shifts. Nevertheless, as the variation of immigrants across occupations is not genuinely random (or exogenous), the causal interpretation of the results should be taken with some caution.\nFor completeness, we close the empirical exercise by also testing whether immigration is related to changes in native employment status. We find little to no evidence that highlyeducated native employees in occupations with large increases in the proportion of similarlyeducated immigrants are more likely to become unemployed or leave the labor force."}, {"section_title": "Motivation", "text": "Many developed countries actively work to attract highly-educated immigrants.\n2 It is easy to imagine that such workers generate aggregate gains. Endogenous growth literature and its emphasis on human capital spillovers and scale effects in promoting technological development suggest high-education immigration could bolster total factor productivity, GDP per capita, and wages. 3 A diversity of immigrant perspectives, experiences, and networks could spur idea generation and trade. 4 Borjas (1999) argues that educated immigrants can improve fiscal conditions by increasing tax revenues without burdening social services. Such immigrants might also reduce short-run wage gaps across education levels by increasing the relative supply of highly productive workers.\nDespite possible aggregate benefits, recent US policy changes have attempted to reduce the number of college-educated foreign-born workers entering the country. In 2004, the annual cap on the number of new H-1B visas (which permit college-educated foreign-nationals to work in the US for three years, renewable to six) was lowered from 195,000 to 65,000. Similarly, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included a provision making it more difficult for firms receiving TARP (Troubled Asset Recovery Program) funds from hiring H-1B workers as part of the bill's overall economic stimulus package. Though most foreign-born workers with advanced degrees are exempt from these regulations, it is conceivable that future legislation will attempt to limit their entry in the US labor market as well."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Presumably, policy-makers are concerned that highly-educated immigrants compete with similarly-educated natives. Comparatively few economic studies have analyzed the effect of immigration within the market for workers with graduate degrees, however. One area of exception is in documenting differences in skills between native and foreign-born workers. Foreigners exhibit a greater proclivity for quantitative skills, with differences emerging at an early age. Chellaraj, Maskus, and Mattoo (2005) cite Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) 6 evidence that \"among the major developed countries and the newly 2 See Kapur and McHale (2005) and Chiswick and Taengnoi (2007) . 3 See Romer (1986) , Lucas (1988) , Romer (1990) , Ciccone and Hall (1996) , and Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle (2009) . 4 See Gould (1994) , Rauch and Trindade (2002) , Peri (2005, 2006a) , and Sparber (2008 Sparber ( , 2009 Like most of the related literature, our paper focuses on native/immigrant imperfect substitutability within broad education groups (in our case, among those with a graduate degree).\nSome, however, have gone farther by noting differences within narrowly-defined fields. Stephan and Levin (2007) show that science and engineering graduates making exceptional contributions to US S&E in the recent past were disproportionately foreign-born. Levin et. al. (2004) compare actual employment changes for native and immigrant S&E doctorates in occupational sectors with changes that would have occurred if employment in each sector had grown at the same rate of all S&E doctorates. They find that the share of native S&E doctorates employed in non-S&E positions (7.6%) was greater than the corresponding share among immigrants (4.2%).\nMoreover, the share of native Ph.D.s in non-S&E jobs after accounting for sectorial composition predicted by trends in native and immigrant S&E Ph.D. attainment (3.4%) is also higher than the figure associated with immigrants (1.6%).\nOne could easily argue that policy and other selection issues might influence the type and skill-set of the highly-educated immigrants who arrive in the US. 8 However, it is the existence of differences themselves that can imply imperfect substitutability between native and foreignborn workers. Past evidence suggests that a comparative advantage in the US labor market 7 Also see Stephan et al. (2002) . 8 Papers studying immigrant selection issues include Bhagwati and Rao (1999) , which claims that \"the preponderance of foreign students get into technical and scientific programs because they (chiefly Asians) happen to be 'good at' mathematics and far less so at 'verbal' skills.\" Similarly, Chiswick (1999) explains the attraction of foreign students to US science by arguing that \"science involves internationally transferable skills in contrast to the tendency for the humanities to be much more country specific.\" exists such that highly-educated natives choose communication-intensive jobs, while foreignborn workers are attracted to math, science, and engineering occupations. We add further evidence by documenting similar behavior in Section 3.\nAfter addressing imperfect substitutability and comparative advantage, the relevant question for our analysis is then how natives with graduate degrees respond to new arrivals of similarly-educated immigrants. Literature in this area is less complete. Levin et. al. (2004) , for example, explicitly state that the occupational effects they term \"displacement effects\" are not causal, while Stephan and Levin (2007) note that \"the question of how immigrants affect employment outcomes in S&E has yet to be investigated.\" George Borjas has done the most work trying to identify the consequences of highly-educated immigration. Borjas (2007) notes that universities only offer a fixed number of seats in the shortrun. Thus, a rise in foreign enrollment can potentially push natives out of universities or into lesser-quality schools. Though he does not find a crowd-out effect for natives in general, he does find evidence supporting the crowding-out of native white men. Interestingly, Groen and Rizzo (2007) provide evidence to suggest that such natives may be moving toward educational programs in accordance with comparative advantage. They find that although the share of Ph.D.s granted to US citizens in the sciences declined between 1963 and 2000, the propensity for native students to pursue an MBA increased markedly.\nIn terms of employment effects, Borjas (1999) argues that immigration policies favouring highly-educated immigrants are likely to be detrimental to highly-educated native workers (though probably beneficial to the US economy as a whole). Borjas (2003) finds that the immigration influx in the 1980s and 1990s caused wages to fall by 4.9% for college graduates.\nSimilarly, Borjas (2006) argues that a 10% immigration-induced increase in the supply of S&E doctorates causes the wages paid to native S&E doctorates to decline by 3-4%. 9 Half of this wage effect can be explained by the displacement of natives into low-paying post-doc positions in the sciences. He also argues that native and foreign-born doctorates are perfectly substitutable within \"cohort by scientific field of study\" groups. This is both because a science doctorate is a \"highly specialized endeavor, requiring the investment of a great deal of time and effort, and the training is very specific,\" but also because he finds that native and foreign-born wages exhibit no statistically distinctive response to immigration. This result is echoed by Bound and 9 Borjas (2005) provides a similar result in a more condensed version of Borjas (2006) . Turner (2006) , who argue that their \"initial evidence on the relative wages of foreign and U.S.\nborn Ph.D.s indicates near perfect substitutability.\"\nWe believe that the reality may be more nuanced, especially if highly-educated native and foreign workers work in differing occupations and employ differing skills. In the empirical analysis of Section 4, we more formally assess how employed native-born workers with graduate degrees respond to immigration through their choice of occupation and the skills those occupations require."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "To ascertain how the occupational skills used by native-born workers change in response to In their analysis of the effects of immigration on workers with little educational attainment, Peri and Sparber (2009) simply aggregate re-scaled O*NET values to the state level. They then use variation across states over a long time horizon to identify the effects of immigration on the skills used by less-educated natives. The methodology is appropriate since evidence suggests that markets for less-educated labor are local, and native-born workers without college experience do not respond to immigration by moving across state borders."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Regressions employing cross-state variation in immigration rates and skill use may be inappro- 11 It is important to note that highly-educated workers use these skills extensively. Many of the omitted skill measures focus on manual tasks (which highly-educated workers do not often use) or on skills in which the comparative advantage is not immediately obvious (such as creativity or organizational ability). Exceptions to this rule exist, as Table 3 will make apparent, but it would be simple to incorporate additional skills into the analysis.\n12 Thus, for example, a Mathematical Reasoning ability value of 0.91 for Economists imply that Economists used more of these skills than 91% of the workforce in 2000.\n13 See Card (2007) , Card and Lewis (2007) , Cortes (2008) , Ottaviano and Peri (2007) , or Peri and Sparber (2010). priate, however, if labor markets are national in scope.\n14 It would be controversial to impose the assumption that highly-educated natives are unresponsive to immigration, so we choose a methodological alternative to Peri and Sparber (2009) that is robust to labor mobility conditions by instead analyzing the effect of immigration on employed individuals at the national level in a shorter and more recent time period. Specifically, we assess how the change in the foreign-born share of workers with a graduate degree in an occupation since 1990 subsequently affects the yearly change in occupational skills used by highly-educated native employees.\n15 Though this identification strategy avoids potential problems with cross-region variation, it will fail to account for occupational changes that take longer to develop. Such delays in response could be caused by the need for further educational training to enter new highly-specialized fields (as discussed in Borjas (2006)), as well as rigorous training to meet occupational licensing requirements. 16 We therefore believe that our results will represent a lower-bound estimate of the native response to immigration.\nThe individuals in our analysis come from the CPS, which records both a respondent's occupation in the year of and prior to the survey. We focus on the post-9/11 period and merge (2006) for evidence. 15 We use longer differences (between 1990 and year t) in measuring the inflow of foreign-born to allow for slow responses and reduce noise and measurement error in the explanatory variable. At the same time this implies that the cross-sectional variation identifies most of the effect. 16 Ball, Dube, and Sorensen (2010) note that licensed occupations have a high degree of interactive content. Moreover, undocumented immigrants find it particularly costly to acquire a license, as evidenced by the fact that Mexican-born workers are less likely to work in licensed professions than natives are, and this difference is only marginally significant for those with post-graduate degrees. Bratsberg and Raaum (2010) use licensing requirements as a source of exogenous variation in immigration rates of less-educated workers across industries and argue that such requirements inhibit migrant mobility more than native mobility. If also true among highly-educated workers, licensing requirements could be a confounding factor in our analysis.\n17 Ruggles et al. (2005) provides CPS data through IPUMS. We base the current-year occupation merge on the variable occ1990. The variable occly measures an individual's occupation in the prior-year. Using the IPUMS-provided occupation-to-occ1990 crosswalk, we are able to construct an analogous occ90ly variable that provides time-consistent codes for an indivual's occupation in the prior year. We base the prior-year occupation merge on this variable. born share simply measure the difference in this proportion between the 1990 Census and the relevant ACS year."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Before turning to the empirical analysis, a few descriptive statistics, tables, and charts will be helpful. Over the survey period, 6.2% of the 44,018 highly-educated native individuals in the sample changed their occupation in the course of a year. Table 2 lists each occupation with more than 100 CPS observations, the percentage-point change in the foreign-born share between 1990 and the 2002-2007 ACS samples, the proportion of highly-educated natives that chose new occupations over the course of a year, and the percentage of the native highlyeducated workforce that was new to a given occupation during a year. Turnover rates vary sizably. Around 10% of highly-educated natives in several management occupations leave their occupation in a year, but only about 1% of lawyers and architects do. Given that an individual's occupation in both the preceding and current year are recorded in the same survey, we believe that most of the observed changes reflect actual changes and not simple coding errors. The change in the foreign-born share also varies considerably -it declined for both Police Officers and Kindergarten Teachers, but rose by more than 20 percentage points for Electrical Engineers and Computer Software developers. Table 3 lists the average occupational skill intensity among highly-educated employees between 2003-2008 for all skill measures, including those not used in the analysis. The value of 0.78 for Inductive Reasoning, for example, indicates that the average occupation chosen by workers with graduate degrees required more inductive reasoning skills than that used by 78% of the entire labor force. Note that all skill measures we use (italicized in Table 3 ) have average values above 0.5, suggesting that these are skills often adopted by highly-educated workers. Table 4 provides select skill values for occupations commonly employing highly-educated labor (more than 25% of the workers in each occupation hold a graduate degree). Column (1) lists the foreign-born share of highly-educated workers for each occupation in the table. Columns (2) and (4) provide the level of quantitative and interactive skills computed by averaging our five 18 Individual-level regressions in Section 4 include non-group quarter, wage-earning, civilian employees, 25 to 65 years old, with a masters, professional, or doctorate degree, who worked in defined states, industries, and occupations both in the year of and prior to the CPS survey (note that CPS data does not allow us to identify whether individuals aged 25 and older are enrolled in school). Immigrant share estimates do not require that the individual is currently employed. Skill percentiles are based upon non-group quarter, wage-earning, civilian employees, 18-65 years old, working in defined industries and occupations in the 1% 2000 Census, regardless of educational attainment and country of birth.\nquantitative and seven interactive skills, respectively. The fourth column records the relative quantitative versus interactive value, and the final column converts this ratio into a percentile so that the occupation with the median value of quantitative versus interactive skill level (among all workers between age 18 and 65 in 2000) has a value of 0.5. Though far from a perfect one-toone correspondence, the table demonstrates that foreign-born laborers disproportionately work in occupations demanding high quantitative versus interactive skills. Also, the occupational ordering of relative skill values appears to be reasonable. Musicians use fewer quantitative versus interactive skills than managers do, and managers use fewer of these relative skills than scientists do. Table 5 provides summaries for the average skill levels of highly-educated natives, immigrants, and various foreign-born groups from 2003-08 (averages exhibit no trends over this short time horizon). Immigrants with graduate degrees choose occupations with quantitative versus interactive skills 4 percentiles above the median occupation. Highly-educated natives choose jobs 7.6 percentiles below the median. We interpret the clear tendency for highly-educated natives to select occupations requiring communication skills at higher rates than immigrants choose those occupations, and the inclination for immigrants to choose jobs requiring quantitative skills more often than natives do, as evidence for imperfect substitution and comparative\nadvantage. An analysis of skill specialization and skill response remains appropriate."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Analysis 4.1 Skill Response", "text": "Equation (1) presents our main empirical specification. If the lagged share of immigrants in an occupation is systematically related to some occupationspecific technological change that also affects the relative demand of quantitative versus interactive skills in the occupation, the estimates of coefficient \u03b2 can be inconsistent. To help control for this, we include two occupational growth variables which may proxy for generic occupationspecific productivity changes. The first accounts for demand trends that an individual would have been able to observe before considering a new occupation. It measures the growth, since 1990, of a native worker's currently-chosen occupation (occ) to year t \u2212 1. The second attempts to control for factors that might encourage a native to leave his/her occupation. It measures the growth, also since 1990, of a native's prior occupation (occly) to year t \u2212 1.\nResults for the baseline specification are in One possible objection is that omitted variables might still be correlated with both the immigrant share of an occupation and trends in occupational employment. Although the short panel and the rich set of fixed effects and covariates should mitigate this problem, further information can be gleaned by including foreign-born workers in the model. The regressions in Table 7 introduce foreign-born workers with graduate degrees, an indicator variable for native workers, and a term interacting the native worker dummy with the change in the foreign-born share of workers. In each cell of the table, the first value represents the coefficient on the foreign-born share for all highly-educated workers. The second value (in bold) represents the differential effect experienced by natives. (i.e., immigrants experience the first effect, while natives experience the sum of the two effects).\nThe general effect is negative in all 35 specifications and significant in all but four. Thus, all highly-educated workers with graduate degrees respond to a high presence of foreign labor by seeking occupations with less quantitative versus interactive content. More interesting, however, is that there is strong evidence that this effect is larger among native-born workers.\nThe coefficient on the interaction term is negative in 26 of the specifications, significant in 14, and never positive and significant. Similar to the results in Table 6 , this differential effect is least likely to be significantly negative when analytical skills are measured by the importance of Analysis of Data and Information, Deductive Reasoning, or Inductive Reasoning. Altogether, the results of Table 7 are consistent with the interpretation that native workers are more likely to shift occupations according to their comparative advantages (and away from quantitative skills) in response to a large inflow of educated foreign-born workers in the occupation. However, we acknowledge the possibility that lingering correlation with omitted variable could bias the results, so this causal interpretation necessitates some caution.\nThe analysis has so far treated immigrants as a homogenous group. The summary statistics in Conclusions regarding wage implications of the skill reallocation would require a more formal theory that not only accounts for skill complementarity and imperfect substitution, but also for possible scale effects as argued by endogenous growth theory. We choose not to provide this analysis, but instead offer a brief comment. Peri and Sparber (2009) argued that less-educated natives mitigate wage losses from immigration through two channels. First, immigration encourages further skill specialization, which reduces direct competition with immigrants. We have now demonstrated that this same channel may be at work among highly-educated workers as well. Second, low education natives specialize in skills that offer a higher rate of return than that paid to skills used by low education immigrants. Thus, low education natives earn a secondary benefit from immigration-induced specialization. This channel does not exist within the market for highly-educated workers, however, as there is no systematic relationship between the average highly-educated worker's wage and his or her quantitative versus interactive relative skill use across occupations. If highly-educated natives protect their wages, they do so through increasing skill specialization."}, {"section_title": "Employment", "text": "The skill response regressions in Section 4.1 only include native workers who were employed both in the year prior to and the year of the CPS survey. While those regressions imply that workers who remain employed in each year respond to immigration by changing the skill content of their occupations, they say nothing about those who have lost their jobs or have left the labor force. If highly-educated foreign-born workers increase the probability of natives leaving employment, one needs to account for this effect too when evaluating labor market impacts of highly-educated immigration. The regressions in Table 9 Columns 3 and 6 add dummies for the industry of most recent employment.\nThe estimates in the first row of Table 9 provide weak evidence that highly highly-educated immigrants could push similarly-educated natives out of employment. According to column 2, a ten percentage-point rise in the immigrant share is related to a 0.27 percentage-point increase in the probability that a native worker is currently unemployed. This effect disappears, however, when further controls are added. Moreover, the foreign-born share never significantly determines whether a highly-educated worker becomes not-employed (unemployed or left the labor force). We believe that rather than causing highly-educated native employees to lose their jobs, it is more likely that immigration instead encourages those employees to respond by choosing new jobs that usually contain less quantitative and more interactive skill content."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Native and foreign-born workers with graduate degrees work in occupations requiring distinctively different tasks, suggesting the two groups are imperfectly substitutable. Natives specialize in occupations demanding interactive or communication skills, while highly-educated immigrants disproportionately work in occupations requiring quantitative and analytical skills.\nIncreases in the foreign-born share of highly-educated employment are associated with a decrease in the quantitative versus interactive content of occupations chosen by similarly-educated natives. That is, natives respond to immigration by changing occupations to those with less quantitative and more interactive content than their previous occupations required.\nThe wage consequences of immigration were not examined in this paper, but they are likely to depend upon the degree of task reallocation experienced by native workers. If the evidence from the labor market for less-educated workers is an indication, the occupational skill response among highly-educated natives is likely to mitigate their potential wage loss from highly-educated immigration. "}, {"section_title": "A Appendix", "text": "One concern with our general methodological framework is whether the measurement of our independent variable (the change in foreign-born share, \u2206F B i,t,occly ) from year t to 1990 allows for too long of a time lag. Occupational shocks that occurred early in the period have the potential for generating a spurious correlation between the change in immigration and a native worker's occupational response in later periods. The regression in Table A1 explores this issue by instead measuring \u2206F B i,t,occly as the change in foreign-born share between year t and 2000.\nThis alternative produces the correct signs but weaker magnitudes: 33 of the 35 coefficients are negative, but only six are significant. When using average quantitative and interactive measures (results not in the table), we get a coefficient estimate of -0.43 that is significant at the 10% level.\nResults based upon differences using the longer time horizon should be interpreted with some caution as spurious effects could emerge, but we believe that the weaker coefficient estimates arise because the shortened period reduces identifying variation. That is, the time lag is not large enough for effects to have occurred. Sample: Regressions include highly-educated natives who were employed in the year prior to the CPS survey.
