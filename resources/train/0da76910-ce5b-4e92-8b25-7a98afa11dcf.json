Research over the past 10 years has shown that COPD is more than just a lung disorder; it affects other end-organs including the cardiovascular and the musculoskeletal systems, making it a multi-component, multi-system disease. COPD increases the risk for ischemic heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, cachexia, and muscle weakness by two to threefold, independent of other factors such as smoking and age. The mechanisms by which COPD affects these end-organs, however, are unclear.

In most patients, the disease process affects the airways (leading to airway remodeling) and parenchyma (leading to emphysema and poor gas exchange). The predominant symptoms of COPD are chronic (productive) cough and exertional dyspnea. However, a substantial proportion of COPD patients have extra-pulmonary symptoms and signs. For instance, in advanced COPD, weight loss and cachexia are common ( Figure 1 ). Other common manifestations include skeletal muscle weakness, osteoporosis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer [Sin et al. 2006a ]. Interestingly, the severity of the underlying COPD modifies the risks of these extra-pulmonary manifestations. For example, in mild to moderate COPD, cardiovascular co-morbidities and cancer predominate; whereas in more advanced disease, osteoporosis, cachexia, and peripheral muscle weakness become the leading extra-pulmonary complications of COPD [Broekhuizen et al. 2006; Sin and Man, 2006b; Yende et al. 2006] . The presence of these extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD increases morbidity and mortality of COPD patients (Sin et al. 2006a) . In this paper, the salient systemic co-morbidites of COPD as well as the proposed pathophysi-J\u00e1n Tk\u00e1\u010d ologies linking these manifestations with COPD will be reviewed."}, {"section_title": "Cardiovascular disorders", "text": "In patients with mild to moderate COPD (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV 1 , >60% of predicted), cardiovascular events are the leading cause of hospitalization and the second leading cause of mortality [Anthonisen et al. 1994 ]. Among patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages 0 to 2 disease (i.e. FEV 1 >50% of predicted), cardiovascular disorders account for approximately 50% of all hospitalizations and nearly a third of all deaths [Anthonisen et al. 1994] . In more advanced disease, cardiovascular events account for 20-25% of all deaths in COPD [Sin et al. 2006a] .\nAt a population level, the link between COPD and cardiovascular disorders can be evaluated by determining the association between FEV 1 and cardiovascular events in the general population using data from population-based studies. One such study is the Honolulu Heart Program, which prospectively followed \u223c6,000 healthy, middleaged men (about half of whom were current smokers) for \u223c17 years and found that compared with subjects with the best lung function (i.e. in the highest quintile of FEV 1 ), individuals with the lowest lung function (i.e. in the lowest FEV 1 Figure 1 . The Systemic Manifestations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Patients with COPD are at increased risk of developing cariovascular disease (CVD), cancer, osteoporosis, peripheral muscle weakness, cognitive decline, anemia, cachexia and many other conditions. These systemic conditions contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. However, the mechanistic pathways linking COPD to these disorders have not been well worked out. quintile) had two times the risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk, RR, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.46 to 2.54) [Beaty et al. 1985] . In another study, Speizer and colleagues reported a RR of 2.74 (95% CI, 1.93 to 3.90) for women and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.90) for men who were in the lowest FEV 1 quartile compared to those in the highest quartile [Speizer et al. 1989] . Similarly, Schunemann and colleagues reported a RR of 1.96 (95% CI, 0.99 to 3.88) for women and 2.11 (95% CI, 1.20 to 3.71) for men, who were in the lowest FEV 1 quintile compared to the highest quintile [Schunemann et al. 2000 ] and Hole and colleagues reported a RR of 1.88 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.47) for women and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.92) for men, who were in the lowest compared with the highest FEV 1 quintile [Hole et al. 1996 ]. Sin and colleagues examined data from The First National Health And Nutritional, Examination Survey and showed that subjects in the lowest quintile of FEV 1 had over three times the risk of cardiovascular mortality compared to those with the best lung function (RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.54 to 7.34), independent of smoking status [Sin et al. 2005 ]. The risk was even higher when only deaths from ischemic heart disease were considered (RR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.26 to 14.13). A systematic review of the literature that included more than 80,000 subjects showed that reduced FEV 1 nearly doubles the risk for cardiovascular mortality independent of confounding factors such as age, sex, and cigarette smoking (pooled RR, 1.75; 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.01) [Sin et al. 2005] .\nThe concept of population-attributable risk is helpful in understanding the public health impact of COPD on ischemic heart disease. The population-attributable risk is defined as the percentage of a given illness that could be prevented if the risk factor causing the illness could be completely abolished [Greenland, 2001] . Hole and colleagues estimated that the population attributable risk of ischemic cardiac deaths from reduced FEV 1 was 26% (95% CI, 19 to 34%) in men and 24% (14 to 34%) in women, independent of the effects of cigarette smoking [Hole et al. 1996] . In other words, their model suggested that approximately 25% of all Review ischemic cardiac deaths could have been prevented if everyone in the cohort had normal lung function. Interestingly, they also found that the population attributable imposed by hypercholesterolemia, a well established risk factor for ischemic heart disease, was only 21% in men and 25% in women [Sin et al. 2005] . These data suggest that reduced lung function imposes a similar risk as hypercholesterolemia does for ischemic cardiac deaths. Taken together, all of these large population-based studies indicate that COPD and related conditions that reduce lung function are important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the community, independent of established risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, total cholesterol and hypertension.\nOne of the hallmarks of COPD is rapid decline in FEV 1 over time. This too is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Engstrom and colleagues showed that the cardiovascular event rate among smokers who had the fastest decline in FEV 1 (i.e. the highest third with regard to the decline in FEV 1 ) were 2.5 times higher than smokers who were in the lowest third of FEV 1 decline [Engstrom et al. 2000 ]. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, individuals who experienced the most rapid decline in FEV 1 over a 16-year follow-up were three to five times more likely to experience cardiac death compared with those who had the slowest decline in FEV 1 [Tockman et al. 1995] . Even among lifetime nonsmokers, accelerated decline in FEV 1 was associated with a 5 to 10-fold increase in the risk for cardiac deaths, which suggests that the relationship between decline in FEV 1 and cardiovascular events occurs independently of the effects of smoking. Whether cigarette smoking modifies the relationship between accelerated decline in FEV 1 and cardiovascular outcomes, however, is unclear.\nAlthough in the general adult population the most common cause of reduced FEV 1 is obstructive airways disease, other disorders can also decrease FEV 1 . Reduced FEV 1 :forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, on the other hand, is a more specific indicator of airways disease. Sin and Man (2003a) showed using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that individuals with severe airflow obstruction (defined as FEV 1 <50% of predicted and FEV 1 /FVC ratio 70%) were two times more likely to have electrocardiographic evidence of probable or possible myocardial infarction compared with those without airflow obstruction. In addition to being a risk factor for ischemic heart disease, reduced FEV 1 :FVC ratio may act as an effect modifier. In the Malmo \"Men Born in 1914\" Study, Engstrom and coworkers showed that reduced FEV 1 :FVC ratio by itself was only a modest independent predictor of coronary events (RR, 1.30). Having arrhythmias on a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recording device in the absence of COPD was not associated with coronary events (RR, 1.01). However, when subjects had both COPD and arrhythmias at baseline, the risk of coronary events increased by over two fold compared with subjects without COPD and without any ectopic rhythm (RR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.36 to 4.32) [Engstrom et al. 2001] . These data suggest that airflow obstruction impacts synergistically on the diseased heart to make it more vulnerable to acute coronary events.\nThe most common symptom of COPD is cough with sputum production [Pauwels and Rabe, 2004] . Jousilahti and colleagues (1996 Jousilahti and colleagues ( ) studied 9,342 men and 10,102 women, born between 1913 Jousilahti and colleagues ( and 1947 in Finland and found that a positive response to the question, \"do you cough on most days and nights as much as 3 months each year?\" was associated with a \u223c50% increase in the risk for coronary deaths, adjusted for age, study year, serum total cholesterol, and amount of smoking (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.90 in men and 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92 to 2.16 in women). Interestingly, chronic bronchitic symptoms were also associated with raised plasma fibrinogen levels both in men (3.70 g/L vs 3.35 g/L in those with and without chronic bronchitis; p = 0.001) and in women (3.64 g/L vs 3.44 g/L in those and with and without chronic bronchitis; p = 0.001) [Jousilahti et al. 1999] , which is a known likely causative risk factor for cardiovascular events [Danesh et al. 2005] .\nFindings from established COPD cohorts have largely confirmed the results from the populationbased studies. For example, The Lung Health Study investigators [Anthonisen et al. 1994] studied 5,887 smokers, aged 35 to 60 years, with mild to moderate COPD. Study participants were randomized to three arms: usual care plus placebo; special intervention for smoking cessation plus ipratropium; and special intervention for smoking cessation plus placebo. During the initial 5 years of follow-up, 2.5% of the original cohort died and 13% were hospitalized at least once. Cardiovascular events accounted for 42% of the first hospitalizations and 48% of the second hospitalization. The rate of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection was only a third of that for cardiovascular events. For every 10% decrease in FEV 1 , allcause mortality increased by 14%, cardiovascular mortality increased by 28%, and nonfatal coronary event increased by almost 20%, after adjustments for relevant confounders such age, sex, smoking status, and treatment assignment [Anthonisen et al. 1994 ].\nIn more-severe cases of COPD, respiratory failure becomes a much more important cause of mortality. However, cardiovascular events still account for a large percentage of deaths even in severe COPD. TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) clinical trial followed patients with moderate to severe COPD (FEV 1 60% or less) for 3 years and treated patients with salmeterol, fluticasone, salmeterol/fluticasone combination or placebo. There were 784 deaths during this period and each of the deaths was carefully adjudicated by an independent mortality review board, which was blinded to the treatment assignment. It found that 26% of all deaths were directly attributable to cardiovascular events [McGarvey et al. 2007 ]. Although the effects of treatment on this outcome are uncertain because the four treatment groups were combined for this analysis, these data, nevertheless, suggest that cardiovascular events account for a large proportion of mortality in COPD patients, even in moderate to severe disease.\nFindings from large administrative databases have also shown similar findings. Curkendall and colleagues, for example, showed that COPD patients were 1.76 times more likely to have arrhythmia (95% CI, 1.64 to 1.89), 1.61 times more likely to have angina (95% CI, 1.47 to 1.76), 1.61 times more likely to develop acute myocardial infarction (95% CI, 1.43 to 1.81), and 3.84 times more likely to develop congestive heart failure (95% CI, 3.56 to 4.14). The risk ratio for cardiovascular mortality in the COPD patients was 2.07 (95% CI, 1.82 to 2.36) [Curkendall et al. 2006 ]. In a separate study, Huiart and colleagues showed that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates were higher in the COPD cohort than in the general population (standardized rate ratios of 1.9 and 2.0, respectively). Among cardiovascular disorders, heart failure represented the most frequent cause of hospitalization (58.8 per 1,000 person-year) and more COPD patients died from ischemic heart disease (19.6 per 1,000 person-year) than COPD itself (15.5 per 1,000 person-year) [Huiart et al. 2005] . Over a mean follow-up of 2.5 to 3 years, Sidney and colleagues demonstrated that the risk of hospitalization was higher in COPD patients than in control subjects for all cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality. The RR for cardiovascular hospitalizations was 2.09 (95% CI, 1.99 to 2.20). Younger patients (i.e. age <65 years) and female patients had higher risks than older or male patients [Sidney et al. 2005] . Reduced lung function also increases risk of atrial fibrillation. In one study, the risk of atrial fibrillation related hospitalization was 1.3 times higher in subjects who had an FEV 1 of 60 to 80% of predicted and 1.8-times higher in subjects with FEV 1 <60% of predicted compared with those whose FEV 1 was 80% of predicted [Buch et al. 2003 ].\nIn summary, reduced FEV 1 (as well as reduced FEV 1 to FVC ratio), COPD symptoms and a clinical diagnosis COPD are all independent risk factors for cardiovascular events. Even relatively small reductions in lung function increases the risk for ventricular arrhythmias, coronary events, and cardiovascular mortality by twofold, independent of the effects of smoking. In patients with mild to moderate COPD, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of hospitalization, accounting for 40 to 50% of all hospital admissions. They are the second leading cause of mortality, only trailing lung cancer, and account for 25% of all deaths. In general, a 10% decrease in FEV 1 among COPD patients increases the cardiovascular event rate by \u223c30% [Anthonisen et al. 1994 ].\nNot surprisingly, the presence of one or more of the cardiovascular co-morbidities significantly increases the risk of future risk of morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. Antonelli-Incalzi and colleagues showed that the 5-year mortality of severe COPD patients was significantly associated with only five risk factors and two of these factors related directly to the heart: ECG signs of right ventricular hypertrophy (HR, Review CI, 1.05 to 3.02) [Antonelli-Incalzi et al. 1997 ]. Even during COPD exacerbations, cardiovascular events are salient. For example, Baillard and colleagues showed that having elevated levels of cardiac troponin I enzyme, a specific biomarker of myocardial damage, was associated with a sixfold increase in the risk for hospital mortality during acute COPD exacerbations (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 6.52; 95% CI,1.23 to 34.47) [Baillard et al. 2003 ]. Scarduelli and colleagues showed that during severe COPD exacerbations requiring intensive care support, nearly 40% of the patients developed cardiovascular complications including congestive heart failure (in 18%), arrhythmias (in 14%), shock (in 5%), and hypotension (in 4%). Importantly, the overall mortality was 5% in patients without and 16% in those with cardiovascular complications during these COPD exacerbation episodes (p = 0.0044) [Scarduelli et al. 2004 ].\nThe increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with COPD extends beyond the heart. Hozawa and colleagues showed that reduced lung function significantly increased the risk for ischemic strokes but the association was weaker than that observed for reduced lung function and ischemic heart disease. This inverse relationship between lung function and ischemic stroke was observed in subjects who had never smoked indicating that this relationship is not confounded by smoking [Hozawa et al. 2006 ]. Trusen et al. showed similar findings. They observed an inverse association between FEV 1 and the risk for a firsttime stroke. For each 10% decrease in FEV 1 (as a percentage of predicted), the RR increased by 5% (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.09, p = 0.03). This represented a 30% higher risk of stroke in the group of people with the lowest lung function compared with the group with the highest lung function [Truelsen et al. 2001] ."}, {"section_title": "A model linking COPD and cardiovascular events", "text": "Why COPD would predispose to cardiovascular events is largely a mystery. COPD and ischemic heart disease have shared risk factors including advancing age, cigarette smoking, and environmental air pollution. However, even among relatively young nonsmokers, COPD is an independent risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease suggesting other mechanisms. Over the past 5 years, several plausible explanations have been provided (Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Systemic Inflammation", "text": "Oxidative stress Patients with COPD (especially in moderate to severe disease) demonstrate systemic inflammation, increased oxidative stress, neurohumoral disturbances, and increased thrombotic tendency. All of these factors are mechanistically linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the general community.\nThe first relates to inflammation. It is postulated that in COPD, persistent pulmonary inflammation promotes the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines into the circulation. These mediators then stimulate various endorgans including the liver, adipose tissues, and the bone marrow to release excessive amounts of acute-phase proteins, inflammatory cells, and secondary cytokines into the general circulation, resulting in a state of persistent low-grade systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammation in turn adversely impacts the blood vessels, contributing to plaque formation and, in certain cases, to plaque instability and rupture [Sin et al. 2005] . Consistent with this theory, Gan et al. found that COPD patients had significantly increased levels of circulating C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific but a robust biomarker of systemic inflammation, compared with those without COPD, independent of confounding factors such as smoking [Gan et al. 2004 ]. The standardized mean difference in the CRP level between COPD and control subjects was 0.53 units (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.72) or 1.86 mg/L (95% CI, 0.75 to 2.97 mg/L). Other biomarkers of systemic inflammation are also elevated in COPD. The standardized mean difference in the plasma fibrinogen, for example, was 0.47 units (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.65) or 0.37 g/L (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.56 g/L) in Gan's analysis. There are strong epidemiologic data linking systemic inflammation to atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and coronary deaths [Danesh et al. 2005] . During exacerbations, systemic inflammation increases even further [Hurst et al. 2006 ].\nHemostasis and thrombotic pathways may also play relevant roles in COPD and ischemic heart disease [Wu and Thiagarajan, 1996] . One of the initial steps in thrombosis is platelet adhesion to collagen. To facilitate adhesion, circulating platelets must first interact with von Willebrand factor (vWF), which slows them down. This allows the platelets to bind to collagen via the \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 integrin molecule. Increased expression of vWF and/or \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 integrin might therefore increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. Consistent with this notion, an 807 C to T single nucleotide polymorphism close to the gene coding for the \u03b1 2 subunit of the \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 integrin molecule, which increases \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 integrin density on platelet membranes, has been associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality in female smokers [Roest et al. 2000] .\nSimilarly, raised vWF has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease in a large population-based study [Wiman et al. 2000 ]. After platelets adhere to cell surface, they become activated and start releasing adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane A2, which in turn recruits additional platelets to the site. The activated platelets also undergo a conformational change in the membranous glycoprotein IIb-IIIa structure, which becomes a substrate for fibrinogen binding [Wu and Thiagarajan, 1996] . This in turn promotes binding of coagulation factors such as factor Va and VIIIa to the platelet surface. Factor VIIIa becomes the substrate for the synthesis of a VIIIa-IXa-X-Ca 2+ complex, which catalyzes factor X to Xa. Factor Xa is an important co-factor in the generation of thrombin from pro-thrombin. Thrombin has pleiotropic pro-thrombotic and anti-thrombotic activities. The pro-thrombotic effects of thrombin stimulate the synthesis of a fibrin clot. This process is counter-balanced by fibrinolytic molecules such as tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).\nIncreases in the circulating levels of thrombotic factors may be expected to elevate the risk for cardiovascular disease. Indeed, this appears to be the case. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, for instance, which studied over 5,800 men and women, 65 years of age and older, plasma fibrinogen as well as circulating factor VII and VIII levels were associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease [Tracy et al. 1999] . The relationship was particularly notable in men. Elevated circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which neutralizes the effect of TPA, are also associated with cardiovascular disease [Lyon and Hsueh, 2003 ].\nCOPD patients have increased circulating levels of thrombin, tissue plasminogen activatorplasminogen activator inhibitor (tPA-PAI) complex, and \u03b2-thromboglobulin, a marker of platelet activation [Ashitani et al. 2002 ]. In the FINMONICA study (The Finnish part of the WHO MONICA study), individuals with symptoms of chronic bronchitis had significantly elevated plasma fibrinogen levels compared with individuals without chronic bronchitic symptoms even among nonsmokers (in men 3.70 g/L vs 3.35 g/L; p < 0.001; in women 3.64 g/L vs 3.44 g/L; p < 0.001) [Jousilahti et al. 1999] .\nOverall in men, the mean fibrinogen levels were 11% higher in symptomatic subjects, whereas in Review women, they were 6% higher. In another study, Fowkes and colleagues showed that COPD was a significant risk factor for aortic aneurysm. Most of the excess risk associated with COPD could be nullified when the analytic model accounted for haemostatic markers such as D-dimer [Fowkes et al. 2006 ]. During exacerbations, there is a further increase in plasma fibrinogen levels, which may contribute to abnormal hemostasis and thrombosis in such patients [Wedzicha et al. 2000 ]. Further work is needed to determine the contributions of this pathway to the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases observed in COPD."}, {"section_title": "Neurohumoral disturbances", "text": "Excess sympathetic nervous activity is significantly related to cardiovascular disease [Mancia et al. 1999 ]. In advanced COPD, patients demonstrate excess adrenergic activity. Using microneurography of the peroneal nerve, Heindl and colleagues showed that patients with respiratory failure have a marked increase in peripheral sympathetic discharge compared to controls [Mancia et al. 1999] . The intensity of the sympathetic nervous activity was inversely related to the patients' oxyhemoglobin saturation. Supplemental oxygen attenuated (but did not normalize) the sympathetic nervous activity. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an analog of guanetidine, has similar metabolism to norepinephrine in systemic nervous tissues [Wieland et al. 1980] . MIBG has been used to image the heart for assessment of cardiac sympathetic activity. Sakamaki and colleagues showed that COPD patients had reduced cardiac accumulation of MIBG and a higher washout rate from the heart than control subjects, indicating excess activity of the sympathetic nervous system with increased norepinephrine turnover [Sakamaki et al. 1999] . Interestingly, the MIBG accumulation rate significantly correlated with the intensity of dyspnea of these patients (p < 0.05). Consistent with the MIBG data, COPD patients had higher plasma norepinephrine levels than did the control subjects (449 vs 69 pg/mL; p < 0.01)."}, {"section_title": "Oxidative stress", "text": "Oxidative stress induces endothelial dysfunction [Elahi and Matata, 2006 ]. Oxygen-derived free radicals such as superoxide anions impair endothelial vasomotor function [Cai and Harrison, 2000] . Oxidative stress can impair vasodilation, endothelial cell growth, and promote plaque build-up and rupture [Sugiyama et al. 2004] . Anti-oxidants, on the other hand, improve endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease [Azen et al. 1996 ]. Leukocytes, when activated, can generate a large amount of oxidative stress through the induction of enzymes such as NADPH oxidase, superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide synthase, and myeloperoxidase. When the oxidant load exceeds the antioxidant capacity of the organ, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA materials in the local milieu may be modified through oxidation, resulting in tissue injury. Oxidants can also induce inflammation. Inflammation, in turn, can generate more oxidant species, creating a positive feedback loop [Azen et al. 1996] .\nCOPD patients experience more oxidative stress than control subjects. The load is further increased in patients who continue to smoke and in patients who experience frequent exacerbations [Rahman et al. 1996] . The magnitude of the oxidative stress in these patients appears to be negatively correlated with FEV 1 (as percent predicted) indicating a dose-response relationship [Nadeem et al. 2005] . Local oxidative stress in the peripheral muscles of COPD patients is associated with reduced muscle strength [Couillard et al. 2003 ]. The etiology of the oxidative burden in COPD is probably multifactorial. Hypoxemia, poor nutrition, inflammation, infection, and smoking have all been implicated [Koechlin et al. 2005] . As COPD patients have perturbed oxidant/anti-oxidant balance in favor of oxidative stress, it is plausible that the excess oxidant load could contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events."}, {"section_title": "Cachexia and nutritional abnormalities", "text": "Cachexia is defined as excessive weight loss in the setting of ongoing disease, associated with disproportionate muscle wasting [Owen, 2005] . Weight loss related to starvation, on the other hand, is associated with a disproportionate reduction in fat mass. Cachexia and weight loss are frequently observed in patients with COPD and are associated with poor functional capacity, reduced health status, and increased mortality. The prevalence of weight loss in COPD increases with COPD disease progression. In mild to moderate COPD, only 10 to 15% of patients have significant weight loss. In contrast, in severe COPD, nearly 50% of patients have significant weight loss [Creutzberg et al. 1998 ]. Although cachexia of COPD affects all body compartments, skeletal muscle mass appears to be especially vulnerable. Fat mass, on the hand, is largely spared until the very last stages of the disease. Thus, most patients with moderate to severe COPD have significantly reduced fat-free mass. This change in body composition can also occur in the early stages of the disease and even in the absence of any meaningful reduction in the total body weight [Agusti, 2005] . Accordingly, while total body weight is a useful surrogate measure to monitor patients for COPD-related cachexia, in certain circumstances, it can be misleading; measurement of fat-free mass may be a more sensitive marker of disease activity and outcomes of COPD patients.\nCOPD-related cachexia is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. In a recent study, Hallin and colleagues found that in a group of patients who were hospitalized due to an exacerbation of COPD, a history of weight loss during a 12 month follow-up period and the initial weight of the patients were both independently associated with a higher risk of experiencing a new exacerbation [Hallin et al. 2006 ]. In a study by Schols and colleagues, mortality risk increased significantly once the body mass index (BMI) of patients reached 25 kg/m 2 or less [Hallin et al. 2006 ]. In those with mild to moderate COPD (FEV 1 50% of predicted), the relationship between BMI and mortality was U-shaped with the extremes of BMI having the worst prognosis, and BMI between 20 to 25 kg/m 2 having the best prognosis. In those with severe COPD (FEV 1 <50% of predicted), the relationship between BMI and mortality appears to be (inversely) linear; the prognosis progressively worsens with decreasing BMI [Landbo et al. 1999 ]. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, for instance, COPD mortality was 2.2-fold higher in COPD patients with FEV 1 <50% of predicted, who had a BMI <20 kg/m 2 compared with those whose BMI was between 20 and 25 kg/m 2 and over seven-fold higher compared with those whose BMI was 30 kg/m 2 or greater [Landbo et al. 1999] ."}, {"section_title": "Mechanism of cachexia", "text": "The mechanisms responsible for cachexia in COPD are not well understood. In health, protein degradation and replacement is carefully regulated and controlled. Any significant perturbations in this balance can result in cachexia and wasting. Nutritional status and body hormones play significant roles in maintaining this homeostasis. For instance, growth factors such as human growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, and anabolic steroids promote protein synthesis, whereas glucocorticoids and catecholamines favor catabolism [Wing and Goldberg, 1993] . Low testosterone levels have also been associated with COPD cachexia [Laghi, 2005] as testosterone promotes myoblastic activity and inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1.\nMore recently, cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cachexia. When patients become clinically ill from an inflammatory or infectious insult, there is a rapid rise in the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3 ) and TNF-\u03b1. These cytokines especially TNF-\u03b1, and INF-\u03b3 can act synergistically to inhibit messenger RNA expression for myosin heavy chain, leading to decreased muscle protein synthesis. These cytokines may also directly or indirectly stimulate proteolysis of myosin heavy chains [Acharyya et al. 2004; Guttridge et al. 2000 ]. In COPD, the hormonal balance is shifted towards catabolism, especially in the severe to very severe stages of the disease. Patients have reduced testosterone levels, and increased proinflammatory cytokine expression both locally in the muscles as well as systemically, and increased catecholamine synthesis [Schols et al. 1998 ] presumably related to the underlying inflammatory and oxidative processes in the airways. Moreover, COPD patients frequently take inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids, which further contribute to a catabolic state."}, {"section_title": "Skeletal muscle dysfunction and reduced exercise tolerance", "text": "With increasing severity of disease, COPD patients complain of reduced exercise capacity and weakness of muscles. Objectively, they display skeletal muscle dysfunction especially in the thighs and upper arms. The skeletal muscle dysfunction of COPD is predominantly driven by a loss in skeletal muscle mass [Schols, 2000] . Over time, these patients lose exercise endurance and complain of fatigue and dyspnea with only minimal degree of exertion ]. These symptoms curtail patients' ability to exercise and compromise their cardiac fitness, which further limits their exercise tolerance, creating a vicious downward spiral that can eventually lead to generalized debility and immobility [Montes de Oca et al. 1996] . Not surprisingly, skeletal muscle dysfunction contributes to reduced health status of COPD patients and substantially increases the risk of mortality, independent of traditional markers of COPD mortality such as baseline lung function, age, and cigarette smoking [Marquis et al. 2002] . Encouragingly, early interventions with exercise programs may restore some of the lost health status related to muscle dysfunction and increase patients' exercise tolerance and stamina [Sin et al. 2003b ]."}, {"section_title": "Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mechanism of skeletal muscle weakness", "text": "Despite the importance of skeletal muscle performance in COPD morbidity and mortality, the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the muscle failure remain largely a mystery. With advancing disease, skeletal muscle mass decreases in COPD [Mador and Bozkanat, 2001] . Biopsy analyses from quadriceps and elsewhere reveal a significant reduction in type I fibers and a relative increase in type II fibers as compared with normal individuals, which probably contributes to increased fatigability and reduced muscle endurance observed in COPD patients [Mador and Bozkanat, 2001] . Moreover, in severe COPD, the peripheral muscles demonstrate a marked decrease in muscle capillarization and reduction in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase, indicating reduced oxidative energy metabolism [Gosker et al. 2002] . Microscopically, these skeletal muscles show accelerated apoptosis, increased oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and inflammatory changes [Agusti et al. 2002] , raising the possibility that local inflammatory and oxidative milieu may also play a role in the physiologic changes in COPD skeletal muscles.\nInterestingly, however, these changes are generally not observed in patients with mild to moderate disease (FEV 1 greater than 50% of predicted) except in the diaphragm muscles, which demonstrates adaptation (i.e. increased oxidative capacity and higher proportion of Type 1 fibers) even in mild to moderate disease [Douctt et al. 2000 ]. The peripheral muscle dysfunction related to COPD may also be due to deconditioning and disuse. With COPD progression, patients become more breathless and adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. From disuse, muscles can become progressively weaker, more atrophic, and less able to endure oxidative and physical stress [Serres et al. 1998 ]. These adverse changes in the muscles become exaggerated with hormonal changes (discussed in the previous section), use of corticosteroids, and with poor nutrition [Casaburi, 2000] . On the positive side, even low-intensity pulmonary rehabilitation for a relatively short period of time can recondition the muscles and partially restore their strength [Clark et al. 2000 ]. It is controversial whether regular exercise can modulate local or systemic inflammation in COPD [Rabinovich et al. 2003; Vogiatzis et al. 2007 ].\nRegardless of the mechanism, regular exercise appears to have a salutary effect in reducing morbidity and mortality of COPD [Garcia-Aymerich et al. 2006 ]."}, {"section_title": "Osteoporosis and fractures", "text": "Reduced bone mass is a common finding in COPD patients. The risk of osteopenia, defined as bone mineral density values less than 1.0 standard deviation, SD, (T scores of \u22121.0) below the mean bone mineral density values of sex-matched Caucasian participants 20-29 years of age, increases by 30% in moderate (FEV 1 50 to 80% of predicted), and 70% in severe COPD (FEV 1 less than 50% of predicted) (Sin et al. 2003c ). The risk of osteoporosis (T scores of \u22122.5 or below), increases by 2.1-fold with moderate COPD and by 2.4-fold with severe COPD (100). In subjects with severe COPD, the prevalence of osteopenia is 60% and osteoporosis is 10% in men, whereas in women, the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis is 76% and 33%, respectively [Sin et al. 2003c ]. Similarly, in a cross-sectional study of 62 patients, J\u00f8rgensen and coworkers (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2007) found that 68% of study participants had osteoporosis or osteopenia. Not surprisingly, given these data, patients with COPD have increased risk of osteoporotic fractures (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.52 to 1.71). The risk is amplified in patients who are thin (BMI <20 kg/m 2 ; RR, 2.54) and in those who experience exacerbations (RR, 2.02). COPD patients are particularly vulnerable to vertebral fractures [de Vries et al. 2005 ]. Their risk is increased four to eight fold above those without COPD. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids may further increase the risk by 10 to 50%, though this relationship is still quite contentious [Lee and Weiss, 2004] ."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms of osteoporosis", "text": "Because proinflammatory cytokines can significantly alter bone metabolism, excessive osteoporosis in relation to age could be considered a systemic effect of COPD [Agusti, 2005] .The etiology of bone loss in COPD is complex but probably includes smoking, vitamin D deficiency, low BMI, hypogonadism, sedentary lifestyle, and use of corticosteroids [Biskobing, 2002] .\nOther systemic manifestations of COPD Patients with COPD are at increased risk of depression [Coultas et al. 2007 ], cognitive dysfunction, especially in those with hypoxemia [Antonelli-Incalzi et al. 2003 ] and chronic anemia [Cote et al. 2007 ] All of these factors are associated with poor outcomes in COPD."}, {"section_title": "The impact of systemic consequences of COPD on mortality", "text": "In the past, COPD mortality research has focused on measurements of lung function, especially FEV 1 . Although FEV 1 correlates with survival in COPD, the relationship is rather weak probably because FEV 1 does not fully capture the extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD that have been discussed in the previous sections. Prognostic indices that incorporate systemic elements of COPD perform much better than does FEV 1 alone. A recent example is the BODE index. The BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE) index is a multidimensional instrument that is derived from BMI, FEV 1 , modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score and 6-minute walk distance [Celli et al. 2004] . The BODE index is, therefore, an integrated scale that captures respiratory function, cardiovascular fitness, nutritional status, and skeletal muscle performance of COPD patients. A one-point increase in the BODE index is associated with a 34% increase in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.42). Overall, the BODE index is much better than FEV 1 alone in predicting risk of all-cause and respiratory-cause specific mortality."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "COPD can be described as a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs, the progression of which is often characterized by the development of extra-pulmonary diseases. These systemic manifestations such as cardiovascular diseases, skeletal muscle dysfunction and osteoporosis, contribute a great deal to reduced quality of life and increased mortality in COPD patients. Although the mechanisms for the association of COPD with these systemic disorders have not been fully worked out, local and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and perturbations in the neurohumoral states are some of the likely candidate pathways by which these extra-pulmonary complications of COPD are effected. Future work will undoubtedly shed more light on the processes and mechanisms for the extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD. In the meantime, when assessing COPD patients, physicians must be mindful of these extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cachexia, muscle weakness, anxiety, and depression. In addition to a careful history and physical examination, appropriate investigations are needed to ascertain these co-morbidities in COPD patients. Once detected, these extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD should be treated aggressively, as they add to the overall morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. In general, smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation can be recommended to patients to modify some of these processes."}]
