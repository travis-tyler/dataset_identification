[3] [4] [5] Similar findings were also reported in studies using occupation, premorbid intelligence, or brain size as a reserve proxy. 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] Once cognitive impairment begins, people with higher reserve seem to have faster cognitive deterioration. [10] [11] [12] It is assumed that by the time dementia is diagnosed, more AD pathology has accumulated in people with higher reserve, and therefore accelerated clinical deterioration occurs. Cognitive reserve may reduce the risk of symptomatic expression of AD or modulate the course of cognitive decline but reserve markers per se supposedly have no biological effect on AD pathology and thus are independent of AD pathologic progression. 13 A recent study from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has shown stage-dependent trajectories of 3 biomarkers of AD pathology: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab 42 , [ 18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) uptake, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal volume 14 ; but how these pathology markers change over time in relation to individual reserve marker status is not known.

After adjusting for age and sex, ICV correlated with MRI hippocampal volume in all diagnostic groups, whereas ANART was associated with hippocampal volume only in AD; otherwise, reserve markers were independent of CSF and imaging biomarkers at baseline. ICV was thus not included in the analysis of MRI hippocampal change. Except for a sex difference in ICV in FDG-PET follow-ups among cognitively normal participants, missing data predictors were not significantly associated with reserve markers.\nCognitive reserve markers including education, occupation, and ANART significantly modified the rates of CSF Ab 42 change in cognitively normal participants (education: P = 0.03; occupation: P = 0.01; ANART: P = 0.002; Table 2 ). People with higher levels of reserve markers had slower rates of CSF Ab 42 decline. CSF Ab 42 trajectories of high, intermediate, and low cognitive reserve marker levels were modeled for participants at age 75 (Figs. 1A-C). Further analyses of the NC group with repeated CSF studies (n = 35) showed that education levels were associated with occupation and ANART.\nAD participants with better ANART scores had slower progression of glucose hypometabolism (P = 0.0003; Table 2 ). This pattern also appeared in the NC group, but was not statistically significant (P = 0.17; Table 3 ). The rates of hippocampal atrophy in MRI were, however, not modified by any of these reserve markers in all 3 diagnostic groups (Table 4 ). Unlike NC and AD groups, there was no effect of cognitive reserve markers on AD biomarker changes in the MCI group.\nThe effects of reserve markers on AD biomarker rates remained unchanged after accounting for APOE 4 and longitudinal missing data. For those whose biomarker rates of change were modified by reserve markers, we further examined their cognitive performance at baseline and there was no apparent difference in Mini-Mental State Examination score, Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale, and auditory verbal learning test across each reserve marker stratum (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 , http://links. lww.com/WAD/A55, http://links.lww.com/WAD/A56)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study showing the protective effect of cognitive reserve markers against AD pathologic progression. We found that higher levels of education, occupation, and premorbid intelligence decelerated the decline of CSF Ab 42 in participants with NC and the effect of premorbid intelligence extended to FDG uptake in patients with AD. The longitudinal effect of cognitive reserve markers on CSF Ab 42 is consistent across different proxies, regardless of whether in continuous or categorical variables, and was not confounded by baseline cognitive function, missing data, or APOE 4. Our findings agree with a recent cross-sectional study, which reported that greater lifetime cognitive engagement was associated with reduced Ab deposition measured by Pittsburg Compound B uptake (PIB). 23 Therefore, cognitive reserve markers may not only modify the effect of AD pathology on cognitive performance but also exert direct biological influence to slow pathologic progression.\nThis protective effect of cognitive reserve markers was mainly found among cognitively normal participants. Ab deposition is considered a pivotal event in the AD *P < 0.05 or the rate of change is significantly modified by reserve markers; wP < 0.05 only appears when reserve marker is stratified into 3 levels but disappears when using continuous variables, for example, years of education. Positive coefficients indicate that the biomarker decline is slower in participants with higher levels of reserve markers. pathologic cascade that precedes cognitive impairment and triggers subsequent changes in tau, glucose hypometabolism, and hippocampal atrophy. 24 Therefore, if reserve markers have any direct influence on AD pathology, the effect may be more likely detected in the dynamics of CSF Ab 42 before any cognitive deficit is manifested. We also observed that ANART modulated the decline of FDG uptake in patients with AD, which seems to be against current reserve hypothesis that people with higher reserve would decline faster once AD becomes symptomatic. Nevertheless, the faster decline in cognitive function may not reflect underlying metabolic decline. Although there was evidence in the inverse relationship between cognitive reserve and parietal flow from an earlier, cross-sectional study, 25 evidence on longitudinal FDG-PET in AD is still lacking. A larger sample of AD with repeated FDG-PET scans may help clarify this difference.\nThe underlying mechanism of how cognitive reserve markers might shape AD pathologic change is intriguing. Transgenic mice studies have shown that exposure to environmental enrichment reduced cerebral Ab deposition, 26 suggesting that AD pathology can be modulated by environmental experience. Furthermore, as Ab release is synaptically regulated, greater synaptic activity increases the level of Ab in brain interstitial fluid and leads to region-specific Ab aggregation. 27, 28 These vulnerable regions overlap with a set of highly interconnected networks, also known as cortical hubs, which include posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal regions. 29 The spatial convergence of cortical amyloid and these metabolically active cortical hubs leads to a unifying framework recently proposed to explain the relationship between lifespan brain activity and AD. 30 On the basis of the framework, these interconnected networks are responsible for information processing and therefore synaptically active, which may in turn provoke regional deposition of Ab. The role of cognitive reserve in this model is proposed to support neural efficiency and flexibility for cognitive function. Thus, individuals with higher cognitive reserve would utilize more efficient neural processes, require less synaptic activation, and have slower cerebral deposition of Ab detected as slower CSF Ab 42 decline.

Our brain size measure was approximated by combining the volume of CSF space, gray and white matter; however, how valid and precise this approach is for defining maximum synapse count in adulthood or the physical basis of reserve is unclear.\nMCI participants were enrolled in ADNI based on clinical criteria, but their underlying pathologic profile is likely to be heterogenous. 32 Despite a larger sample size than NC and AD groups, the effect of reserve markers on AD biomarker changes did not appear in the MCI group, consistent with a higher degree of heterogeneity in MCI than in NC or AD.\nEducation might mediate microstructural changes in hippocampus, 33 but we did not observe any effect of cognitive reserve markers on the rates of MRI hippocampal atrophy. Hippocampal volume is a macrostructural measure and the effect of education or other proxies may be more difficult to detect by volumetric MRI. Most importantly, hippocampal atrophy probably represents a late change in the AD pathologic cascade and cognitive reserve markers may be no longer protective once the pathologic cascade becomes advanced.\nOne of the unique strengths in our study is that we have repeated measures of AD biomarkers to delineate AD pathologic changes over time. Unlike cross-sectional approaches, longitudinal study does not require the assumption that an age effect is uniform across different individuals. For instance, 2 different participants at age 60 and 70 in the same group are treated separately and we do not assume that the pathologic burden of the individual at age 60 will develop into what the 70 years old expresses after 10 years. Second, we have multiple reserve proxies typically used in past studies: education, occupation, ANART, and even ICV, all within the same database, which is rarely available in a clinical study. These reserve proxies share some features and capture different components of the reserve construct: cognitive experience early in life, cognitive activity during adulthood, and steady-state linguistic capacity for example. Cognitive reserve is a hypothetical construct and cannot be directly measured. It is therefore beneficial to address the effect of cognitive reserve markers from >1 perspective. Third, ADNI comprises a wealth of information, allowing us to assess the potential confounding from missing data, APOE 4, and baseline cognitive function. As all participants were enrolled at different stages in the disease course, baseline evaluation did not reflect their pathologic states when they first had cognitive change. We therefore carefully applied GEE to avoid the unverifiable assumption about the distribution of baseline AD pathology. 34 The longitudinal structure and comprehensiveness of ADNI data, together with our statistical approach, all strengthen our results to be less biased.\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, although over 800 people participated in ADNI, the robust longitudinal effect of cognitive reserve mainly came from 35 cognitively normal subjects with 3 repeated CSF studies. This small sample size may be a concern if we want to generalize our results to a larger population. Because missing data and other potential confounders have been considered in our analyses, the internal validity for all 229 participants in the NC group is likely achieved. In addition, the statistical significance from a small sample suggests that the actual effect may be striking. However, the reserve markers we examined actually reflect complex phenomena with a variety of effects on participants, so that we cannot rule out residual confounding. As we made several hypothesis tests with different biomarkers and cognitive reserve surrogates in the same study population, some significant results might be due to multiple comparisons. Second, there are only up to 3 time points of CSF Ab 42 for longitudinal analysis. Although we could evaluate both change and the variance of change based on 3 repeated measures, we might need more data points to sufficiently minimize the effect of \"regression toward the mean\". However, lumbar puncture is an invasive procedure; it is practically challenging to repeat CSF studies especially on normal participants. Amyloid PET imaging, a similar but noninvasive biomarker, may replace the use of CSF Ab 42 to follow cerebral amyloid dynamics in the future. Third, only 55 participants (6.7%) had <12 years of education, and highly educated participants were overrepresented in the ADNI population (Supplementary Table 3 , http://links. lww.com/WAD/A57). Therefore, the effects we detected were relatively confined to those with actually moderate to high levels of education. Nevertheless, this relationship was also seen in our other reserve markers. Fourth, ADNI participants were enrolled based on clinical criteria but not biomarker measurement. They likely had developed various degrees of AD pathology by the time of enrollment. Although we showed that baseline AD biomarkers were independent of cognitive reserve levels, how baseline differences in pathology would affect rates of change is not known. We therefore need to assume that baseline AD pathology for participants within the same cognitive group is homogenous. Ideally, we would like to begin with a group of people with a similar amount of AD pathologic burden and then follow them to assess the effect of cognitive reserve markers. High levels of reserve markers may not only reduce the risk of AD or modify the effect of AD pathology on cognitive performance but also have direct biological influence to slow Ab deposition and compensate for synapse loss in the brain. The protective effect of reserve markers mainly occurs before cognitive impairment, implying that if cognitive intervention can be effective in preventing the occurrence of AD it should be initiated as early as possible."}]
