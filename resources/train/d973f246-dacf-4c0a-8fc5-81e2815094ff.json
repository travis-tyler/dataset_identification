In the United States, public support for immediate federal government action to address this problem declined between (Pew Research Center 2010 , and the political climate in Congress makes near-term climate change abatement legislation a remote possibility. Nevertheless, a variety of local and regional initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI; www.rggi.org) and the Western Climate Initiative (www.westernclimateinitiative.org), have been undertaken in the United States to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Although the feasibility or even desirability of such fragmentary approaches to climate change mitigation has been questioned (Victor et al. 2005 , Wiener 2007 ), at present they are the only game in town. Moreover, cogent arguments, both theoretical and practical, for multilevel governance on this issue have been made (e.g., Trisolini 2010) . For example, local governance plays a key role in a variety of economic activities that significantly influence greenhouse-gas emissions: building codes, zoning regulations, property taxes, public transportation, proprietary"}, {"section_title": "Articles", "text": "Our objective in this study is to describe how variation in this suite of factors influences the current carbon balance (i.e., net carbon dioxide [CO 2 ] fluxes) and the feasibility of approaches for reducing CO 2 emissions in the northeastern United States. We compare carbon budgets and mitigation opportunities across nine representative northeastern counties to illustrate some of the key features influencing the choice of strategies in this region. We chose the county scale because it is the smallest political unit for which nationally consistent data sets related to energy and emissions are commonly collected (Parshall et al. 2010) . We focus on CO 2 , which accounts for 77% of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007) and 85% of US greenhouse-gas emissions (USEPA 2011a) , as the key greenhouse-gas involved in the climate change threat. A major emphasis in our analysis is the contribution of land use to CO 2 emissions, sinks, and mitigation opportunities. Recent analyses illustrate that land-use options may provide costeffective carbon sequestration in the United States (Lubowski et al. 2006) . Although several CO 2 -emissions analyses have been conducted at national and global scales (Metz et al. 2001 , Houghton 2007 , USEPA 2011a , few have been done at the local scale. We hope that this synthesis stimulates a productive dialogue among policymakers, educators, and society at large and offers motivation and guidance for municipalities who will set goals to decrease CO 2 emissions in response to regional and international initiatives.\nThe region chosen for this study encompasses the states involved in the RGGI, an early cap-and-trade system designed to decrease CO 2 emissions from the northeastern United States. Under the RGGI, a cap on CO 2 emissions from the electric power sector has already been applied, with the goal of a 10% decrease by 2018 (www.rggi.org). The Northeast region is heavily populated and urbanized and currently emits more greenhouse gases than all but five nations: China, Russia, India, Japan, and the United States (USEIA 2009) . Within this region, we chose eight counties, plus the independent city of Baltimore, for detailed study (figure 1). Baltimore is the third-largest city (by population and land area) in the region, although it is substantially smaller than New York City (the largest) and may not represent the most densely populated areas of that city (e.g., Manhattan). Metropolitan areas outside of major cities are represented by Essex and Middlesex Counties (Boston metropolitan area) and Baltimore County (BaltimoreWashington metropolitan area). Worcester County, Massachusetts, contains the medium-sized city of Worcester. The four remaining counties do not contain any cities with a population of more than 50,000 people. Hereafter, the eight counties and the independent city of Baltimore will all be referred to as counties. These counties exhibit a wide range of demographic and land-use characteristics from highly urbanized to heavily forested (table 1) . They also encompass a moderate range of climatic variation and biotic production potential. Together, these factors were expected to result in highly contrasting profiles of energy use, carbon budgets, and mitigation potential across the region. Six of the counties encompass intensive research sites in the National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research Network (www.lternet.edu).\nA brief description of our methods In general, we followed the protocols developed by Vadas and colleagues (2007) to circumscribe boundary conditions and to make emissions and sequestration estimates for the counties. Because utility data on heat and power supplies are not generally available at the county scale, we adjusted statelevel data on the basis of population, employment, housing statistics, and typical energy-usage profiles for each housing type (Vadas et al. 2007 ). For residential electricity emissions, for example, we assigned total state-level emissions to the counties in weighted proportion both to the number of housing units in each county and to the relative energy usage of the housing types in each county (e.g., the proportion of single-family detached or single-family attached homes). Electricity emissions for the residential sector were obtained from the US Energy Information Administration's (USEIA) state-level data (USEIA 2010 ). Relative energy usage for each housing type was obtained from the USEIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (USEIA 2005) . The number and types of housing units in each county were obtained from the US Census Bureau (2011). Our analysis excludes CO 2 emissions from air travel and indirect CO 2 emissions associated with the manufacture of imported goods and with the extraction and transport of fossil fuels, Figure 1 . Map of the study area, which includes the states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Detailed carbon budgets and mitigation analyses were conducted for the highlighted counties. Articles which would be challenging to incorporate without violating our county-level boundary conditions (designed to prevent double counting of CO 2 emissions across geographic areas); we consider some implications of this approach for informing national policy in a later section discussing wider applications and implications. For land areas classified as forested by the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data (http:// fia.fs.fed.us) were used to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks, except for Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where more detailed forest and nonforest biomass data were available Crane 2002, Jenkins and Riemann 2003) . To estimate the potential for carbon sequestration by afforestation, we assumed that all inactive agricultural land (USDA 2009 ) is available for afforestation. We used FIA estimates of forest carbon storage for 26-30-year-old forest plots in each state (using data from between 2002 and 2008) and divided the total biomass by the median age of the forest to provide an estimate of mean annual sequestration.\nFor the carbon budgets, we used common, widely available data sources when that was possible in order to standardize our comparisons across counties and to ensure that our calculations would be easily repeatable, so that they might serve as a model for calculating carbon budgets and mitigation opportunities for other counties. All of the mitigation opportunities evaluated use mature, current technologies and can be separated into 10 categories: (1) space and water heating (e.g., improved building insulation, sealed air leaks, programmable thermostats, lower thermostat temperature settings, boiler maintenance or replacement, geothermal heating); (2) lighting (compact florescent lamps [CFLs] and LED [light-emitting diode] exit signs); (3) computers and appliances (energy star refrigerators and airconditioning units, and computer energy-saving features); (4) fuelwood harvest for electricity generation; (5) wind power (land-based, utility-scale facilities); (6) bioenergy crops (switchgrass and willow for electricity generation, soybeans for biodiesel, corn for ethanol); (7) afforestation; (8) residential, commercial, and industrial photovoltaics; (9) transportation (for Tompkins County only, including increasing personal-vehicle fuel efficiency to 35 and 50 miles per gallon [mpg] , increased bus ridership and carpooling to work, traffic signal upgrades, hybrid electric buses, waste oil as fuel, production and use of ethanol and biodiesel); and (10) combined heating and power (CHP). Near-future technologies, including carbon capture and storage, highefficiency solar photovoltaics, and fuel-cell vehicles, were not evaluated. Nuclear power, offshore and small-scale wind power, and energy efficiency in industrial processes were outside of the scope of the analysis. We did not include embedded energy (e.g., manufacture, transport, installation of equipment) in our calculations; life cycle assessments of solar and wind power indicate that these emissions are small relative to their carbon offsets and the total energy generated (Pehnt 2006 , Fthenakis et al. 2008 . Detailed methods and data sources can be found in Vadas and colleagues (2007) , which we followed in general but with major adjustments; we describe these adjustments below.\nSolid bioenergy for electricity generation and liquid biofuels for on-road transportation. For bioenergy crops (see box 1)-we used a scenario in which solid bioenergy (switchgrass and willow) would be used in place of coal for electricity generation and in which liquid biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) would be used in place of gasoline or diesel in vehicles. All scenarios were based on published life-cycle analyses (Ney and Schnoor 2002 for switchgrass, Keoleian and Volk 2005 for willow, Wang M 2005 for ethanol, and Sheehan et al. 1998 for biodiesel). We used statistical and geospatial methods to estimate land availability for bioenergy production using switchgrass, short-rotation willow, soybeans, and corn without competition with current agricultural production. On the basis of the total area of pasture, hay, and grassland (Homer et al. 2004 ), we discounted land in federal ownership, land with slopes greater than 15%, and land currently in pasture or hay production, determined on the basis of the 2007 Census of Agriculture (USDA 2009 ). We assumed that only 20% of the total available land area would actually be used for bioenergy feedstock production. Yield data for dedicated bioenergy feedstocks are only available from a few locations in the Northeast, and these data are not sufficient by themselves to predict yields across our study region. Therefore, to estimate potential feedstock yields, we used measured crop-yield data for all of the counties and an integrated index of soil and climate characteristics called the National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (Dobos et al. 2008 ). This index incorporates key soil and climatic characteristics that influence crop yields and is available for the locations in our study region. We also used corn yield data from the National Agricultural Statistical Service. We developed regression equations to predict corn yield on the basis of this index (r 2 = .65; NYSERDA 2011). Assuming a one-toone relationship between grain and stover (Graham et al. 2007 ), this regression relationship was modified to predict the aboveground biomass yield of corn, which was used as a conservative proxy for the potential switchgrass and willow yield (NYSERDA 2011) . This regression equation was used to predict switchgrass and willow yield on the land identified to be potentially available in each county as was described above. We performed further regression analyses to quantify the trends from 1960 to 2007 in 35 major crops for each state. For crops with strong evidence of linear increases in yield, we predicted the yield increases from 2007 to 2020 and estimated the area of land that would Box 1. Land cover, albedo, and climate.\nThe potential climate benefits of carbon sequestration in forests and of replacing fossil fuels with solid biofuels are widely acknowledged. Less appreciated, however, are the concomitant effects of land-use changes on radiative forcing associated with differences in albedo, evapotranspiration, and surface roughness between native vegetation and bioenergy crops. For example, conversion from herbaceous vegetation to forest in boreal regions likely has a net warming impact on the climate, whereas similar conversion in broadleaf temperate regions can range from net warming to net cooling (Bala et al. 2007 ). The differing climate impacts of afforestation in boreal and temperate forests result especially from the fact that the albedo of deciduous forests is higher than that of evergreen forest, and that of herbaceous vegetation can be particularly high, especially when the area is snow covered (Bonan 2008) . From south to north across the northeastern United States, forest cover changes from predominantly broadleaf deciduous to evergreen conifer, the duration of snow cover increases markedly, and the potential yield of biofuel crops and the growth of forests declines. Each of these differences contributes to the regional variation in the effects of land-use change on radiative forcing. To illustrate the magnitude of these effects, we compared the climate forcing associated with afforestation and biofuel crops in Baltimore County, Maryland, and Coos County, New Hampshire (figure 1). We used climate data specific to each location (NCDC 2009 ), together with albedo estimates for these land-cover types (Bonan 2008 , Jackson et al. 2008 to calculate the annual albedo difference between forest (hardwood or conifer) and cropland in the two locations. The albedo difference between bioenergy crops and forest is much greater for the northern location (Coos County; see table 2).\nThis difference indicates that albedo change has a much greater effect on the climate forcing associated with land-use conversion to bioenergy crops at northern than at southern locations, even within the relatively restricted Northeast region. In fact, a simple conversion of the change in albedo to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalents (see Betts 2000; assuming the change in radiative forcing at the Earth's surface is equal to the change in radiative forcing at the tropopause) suggests that the albedo effect of land-use change in Coos County may greatly exceed the climate forcing associated the effects of bioenergy crops and afforestation on atmospheric CO 2 at decadal time scales. In contrast, in Baltimore County, these effects are more comparable. Moreover, the differences in productivity and carbon sequestration between the northern and southern locations are overshadowed by the contrast in albedo effects. These observations are meant to illustrate the fact that evaluations of land-use change for climate benefits need to account for forcings other than carbon sequestration and that these other forcings can vary markedly even within relatively restricted geographic ranges (e.g., the northeastern United States). A complete quantitative assessment of the climate forcing associated with the land-use change would need to include surface roughness, evapotranspiration, climate model runs to simulate how radiative forcing at the Earth's surface influences radiative forcing at the tropopause (i.e., the layer in the atmosphere at which the radiative forcing by CO 2 is determined), and other factors. Research is needed to better address this important problem. Articles become available for each crop for each county. This land could be available either for increased crop production or for the production of bioenergy feedstocks. We assumed that all of this land could be available for feedstock production.\nSustainable fuelwood harvest for electricity generation. Sustainable harvest rates from forests were calculated from FIA data for the years between 2002 and 2008 using the following criteria: (a) The live-forest biomass that accounts for all types of harvest and removals must be maintained or increased; (b) at least 35% of logging residue (branches and tops) must be left on site, therefore allowing a maximum of 65% to be removed for feedstock; (c) all dead trees must be left on site; (d) no more than 3% of noncommercial and commercial standing biomass from trees greater than 12.7 centimeters (cm; about 5 inches) in diameter may be harvested and all residue from these trees must be left on site; and (e) 50% of \"other removals\" should be added from the FIA-estimated timber product output. The sum of these criteria provides an estimate of the available biomass that can be harvested indefinitely (Perlack et al. 2005) . Finally, an ownership factor of 50% was applied in order to account for the likelihood that only a portion of forest landowners would be interested in biomass harvest. In New York State, this factor has been estimated to range from 10% to 90% (NYSERDA 2011 ).\nCommercial-scale wind energy. For this category, we used 200-meter-(m) resolution simulated wind-resource data to evaluate the potential for commercial wind power generation across the counties in New England. Our analysis was focused on terrestrial wind resources. Areas with class 3 (6.4 m per second mean speed at 50 m height) or greater wind power potential were considered commercially viable sites for wind power generation. Developed areas were excluded as potential sites. The information on land availability for wind power generation was determined using the 2001 national land-cover database of Homer and colleagues (2004) . The wind-resource data, obtained from MassGIS (the Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information, Boston), were originally developed by AWS Truepower (Albany, New York) as part of a project funded by the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund (now part of the Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority), the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, and Northeast Utilities.\nCombined heating and power. For CHP, we evaluated the potential CO 2 -emission reductions that would result if natural-gas-powered CHP systems were installed in all high-potential buildings in each county: hospitals, educational facilities, office buildings, and lodging (hotels, motels, resorts, assisted-care facilities, and dormitories). The total square footage of each building type in each county was estimated by scaling regional building square footage estimates (USEIA 2003) by county population or by student population for educational buildings (US Census Bureau 2011). The average electrical, heating, and hot-water usage per square foot (USEIA 2003) were used to calculate the annual energy usage for each building type. The fuel required for each CHP system was estimated using the total electrical load and a conservative heat rate (Midwest CHP Application Center 2010). These energy requirements were converted to CO 2 emissions (USEPA 2011a ). The net CO 2 reduction was obtained by summing the current electrical and thermal CO 2 emissions and then subtracting the CO 2 released from hypothetical CHP systems.\nLight bulb replacement. We assumed a mean total usage of 30 bulb-hours per day for CFL replacement bulbs in an average housing unit (USEIA 2005) .\nResidential photovoltaics. We assumed that half of all singlefamily dwellings would be realistic candidates for photovoltaic systems (Anders and Bialek 2006) .\nElectric fuel grid mix. For all electricity-based energy savings and new renewable power generation, we assumed that emission reductions would displace emissions from the current mix of fuels in the regional electricity grid (USEPA 2011b) .\nforests are predicted to be subsumed by urban development between 2000 and 2050 (Nowak and Walton 2005) . At present, forest preservation and afforestation are highercost strategies because of relatively high land values in the region, the low value of carbon offsets in existing markets, and the challenges of meeting additionality and verifiability requirements under emerging carbon-accounting frameworks (Fahey et al. 2010) .\nGrowing willow and switchgrass for electric generation could provide relatively large reductions in CO 2 emissions (table 4) but at a higher price per unit of energy than coal (Vadas et al. 2007) . Cofiring willow or switchgrass could offset up to 15% of CO 2 emissions in rural and suburban counties (up to 75,000 Mg of carbon per year) without competing with current agricultural production or forestland. Together, afforestation and bioenergy could offset 0.3%-28% of the CO 2 emissions in rural counties. Afforestation is limited by the availability of inactive agricultural land, whereas bioenergy feedstocks are also limited by climate, soil quality, and their proximity to potential markets or processing facilities (Potter et al. 2007 ). In the suburban counties (those with fewer than 180 people per km 2 , excluding Baltimore City), the potential for afforestation and bioenergy is significant (4700-101,000 and 7600-149,000 Mg of carbon per year, respectively) and could offset 0.3%-6.8% of current CO 2 emissions. However, it is likely that land prices and development pressure in these areas will be highest. For instance, Nowak and Walton (2005) predicted that more than 60% of the land area of four of the most-developed northeastern states (Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut) will be urban by the year 2050.\nIn the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, gridconnected rooftop photovoltaic systems have the potential to reduce county-level CO 2 emissions by 9.5%-19%, but the initial costs are high, and the payback periods exceed the lifetimes of the systems unless large subsidies are available to reduce the costs. The initial system costs are approximately $40,000 for 5-kilowatt (kW) residential systems and $115,000 for 15-kW commercial systems (Barbose et al. 2010) . The associated energy-cost savings ranged from $800 to $1000 per year and from $1900 to $2800 per year for 5-kW and 15-kW systems, respectively, on the basis of local energy-generation potential and retail electricity prices (NREL 2010) . At current electricity prices, and assuming no government subsidies or feed-in tariffs, this would mean a payback period of 37-63 years, depending on the county and emissions (up to 42%) by expanding forest CO 2 sinks and, in some cases, by growing bioenergy crops, but protecting existing forests from overharvest and land-use conversion will be critical. Forests are the largest potential CO 2 sinks in rural counties (figure 6) and sequester 18%-420% of annual CO 2 emissions in the studied counties (77,000-511,000 Mg of carbon per year). Forest loss would turn these present-day sinks into large sources of CO 2 emissions. Unfortunately, these forests face strong development pressure. For instance, the Maryland Department of Planning predicts that if past trends continue, the state will lose 9% of its forest cover by 2020 (Weber et al. 2006 ). This trend holds true for the entire Northeast region, where approximately 9% of existing (Banister 1999) . The impact of these land-use-planning activities was tested with a number of indicators, including congestion and vehicle miles traveled. Under proposed land-use planning scenarios, the model predicted a 2% decrease in vehicle miles traveled at peak travel times. If this outcome is generalized to include off-peak travel times, it would mean a decline of approximately 2% in county CO 2 emissions relative to the business-as-usual scenario.\nOther mitigation opportunities in the transportation sector include improving passenger-vehicle fuel efficiency, producing transportation biofuels, increasing carpooling Articles kilowatt-hour) and lowest in Maryland ($0.10-$0.11 per kilowatt-hour). These factors can combine to create dysfunction in the economic incentive structure for carbon abatement. For example, Baltimore County and City have the highest carbon intensity for residential heating systems in the region, yet they have the lowest economic incentive (slowest return on investment) for mitigation opportunities ( figure 7) . Clearly, correction of this sort of economic disincentive, such as through a rise in the cost of carbon credits under the RGGI, will be needed."}, {"section_title": "Carbon budgets", "text": "The counties included in this study span a wide range of population densities, from 7 people per square kilometer (km 2 ) in Coos County, New Hampshire, to over 3000 people per km 2 in Baltimore City, Maryland. The net CO 2 fluxes from the counties were strongly and positively correlated with population density (figure 2), despite moderate differences in per capita CO 2 emissions among the counties (figure 3). The current rates of carbon sequestration in vegetation and soils were inversely related to population density (r 2 = .63); however, this pattern was not robust at the lower population densities, because the counties with population densities of less than about 200 people per km 2 differed little from each other in sequestration rates. According to the national land-cover database, all counties with population densities in this lower range have developed less than 12% of their total land area, and most of that developed area falls into the open space and low-intensity development landuse categories (Homer et al. 2004) . These data suggest that opportunities for sequestration in vegetation and soils are not greatly diminished until the developed proportion of the landscape exceeds about 10%-15%.\nMost of the counties were net sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere, since emissions from fossil-fuel combustion exceeded sequestration in vegetation and soils (figure 2). The exceptions were the two most rural, forested counties in northern New Hampshire, where the carbon sequestration in growing forests exceeded CO 2 emissions. Therefore, much of the northeastern United States is a source of atmospheric Articles additional CO 2 will likely decline unless policies and practices shift considerably (Hurtt et al. 2002) . Furthermore, sequestration in northeastern forests is threatened by a number of invasive pests and pathogens (Lovett et al. 2006 ) that could significantly reduce forest biomass over the coming decades. Finally, forest cover in the region is declining as real estate development expands in both suburban and rural areas (Stein et al. 2010) . Therefore, if current trends in land use continue, future carbon sequestration potential will be reduced and some previously stored carbon in vegetation and soil will be released to the atmosphere as CO 2 .\nPer capita CO 2 emissions Per capita CO 2 emissions among the counties ranged from 2900 kilograms (kg) of carbon per person for Chittenden County, Vermont, to 4670 kg of carbon per person for Baltimore County, Maryland (figure 3). This range in per capita emissions is smaller than international variation (Aldy 2006 ), but it is still quite large, which suggests that local factors may exert considerable influence on per capita CO 2 emissions.\nThe transportation sector accounted for the largest share of CO 2 emissions from every county (35%-47%), except for Baltimore City, Maryland (26%; figure 3). Per capita transportation CO 2 emissions ranged from 920 kg of carbon per person in Baltimore City to 1640 kg of carbon per person in neighboring Baltimore County. The greater availability of public transportation and the closer proximity to places of employment play a role in Baltimore City's lower transportation CO 2 emissions. More than 28% of working Baltimore City residents used public transportation, walked, or used alternate means of transportation (19.4%, 7.1%, and 1.6%, respectively) to get to work (US Census Bureau 2011). Compare these values with those for neighboring Baltimore County, where fewer than 8% of working residents used these forms of transportation for their daily commute. A lower average income combined with more convenient access to public transportation probably contributes to the lower vehicle ownership rates in Baltimore City, where 30% of households have no personal vehicle (US Census Bureau 2011). The other county with comparatively low per capita transportation CO 2 , with the strength of the source varying primarily with human population density and with only sparsely populated forested counties acting as net CO 2 sinks.\nNet-zero emissions of CO 2 in the northeastern region coincide with a population density of about 30 people per km 2 , a figure that is based on the regression between net CO 2 emissions and population density (r 2 = .99; figure 2 ). This value represents the population density at which CO 2 emissions in the Northeast are roughly in balance with the sequestration in vegetation and soils. Contrast this value with the mean population density of the region of 134 people per km 2 (US Census Bureau 2011). The implication of our results is that sequestration in forests and soils cannot offset existing emissions from the region. Note that our analysis ignores air travel, which constitutes nearly 3% of US CO 2 emissions (USDOE 2009a) , as well as CO 2 emissions associated with the production and transportation of imported food and goods, which are at least 10% of the total emissions for the United States (Davis and Caldeira 2010) .\nThe future potential for natural sequestration to offset regional CO 2 emissions is less promising when the patterns of forest regrowth in the Northeast are examined. Forests in the region are maturing, and their ability to sequester Articles CO 2 emissions is Tompkins County, New York, which is dominated by the small city of Ithaca. Ithaca is itself dominated by Cornell University, which provides strong incentives to discourage single-occupancy vehicle commuting. More than 8% of Tompkins County commuters use public transportation, and an even greater percentage (19.4%) walk or use other alternative means of transit. Still, a most-striking pattern is the similarity in per capita transportation CO 2 emissions across counties with dramatically different population densities and landcover patterns.\nThe residential sector accounted for the second-largest share of CO 2 emissions in each of the counties (except Baltimore City, where it ranked first), accounting for 25%-35% of the total CO 2 emissions. CO 2 emissions ranged from 760 kg of carbon per person in Chittenden County, Vermont, to 1260 kg of carbon per person in Coos County, New Hampshire. Factors such as local climate, housing mix, and the carbon intensity (the amount of carbon released per unit of energy produced) of fuels used for heating and electricity generation contribute to this wide range in residential CO 2 emissions. For instance, Baltimore City has lower per capita CO 2 emissions than Baltimore County, despite similar climate and fuel mixes for heating and electricity generation. The greater proportion of attached houses, multifamily dwellings, and apartment buildings in Baltimore City (86% of housing units) is a major driver of these trends, because these smaller, attached housing units require less energy to heat, cool, and light than do detached, single-family houses (USEIA 2005) .\nElectricity usage constituted a large and highly variable percentage of residential CO 2 emissions across the counties and influenced many of the patterns in residential CO 2 emissions. Chittenden County, Vermont, has unusually low per capita residential CO 2 emissions because of its extensive reliance on renewable energy (50%, mostly hydroelectric) and nuclear power (34%) for electricity generation (VTDPS 2011) . These low-carbon-intensity electricity sources result in residential electricity emissions of only 82 kg of carbon per person or just 11% of the total residential CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, Baltimore City and Baltimore County had the highest per capita residential electricity use (0.049 and 0.056 billion British thermal units [Btu] per person, including system losses) and the highest accompanying CO 2 emissions from electricity use, at 750 and 850 kg of carbon per person, respectively-10 times higher than that in Chittenden County, Vermont. The warmer climate in Maryland and the state's heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation may explain this sharp contrast. Baltimore City averages 1220 cooling degree-days (CDD) per year versus just 370-560 CDD per year for the other counties (table 1; NCDC 2009 ), which leads to higher electricity use for home cooling. The milder climate also stimulates a greater proportion of homeowners to rely on electric heat, which is a relatively inefficient source; more than 36% of Maryland residents heat their homes with electricity compared with fewer than 10% in the New England states (USEIA 2005) .\nFossil-fuel burning for space and hot-water heating accounted for the largest proportion of residential CO 2 emissions in the upstate New York and New England counties, making up 59%-89% of emissions compared with less than 35% of residential emissions in the Maryland counties. Natural gas and heating oil are favored in the colder climate of New England (more than 6000 heating degreedays [HDD] per year, compared with 4700 HDD per year in Baltimore City and County; see table 1).\nPer capita industrial CO 2 emissions were much greater in Baltimore City and Baltimore County (927 and 1058 megagrams [Mg] of carbon per person) than in other counties (355-636 Mg carbon per person). Baltimore is home to a major port and has historically been a center for industry in the region, despite a major industrial decline in the second half of the twentieth century. Finally, the differences in per capita CO 2 emissions from the commercial sector are not explained by any obvious factor; for example, the highest and lowest per capita commercial sector CO 2 emissions were observed in the two northernmost rural counties in our study. Detailed study of this variation is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Mitigation opportunities", "text": "The nine counties in this study represent a wide variety of biophysical, demographic, political, and economic conditions, which in turn influence the feasibility of various approaches for reducing CO 2 emissions.

The actual return on investment may be slower than is represented here, since the potential interest earned from alternative investments and the interest paid on loans are not considered. However, if CO 2 emissions are priced and energy prices subsequently rise, the return on investment may be faster than we have estimated. Our suite of low-cost mitigation opportunities includes land-intensive alternative power sources such as electricity production from sustainably harvested fuelwood and utility-scale wind power. In the residential sector, low-cost opportunities include energy-efficient lighting (replacing incandescent bulbs with CFL bulbs), increased home insulation, programmable thermostats, lowered thermostat temperature settings for heating, sealing air leaks, boiler maintenance or replacement, and US Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star-certified refrigerators and air-conditioning units (Vadas et al. 2007) . We focused our analysis on the residential sector, together with land-use change and alternative-energy opportunities. Mitigation strategies were applied to commercial and industrial sectors in cases in which they were readily transferable and for which supporting data were available.\nRural counties in our study area (less than 100 people per km 2 ) could offset 27%-1000% of the current emissions at low cost through the sustainable harvest of fuelwood from existing forests and through the installation of commercial-scale wind-energy farms at favorable sites (figures 4 and 5). Our wind-energy analysis was focused on terrestrial wind resources, which are most abundant in hilly and mountainous terrain; however, the region also possesses abundant offshore wind resources (figure 5 inset). Because of low population densities, abundant forest cover, and favorable topography for wind energy, these land-based strategies could provide cost-effective reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in rural areas. In suburban counties, these strategies are also favorable (they would, e.g., reduce emissions up to 116,000 Mg of carbon per year in Essex County, Massachusetts), although they could mitigate a smaller proportion of total county CO 2 emissions (0.4%-3.3%).\nRegardless of population density and available land area, the suite of low-cost residential, commercial, and industrial energy-saving opportunities could be substantial and represent a potential 29%-37% reduction in the CO 2 emissions of the counties in this study. The largest potential for low-cost residential energy savings was for space and water heating, for which a combined 9%-13% reduction in county CO 2 emissions could be achieved by sealing air leaks, by increasing insulation in older homes, by lowering thermostats to 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit, by using programmable thermostats, through boiler maintenance, and through the replacement of outdated boilers. Other spaceand water-heating upgrades would bring even greater energy savings but would require greater upfront costs. For instance, augmenting conventional home-heating systems with geothermal systems could reduce heating energy forests and inactive agricultural land are abundant, a variety of land-based strategies offer opportunities to sequester CO 2 in vegetation and soils and provide feedstocks for biofuel production or space to accommodate alternative energy technologies. In more urbanized counties, in which available land is limited and expensive, the most cost-effective carbon-mitigation strategies will include energy-efficiency practices and energy-saving technologies. In all cases, a range of locally tailored management and technology options can offer substantial CO 2 -emission reductions at high rates of return on investment, as is described below.\nLow-cost mitigation opportunities. We identified and evaluated a range of low-cost mitigation opportunities (i.e., those that entail a rapid return on investment; figure 4) that were based on the criterion that they pay for themselves with income generated or through energy-cost savings over the lifetime of the strategy. For simplicity, we have assumed a simple payback period, such that the payback time in years is equal to the initial investment divided by the annual Articles bulbs. Enabling computer energy-saving features on the nearly 50% of commercial-sector computers that are currently set to run constantly (Alliance to Save Energy and 1E 2009) would decrease total county CO 2 emissions by another 1.1%-2.4%.\nCombined heating and power, which uses a generator to produce electrical power while applying the waste heat for another purpose, is a viable mitigation strategy in all of the counties. Using waste heat for space heating or absorption refrigeration can result in energy efficiencies as high as 85%, compared with 35% for conventional heating and power systems (Midwest CHP Application Center 2009) . CHP also offers opportunities to switch to lower-carbon fuels (such as natural gas or biofuels), which can provide additional reductions in CO 2 emissions. The price difference between electricity and a chosen combustible fuel (typically less expensive per unit of energy than electricity) is a widely accepted indicator of the economic feasibility for CHP systems for a given area (Midwest CHP Application Center 2009) . We compared natural gas and electricity prices in the counties and found that the resulting price differences were high in all of the counties (between $25.08 and $34.56 per million Btu), with the exception of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where it was moderate ($12.66 per million Btu). For buildings in the latter locations to have acceptable payback periods for CHP systems, other factors would have to be favorable, such as a good balance of thermal and electrical load, high heat and electricity demand, or long operating hours (Midwest CHP Application Center 2009 ). Our analysis indicates that installing CHP systems in all high-potential buildings in each county (hospitals, educational facilities, office buildings, and lodging) could reduce CO 2 emissions by 0.6%-2.4% (table 3) . The use of biofuels as CHP feedstocks could provide even greater CO 2 -emission reductions than would the use of natural gas (Eriksson et al. 2007) .\nIn total, the low-cost mitigation options that we evaluated could decrease or offset a high proportion of the CO 2 emissions in the studied counties. For example, the rural counties that contain small cities, represented here by Tompkins County, New York, (which includes Ithaca) and Chittenden County, Vermont, (which includes Burlington), could offset more than half of their CO 2 emissions. At higher population densities, energy-efficiency strategies and technologies are the most cost-effective options and could offset as much as 34% of county CO 2 emissions.\nHigher-cost mitigation opportunities. The higher-cost opportunities that we evaluated (figure 8) include terrestrial sinks (e.g., afforestation of inactive agricultural land) and bioenergy crops (willow and switchgrass for solid fuels, corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel for transportation fuels). We also evaluated the potential for photovoltaic systems in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.\nThe rural counties (those with populations under 100 people per km 2 ) could offset a significant portion of current CO 2 expenditures by about 50% (USOGT 1998) , which would lead to an 8%-11% reduction in county CO 2 emissions. Such systems would cost approximately $18,750 for a typical house (Hughes 2008 , SBI Energy 2009 and have a simple payback period of 18-20 years, as determined from 2008 energy prices in the region. Similarly, residential solar hot-water systems (flat plate collectors) could decrease water-heating costs by about 50%, with upfront costs of $3250 (USDOE 2010 ) and a payback period of 14-22 years for a typical home. This could reduce county CO 2 emissions by another 1.7%-2.3%. Replacing the 28 remaining incandescent light bulbs contained in the average home (USDOE 2009b ) with more-energy-efficient lighting is the next largest low-cost opportunity to reduce CO 2 emissions in the residential sector; county CO 2 emissions could be reduced by another 2.4%-3.4% with CFL "}, {"section_title": "Wider applications and implications", "text": "We chose the county scale as an effective level of analysis to inform local policies that could contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions (e.g., building and tax codes, public transit, proprietary functions). The application of analysis at this scale to policy development at larger scales deserves further attention. To avoid double counting, it seemed appropriate to define boundary conditions at the county scale; therefore, importation and cross-boundary transport were not considered, nor were large-scale energy-generation facilities. To inform policies at the regional and national levels, future development of this approach must be embedded in analyses at these larger scales. The contribution of local analysis to prescriptions for incentives and investments at larger scales also need to by 6.6%. Increasing effective fuel efficiency to 50 mpg would lead to a 19% decrease in transportation-related CO 2 emissions. The county could provide some incentives to encourage the use of fuel-efficient vehicles, such as enhanced parking privileges or special travel lanes for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. Increased carpooling could reduce transportation-related CO 2 emissions by up to 7.4%, assuming that the majority of people who drive alone to work would participate. Increasing bus ridership in the county by approximately one third (or 1,000,000 annual rides) would decrease transportation-related CO 2 emissions by 1.3%. A mix of smaller upgrades, including traffic-signal upgrades in the city of Ithaca (0.6%), hybrid electric buses (0.2%), and using available county waste oil as fuel (0.1%) could further reduce transportationrelated CO 2 emissions. These emissions could be offset by another 0.8% by growing corn and soybeans for ethanol and biodiesel, a figure based on a scenario that avoids deforestation and competition with existing agricultural production. Note that willow, switchgrass, or forest biofuels could provide larger emission benefits than ethanol or biodiesel, especially if they are used in place of carbonintensive fuels such as oil (for home heating) or coal (for electricity generation). Taken in total, these improvements have the potential to decrease transportation-sector CO 2 emissions by 17%-29% and total county CO 2 emissions by 6.3%-11% (table 5) . The transportation-related CO 2 mitigation portfolio for other counties would vary as a consequence of differences in current transportation systems and other factors, but clearly, incentives for increased passenger-vehicle fuel efficiency will dominate the mitigation opportunities regionwide.\nOther patterns in mitigation cost and potential. A number of regional and local conditions contribute to the differences in potential mitigation costs and emission benefits (figure 7) among the countiesparticularly, the mix of fuels used for heating and electricity generation, local climate (e.g., cooling and heating degree-days), and fuel prices. The payback period for photovoltaic systems; energy-efficient lighting, airconditioning, and appliances; and commercial wind installations are all dependent on the market price of electricity (USEIA 2009 Articles technology options, substantial CO 2 -emission reductions can be achieved at low cost. For largely rural counties, afforestation, sustainable fuelwood harvest for electricity generation, and utility-scale wind power can provide the largest and most cost-effective mitigation opportunities. For urban and suburban counties, energy-efficiency measures and energy-saving technologies will be the largest and most costeffective mitigation opportunities. Many of the mitigation strategies presented here are considered \"low cost,\" because the energy saved or the income generated will equal or exceed the initial capital costs over the lifetime of the strategy. These low-cost options could effectively offset or decrease CO 2 emissions by as much as 31%-1100% in counties across the region. And if the higher-cost options are included, emissions can be reduced by another 14%-440%. In both cases, the greatest proportional CO 2 -emission reductions are possible in rural counties in which the carbon sequestration in vegetation and soils may already exceed current account for differences in the cost-effectiveness of mitigation activities at the larger scale; for example, the embedded energy in any material-intensive mitigation option would comprise a different proportion of the carbon offset, depending on the efficiency of the end use. We recommend that future researchers work toward a synthesis of local-, regional-, and national-scale analyses of carbon budgets and mitigation options; this would facilitate quantitative comparisons that could help direct policy decisions at various scales.\nTo put our results into a larger context, we used regression relationships between population density and per-area emissions (r 2 = .97) and mitigation potential (r 2 = .96) for the nine counties to extrapolate our results to the Northeast region on the basis of the population density of each county. We caution that this is a rough extrapolation because our nine-county comparison demonstrated large differences in the emissions and offset potential of the mitigation strategies (e.g., figures 3, 4, and 8, and table 4). Our scaling exercise results in net CO 2 emissions of 188 teragrams (Tg) of carbon per year, based on 228 Tg of carbon per year of gross emissions and 40 Tg of carbon per year of terrestrial sinks. Our extrapolation of gross regional emissions is within 5% of the USEIA emissions estimates for the region. Our estimate of terrestrial CO 2 sinks is within the range of published estimates for the region (e.g., 31 and 45 Tg of carbon per year for Turner et al. 1995 and Murdock et al. 2007 , respectively). When we analyzed the relationship between low-cost mitigation opportunities and population density in the same way (r 2 = .97), we found that approximately 117 Tg of carbon per year (52% of the extrapolated annual CO 2 emissions) can be offset in the region at low cost (i.e., with a favorable payback period). These extrapolations provide a coarse estimate of the potential carbon mitigation for the region on the basis of the strategies and assumptions that we have outlined.\nThe magnitude and feasibility of the mitigation strategies rely, to a significant extent, on climate, energy usage patterns, and the level of carbon intensity of the local economy of the northeastern United States. We would expect similar emissions and mitigation profiles for the northern United States, southern Canada, and possibly northern Europe. Regions with warmer climates, largely nonforest vegetation, or lower affluence would be considerably different. For example, despite similar climate, potential vegetation, and human population density (Toth et al. 2003) , the carbon balance of northeastern China would reflect the lower per capita income (Pedroni and Yao 2006) , level of carbon intensity (UCS 2009 ), and forest carbon sequestration (Wang S et al. 2002 )-the latter two of which could increase with continued economic development and afforestation (Shuifa et al. 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Clearly, no single carbon-mitigation strategy will be costeffective for all locations in the Northeast region; however, by implementing a range of locally tailored management and CO 2 emissions. If the transportation-sector opportunities explored in Tompkins County are indicative of what can be achieved in other counties, countywide CO 2 emissions could be reduced by an additional 6.6%-11%. Future work in which this approach is used should be embedded in the context of regional-and national-scale analyses in order to better inform policies for achieving cost-effective reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in the US economy.\nDespite the generally promising findings, implementing even the low-cost mitigation opportunities will be difficult without strong leadership, effective policies, and greater public support for reducing CO 2 emissions. The potential clearly exists to dramatically alter the carbonmitigation landscape in the United States by taking advantage of a suite of existing technologies and future breakthroughs in such areas as building design, alternativeenergy vehicles, biofuels and cellulosic ethanol, photovoltaics, and carbon capture. These changes can be implemented most efficiently at the local level, and the analysis presented in our study contributes to a blueprint for achieving this goal."}]
