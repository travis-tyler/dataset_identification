In this paper we analyse evacuation planning to reduce exposure. Evacuation planning has developed for different systems (single building, land system, transportation system, industrial system) [2, 8, 33] . In recent years, some modelling tools and Decision Support System (DSS) are developed to monitoring and prediction tools are indicated in U.S. guidelines to support an evacuation [4, 6, 7] . U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have analyzed possible impacts of various hurricane hazards to determine the amount of response time necessary to ensure all populations are out of the threatened areas before the effects of any hurricane arrive.\nIn this paper we recall a proposal of an internal evacuation planning process presented in previous works [24] [25] [26] . The process is affected by the objectives to be pursued to implement strategies which respect constraints. Starting from analysis of the present situation, in the plan a set of strategies to adopt for pursuing their objectives is identified. Strategies include a set of interventions that have to evaluate whether objectives could be achieved and constraints respected. Ex ante and ex post evaluations of effects produced by the planned interventions are essential elements of the process [24] .\nA possible method to evaluate how strategies actually achieve goals, starting from inputs exogenously defined, is the Logical Framework Approach (LFA). The method is a planning tool according to a results-oriented approach [1, 34] .\nLFA is applied in planning by numerous countries. In the United States, the LFA has been applied in the general planning process since 1993 with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) [32] . Many guidelines to implement the LFA are available and are recalled in [22] and [26] . The European Commission adopted LFA as core tool used within Project Cycle Management (PCM). In PCM, a project is defined how a series of activities aimed at bringing about clearly specified objectives within a defined time-period and with a defined budget. PCM is a term used to describe the management activities and decision-making procedures used during the life-cycle of a project (including key tasks, roles and responsibilities, key documents and decision options). PCM, integrated with the LFA, is adopted to allocate and monitor structural funds [3] .\nA research project called SICURO (riduzione del riSchio medIante proCedure di evacuazione: linee gUida, speRimentazione e sistema di suppOrto alle decisioni) has been developed by LAST (Laboratory for Transport Systems Analysis) with a grant from the European Union and Calabria region: methods and models of the research project can be applied to evaluate ex ante an urban evacuation plan; in the project two experiments are carried out to evaluate ex post the plan.\nIn this paper, the LFA is considered in relation to evacuation planning of an urban system in emergency conditions. In section 2, USA approach to emergency planning modelling is presented. In section 3, LFA is proposed to transportation planning in evacuation conditions. Methods and models of the SICURO project are applied to calculate ex ante indicators to evaluate an evacuation plan in an urban context. In section 4, an analysis of principal software and DSS that could be used in evacuation planning is presented and an application of LFA in a local evacuation plan is given.\nreason, in the following, we analyse USA approach to emergency planning modelling.\nEmergency planning is a critical focus area of USA general transportation planning process [6] ; recommendations and guidance are indicated from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS); U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has published a guide focuses on planning and coordination associated with evacuating populations using highways and roads when there is advance notice of an event. American public safety organizations work to improve their capabilities according to the National Response Plan (NRP) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS), which were released by the DHS [4] . [20] . The models are based on socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics combined with threat assessment by geographic zone [28] . In Virginia ATM has applied to identify bottlenecks or other problem areas that may develop as a result of evacuation activities. To analyse in depth critical points, micro-simulation software was applied to model the impacts of different storm categories on traffic conditions. Specific guidelines are published to assist transportation agencies in developing drills and exercises in alignment with the National Incident Management System (NIMS). [...] Guidelines comprise the required elements of a successful transportation emergency exercise program for all modes of transportation. Indications are provided to coordinators at state and local transportation agencies responsible [18] .\nExercise programs contribute to improve the cycle between planning, training, exercises, and the identification and implementation of improvement actions. DHS has developed the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) to introduce standard for emergency exercises in terms of terminology, common processes and implementation approaches. DHS identifies seven types of exercises whit increasing levels of complexity: discussion based that includes seminars, workshops, tabletops, games; operations based that include drills, functional exercises, and full-scale exercises. HSEEP provides tools and resources to establish self-sustaining exercise programs [10] .\nThe US Department Of Transportation (DOT) has published a literature review about domestic and international evacuation reference materials (plans, policies, procedures, \u2026). DOT reviewed the current guidance for local, State, and Federal agencies regarding evacuations. The review provides a framework of guidance to prepare for and implement a mass evacuation. Documents identify lessons learned and best practices from after-action reports and case studies [5] ."}, {"section_title": "Logical framework approach in evacuation planning process", "text": "Internal evacuation planning process can be organised adopting LFA and its two principal stages: Specific level of target can be defined, based on inputs that are exogenously defined and constitute external factors (or precondition) to implement the plan. If the level of target to pursuing is higher, a major quantity of inputs is necessary. Starting from new quantity of inputs, all plan components have to modified. Evolution target's pursuit of depends on inputs expressed as external factors and the pursuit of the goals. The evolution ends when input finish or goals are pursued (Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Indicators", "text": "The evacuation plan can be evaluated ex ante by means of indicators that can be calculated by applying system of models. In particular:\n\u2022 possible activity indicators could be expressed in terms of times and number of actions to prepare the plan, other than all the activities developed by technical group; \u2022 possible output indicators could be expressed in terms of number of real evacuation tests conducted;\n\u2022 possible outcome indicators are expressed in terms of evacuation times;\n\u2022 possible goal indicators could be expressed in terms of risk reduction.\nThe same plan can be evaluated ex post by means of real evacuation tests measures, with a monitoring system re-calculating in ex post conditions, the same activity, output, outcome and goal indicators calculated ex ante."}, {"section_title": "Means of verification", "text": "Means of verification of evacuation plan can be represented by methods and models available in literature or Decision Support System (DSS) developed to support evacuation Planning.\nThere are means of verification for each component of an evacuation plan according to LFA and in particular:\n\u2022 possible activity means of verification could be database that collects to simulate effects of evacuations or exercises; for instance methods and models resulting from the SICURO project [23] or DSS developed in USA to support evacuation planning;\n\u2022 possible goal means of verification could be specific for each risk component."}, {"section_title": "External factors", "text": "External factors in the emergency planning process can be represented by a set of elements of uncertainty that characterize the context in which evacuation procedures are activated (for instance meteorological conditions, bad functioning of means of communications, unexpected events).\nEach plan components can have external factors that determine effects that can modify the next component.\nAll plan components depends on available inputs. The input in evacuation planning can be expressed in terms of quantity of material and immaterial available resources to implement evacuation procedures. If the quantity of available inputs is modified, all components, logically connected, have to be reassessed ( Figure 2 ). The iterative process ends when end the starting resources allocated, or when the target relative to goals is obtained."}, {"section_title": "Study case of evacuation planning process", "text": "Methods and models resulting from the SICURO project are applied to verify the Local Civil Protection Plan (LCPP) of Melito Porto Salvo in the province of Reggio Calabria in Italy (study area). By adopting the project guidelines, the plan is tested for a specific event that involves part of the municipal area. The scenario simulated concerns an incident involving a tank transporting hazardous goods which, on a workday morning (8.00 am -12 noon), is leaking. Starting from the instant in which the presence of a potentially disastrous event is announced, the Mayor decides that the surrounding area must be evacuated.\nA subset of results from the SICURO project is reported in [25] and [26] , with the estimation of ex ante and the monitoring of ex post indicators of evacuation planning, according to the LFA.\nThe emergency planning process in the Municipality complies with Italian law [13] . In the Provincial Civil Protection Plan (PPPC) of Reggio Calabria, Melito Porto Salvo is listed as a Mixed Operative Centre. Hence the Municipality draws up a Local Civil Protection Plan (LCPP).\nThe municipal area covers about 35,300 ha, the urban centre covers about 50ha. In the municipal area there are 10,483 residents and 2,432 workers. After the event, based on information about the type and quantity of hazardous goods, the Mayor identifies an area of about 4.3 ha. In this area, on an average working day morning, 255 residents and 225 employers, teachers and scholars are present.\nIn the case of the scenario simulated, the Mayor implemented interventions of the LCCP plan for the partial municipal area.\nTwo evacuation tests are carried out (I test ; II test). In the I test the town hall and school buildings are involved. In the II test, besides public buildings, private and commercial buildings in the area are involved.\nOutcome and goal indicators are evaluated ex ante, applying methods and models resulting from the SICURO. The same indicators are measured ex post during the two evacuation tests and compared with ex ante evaluation."}, {"section_title": "DSS for LFA", "text": "DSS that integrate analysis of transportation system and project management for planning aren't available in commerce and DSS for planning transportation system with LFA don't exist. Than, in the following, two different typologies of DSS will be analysed.\nStandard DSS to support project management in planning are available (section 4.1).\nSeveral commercial DSS could be used to analyse a transportation system in ordinary condition or forced to analyse traffic system in emergency condition. Specific DSS are projected to support emergency planning (section 4.2)."}, {"section_title": "DSS for project management in emergency planning", "text": "In recent years some software to support project management and LFA have been developed. Among principal, it's need to refer: "}, {"section_title": "DSS for emergency planning", "text": "Different commercial DSS are available to analyse transportation system in ordinary condition. Among principal we can recall: EMME/2, TransCAD, VISUM, CUBE. Some of these software can be adapted to analyse transportation system in emergency condition. More specifically, micro simulation programs can be used to analyse traffic system in evacuation planning. One example is Dynasmart-X, which provides estimates of network traffic conditions, predictions of network flow patterns over the near and medium terms in relation to different interventions. Another example is CORSIM, that is a microscopic traffic simulator of traffic and traffic control systems using commonly accepted vehicle and driver behavior models. CORSIM combines two of the most widely used traffic simulation models, NETSIM for surface streets, and FRESIM for freeways.\nSpecific software is designed to support emergency planning or single component of a plan (activity, output, outcome or goal) . For instance: MASSVAC (MASS eVACuation) is a simulation model of highway networks to calculate evacuation time; OREMS (Oak Ridge Evacuation Modeling System), is a probabilistic model for a systems approach to evacuation operations; ETIS (Evacuation Traffic Information System) is a tool to monitor highway evacuation processes, to share information during an evacuation to help decision makers make adjustments in their evacuation routing [4] ; HURREVAC (HURRicane EVACuation) is an hurricane evacuation decision-making tools that estimate clearance times to help determine when and if evacuations should begin [12] ; SLOSH Model (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) that allows to predict specific event (e.g. storm surge) [4] ; HAZUS-MH (Multi-Hazards U.S. Software) is a tool to predict the impacts of disasters to buildings and infrastructures (bridges, galleries, ...) from various hazards; CATS (Consequence Assessment Tool Set) / Joint Assessment of Catastrophic Events (JACE) is a tool to estimate damage and assists emergency managers to develop mitigation strategies [4] ; MitigationPlan.com System to identify hazards that could impact their community and the need for an evacuation; Abbreviated Transportation Models (ATM) to estimate the number of people and vehicles that will be evacuating each jurisdiction under various storm scenarios [19] ."}]
