[{"section_title": "", "text": "Rates of unintended childbearing in the United States are high: Close to half of all pregnancies and roughly onethird of births are unintended. 1, 2 Research suggests that unintended births, and particularly unwanted births, are negatively associated with the health and well-being of women and children, although disagreement exists regarding the causal nature of the relationship. [3] [4] [5] Because of these associations, President Obama' s administration has prioritized reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion. 6 Childbearing intentions vary substantially by two important demographic characteristics: race and ethnicity and relationship status. Although 70% of births to white women are identifi ed as intended, only 56% of births to Hispanic women and 49% of those to black women are. Seventy-seven percent of births to married women are intended, compared with 49% of those to cohabiting women and 36% of those to women who are not cohabiting and have never married. 2 Some of the racial and ethnic differences in childbearing intentions are likely due to variation among groups in the distribution of women by relationship status. However, the meaning and role of various relationship types may differ across racial and ethnic groups, refl ecting disparities in access to social and economic resources and different cultural and social contexts. [7] [8] [9] A woman' s identifi cation of a birth as intended within a certain relationship type, therefore, may also vary by race and ethnicity.\nUsing data from a 2001 birth cohort, we examine whether racial and ethnic differences in childbearing intentions are due, in part, to differences in relationship status at the time of conception, and whether associations between race and ethnicity and childbearing intentions vary by relationship type. Most previous research has focused on childbearing intentions among cohabiting 10 or unmarried 11 women, or has compared married women' s childbearing intentions with those of unmarried women. Instead, we examine differences in childbearing intentions at the time of conception among three groups: married women, cohabiting women and those who are neither married nor cohabiting. Additionally, we examine childbearing intentions across a broad range of racial and ethnic groups: whites, blacks, native-born Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics and Asians. We pay particular attention to nativity status among Hispanic women because of substantial differences between native-and foreign-born women in the prevalence and meaning of marriage and cohabitation; these differences may be obscured when Hispanics are looked at as a whole. 7 ,9,12,13 BACKGROUND Unintended births are those identifi ed as unwanted (i.e., the mother did not want to have any more births at any time in the future) or mistimed (i.e., the birth occurred earlier than the mother desired). Unwanted and mistimed births are often distinguished from one another because they generally occur at different times in a woman' s life and because unwanted births tend to be more strongly correlated with negative outcomes than are mistimed births. 14, 15 Also, the proportions of unintended births that are unwanted and mistimed vary by race and ethnicity and by relationship status. 2, 11, 16 For example, unintended births are more likely to be unwanted among black and unmarried women than among white and married women. 16 In this article, we examine unintended births as a whole, but we also separate unwanted from mistimed births.\nRelationship status shapes a woman' s perception about the acceptability of a birth; 11 historically, social norms have dictated that childbearing should occur within marriage. 17 However, childbearing has become increasingly separated from marriage, albeit to a greater extent among some subgroups (black and Hispanic women) than others (white and Asian women). 18 In addition, the relationship status of unmarried mothers at the time of birth varies by race and ethnicity; more than 60% of nonmarital births to white and Hispanic women occur in cohabiting unions, while 70% of all births to black women occur outside of coresidential unions. 19 Mirroring these demographic variations, a growing body of work suggests that the acceptability of childbearing within a specifi c relationship status varies across racial and ethnic groups. 7, 8, 10, 11 In contrast to white women, who tend to view cohabitation as a stepping-stone to marriage, Hispanic and black women may view it as an alternative to marriage or as an appropriate setting for family formation and childrearing. 9, 13 One likely reason is the socioeconomic disadvantage that black and Hispanic women experience; low-income couples often cite economic and social barriers to marriage and choose to remain in cohabiting or visiting relationships. 20, 21 Among Hispanics, a cultural orientation that is more tolerant of cohabitation may also play a role, particularly for the foreign-born; 13 consensual unions have a long and well-established history in Latin America, and they tend to operate similarly to marriages, sharing, to some extent, the same social recognition, economic responsibilities and family formation behaviors. 22 Cohabiting Hispanic women are more likely than cohabiting white women both to have an intended pregnancy and to give birth. 10, 11 Additionally, Hispanic 10 and black 23 women are more likely than white women to continue cohabiting following a pregnancy. Interestingly, the instability of cohabiting unions with children, relative to marital unions with children, is substantially greater for white parents than for black and Mexican-American parents (who compose the bulk of the Hispanic population in the United States). 7 In fact, among foreign-born Mexican-American parents, cohabiting relationships are as stable as marriages. 7 For these reasons, to the extent that black and Hispanic women are more likely than women of other racial and ethnic groups to view cohabiting unions as an acceptable domain for childbearing, we expect black and Hispanic women to be more likely than white women to have intended births in cohabiting unions. In addition, we expect intendedness within cohabiting unions to be higher for foreign-born than native-born Hispanics.\nRacial and ethnic differences in social norms may also be important. Engaging in nonnormative behavior is often stigmatized. 24 However, because the proportion of births that occur outside of coresidential unions is substantially higher among black women (70% in 2001) than among Hispanics (30%) or whites (15%), 19 the stigma of such births may be much less pronounced for blacks than for other groups. Qualitative research suggests that black women (poor ones, in particular) attribute great social and emotional value to childbearing, despite the high levels of uncertainty surrounding their romantic relationships. 25 Similarly, although Hispanic women (particularly the foreign-born) have lower levels of noncoresidential fertility than blacks, they are often characterized as especially family-and child-oriented. 8, 13 Women who have children outside of coresidential unions often rely on others, such as parents and siblings, for fi nancial and social support, and the amount and type of support they receive may vary across racial and ethnic groups. 13, 26 If black and Hispanic women outside of coresidential unions experience less stigma than other women when bearing children or receive higher levels of childrearing support, then they may be more likely than their counterparts from other racial and ethnic groups to have an intended birth. We have no a priori expectations, however, regarding the relative proportions of unwanted and mistimed noncoresidential births.\nLastly, we expect racial and ethnic variation in childbearing intentions within marriage. Not only do black women have higher levels of socioeconomic disadvantage than most other women, but their experience of marriage differs from whites' in ways that make the union fundamentally less stable and more stressful. First, black women experience higher levels of marital dissolution than do white and Hispanic women 27 and, correspondingly, are more likely to think that marriages will break up. 28 Second, compared with other racial and ethnic groups, blacks report higher levels of distrust and strain between the sexes (including within married couples); they also report greater ambiguity surrounding family roles. 25, 28 Third, black men and women have the highest levels of multiple-partner fertility, 29 which is associated with reduced levels of social support and elevated levels of union dissolution. 30 As a result of these factors, births to married black women may be more likely than those to married women of other races and ethnicities to be identifi ed as unwanted or mistimed.\nHispanic women may also differ from white and other women. They, too, have high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage; moreover, as mentioned previously, Hispanic women tend to be very pro-family and pro-child. To the extent that this is true, we expect levels of unintended births to be lower for married Hispanic women than for married white women, net of other factors. However, it is also possible that the risk of unintended births is elevated among Hispanic women, including those who are married, because of limited access to birth control or cultural barriers to birth control use."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "Asian-Americans are conspicuously absent from the discussion above. Few studies have examined patterns of family formation among Asian-Americans, 32,33 and none have looked at childbearing intentions. In general, Asian immigrants are characterized as placing a high value on marriage and family. 8, 34 While this depiction masks much diversity among the more than 20 Asian immigrant populations in the United States, as well as across generations within specifi c ethnic groups, 34 as a whole Asian-Americans exhibit fairly traditional family patterns. They have high rates of marriage, tend to marry at an older age than do members of other groups and have the lowest levels of marital disruption (divorce or separation). 27 Additionally, they have the lowest levels of teenage and nonmarital childbearing and the oldest age at fi rst birth. 33, 35 First-generation AsianAmericans, who make up the bulk of the Asian-American population, have the lowest levels of cohabitation in the United States, although rates increase fairly quickly across generations. 32 We expect unintended childbearing to be lower than average among married Asian women and higher than average among Asian women outside of marital unions.

Data were obtained from birth certifi cates and from interviews and self-administered questionnaires completed by mothers when their focal child was approximately nine months old.\nOur study sample comprised 10,000 biological mothers \u2020 who resided with their focal child and participated in the interview, and for whom valid sample weights were available. We excluded 900 women because we could not determine their relationship type at conception or because data on their childbearing intentions were unavailable.

Those who had been using contraceptives were asked, \"At the time you became pregnant with your baby, did you yourself actually want to have a baby at some time?\" Response options were \"yes,\" \"no\" and \"not sure.\" Women who said they were not sure were asked, \"It is sometimes diffi cult to recall these things but, just before that pregnancy began, would you say you probably wanted a(nother) baby at some time or probably not?\" Possible responses were \"probably yes,\" \"probably no\" and \"didn't care.\" Women who responded \"probably yes\" were then asked, \"Did you become pregnant sooner than you wanted, later than you wanted, or at about the right time?\"\nWe classifi ed a pregnancy as intended if it was identifi ed as wanted and had occurred on time or later, or if it had occurred after the mother had stopped using contraceptives in the hope of becoming pregnant. A pregnancy that had occurred sooner than desired was coded as mistimed. If a respondent reported that she had not wanted to have a baby when she became pregnant with the focal child, the pregnancy was coded as unwanted, as were pregnancies among mothers who were unsure if they had wanted the pregnancy and reported in follow-up questions that they probably had not wanted the pregnancy or had not cared. These measures closely match those used in other studies. 17, 18, 24 In our fi rst set of analyses, we used a dichotomous measure to indicate whether the birth resulted from an unintended or an intended pregnancy. In the second set, we used a categorical variable that distinguished among births resulting from intended, mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. For clarity, we refer to childbearing intentions in reference to births rather than to pregnancies, because the ECLS-B collects data on childbearing intentions for a birth cohort.\nA mother' s relationship status at conception was defi ned in relation to the child' s biological father; mothers were categorized as married, cohabiting or neither married nor cohabiting.

Consistent with 2004 census data, \u2020 37 the vast majority of Asian mothers in our sample (89%) were foreign-born, but only small proportions of black (9%) and white (4%) mothers were. Sample limitations also precluded our looking at Hispanics by country of origin.\nThe analyses controlled for several maternal characteristics: education (categorized as either a high school degree or less vs. at least some college education); employment status in the year before the focal child' s birth (worked at all versus did not); age at the child' s birth; and, as a proxy for cultural values, frequency of religious service attendance (never, once or twice a year, several times a year, once or twice a month, or weekly or more). We controlled for parity using a dichotomous variable indicating whether the focal child was the mother' s fi rst. Our marital history measure indicated whether the mother had previously been married to a man other than the child' s biological father. We included three controls for the mother' s family background: childhood family structure (whether the mother had resided with both biological parents until age 16), parental education (whether at least one of her parents had more than a high school diploma or the equivalent) and childhood welfare receipt (whether her family had ever received welfare before she was 16). 16 Finally, we included three measures of father' s characteristics, drawn from the birth certifi cate or the mother' s survey: age at the child' s birth, education (categorized as per the mother' s) and whether the father' s race and ethnicity differed from the mother' s.

The relationships between background characteristics and childbearing intentions were generally in the expected directions: Maternal characteristics associated with elevated odds of an unintended birth were having worked in the year prior to birth (1.2), having been 29 or younger at the child' s birth (1.5-2.6) and having had a prior birth (1.5); paternal characteristics associated with elevated odds of an unintended birth were having been younger than 25 at the child' s birth (1.7) and being of a different race and ethnicity from the mother (1.4).

The association is similar among married women, but not among mothers in other relationship types. Therefore, the difference between black and white women at the population level appears to be driven in part by differences in childbearing intentions among married women. Given that a smaller proportion of black women than of white women marry, the effects of the differences in unintendedness between them must be fairly large.\nHowever, analyses of the individual components of childbearing intentions reveal more complex differences between black and white mothers. Our multinomial models suggest that blacks in both married and noncoresidential unions are more likely than whites to have an unwanted versus an intended birth. These fi ndings are consistent with those of previous research indicating that in general, blacks are more likely than whites to have unwanted births and whites are more likely than blacks to have mistimed births. 2 Our research further suggests, however, that among married women, blacks have higher levels than whites not only of unwanted births, but also of mistimed births. The elevated odds of unwanted births among married and noncoresidential black mothers may be due in part to economic or relationship stresses that were not directly measured in this study, or to the more limited marriage opportunities among blacks. 11, 25, 28 The fi ndings may also refl ect the greater uncertainty or instability of relationships among blacks. 25 Likewise, higher levels of unwantedness among blacks may be due to ambivalence about childbearing and to lack of contraceptive use among unmarried and cohabiting couples, whose pregnancies are frequently neither planned nor actively prevented. 39 In addition, the elevated odds of unwanted childbearing among black women may refl ect, in part, racial differences in women' s willingness to terminate unwanted pregnancies.

However, both native-and foreignborn Hispanic mothers who were married at the time of conception had higher odds of an unintended birth than did white married mothers. The results of the multinomial regression analysis suggest that these differences are likely driven by mistimed births and may be limited to foreignborn Hispanics.\nAmong cohabiting women and those outside of a coresidential union at the time of conception, nativeborn Hispanics and whites had similar odds of reporting an unintended birth. On the other hand, foreign-born Hispanics who were cohabiting at the time of conception had lower odds than white cohabiting women of reporting an unintended birth.

Several factors may explain this fi nding. First, common-law marriages are an established tradition and are very prevalent in Latin American countries, where women' s reproductive behavior is similar in formal unions and informal unions. 22, 41 Moreover, the characteristics of cohabiting unions among foreign-born Hispanics may differ from those among their native-born counterparts and among whites. Another possibility is that the relationship quality of foreign-born Hispanics differs from that of others or that the experience of having migrated to the United States helps couples who are not legally wed to bond in ways that facilitate family formation. Unfortunately, data on relationship and socioeconomic characteristics at the time of conception are not available in the ECLS-B, so we could not explore these issues.\nThe differences between foreign-born and native-born Hispanic cohabiting mothers suggest that as Hispanics become acculturated, the meanings they ascribe to cohabitation may come to resemble those among whites and blacks. 13 In addition, reports of childbearing intentions may be more subject to social desirability bias among foreign-born Hispanics-most of whom have emigrated from countries whose culture and religion venerate motherhood-than among native-born Hispanics. 13 Indeed, motherhood and children are highly valued in Catholicism, which plays a prominent role in Latin American countries. As a result, foreign-born Hispanics may be more inclined than their native-born counterparts to report an unintended birth as having been mistimed rather than unwanted. However, religious attendance (the only variable in the data set related to cultural and religious values) did not attenuate the relationship between nativity and childbearing intentions. Our fi ndings also underscore the importance of recognizing the diversity of the Hispanic population within the United States. Table 4 were also included in these models. ref=reference category.

This is surprising, given that Asians appear to adhere to a traditional conservative culture. Perhaps the unmarried Asians in our sample were more likely than their married counterparts to be third-or later-generation immigrants and have adopted mainstream views on cohabitation and nonmarital childbearing. Because Chinese make up one of the largest groups of Asian-Americans in the United States, 37 and because the large majority of Asians in our sample were foreign-born, the elevated likelihood of reporting unwanted births may refl ect a strong preference for male children 42 or a carryover of China' s one-child policy.

First, our sample included only pregnancies that resulted in live births. Additionally, our measure of childbearing intentions may have been subject to the bias inherent in retrospective reports of childbearing intentions. 42 Such bias may have been exacerbated by our use of a cohort of live births and of intentions data collected relatively soon after the child' s birth, when women have a reduced likelihood of labeling a birth unintended. However, the overall fi ndings are consistent with those of other studies and are contrary to what we would expect if respondents were providing socially desirable responses. Another limitation is that childbearing intentions may be more nuanced than our discrete categories allowed; 43 such intentions may be better measured on a continuum that refl ects the ambivalence that many couples voice. 21 Moreover, differences in the interpretation and applicability of current questions used to measure childbearing intentions may vary by race and ethnicity. 14 "}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Our fi ndings have several policy implications. Because unintended births, particularly those that are unwanted, are associated with poor outcomes for couples and children, 4,5 our fi ndings underscore the need to improve access to family planning to help prevent unwanted and mistimed births among couples of all racial and ethnic groups and relationship types. Applicable programs should be tailored to a woman' s relationship type and should recognize the extent to which her relationship status may shape the meaning and implications of childbearing. That differences in unintended births between Asians and whites and between blacks and whites were limited to married women speaks to the need for programs and services that broaden their focus beyond unmarried women and other groups traditionally considered at high risk for unintended childbearing. The especially high rates of unwanted births among blacks in all relationship categories indicate the need to address the unique cultural and economic issues of this population. More generally, our fi ndings suggest that each relationship type may warrant unique program and clinic approaches to help reduce unintended pregnancy.\nThe results of this study point to several avenues for future research. First, our fi ndings, coupled with those of others, suggest a need to better understand the meanings associated with childbearing intentions of whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and others, and how these meanings may vary among relationship types. This is particularly important given the especially high rates of unwanted and nonmarital fertility among blacks, the current immigration patterns among both Hispanics and Asians, and the high rates of fertility among Hispanics. 13 Additional research is also needed to identify factors that help explain why rates of unwanted births are higher among blacks than whites, particularly among married women. In addition, research should examine the differences in the meaning of cohabitation across racial and ethnic groups and by nativity status. Indeed, our fi ndings suggest the potential value of examining whether actively planned pregnancies within cohabiting relationships are more likely to occur among foreign-born Hispanic women than among native-born Hispanics and women of other racial and ethnic groups; such research would provide insights into the meaning of cohabitation and childbearing across these groups. Further work is needed on the fertility and childbearing patterns of Asians, about which little is known. Lastly, it is important to remember that the meanings of marriage and cohabitation have changed dramatically during the past two to three decades, and are still changing. Thus, the associations between relationship status and birth intentions will likely continue to change, albeit at a different pace for different groups of women."}]
