Genes involved in the production of Ab cause autosomal dominantly inherited forms of AD (Price and Sisodia, 1998) . The genetic etiology of late-onset AD is more complex and includes a great deal of missing heritability according to current approximations (Bertram et al., 2010) .\nThe driving theoretical framework of AD over the past decade has been built around the Ab cascade. The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that the disease process is initiated by Ab formation leading to downstream pathologies and neurodegeneration (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002) . Within such a framework, amyloid pathology precedes tau pathology and would have to drive its formation in some way. As nicely reviewed by Ittner and G\u00f6tz (2010) , there is substantial evidence that such a causal relationship does exist. However, other evidence has suggested that tau and amyloid pathology may arise independently, with upstream genetic interactions causing both pathologies through separate defects in distinct molecular pathways (Small and Duff, 2008) . In either scenario, genes that confer risk for tau pathology may also confer risk for amyloid pathology through complex epistatic relationships. The current project sought to identify such interaction effects, primarily focusing on the tau kinases that have recently been implicated in both pathologic pathways.\nOne such kinase that has been implicated in both tau and amyloid pathology is glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 has been implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation, subsequent neurodegeneration (Lucas et al., 2001 ) and amyloid accumulation (Martin et al., 2013) . Moreover, GSK-3 appears to regulate Ab production (Phiel et al., 2003) , and silencing GSK-3 leads to reduced plaque and tangle formation in transgenic mouse models of AD (Hurtado et al., 2012) . These findings have led to the GSK-3 hypothesis that suggests overactivity of GSK-3 can account for cognitive impairments, the pathologic cascade, and the neuroinflammatory response characteristic of AD (Hooper et al., 2008) .\nIn addition to GSK-3, 2 other tau kinases have been implicated in both amyloid and tau pathology. As reviewed previously (Martin et al., 2013) , knock-down of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) results in reduced tau pathology in transgenic AD models (Piedrahita et al., 2010) , and the CDK5-related tau cascade appears to be activated by Ab (Lopes et al., 2010) . Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) phosphorylates both tau and APP (Martin et al., 2013; Ryoo et al., 2008) and has been related to the pathologic cascades of tau and Ab (Wegiel et al., 2011) . In addition, there has been some evidence that phosphorylation of tau by DYRK1A leads to additional tau phosphorylation by GSK-3, ultimately resulting in hyperphosphorylation (Liu et al., 2008) .\nThe aim of the current study was to identify epistatic relationships between genes coding tau kinases and genes previously associated with amyloid deposition. We hypothesized that genes coding GSK-3 and comparable tau kinases would modify genetic risk for amyloid plaque pathology."}, {"section_title": "Methods and materials", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

Finally we included the SNP-SNP interaction term to see how much additional variance was explained by the interaction term beyond these known predictors of amyloid deposition.\nGender, age, and diagnosis were entered into the model first and accounted for 12% of variance in amyloid deposition. Next, APOE status was entered into the model and accounted for an additional 18% of variance. Four separate hierarchical linear regression models were run across the 4 significant interactions.

As reported in Haploreg (Ward and Kellis, 2012) , this SNP is 20 kb 5 0 from GSK3b; it acts as a strong enhancer in a variety of cell lines, including epithelial cells, skeletal muscle myoblasts, and lung fibroblasts among others; it has been shown to bind with 4 transcription factors in ENCODE tracks, including FOXA, POL2, and STAT3; and it has been shown to alter the p300 regulatory motif p300_known1 identified using position weigh matrix techniques. This suggests that this SNP is in a highly active genetic region and may regulate gene expression or otherwise play an active role in GSK3b function. In addition, rs334543 is in a DNase-I hypersensitivity uniform peak in an astrocyte cell line, suggesting this SNP may be functionally active in the brain (Rosenbloom et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Glycogen synthase kinase3B and amyloid burden", "text": "The first interaction in which the minor allele in GSK3b (rs334543) was related to high levels of amyloid deposition was a GSK3b x APP interaction. Although only 6 subjects were homozygote carriers of both the APP and GSK3b minor alleles (Fig. 1) , none of the subjects were statistical outliers in amyloid deposition with each falling between 1.4 and 1.8 mean SUVR. Previous research has suggested that GSK3b might play a role in APP processing. A GSK-3 blocker, lithium, has been shown to decrease amyloid burden in APP mice, and the effect appears to be driven by GSK3b, given that genetic modification of GSK3b mimics this effect (Su et al., 2004) . Additional evidence has suggested that modulation of GSK3b activity reduces APP phosphorylation and amyloid load (Rockenstein et al., 2007) . In the present study, the effect of GSK3b was only present in carriers of the APP (rs457581) minor allele, and neither SNP showed a main effect in conferring risk for amyloid when the interaction term was excluded. This may suggest that slight increases in GSK3b activity are only related to a negative outcome when APP is overexpressed as well, perhaps via the increased phosphorylation of APP suggested previously (Rockenstein et al., 2007) . Regardless of the exact mechanism, the observed interaction adds additional support to a GSK3b-APP relationship that appears to have a meaningful impact on risk for amyloid burden in vivo.\nThe other 2 significant interactions were between GSK3b and APBB2. In both cases, the strongest effect of GSK3b was present in homozygous carriers of the A allele for these SNPs (Figs. 2 and 3) , although the A allele was actually the major allele for rs2585590 (54% frequency). These 2 APBB2 SNPs are in low linkage disequilibrium in the 1000 Genomes data set (r 2 \u00bc 0.\nleaving open the possibility that the same signal is driving both effects. However, the 2 SNPs did appear to differ slightly in terms of their interaction effect (Figs. 2 and 3 ). The interaction with rs2585590 was particularly interesting because it appeared that GSK3b homozygous minor allele carriers showed especially low amyloid burden in homozygous carriers of the APBB2 A allele and especially high amyloid burden in homozygous carriers of the G allele. We would suggest that this may be due to the role GSK-3 plays in both APP processing and the neuroinflammatory response system. In certain scenarios, the increased cytokine production and microglial response driven by GSK-3 (Woodgett and Ohashi, 2005 ) might have beneficial effects by decreasing amyloid load through microglial phagocytosis (Rogers et al., 2002) . However, when GSK-3 activity is overactive in the presence of overexpressed APP, any beneficial effects of an early proinflammatory response fail to clear amyloid fast enough, ultimately resulting primarily in the damaging side effects of neuroinflammation and failure to substantially reduce the aggregation of amyloid deposits. Such a hypothetical model is particularly relevant to the APBB2 \u00c2 GSK3b interaction because APBB2 appears to drive the intracellular production of both APP and GSK-3. The gene product of APBB2 is a member of the FE65 protein family, which interacts with the amyloid intracellular domain (AICD) and ultimately has an effect on APP processing (McLoughlin and Miller, 2008) . Moreover, the AICD-FE65 interaction appears to have an effect on GSK3 activity in that the AICD modulates (increases) GSK-3 activity, but only when bound by FE65 (Ryan and Pimplikar, 2005) . In the present results, variation in APBB2 may ultimately influence the probability of FE65 binding to the AICD and thus influence whether APP becomes overexpressed and whether GSK-3 becomes overactive. When FE65 binding to AICD is reduced (perhaps in homozygous carriers of the A allele in either of these 2 APBB2 SNPs), the slightly increased GSK3b expression related to minor allele status in rs334543 is actually beneficial. However, when the FE65-AICD complex is more prevalent, perhaps in rs2585590 G/G carriers, the slightly increased GSK3b expression becomes damaging in the presence of increased APP, and the additional GSK-3 activity driven by the FE65-AICD complex."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "This article has highlighted a potential gene-gene interaction in support of the GSK-3 hypothesis of AD. The strengths of the current analyses include the well-characterized sample, a validated, disease-relevant quantitative phenotype, and consistent interaction effects observed across 2 independent cohorts. However, this study is not without limitations. Although consistent effects were observed across independent subsets in ADNI, a true replication sample from an additional data source with GWAS and PET data will be necessary to confirm our findings. This is especially relevant given the relative low cell counts present when performing interaction analyses, although the consistency in the present analysis in the fewer minor allele homozygotes is encouraging. Our 2 subsamples also included slight differences in clinical characteristics. The ADNI-1 sample in our analysis included fewer MCI and mild MCI subjects relative to ADNI-2/GO. In the case of the APP \u00c2 GSK3b interaction, the trend level effect in ADNI-1 may indeed be driven by the discrepancy in MCI subjects relative to the other categories. The observed effects do appear to be driven by an effect in the MCI cohort in all cases when stratifying across diagnostic categories, but a larger sample of each group is necessary to test for a 3-way interaction (diagnosis \u00c2 APP \u00c2 GSK3b). Moreover, because all AV-45 PET scans were conducted as part of ADNI-GO (about 6 years after ADNI-1 was initiated), subjects who were genotyped in ADNI-1 and received an AV-45 PET scan had been in the study longer and might have introduced a form of survivor bias into the ADNI-1 subsample. The other main weakness of this study is the lack of data demonstrating the function of the implicated SNPs. Although bioinformatics methods were used to annotate findings based on known or predicted function, additional molecular experiments verifying the functional relationships between these genes, and these SNPs more specifically, is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Future directions", "text": "The biologically plausible mechanism implicated in this study suggests some possible avenues for future exploration.
