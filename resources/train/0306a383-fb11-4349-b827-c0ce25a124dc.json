[{"section_title": "Gender and Social Studies Learning", "text": "in the 8th, 10th, and 12th Grades Policy Issues: Gender and Citizenship Participation One of the most important goals for the social studies has always been for all students to participate in the democratic process (Engle & Ochoa, 1988) and the researcher shares this perspective. Historically, the public schools have been assigned the mission of preparing students for citizenship. Diverse meanings exists on what is citizenship education (Gay, 1997;Gross & Dynneson, 1991;Kaltsounis, 1997;Newmann, 1989;Parker, 1997;Van Sledright & Grant, 1991) plus differing definitions of \"acceptable\" levels of participation--active vs. passive, group vs. individual, voting vs. larger community participation--cause dilemmas in the field of civic education. However, almost everyone accepts the definition of a \"good\" citizen as a minimum is one who votes. The effectiveness of school social studies courses in promoting civic participation, especially the civics or goverment courses, has had a long history based on convenience samples. But in recent years there has been relatively little work comparing course subject matter to civics knowledge and participation. Only Niemi and Junn (1993) have used data of the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) suggesting that the school and the civics curriculum are influential in terms of the political awareness and attitudes of U. S. 12th graders. More attention now being given service learning to improve civic education, but a question arises on why do males consistently outperform females on standardized tests of social studies achievement? NAEP assessments in History (U. S. Department of Education, 1996) and 4 Geography (U. S. Department of Education, 1995) as well as the NELS:88 (National Longitudinal Study of 1988) cognitive social studies tests showed that males obtain overall higher test scores. The 1994 NAEP average U. S. History scale scores indicated that at the 4th grade there were no significant differences except that Black females scores higher than Black males. There were no significant differences in the 8th or 12th grades except Hispanic males scored higher than Hispanic females in the grade 12. However, if the test is broken into categories of achievement levels, the percentage of twelfth-grade males at or above Proficient and Basic levels is higher than the percentage of females. The NAEP 1994 Geography assessment showed even more striking gender differences with 4th and 8th grade males more likely than females to score at or above the Proficient level and at the Advanced Level. At 12th grade, males were more likely than females to score at or above the Basic level and at or above the Proficient level. These gender differences are occurring even though typically males and females take the same number of required social studies courses and social studies courses are less likely to be tracked than other academic courses. Yet data from three National Longitudinal Studies, 1972, 1980, (National Center for Educational Statistics (1995a, 1995b indicate that female seniors have participated more than males in student government in all three time periods of assessment. Higher female student government participation parallels the young female adult national voting patterns of more participation than males (Costello & Kringold, 1996). This raises the question of whether higher test scores in history, geography, and the NELS:88 social studies tests are really the best 5 predictor of actual adult civic participation. However, in all three time periods, 1972, 1980, 1988, high socioeconomic status, academic high school program, and high test scores in math and reading were associated with increased participation in student government. These data parallel the general adult pattern of higher civic and voting participation for those with more income and education."}, {"section_title": "Objectives/Research Questions", "text": "Research studies using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) in science and mathematics education have shown the value of analysis and breaking the achievement tests into different parts (Burkam et al, 1997, Hamilton et al, 1995, Kupermintz et al, 1995, Kupermintz & Snow, 1997, Lee et al, 1996, Nussbaum & Snow, 1997. The distinctiveness of affects in specific school subjects has also been examined (March & Yeung, 1996). Research Question 1. Achievement Gaps Increase. It was expected that the gaps in gender performance on the social studies tests would increase over time. Research Question 2. Ability. Are gender differences on the social studies test differentiated by the students' ability level? It was predicted that gender differences would be the largest for the most able students. Research Question 3. Students' Views on Social Studies. Three student affect questions (looking forward to, anxiety about social studies, and perceived usefulness) were examined and compared to test results. It was hypothesized that females would not report as high positive ratings on these three items as males. These three affect questions were only found in the 8' grade student questionnaires but other questions at the 10th grade also offered the opportunity for students to 6 evaluate their social studies classes. Research Question 4. Extracurricular Activities. What is the relationship of participation in student government and community service to the test scores? Long Range Research Questions. My long-range goals in using NELS:88 data are as follows: (1) to follow-up on the effects of student achievement and student government/community service on the voting patterns and community participation of young adults after they leave high school; (2) to divide the test items into two categories (history and citizenship) to see if females do better on the citizenship test items; (3) to check instructional factors by using teachers' class descriptions and student responses.

American history questions addressed important issues and events in political and economic history from colonial times through the recent past. Citizenship items included questions on the working of the federal government and the rights and obligations of citizens. The geography questions touched on patterns of settlement and food production shared by other societies as well as our own."}, {"section_title": "Psychometric Properties of the Test", "text": "There is a long history of critics of large scale educational testing. However, it is wishful thinking to ignore the relevance of scores on well-designed standardized tests. In addition, researchers have presented insightful methodology for better analyzing large-scale data (Kupermintz et al, 1995, Hamilton & al, 1995. Rock and Pollack (1991)  At each of the three grade levels, the standardized social studies test with the median of 50 was chosen for analysis because of its finer detail; the other choice was using the test divided into quartiles. There were significant gender achievement gaps favoring males at the higher achievement levels at all three grade levels; this is about the top 15% of students (Table 2). For 1 0 low-scoring students, approximately the bottom 15% of students, there were more males than females in the 8\" and 10\" grades with low test scores. By the 12\" grade, however, there were no significance gender differences for low scoring students perhaps partly reflecting higher dropout rates for males; the dropout rate for the sample was about 12% by 1992. Females were more concentrated at the middle level scores at all three grade levels. With a higher concentration of males in the high scoring category and in the lower scoring category with the exception of the 12th grade, males generally manifested a wider spread in achievement. The gap or the difference in achievement between females and males did not increase from the 8\" to the 12th grade in any of the three ability levels of the tests with the exception of 12th grade males in the low-scoring category who improved. But one caution should be noted. The analysis in Table 2  problem just to written questionnaires. Interviews and observations are subject to the same problems of validity and reliability. Here are some of the concerns. What interpretation should be made about the students who did not fill out the specific question, item-level nonresponse? Some students did not answered every question in the survey. This may be due to inability or unwillingness to give correct information, differences in interpreting questions, or ambiguous definitions. On more sensitive questions such as drug usage, there is a tendency for some students to skip such items. It has also been noted that students often are not accurate about what courses they have taken in the past. They may over report participation in athletics or other activities. Response sets are also another area of interest. African American students tend to take more extreme position, strongly agree or strongly disagree, than other students. However, the NELS:88 data with its rich, wide variety of sources does offer some checks. In many cases, it is possible to use transcripts, parent, teacher, and administrators responses to check students' responses. While one should always be aware of the limitations of the data, the strength of the NELS:data is the large samples where sampling errors are generally minimal except when estimates are made for relatively small subpopulations, such as for American Indians. For this reason, American Indians were not included in analysis in this paper."}, {"section_title": "Students' Views on the Social Studies", "text": "The three affect questions for the 8' grade students were written as follows: I usually look forward to social studies class I often am afraid to ask questions in social studies class Social studies will be useful in my future. 1 4 Students were also asked the same three questions for math, science, and English with a total of 12 affect questions on academic subjects. It was assumed that these questions were not highly sensitive and that students answered honestly. In comparison with the other three academic subject areas, for the question, \"I look forward to ...,\" science was the most popular class followed by social studies in second place. In a similar manner, for the question \"I am afraid to ask questions ...,\" students in science class were least afraid of asking questions with second place by social studies. However, in terms of seeing social studies useful in my future, social studies was definitely in the fourth and last place (Table   6). This low rating for usefulness may help to explain the low ratings that students have traditionally given to the social studies. The majority of 8th grade students looked forward to the social studies class (55.8% strongly agree and agree) and were not anxious about asking questions in class (80%) , but, 8th grade students, in comparison with other academic subjects, did not see as much usefulness in the future for social studies classes. In this paper, comparisons were made between females and males within a given racial/ethnic group since just using the broad categories of female and male tended to hide some of the differences previously reported in the research. However, the primary focus was not the comparisons between the various racial/ethnic groups; achievement gaps between racial/ethnic groups have been an intense concern for years. It should be noted due to the large samples (Whites with 8,166 females and 8,151 males in the 8' grade) in a few cases even when the same percentage point is given for females and males, there may be significant statistical differences. In \"Looking Forward to Social Studies\" (Table 7) males in all four racial/ethnic groups gave higher ratings than females in almost all of the four response categories (strongly agree, 1 5 agree, etc.) Black males and Black women looked forward to social studies classes more than any other racial/ethnic group. Even putting together the strongly agree and agree categories, Black students still ranked the highest on looking forward to social studies. Note than even in the 8th grade, there were missing responses and for the 8th grade more males were not answering the given question. For the anxiety question (Table 8) on being afraid to ask questions in social studies, 8th grade White and Hispanic females had the highest anxiety. There were no gender differences for Asians in all four response categories (strongly agree, agree, etc) and no differences for Black females and males in the strongly agree and agree categories. As far as the usefulness of social studies in the future (Table 9), Asian and White males gave a statistical significant higher rating in the category of strongly agree to the usefulness of social studies than did females. Collapsing the categories of strongly agree and agree for Hispanics and Blacks showed no gender differences. The three affect questions were then compared to the social studies test scores (Tables 10-15). As expected, students with high test scores (60.-79.99) looked forward to social studies classes more than students with low achievement scores. However, the highest level female achievers (70.-70.99) only 16% marked that they strongly agreed to looking forward to social studies classes compared to 27% males (Tables 10-11). High achievers were also least concerned about asking questions in their social studies class (Tables 12-13). More males with lower achievement scores than females were afraid to ask questions (the strongly agree column) than low achievement females but high female achievers, although few in number, still were more afraid to ask questions than high achieving males."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "In usefulness of social studies in the future (Tables 14-15), examining the \"strongly agree\" column, low achieving females saw social studies as being more useful than high achieving females. However, collapsing the strongly agree and agree responses showed that higher female achievers placed a higher value to the usefulness of social studies than lower female achievers. For males, in contrast, in the strongly agree response the highest scoring males expressed the highest value to the usefulness of social studies in the future. In summary, the analysis by racial/ethnic groups of the three 8fil grade affect questions on social studies denoted many gender differences, typically showing males with more interest in the social studies but in some cases there were no gender differences. In relationship to the scores on the social studies test, in general high achievers, both female and male, were more likely than low achievers to look forward to social studies class, were not as afraid to ask questions, and were more likely to rate the usefulness of social studies as higher than low achieving students. However, there were some exceptions among the ethnic/racial groups. While the three affect questions were not asked in the 10'h grade questionnaire, sophomores were asked the main reason for taking mathematics, science, English, and social studies. The most frequent response for all subject areas was that \"it was required.\" However, one response was that \"I wanted to take it.\" More students in mathematics (25%) and science (24%) marked that they wanted to take it. Social studies was in third place with 15.4% wanting to take it followed closely behind by English at 14.8% wanting to take it. In comparison with the other subject area three other questions at the 10th grade indicated that social studies had the fourth or the lowest ratings of the four subject areas. For the response \"challenged almost every day\" mathematics was the highest with 42.4% with social studies only 1 7 17.9%. For the response \"try hard almost every day\" mathematics was the highest with 45.7% compared to only 27.1% for social studies. And lastly, \"asked to show understanding in history\" (or science, math, English) mathematics had the highest popularity with 31.7% compared to social studies 14.5%. Gender differences on working hard in history class and being challenged almost every day showed some females reporting working harder and being more challenged than males but not in all categories (Tables 16-17). A higher percentage of Asian, Black, and White females compared to males responded that they were almost challenged every day but Hispanic males were higher than Hispanic females. Asian males reported working harder almost every day (31%) than any other male ethnic/racial groups while Black (34%) and White (32%) females were higher than males in the category working hard almost every day. The questions about students' views on the social studies were different at the 8th and 10th grades. However, it would appear that by the 10th grade social studies was not being viewed as favorably as a subject area as compared to the 8th grade."}, {"section_title": "School Experiences Results", "text": "Instruction has great importance in learning social studies. NELS:88 data came from surveys rather than observations but the student reports of their student experiences at the schools they attend can be valuable. In the following section, a variety of variables are examined to identify if there are gender differences and if they might help in explaining the gender differences in social studies test scores."}, {"section_title": "Coursework 1 8", "text": "Only about 4 percent of 1988 eighth graders were not enrolled in a social studies course. However, about a quarter of the 1990 sophomores reported that they were not currently taking a social studies course. It may be that females were 2% to 3% less likely as sophomores to be taking a social studies course but there were conflicting data and there are indications that student reports on what courses they are taking were not always accurate. By sophomore year, world history, the most common offering, had been taken by half or more of the students. The second most common offering after leaving the eighth grade was U. S. History which about onethird of the students had taken. A few other students had taken, geography, government/civics and economics in that order. By the 12th grade, 99 plus percent of high school seniors were enrolled in a social studies class. An analysis should be made of the social studies courses that high school students take to see if the pattern of coursework of females is different from males. To investigate this hypothesis one needs to use NELS:88 transcript data gathered over the full 4 years of high school. This requires a researcher to apply for a license since this is confidential material not available on the public NELS:88 CD-ROM."}, {"section_title": "Accelerated Classes", "text": "In the 8th grade, 23% of the females compared to 25% of the males reported participated in \"advanced, enriched, accelerated\" social studies classes. This approximately 24% of all social studies students reported in accelerated classes was the lowest in the total amount of accelerated classes of the four subject areas: mathematics was the highest with 39%; English (language arts) with 31%; science with 26% and then social studies with 24%. Black females (34%) were the highest of the four female racial/ethnic groups in the reported accelerated social studies classes followed by Asians (31%), Hispanics (24%) and lastly by White females (19%). For males, the highest percent in the reported accelerated social studies classes was Asians (34%), Blacks, (33%), Hispanics (27%), and again last place by White males (22%). Only for White and Hispanic males were there significantly higher numbers of males compared to females in accelerated classes (Table 18). There are probably only small differences in gender in enrollment in accelerated social studies classes but much larger differences according to racial/ethnic groups but more research is needed to confirm this. A higher percentage of Asians and Whites have typically been found in accelerated classes and therefore some of the results of the percentage in accelerated social studies classes was unexpected. I was surprised that the amount of tracking in accelerated social studies classes was as high as reported by students. The 8th grade students appeared to be accurate in reporting that their math classes had the largest number of accelerated classes and that the social studies classes were the least tracked although there is little or no research on the amount of social studies tracking in the 8th grades. What accounts for the relatively low number of Whites, female and male, in accelerated classes and higher numbers than expected for Blacks and Hispanics? Further research is essential in the area of accelerated/tracked classes in the social studies and this can be done using using NELS:88 data; for each student in most cases there are two teacher reports. Teachers' descriptions of their course can be compared to students' description of the class. However, the teachers may be English, science, mathematics, or social studies teachers reducing the teacher sample and the 24% of students reporting accelerated classes reducing the student sample. This would be a subject of another paper."}, {"section_title": "Reading Scores 2 0 20", "text": "Reading the textbook has often played a prominent role in social studies courses. Therefore, reading ability could be expected to be important in achievement on social studies tests. The NELS:88 reading test included social studies content items along with other subject area questions. The 8th reading test given indicated that boys were in the lowest quartile (27% compared to 20% of the females) and females were higher in both the third quartile (25% compared to 23% of males) and the greatest difference was in the highest quartile with 29% of the females compared to 23% of the males. In the 10th grade, females were still in the highest quartile (27% to 23%) and (25% to 21%) in the third quartile. In the 12th grade, females continued in the highest quartile (23% to 19%) and in the third quartile (19% to 17%). However, by the 12th grade, there were 26% missing reading test scores. Asian and White students, both female and male, were significantly more likely to be in the two highest quartiles compared to other ethnic/racial groups. than White students (Table 19). In this question, however, caution in interpretation is needed since the \"missing\" category is high although one can assume that missing means not participation."}, {"section_title": "Reported Student Council/Student Government Participation", "text": "More 8th grade females reported participation in student council: 9% compared to 7% males. In addition, females were significantly more likely to be officers: 4% compared to 3%. This trend of both more reported participation of females in student council and significantly more likely to be officers was also true for the 10th and the 12' grades.

Those who responded yes, then answered separate questions if R's volunteer work was strictly voluntary, court ordered, required for class, and then further separate questions on the type of community service.

Higher community service was related to higher socioeconomic status, higher parents' education, higher test scores, being in a college preparatory high school program, and higher class rank."}, {"section_title": "Time Spent on Homework", "text": "The 8th grade students were asked \"about how much time do you spend on homework EACH WEEK?\" in the four major subject areas (mathematics, science, English, social studies) and homework for all other subjects. Students therefore had to make estimates on the number of hours they usually spend on each subject area. Mathematics was clearly ahead as the subject for which students did the most homework but in second place was social studies. Although social studies was in second place for amount of time spent on homework, the actual amount of time could be considered low. About 13% of students reported doing no homework in the social studies in a week while 39% reported less than one hour. In other words, about 50% of the students reported no or less than one hour of homework per week for social studies. About 22% reported one hour a week and another 10% two hours a week with 11% reporting more than three hours or more hours a week. In the 8th grade, Asian students, both male and female, reported doing the more homework compared to the other ethnic/racial groups. White females were significantly spending more time on homework in all time categories except the highest (7-9 hours) where 1% of both males and females had the same percentage. For the other ethnic/racial groups females only in a few categories reported significant differences in the amount of time spent on homework. Given the relatively small amount of time spent on social studies homework, the gender differences in time spent on homework may only result in a difference of minutes. Other 23 factors do influence the time spend on homework such as higher socioeconomic status, higher parents' education, and higher rank in class. Particularly in high school, academic high school program students report more time spent on doing homework compared to students in vocational or general high school programs. In the 10'h grade, students were asked to report the amount of time spent on homework both in the school or outside of the school EACH WEEK. Similar to the fith grade, about half of all students, female and male, reported no time or less than 1 hour of time spent outside of school on social studies homework. With the exception of Hispanic females, more females reported spending no time on social studies homework than males. More Black and White females also stated that they spent less time on homework in the category of less than one hour than Black and White males. The rest of the categories of two or more hours a week were not significantly different for males and females. Thus, it was not accurate to state that females always do more homework outside of school than males. There were exceptions on the grade levels and the categories of hours spent on homework."}, {"section_title": "Self-Esteem Measures", "text": "How students think about themselves and their self-worth was measured by two measures of self-esteem.

For 8'h grade males, Blacks students had the highest percentage in the high esteem 24 category in both scales followed by White, Hispanic, and Asian males. For females, both scales indicated Black females had the highest scores in self-esteem followed in one scale with Asian-Hispanic (a tie) and then White females. On the other scale, Black females were again the highest followed by Asian, White, and then Hispanic females. In no case in either self-concept scale were females higher than males in the comparison of ethnic/racial groups. In other words, although Black females were the highest in self-esteem of all females they were still lower than the scores of Black males. In both the 10th and 12' grades, both self-esteem scales continued to show lower scores for females compared to males with the exception of Black females who in the 12th grade on both scales were higher than Black males, a change from the 8th grade.

The importance of the high scoring 15% of students on the social studies test should also not be brushed aside since this is the potential pool for those obtaining doctorates and careers in the social sciences. More analysis of large databases is necessary to study such issues as tracking, teachers' instructional practices, and course taking in the social studies at both the middle school and high school level to allow policy makers on all levels to make better decisions on how to improve social studies learning."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "'For convenience the terms and order of NELS:88 data were used; \"Asians\" really mean Asian Americans and Blacks mean African-Americans.

Therefore, the tests not completed and the missing tests categories could be better analyzed to indicate the characteristics of students who were not completing the tests. Unweighted frequencies reflect the NELS:88 sample; weighted frequencies reflect the national population estimate that is derived from the sample. Design effects of NELS:88 involved cluster sampling--students nested within schools--and standard errors associated with means are artificially reduced, resulting in somewhat inflated significance levels. For that reason, in order to safeguard against inflated significance levels, one can report differences as statistically significant only when p<.01, rather than the more conventional .05 probability cutoff In this paper, most of the significance levels were at the .001 probability level but the reader could ignore items on the .05 level of significance. Comparisons of standardized tests like SAT (also designed by ETS) are made from one year to the next although each year has different test items and the sample of students who take the test normally changes and so it was judged appropriate to make comparisons of high scoring students in the 8th and 12th grade. Another option is to include in the sample only students who have all three test scores (8th, 10th, and 12th grade); the disadvantage here is reducing the size of the sample especially since the 12th grade has a high number of no test completed/missing. This option may be done later. It is also possible to compare performance on the 17 test items that were identical on both the 8th and 12th grade tests and this also may be done later; the disadvantage is that the smaller number of items in the test reduces the reliability of the test.
