[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The goal of this work was to assess statistical power to detect treatment effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)ederived brain biomarkers. We used unbiased tensorbased morphometry (TBM) to analyze n \u00bc 5,738 scans, from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 participants scanned with both accelerated and nonaccelerated T1-weighted MRI at 3T. The study cohort included 198 healthy controls, 111 participants with significant memory complaint, 182 with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and 177 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 155 AD patients, scanned at screening and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The statistical power to track brain change in TBM-based imaging biomarkers depends on the interscan interval, disease stage, and methods used to extract numerical summaries. To achieve reasonable sample size estimates for potential clinical trials, the minimal scan interval was 6 months for LMCI and AD and 12 months for EMCI. TBM-based imaging biomarkers were not sensitive to MRI scan acceleration, which gave results comparable with nonaccelerated sequences. ApoE status and baseline amyloid-beta positron emission tomography data improved statistical power. Among healthy, EMCI, and LMCI participants, sample size requirements were significantly lower in the amyloid\u00fe/ApoE4\u00fe group than for the amyloide/ApoE4e group. ApoE4 strongly predicted atrophy rates across brain regions most affected by AD, but the remaining 9 of the top 10 AD risk genes offered no added predictive value in this cohort. (P.M.

In the past 3 decades, medical researchers and the pharmaceutical industry have teamed up to identify neuroimaging, clinical, or other measures of disease progression that may be precise and reproducible enough to evaluate treatment response. No currently available treatments are able to slow the progression of AD, although some genetic and lifestyle factors affect vascular disease, which contributes to age-related cognitive decline. There is an urgent need to determine imaging measures of brain degeneration that may be influenced by treatments.\nAD drug trials have a high failure rate (Cummings et al., 2014) . Imaging biomarkers play an essential role in evaluating potential therapies and aim to identify those at risk before symptoms appear, monitor disease progression, and evaluate treatments Frisoni and Weiner, 2010; Jack et al., 2003 Jack et al., , 2005 Weiner et al., 2010 Weiner et al., , 2012 . A suite of candidate imaging biomarkers are being developed to provide clinically relevant information on the stages of AD pathophysiology , including amyloid imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; , tau imaging (Maruyama et al., 2013; Villemagne et al., 2014) , and brain atrophy measured with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fox et al., 2000; Fox and Freeborough, 1997; Jack et al., 1998 Jack et al., , 2004 . The European Medicines Agency has recently approved hippocampal volumes as an enrichment strategy for trials in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and prodromal AD (Hill et al., 2014) . All these measures can detect accelerated brain changes in the preclinical disease stages, before symptoms appear.\nHigh-resolution structural MRI is now commonly included in AD drug trials to monitor potential side effects (e.g., microhemorrhage and vasogenic edema) and to track brain atrophyda macroscopic reflection of neuronal death, myelin reduction, and cellular atrophy (Chertkow and Black, 2007; Dickerson and Sperling, 2005; Fleisher et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2003; Salloway et al., 2014) . Numerous MRIderived biomarkers have been developed and tested (Baron et al., 2001; Carmichael et al., 2006; Chetelat et al., 2002; Chou et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2001; Freeborough and Fox, 1997; Holland et al., 2009; Hua et al., 2013; Jack et al., 1999; Morra et al., 2009; Reuter et al., 2012; Schuff et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2004) . Over the past decade, researchers have studied the issues of bias, improved the robustness of analysis protocols (lower failure rates), and boosted the power to detect clinically significant brain changes through machine learning approaches (Christensen and Johnson, 2001; Fox et al., 2011; Gutman et al., 2013b; Hua et al., 2013; Yushkevich et al., 2010) . Structural imaging biomarkers generally measure changes in regional brain volume, supplementing the information obtained from neuropsychological and cognitive tests. Structural MRI may be especially helpful in evaluating drugs that aim to restore or repair brain tissue, such as stem cell therapy or growth factors. For trials targeting AD pathology by clearing amyloid plaques and tau tangles, brain volumetric measures serve as a surrogate marker but might not always reflect clinical improvement. Overall, structural MRI can facilitate drug trial enrichment, and lower the cost of trials, or increase power to detect disease progression and factors that affect it (Weiner et al., , 2012 .\nRecently, we have been improving and validating an unbiased 3-dimensional (3D) brain mapping approach to accurately track atrophy in the aging brain, using data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) (Hua et al., 2013) . We are now expanding the analysis to ADNI-2, which differs from ADNI-1 in focusing on people with earlier stages of MCI, scanned at 3T. A single numerical summary of brain atrophy score is derived from the 3D map to capture cumulative change in the temporal lobes (e.g., average change inside the temporal region of interest [temporal-ROI] or statistically defined ROI [stat-ROI]) (Hua et al., 2013) or over the whole brain (e.g., weighted average using linear discriminant analysis [LDA]) (Gutman et al., 2013b) . We aimed to address the following topics with the ADNI-2 data: (1) the best approaches to extract numerical summaries from a 3D map; (2) the minimal scan interval required to robustly detect change with a reasonable sample size using MRI-based tensorbased morphometry (TBM) analysis; (3) effects of MRI scan acceleration on statistical power to track brain change (a follow-up of an earlier pilot study, Ching et al., 2015) ; (4) drug trial enrichment using additional information on ApoE4 status and baseline amyloid PET imaging; (5) AD risk genes and their impact on brain atrophy rates; and (6) the applicability of TBM to multiphase studies with different scanner field strengths."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness and also lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W.

The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date, these 3 protocols have recruited >1,500 adults, aged 55e90 years, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) or late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

The initial dataset included 2,937 nonaccelerated and 2,925 accelerated 3T sagittal T1-weighted scans. We identified subjects with both an accelerated and nonaccelerated scans acquired in the same scan session and removed subjects/scans with a scanner change during serial scanning (n \u00bc 34), subjects without a clinical diagnosis (n \u00bc 2), or scans at the 3-year time point (n \u00bc 4). The final dataset included a total of n \u00bc 5,738 scans (Table 1) (Table 2) . Generally fewer scans are available at later time points, partially because of the attrition, disease progression, and limitation on the available data. Very few scans are available for SMC participants at 6 months and later, which limits the power of the analysis for the SMC group.

There are different methods to extract the numerical summaries. Here we tested 3 approaches: (1) an average within an anatomically defined ROI (temporal-ROI), (2) an average within a statistically defined ROI based on a small training sample (stat-ROI, based on voxels with significant atrophic rates [p < 0.00001] within the temporal lobes, in a training set of 20 AD patients from ADNI-1 scanned at baseline and 12 months) (Hua et al., 2013) , and (3) a weighted average using the LDA approach based on a large training sample (144 AD and 337 MCI from ADNI-1 scanned at baseline and 12 months) (Gutman et al., 2013b) ( Fig. 1) .\nA power analysis was defined by the ADNI Biostatistics Core to estimate the sample size required to detect a 25% reduction in the mean annual rate of atrophy, using a 2-sided test and standard significance level (a \u00bc 0.05) for a hypothetical 2-arm study (treatment vs. placebo). The estimated minimum sample size for each arm is computed from the formula subsequently.

The sample size required to achieve 80% power was computed in this study, referred to as n80. As the observation time ranged from 3 to 24 months, instead of converting the cumulative change to an annual rate of atrophy, we computed the number of subjects required to detect a 25% reduction in the overall atrophy occurring over the interval. These sample size estimates define how many patients would need to be recruited for clinical trials with durations of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The 95% confidence interval for the n80 statistic was computed based on 10,000 bootstrapped resampling, with a bias corrected and accelerated percentile method (Davison and Hinkley, 1997; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) , computed in R using the boot package. Numerical summaries derived from accelerated and nonaccelerated scans were compared using a paired 2-sample Student t test. The statistical threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons across 3 different methods to compute the numerical summaries, using Bonferroni correction (corrected p threshold <0.017).\nTo demonstrate the possible effect sizes after adjusting for healthy aging, we computed sample size estimates using the relative change (Supplementary Table 2 ). The power analysis was conducted by calculating sample size estimates using the variance parameters from the patient cohort, with the treatment effect defined as 25% of the difference between the mean rates of change in the patients and CN (Holland et al., 2012) .\nFrom the 3D maps of longitudinal brain change (Figs. 2e5), we extracted 3 types of numerical summaries based on temporal-ROI, stat-ROI, and LDA weighting. Stat-ROI numerical summaries demonstrated improved statistical power or smaller sample size estimates compared with temporal-ROI but LDA-based weighting performed best (Table 3) .\nThe amount of cumulative atrophy and sample size estimates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were summarized in Table 3 . At 3 months, the variability of change (standard deviation) greatly exceeded the mean atrophy, resulting in enormous sample size estimates. At 6 months, sample size estimates dropped to a more feasible level for LMCI and AD patients. With longer scan intervals, the mean levels of cumulative atrophy rise and the sample size estimates drop. For a 12-month trial, power analysis indicated that 241 CN, 314 EMCI, 162 LMCI, or 80 AD per arm were needed to power a hypothetical clinical trial using stat-ROI summaries, to detect a 25% slowing of rate of change, and only 127 CN, 141 EMCI, 72 LMCI, or 48 AD were needed if using the LDA-weighted summaries. For a 24-month trial, 127 CN, 150 EMCI, 116 LMCI, or 82 AD were needed to power a hypothetical clinical trials using stat-ROI summaries, and only 49 CN, 88 EMCI, 62 LMCI, or 37 AD were needed if using the LDAweighted summaries.\nNumerical summaries derived from accelerated scans were quantitatively similar ( Supplementary Table 1 ). There was no difference between numerical summaries derived from accelerated scans and those from nonaccelerated scans, using paired 2-sample t tests (all p > 0.017, corrected for multiple comparisons, Table 4 ), in the current analysis. Although not statistically significant, the p values of stat-ROI numerical summaries at 12 months and LDA summaries at 24 months were close to the statistical threshold.\nThe sample size estimates after adjusting for healthy aging were computed using the variance parameters from the patient cohort and the treatment effect defined as 25% of the difference between the mean rates of change in the patients and CN ( Supplementary Table S -2, also see Section 4). As expected, the n80s based on relative change are considerably larger compared with sample size estimates based on absolute change. Numerical summaries derived from stat-ROI and LDA measures generally give higher statistical power (lower sample size estimates) compared with temporal-ROI estimates, with the exception of the EMCI group. There were no reasonable sample size estimates for the EMCI group or at very short scan intervals (3 and 6 months). The aging-adjusted sample size estimates for the stat-ROI (n80s: 178 AD and 434 LMCI) and LDA (n80s: 155 AD and 478 LMCI) measures are competitive compared with existing methods that have been applied to the ADNI-1 sample, assuming a 24-month trial (Gutman et al., 2013a; Holland et al., 2012) . For machine learning approaches such as LDA, 2-class LDA classification was shown to deliver higher statistical power compared with using a stat-ROI and surpassed results based on the relative change (Gutman et al., 2013a) ."}, {"section_title": "Drug trial enrichment using ApoE4 status and brain amyloid PET imaging", "text": "We tested a clinical trial enrichment approach using the 12month stat-ROI numerical summaries derived from nonaccelerated scans.

The characteristic pattern of Alzheimer's brain degeneration, with concentrated temporal lobe atrophy accompanied by extensive CSF expansion in the lateral ventricles, became more distinct at longer scan intervals at 6, 12, and 24 months (Figs. 3e5). Similarly, as the disease stage progressed from EMCI, LMCI, and to AD, a greater amount of degeneration was observed, and the pattern of AD became more distinct. CN showed a mild and evenly distributed pattern of brain atrophy, with no focal accumulation of tissue loss in the temporal lobes. The color scales were adjusted at different time points to illustrate the overall scale of change. There were no SMC participants at 24 months follow-up.

Together with the ADNI-1 TBM analysis, our analysis constitutes the largest longitudinal brain imaging study of aging and dementia. Building on our prior work, we tested which methods performed best for tracking brain changes and identified factors that further improved sample size requirements for drug trials. Overall, we recommend a TBM-based approach to MRI analysis, using a statistically defined region of interest or LDA weighting to define a target atrophy pattern. By preselecting people with baseline brain amyloid and ApoE4 genotypes, sample sizes for reasonably powered trials were around 100, regardless of diagnosis. Other risk genes than ApoE offered no detectable preselection benefit. Longer MRI scans (nonaccelerated scans) did not offer detectable advantages over accelerated scans, at least for this method in 1-to 2-year scan interval.\nWe have shown that TBM performs well in multiphase studies with different scanning protocols (1.5T in ADNI-1 vs. 3T in ADNI-2), as we tested it extensively in the ADNI-1 dataset, and now successfully applied it to ADNI-2 dataset and combined the analyses from ADNI-1 and -2. This simulates a scenario in real clinical trials involving multiple study sites and phases. Both analyses were aligned into the same minimal deformation target (anatomic) space, which enabled direct comparison of the 2 studies and pooling the data through \"mega-analysis\" at the voxel level. The 3D maps of longitudinal brain change and derived numerical summaries were comparable between ADNI-1 and -2. Both the stat-ROI and LDA weighting were trained using the ADNI-1 sample.

Although 3 months changes were detectable with TBM, the levels of variability greatly exceed the change, resulting in unreasonable (extremely large) sample size estimates. Shorter scan intervals might be achieved in the future with higher resolution imaging or with even better methods for tracking brain change. With longer scan intervals, the mean change grew faster than its standard deviation, resulting in a continuous drop in n80s, or higher statistical power to detect change. The 6month interval was the minimal duration needed to detect reliable change, although 12 months offered the most robust results, across stat-ROI and LDA-based numerical summaries, after considering a trade-off between scan interval and effect size. Statistical effect is higher at longer scan interval (e.g., 24 months), whereas shorter trials with sufficient power (e.g., 12 months) are preferred because of concerns of cost and attrition."}, {"section_title": "Power of numerical summaries", "text": "Both stat-ROI and LDA are training-based approaches to define a region of interest in a scan, and they both outperformed an anatomically defined temporal-ROI. The stat-ROI was trained to select regions with the highest and most consistently detectable change in 20 AD patients, whereas the LDA weighting was trained on the full ADNI-1 AD and MCI sample (including 144 AD and 337 MCI) and directly optimizes the n80 estimates using information across the whole brain. Each method has pros and cons in terms of training sample requirements (expensive for drug trials), statistical power, and interpretability (Table 8 ). There is also a trade-off between statistical power and interpretability. Temporal lobe atrophy is the most interpretable measure, and it would be intuitively well received if it could be shown that a new drug slowed down temporal lobe atrophy. Even so, the sample size requirements for this are enormous within a typical scan interval of 12 and 24 months. On the other hand, LDA weighting offers the highest performance in statistical power, but it has more limited interpretability for clinical trials. LDA defines a whole-brain pattern of atrophy, which maximizes the effect size of the resulting atrophy measure. However, because of the highly correlated nature of Jacobians in neighboring voxels, neither the LDA weight maps nor the resulting numerical summary can be easily interpreted; please see (Haufe et al., 2014) on the interpretation of weight vectors of linear models in multivariate neuroimaging. For example, the mean LDA-based annual change is about 3e4 times smaller than the stat-ROI summaries. Thus, a new drug may or may not target LDA-derived atrophy patterns specifically. Stat-ROI offers a reasonable middle ground offering good statistical power while maintaining interpretability.\nWe have shown earlier that TBM-derived imaging biomarkers are correlated with baseline and changes in cognitive measures (Hua et al., 2010) . Future studies should also compare the 3 types of TBM numerical summaries for their associations with the change of cognitive measures, in the combined sample of ADNI-1 and -2.

Small regional differences were detected in the thalamus and cerebellar areas at short scan intervals (3 and 6 months) but disappeared at longer intervals (12 and 24 months). It is unknown why the effect is not detected when changes are more prominent, but change is much less reliably detected at very short scan intervals. Nevertheless, TBM studies focusing on the thalamus and cerebellar structures should conduct further analysis on the effects of scan acceleration or stick to one scanning protocol. For a detailed analysis on the effect of scan acceleration on TBM-derived brain atrophic measures, including an analysis by scanner vendor, please refer to Ching et al. (2015) . There was no significant effect of scanner vendor, at least in the TBM analysis, which predicted the difference in accelerated and nonaccelerated numerical summaries."}, {"section_title": "Adjustment for healthy aging", "text": "We computed sample size estimates using the absolute change (main text, Tables 3 and 5e7), following the definition by the ADNI Biostatistics Core. There is some argument in favor of this, as it allows for the possibility that a treatment could slow some of the processes that contribute to normal aging, some of which overlap mechanistically with the biological processes promoting atrophy in the disease group. Even so, some researchers advocate the use of the relative change, or rate of change adjusted for healthy aging, to define the treatment effect (Holland et al., 2012) ; so, we present these measures as Supplementary Table 2 . After adjusting for healthy aging, the sample size estimates were computed using the variance parameters from the patient cohort, and the treatment effect defined as 25% the difference between the mean rates of change in patients and CN. One major advantage of this approach is that it can partially cancel out any systematic methodological bias, avoiding unduly optimistic power estimates. There are several caveats related to applying this approach here. First, the standard deviations in the rate of change and sample sizes differ substantially between the available patient and control groups (e.g., at 24 months, the standard deviation of stat-ROI cumulative atrophy in AD is 2.5 times that in CN, based on data from 24 AD patients vs. 120 CN). Second, many current MCI or AD trials do not enroll healthy subjects as controls. Last, age is the biggest risk factor for AD and many of the contributing biological processes are the same, for example, vascular degeneration. Therefore in theory, atrophy and cognitive decline in healthy aging may be treatable by some drugs that resist AD, although currently no existing drug is designed to specifically target normal aging. Nevertheless, a growing number of prevention trials now enroll healthy subjects and treat them (Eastman, 2012; Ross et al., 2012) , in which case they would be considered as a \"treatment group.\"\nIn real clinical trials, a treatment group is typically compared with a placebo group to assess drug effects. Subtracting the placebo group mean could help to isolate treatment effects while reducing any sources of bias in power analyses. Of course, the best practice in imaging biomarker development is to address any methodological bias at the source, by improving algorithms or correcting steps that lead to bias, instead of trying to cancel out the effect in the enrolment design. Fig. 7 . Three-dimensional maps show areas where longitudinal changes in brain volumes were significantly associated with the number of ApoE \u03b54 alleles. The regression coefficients (unstandardized beta values or \"slopes\") are shown at each voxel that passed multiple comparison corrections (critical p value \u00bc 0.015), after controlling for age, sex, and scan interval. In the combined analysis (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 and 2), each copy of \u03b54 allele was associated with w1% greater atrophy in the temporal lobes and 1%e2% cerebrospinal fluid expansion in the lateral ventricles. 4.5. Drug trial enrichment strategy for early-stage trials\nNewer AD drugs are being tested on presymptomatic participants (EMCI and LMCI) aiming to halt or slow down the decline before substantial damage has been done to the brain. MCI participant are highly diverse; thus, efficient drug trial enrichment strategies are needed to pilot the trials on subjects with the most rapid decline or highest risk of conversion to AD. Drug trial enrichment is achieved by using ApoE4 status, the major risk allele for AD (Hua et al., 2013; Roses, 1996; Roses and Saunders, 1994; Saunders et al., 1993; Schuff et al., 2009 ). Brain amyloid load detected by PET is another important indicator of early AD pathology, and it has been used to predict patients with imminent decline . There has been evidence suggesting an interaction between ApoE4 and brain amyloid level (Lim et al., 2014; Mormino et al., 2014) . We have shown that the combined information could further enrich the drug trials for pilot studies aimed to demonstrate drug efficacy in a targeted group and understand the mechanism of action."}, {"section_title": "AD risk genes and brain atrophy", "text": "In the search of risk genes affecting longitudinal brain change, ApoE was the single significant factor in our analysis. Other top AD risk genes may have an effect not detectable with the current sample or limited by the statistical power from a relatively short scan interval (1e2 years) because AD is a slow progressing disease. Even so, exploratory analysis is important in AD research. Once brain change in a large population has been mapped, we can carry out various exploratory analysis to derive novel imaging biomarkers with new approaches to capture disease-specific change and identify new drug trial enrichment strategies. TBM offers a robust platform for structural imaging biomarker analysis."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no potential financial or personal conflicts of interest including relationships with other people or organizations within 3 years of beginning the work submitted that could inappropriately influence this work."}]
