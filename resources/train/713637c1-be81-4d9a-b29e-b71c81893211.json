It is the purpose of this paper to examine the potential difference in math proficiency between male and female students from 8th to 12th grade. The data collected in National Education Longitudinal Study: 1988 (NELS:88), a nationally representative longitudinal database, were used in this investigation."}, {"section_title": "Background and Perspectives", "text": "Researchers have long been interested in potential gender differences in mathematics proficiency in school years. Many studies have been conducted to investigate such differences. Most of the studies performed during the 1960s and 70s found gender differences in math achievement beginning at puberty and continuing through adulthood, with males generally having superior scores (Fennema & Sherman, 1977;National Assessment of Educationar Progress, 1975, 1979Schonberger, 1976). It has been reported, however, that gender difference in mathematics achievement did not seem to be constant across age groups. It appeared that young girls seemed to have some advantage in mathematics achievement, but such relative advantage seemed to get lost gradually. By the end of high school, some gender difference in math achievement was generally reported which tended to favor male students (Brandon, Newton, & Hammond, 1985;Callahan & Clements, 1984;Cannor Serbin, 1985;Carpenter, Lindquist, Mathews ti Silver, 1983;Dossey, Mullis, Lindquist & Chambers, 1988;Hawn, Ellet & Des Jardines, 1981). TEntatively, the period from 8th to 12th grade was suggested to be important, since it was during this transitional period that male students seemed to surpass female students in math achievement (Armstrong, 1985). The findings in the area of gender difference in math achievement have not been consistent (Hashaway, 1981;Baker & Jones, 1993). Most of the studies conducted in this area also tended to be local studies without much comparability across studies both in terms of samples and mathematics tasks on which the performance was measured. A few meta-analysis studies have been conducted which attempted to integrate the findings from a variety of sources (Friedman, 1989;Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990;Matsumoto, 1995)). In general, meta-analytic results showed some slight superiority of male over female students in math achievement. Furthermore, such male superiority in math achievement also seems to be related to age to certain extent. If gender difference indeed becomes more obvious as a function of age as some studies suggested, then it implies that the math proficiency of male and female students progresses at different rates over certain developmental period. In NELS:88, the students' math proficiency was measured by mathematics proficiency tests administered during each of the three waves of data collection (1988, 1990, and 1992 (NCES, 1994). In this study, three waves of data (1988 for 8th graders, 1990 for 10th graders, and 1992 for 12th graders) were examined. These three waves of data collection, among other things, resulted in nationally representative samples for the three grades at the time (NCES, 1994). Potential gender differences were also examined for different ethnic groups. There is some indication that a simple comparison of two central tendency measures (those of male and female) may camouflage some meaningful differences between male and female students within different ranges of score distribution (National Science Foundation, 1992). For this reason, close attention was paid to potential gender differences near the higher end of math score distributions. In order to investigate if the math proficiency patterns between gender groups were consistent for ethnic groups, similar analyses were conducted separately for each of the four major ethnic groups: Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American. Due to the complex sampling design for NELS:88 data collection, different weights were created to reflect the fact 'chat each individual sample member in NELS:88 represents a differential proportion of the national student populatim (NCES, 1994). In data analysis of this study, appropriate weights were included in analysis procedures. Since this paper focused on describing the gender differences in math proficiency, rather than on inferential hypothesis testing, the design effect, which is necessary for inferential testing, was not applicable for the data reported in this paper. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics on the IRTestimated math test scores of male and female students at 8th, 10th and 12th grades. Cross-sectional weights provided in the data sets for the three grades were used in the calculation of these descriptive statistics. The use of these cross-sectional weights for the three grades produced the most accurate estimate for math proficiency for U. S. national population of 8th, 10th, and 12th grades at the time. In other words, the entires in  margin. Such trends were graphically depicted in Figure 1."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Lack of Obvious Gender Difference on Means", "text": "Compared iith the impression we earlier got from the simple comparison of central tendency measures between gender groups, the information revealed from the examination of these higher score ranges is indeed different."}, {"section_title": "Insert Figure 1 about here", "text": "In NELS:88 data, math ability of individual students was estimated by classifying students into different hierarchical proficiency levels. Five levels of math proficiency were defined and estimated using item clusters contained in the math test. According to NCES publication (NCES, 1994), the five math proficiency levels are defined as follows:  (NCES, 1994;Rock, Owings, & Lee, 1994;Rock & Pollack, 1991). Among those who reached the highest level of math proficiency at 8th, 10th and 12th grade, the composition of male and female students was examined to see if any meaningful difference in gender group proportions exist. The trends observed and discussed at the extreme score ranges were similar for three of the four ethnic group samples examined (Asian, Hispanic and White), with the Hispanic sample exhibiting more prominent gender differences than the total sample discussed above. The black sample, on the other hand, showed the opposite trend, with larger proportion of girls in the higher score ranges than boys. But such anomaly should be viewed with caution, since only very small number of subjects from this group scored in the higher score ranges. For example, at 12th Grade, from the black sample, only 84 (6.7%, compared with 25% for the total sample) scored in the first'quartile, 13 (0.72%, compared with 10% for the total sample) scored in the first decile, and only 3 (0.25%, compared with 5% for the total sample) scored at or above 95th percentile. Due to such small numbers, no definite conclusions could be drawn. One meaningful question about the discussion presented above might be related to the practical meaningfulness of those differences at extreme score ranges. After all, only a small proportion of students ever reach those high score ranges anyway, should we be concerned about gender difference in those score concerned about our future leaders in these areas as we are now (NSF, 1992), and if we want to encourage women to become leaders in these areas, we will be compelled to pay attention to gender difference at extreme ranges of math score distributions. students progress from the 8th to their high school senior year."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Furthermore, the more extreme score distribution one examines at the higher end, the larger the gender difference becomes. It is argued that although relatively small proportions of high school students reach the high scc__ ranges on math test as examined in this study (75th percentile, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile), the observed gender difference within these high score ranges is practically meaningful and warrants our attention, since these students are very likely to be those who will consider going into science, mathematics, or engineering related areas as their career choices. Any significant gender difference in terms gender group proportions within these high math score ranges are likely to be one potential reason for the gender imbalance in the inflow of new students choosing these areas as careers. The tentative results presented in this paper also highlight some difficulties in the investigation of gender difference in mathematics. Most of the research in this area is typically concerned about group mean comparisons. As indicated by the results of this study, we may not be able to notice obvious difference in gender group mean scores. As a result, we may become complacent about such superficial lack of gender difference in math achievement. Such complacency may not be warranted if we understand that it is those high scorers who are likely to become our future scientists, engineers, chemists, physicists, etc., and it is in those high score ranges we see   "}]
