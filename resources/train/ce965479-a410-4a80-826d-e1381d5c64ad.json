[{"section_title": "1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "Child care subsidies are increasingly used by state and local governments to facilitate employment and reduce welfare use among economically disadvantaged families. Most public expenditures on child care assistance are funneled through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which was created alongside welfare reform in 1996. Consistent with the explicit goal of welfare reform, CCDF funds are targeted primarily at low-income families participating in a state-defined work activity. As such, these employment-related subsidies are intended to defray only those child care expenses accrued during work hours, and they maximize parental choice by placing few restrictions on the quality of care that can be purchased (Adams & Rohacek, 2002;Adams et al., 2007;Blau, 2001;. Such design features highlight a longstanding tension between the twin objectives of child care policy in the U.S.: facilitating parental employment and ensuring that children have access to safe and stimulating early care environments. The existing empirical evidence confirms that child care subsidies administered through the CCDF encourage low-skilled parents to move from welfare to work (Blau & Tekin, 2007;Herbst, 2010;Tekin, 2005;). Yet researchers have paid little attention to the potential impact of these work-related subsidies on children's well-being. Most of what is currently known about the developmental effects of subsidized child care comes from international studies of the Canadian (Baker et al., 2008), Danish , and Norwegian (Havnes & Mogstad, 2010) regimes. In contrast, there is an extensive literature on publicly subsidized early education programs such as Head Start and state pre-kindergarten as well as the model programs Perry Preschool and Abecedarian (e.g., Barnett, 1995;Berlinski et al., 2008;Currie & Thomas, 1995;Fitzpatrick, 2008;Garces et al., 2002;Gormley & Gayer, 2005;Karoly et al., 2005;Ludwig & Miller, 2007;Ramey et al., 2000). 2 Although it is tempting to draw conclusions about the impact of child care subsidies from the 2 largely positive results generated by early education interventions, there are reasons to doubt their comparability. Head Start and pre-kindergarten are explicitly designed to promote school readiness by setting relatively high quality standards and offering children educational services. Head Start, in particular, is regarded as a \"two generation\" program that offers bundles of services (e.g., nutrition, social services, and mental health services) to children as well as parents. Subsidized child care, in contrast, currently operates as a labor market policy that encourages parental employment by reducing the costs associated with child care services. In fact, unlike early education programs, eligibility for subsidies is conditioned on parental involvement in work-related activities. Moreover, a key feature of the CCDF is the principle of \"parental choice,\" in which parents may take their subsidy to any legally-operating child care provider. Although this design feature increases flexibility for working parents, it also means that children may be exposed to low-quality care. To our knowledge, only two studies provide direct evidence on the relationship between CCDF child care subsidies and children's well-being. Using data from the Kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), Herbst and Tekin (2010a) find that child care subsidy receipt in the year before kindergarten is associated with negative cognitive and behavioral outcomes at kindergarten entry. In a related paper, the same authors examine children's weight outcomes throughout kindergarten and find that subsidized children are more likely to be overweight and obese (Herbst & Tekin, 2010b). While these studies provide an initial picture of the developmental effects of child care subsidies, they fall short of establishing a causal relationship because of remaining concerns over the potential endogeneity of subsidy receipt. Furthermore, both studies focus on the immediate impact of subsidies, ignoring the possibility that these benefits continue to influence child well-being throughout the school-age years. In this paper, we provide new evidence on the impact of child care subsidy receipt on children's cognitive, behavioral, and psychomotor outcomes. Our paper contributes to the child care literature in several ways. First, very little is known about the potential consequences of child care 3 policy reforms that are designed to interact with parents' employment decisions. Given that the welfare reform law is scheduled to be reauthorized in 2010, our results may have important policy implications. Furthermore, the evidence to date focuses exclusively on short-term measures of child well-being. In this study, we reexamine the ECLS-K, exploiting its longitudinal design to examine the trajectory of child development over the first five years of children's school experiences. Finally, we pay careful attention to providing causal estimates by leveraging plausibly exogenous variation in subsidy utilization through a novel instrumental variable. Finding exogenous sources of variation in child care costs and related policy reforms presents challenges for studying maternal and child outcomes. In fact, identification problems are commonly cited as being primarily responsible for the diversity of empirical estimates documented throughout the child care literature (e.g., Anderson & Levine, 2000;Bernal & Keane, 2009). In this study, we identify the impact of subsidy receipt by exploiting geographic variation in the distance that low-income families must travel from home in order to reach the nearest social service agency that administers the subsidy application process. To implement our empirical strategy, we collected information on the precise location of virtually every public social service agency in the U.S., used these addresses to generate geocodes for each agency, and then calculated the distance between these administrative offices and the residential location of families in our data. Instrumenting for subsidies using our distance measure is conceptually equivalent to comparing the developmental outcomes of children who differ in their propensity to receive subsidized care because they reside various distances from social service agencies. 3 We develop and test a simple theoretical model in which employment-related child care subsidies do not directly influence child well-being. Rather, we show that subsidy receipt operates indirectly through three primary channels in the child production function. First, child care subsidies encourage maternal employment, which has been shown by previous work to have implications for child well-being. In particular, the most recent studies suggest that early maternal work is associated with small, negative effects on early and later cognitive ability (Baum, 2002;Bernal, 2008;Brooks-Gunn et al., 2002;James-Burdumy, 2005;Liu et al., 2003;Ruhm, 2004;, increases in a number of adverse health outcomes (Morrill, 2009), and increases in childhood obesity (Anderson et al., 2003). 4 Second, subsidies increase the use of non-parental child care services, especially center-and family-based care, which is shown to have conflicting effects on child well-being (Bernal & Keane, 2008;Blau, 1999;NICHD, 2003a;2003b). However, there is an emerging consensus that highquality care is beneficial for disadvantaged children (Hill et al., 2002;NICHD & Duncan, 2003). Finally, subsidies can influence child well-being through increases in parental income, which could be spent on goods and services that enhance child quality. The existing evidence suggests that the effect of income on child well-being is small (Blau, 1999;Korenman et al., 1995). In sum, the overall impact of child care subsidy receipt is theoretically ambiguous. Using data from the Kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), we apply our instrumental variables strategy to examine the short-and long-term impact of receiving subsidized child care in the year before kindergarten entry. Our results point to sizeable negative impacts on cognitive ability tests and teacher-reported behavioral measures in the fall and spring of kindergarten. For example, our estimates suggest that subsidized children score 0.4 and 0.3 standard deviations lower on tests of reading and math ability, respectively. However, these negative effects begin to fade by the end of first grade and are completely attenuated by the end of fifth grade. Interestingly, we find robust evidence that the adverse effects of subsidy receipt are concentrated among children of high-skilled mothers."}, {"section_title": "II. Introduction to the CCDF and Its Implications for Child Development", "text": "As previously stated, the CCDF was created alongside the passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). Overall, welfare reform legislation allocated $21 billion for child care assistance over the first seven years, 70 percent of which was earmarked to subsidize child care costs for families receiving welfare or transitioning into work (Greenberg et al., 2000). In 2007, approximately $10.2 billion was spent through the CCDF, providing subsidies to 1.7 million children per month (Child Care Bureau, 2007). In comparison, Head Start in 2005 served 906,993 children, with expenditures totaling $6.8 billion, and state prekindergarten programs enrolled 801,902 children at a cost of $2.8 billion (NIEER, 2005). Thus, expenditures on and recipients of CCDF child care subsidies exceed those of other early care and education programs. In order to qualify for a subsidy, families must have at least one child under age 13, have an income below 85 percent of the state median income, and be employed or participate in a statedefined work-related activity (e.g., education, job search, or job training). Subsidized child care is available to eligible families largely through vouchers and contracts with providers. In 2007, 86 percent and 10 percent of children were served by vouchers and contracts, respectively, while the remainder were served by cash (Child Care Bureau, 2007). States are given substantial latitude to establish key program parameters, including income eligibility thresholds, benefit reimbursement rates, and co-payment rates. Market rate surveys are conducted periodically to ensure that recipient families have \"equal access\" to high-quality providers, defined as reimbursements that cover 75 percent of the local child care price distribution and copayments that do not exceed 10 percent of family income (Greenberg et al., 2000). States are able to use CCDF funds in a variety of ways to directly influence child care quality within the market. For example, states are required to spend a minimum of four percent of the annual CCDF allocation to support such initiatives as teacher training and education, improvements 6 to health and safety conditions, and establishing quality rating systems. However, there is substantial variation in quality-related expenditures across the states, with some jurisdictions spending over 10 percent of its total on these initiatives (nine states) and others spending just below the four percent minimum (13 states). Overall, quality expenditures comprise about six percent of CCDF spending, while direct service provision accounts for 82 percent (Child Care Bureau, 2007). In addition, several features of the CCDF may indirectly influence the quality of care purchased by parents. Perhaps the most important design feature is the principle of \"parental choice,\" in which parents may utilize subsidies to purchase most legally-operating child care services, including unregulated relatives and in-home caregivers. The increased flexibility through \"parental choice\" enables parents to quickly transition into employment, but it raises concerns over whether subsidized children enroll in high-quality child care environments. Without strong quality restrictions, for example, it is plausible that parental decision-making is instead guided by a range of other factors, including personal biases and cultural expectations, word-of-mouth recommendations, and convenience (Pungello & Kurtz-Costes, 1999). Furthermore, previous research finds that parents allocate little time to the child care search (Walker, 1991), consistently overestimate the quality of their children's arrangements (Cryer & Buchinal, 1997), and are unable to distinguish low-from high-quality services (Mocan, 2007). These information asymmetries therefore interact with certain features of the CCDF to discourage low-income parents from purchasing high-quality care, which may ultimately undermine child well-being. The CCDF also creates quality challenges on the supply-side of the market. For example, by mandating only minimum quality standards, the CCDF reduces the incentive for providers to invest in costly quality improvements that promote child development. In addition, conditioning subsidy eligibility on parental employment further discourages providers from offering high-quality services. Child care providers that rely heavily on subsidized children as a source of revenue may experience severe fiscal shortfalls when parents lose eligibility or use their subsidy to pay another provider. The 7 volatility associated with serving subsidized children prevents child care providers from making long-term quality investments (Adams & Rohacek, 2002;Adams et al., 2007). Frequent changes in eligibility due to changes in parental work status or earnings can also increase instability for children. 5 Indeed, Ha (2009) provides evidence that parents cycle on-and-off the child care subsidy rolls, with 50 percent of first spells ending within six months (Ha, 2009). If accompanied by frequent changes in child care arrangements, these interruptions could have adverse effects on child wellbeing (Huston et al., 2002;Loeb et al., 2004;Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000;Tran & Weinraub, 2006). 6 A final supply-side constraint is created by states' reimbursement-rate policies. It is only a recommendation that subsidy reimbursements be set at the 75 th percentile of the local price distribution, leaving states with considerable flexibility to set lower benefit rates. In fact, only nine states in 2007 abided by the federal recommendation (Schulman & Blank, 2007). Low reimbursement rates limit parental access to high-quality early care environments and intensify resource constraints among providers. Beyond these child care constrains, the type and quality of parental employment obtained through child care subsidies may also have implications for child well-being. For example, previous studies find that parents receiving subsidies typically work in low-wage occupations that offer few training opportunities (e.g., Okuyama & Weber, 2001). Indeed, studies produce mixed evidence on the impact of subsidy receipt on earnings (e.g., Berger & Black, 1992;Danziger et al., 2004). Furthermore, the loss of government-provided health insurance is commonly cited in studies of welfare leavers (Loprest, 1999). Therefore, it is possible that the employment effects of child care subsidies lead to dramatic changes in the home environment-ranging from increased parental stress and anxiety to the loss of other policy supports-without an offsetting increase in material wellbeing."}, {"section_title": "III. Data Description", "text": "The dataset used in this paper is the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative survey of 21,260 children entering kindergarten in the fall of 1998. Children in the ECLS-K are followed through the eighth grade, with detailed parent, child, and teacher interviews conducted in the fall and spring of kindergarten (1998 and 1999)  Analyses in this study are based primarily on the fall of kindergarten wave of data collection, in which child cognitive and behavioral assessments were conducted and parents were asked about child care subsidy receipt in the year prior to kindergarten entry. We also exploit the longitudinal design of the ECLS-K and examine child outcomes in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of 1 st , 3 rd , and 5 th grades. 7 Our analysis sample retains children living with an unmarried biological mother or female guardian (related and unrelated) as of the fall of kindergarten. 8 We focus on unmarried mothers because this group constitutes approximately two-thirds of eligible subsidy recipients (Herbst, 2008). Exclusions from the sample are made if the child is missing information on all outcome variables (1,766) or the entire fall of kindergarten parent interview (740), the questions regarding child care subsidy receipt (35), and census tract identifiers (2,256). We exclude an additional 12,607 children who do not meet our requirements for residence with an unmarried mother. 9 The resulting analysis sample includes 3,848 children. We begin by exploring the impact of child care subsidy receipt on nine child outcomes 9 measured in the fall of kindergarten. Tests of reading and math ability comprise the outcomes in the cognitive domain. 10 The reading test measures language and literacy skills, including print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. The math test evaluates identification of one-and two-digit numerals, recognition of geometric shapes, counting and reading numerals, pattern and sequence recognition, and solving simple word In addition to the overall cognitive assessments, we examine subject-area proficiency scores in reading and math. Such measures are useful for understanding performance in domain-specific content areas. In particular, we analyze five increasingly difficult reading and math domains through proficiency probability scores, which use the individual test score items to provide a measure of the likelihood that a given child has mastered each skill set. In the reading domain, we analyze proficiency scores for letter recognition, beginning sounds, ending sounds, word recognition, and word comprehension. In the math domain, we explore numbers and shapes, relative sizes, ordinality, addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. In the behavioral domain, we explore teachers' subjective reports of children's externalizing behavior problems, internalizing behavior problems, approaches to learning, self-control, and interpersonal skills. The externalizing behavior scale inquires about the frequency of acting out behaviors, including arguing, fighting, anger, and impulsive behavior. The internalizing behavior scale asks about the frequency with which children display anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness. The approaches to learning scale measures behavior reflecting the ease children display in 10 the learning environment, including attentiveness, task persistence, and eagerness to learn. The selfcontrol scale measures the extent to which children are capable of controlling behavior by respecting the property of others, limiting temper, and responding appropriately to peer-pressure. Finally, the interpersonal skills scale provides information on children's ability to form and maintain friendships, comfort or help others, and show sensitivity toward one's peers. All of the behavioral outcomes are measured on a scale of one to four. Higher scores on the internalizing and externalizing behavior scales indicate more frequent behavior problems, while higher scores on the remaining scales indicate increasingly positive behavior. These measures are scaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 10. The final set of outcomes explored in the study focus on children's psychomotor skills, specifically fine and gross motor skills. Fine motor skills capture hand-eye coordination and include such tasks as building a gate, drawing a person, and copying simple figures. The test of gross motor skills evaluates children in the areas of balancing, hopping, skipping and walking backward. Fine motor skills are measured on a scale of zero to nine, and gross motor skills are measured on a scale of zero to eight, with higher scores indicating greater abilities. As with the behavioral outcomes, these measures are scaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 10. The primary right-hand-side variable in this analysis is a measure of child care subsidy receipt, defined as a binary indicator that equals unity if a given child received subsidized, nonparental child care in the year prior to kindergarten. During the fall of kindergarten interview, parents were asked about non-parental child care arrangements utilized throughout the previous 12 months. For each arrangement, a set of follow-up questions were then directed at parents to ascertain whether any help was received in paying for child care expenses. Specifically, parents were asked the following: \"Did any of the following people or organizations help to pay for this \u2026 provider to care for {CHILD} the year before {he/she} started kindergarten?\" Four possible choices were then presented to parents, and we coded those answering \"a social service agency or welfare office\" as receiving a child care subsidy. 11 Thirteen percent of children in our analysis sample are coded as receiving a child care subsidy. This figure is consistent with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' finding that 12 percent to 15 percent of eligible families received a CCDF subsidy around the same period (U.S. DHHS, 1999). 12 Also included in the production function are several exogenous determinants of child wellbeing, including the child's gender, age (months), race and ethnicity (four dummy variables), weight in the fall of kindergarten (pounds), and dummy variables for premature birth, low birth weight, fair or poor health status, and first-time kindergartner. Maternal characteristics include age at the fall of kindergarten (years), educational attainment (three dummy variables), number of other children in the family (two dummy variables), a dummy variable to indicate whether English is the primary home language, log of family income, and a dummy variable indicating urban residence. In addition, we account for the neighborhood environment by adding census tract-and school-level controls for the log median household income, log of population density, percent non-Hispanic white, percent foreign born, percent ages 65 and over, percent female, percent of children ages 0-2, 3-5, 6-11, 12-13, 14, and 15-17 living in female-headed households, percent of children in the school eligible for free or reduced price lunch, a dummy variable indicating whether a majority of children in the school are minorities, and a dummy variable indicating whether the school receives Title I funding. Finally, our fullest specification incorporates state fixed effects. 13 Summary statistics for the child and maternal variables are presented in Appendix Table 1. Subsidized children are more likely to be black and in fair or poor health than their unsubsidized counterparts. Such children also reside in families with lower incomes. It is somewhat surprising, 12 therefore, that subsidized children are less likely to be born prematurely and deemed low birth weight. Moreover, mothers of subsidized children are less likely to be high school drop-outs and more likely to have some college education. These conflicting results imply that subsidy utilization is a complex phenomenon that likely reflects parental tastes for work and child care as well as statespecific practices to systematically ration benefits. Consistent with this, we find that mothers receiving a subsidy are more likely to be employment (79 percent compared to 72 percent) and make greater use of center-based care for their children (39 percent compared to 10 percent). Furthermore, the positive association between maternal education and subsidy receipt might reflect the skills and motivation necessary to navigate the complex application and recertification process (Blau & Tekin, 2007). It could also be an indication of local administrators' preferences for higher-skilled mothers, who might find employment more rapidly than those drawn from the bottom of the skill distribution."}, {"section_title": "IV. Theoretical Model and Econometric Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Child Care Subsidies and the Production of Child Well-Being", "text": "The conceptual framework for our analysis is based on the economic model of the family developed by Becker (1981), in which households combine time and market resources to maximize a utility function. In our case, a household receives utility from the mother's leisure (L), a vector of consumption goods (X), and child quality (Q) according to the function where Z and \u03b5 are observed and unobserved determinants of preferences, respectively. A i subscript for the i th single mother is suppressed for clarity. Child quality can be modeled as a production function determined by the quality of maternal care (Q M ), the quality of market care (Q C ), and purchased goods related to child quality (G): ( As shown in (2), the quality of maternal care is a function of the mother's hours of work (H) and hours of maternal care (J); the quality of market care is a function of hours of market care (C) and child care subsidy receipt (s); and the quantity of purchased goods is determined by the mother's total income (I). 14 In this model, we assume that subsidy receipt is a function of the distance (d c ) that a mother travels to reach the nearest social service agency that administers the subsidy program in her county of residence. Below we elaborate further on role of travel distance in determining household behavior. Note that G captures the additional consumption that occurs when subsidized families spend less on purchasing child care services. In addition, while G can be beneficial for child quality (e.g., books, cognitively stimulating toys, and fresh fruits/vegetables), it can also be potentially harmful (e.g., video games and fast food). In principle, the impact of all inputs in (2) can be period-specific and can vary over the child's life (Ruhm, 2004). It is possible, for example, that children have multiple subsidy receipt spells prior to kindergarten entry, and that each spell differentially affects child well-being over time. Data restrictions preclude a fully specified child production function, so we instead focus on a contemporaneous representation, which yields the impact of each input in the current period combined with those in previous periods. Therefore, s should be interpreted as commingling the contemporaneous and lagged effects of child care subsidy receipt. The mother's time constraint is The household's budget constraint is the following where p c , p g , and p x are the prices of market care, purchased goods related to child quality, and other consumption goods, respectively. The p s is the hourly equivalent of child care subsidy benefits if the household is eligible for and receives them; w is the mother's hourly wage rate; and Y is non-labor income. It is further assumed that \u2202Q/\u2202Q M >0 and \u2202Q/\u2202Q C >0. The effect of G on child quality depends on the extent to which the mother uses I to purchase goods that enhance child quality or goods that might hamper it. Therefore, \u2202Q /\u2202G is ambiguous. As the model shows, subsidy receipt can influence child well-being through three channels. First, it enters directly into the quality of market care. This is due to the aforementioned design features embedded in the CCDF that have implications for child care quality. Such characteristics are likely to have negative effects on child care quality, although we do not constrain the relationship between Q C and s to be negative (i.e., \u2202Q C /\u2202s<0) a priori. Second, the quality of maternal care is influenced by the mix of time spent in the labor market and time engaged in maternal care. Given that eligibility for child care subsidies is conditioned on employment, subsidy receipt should lead to an increase in labor market time and a decrease in the amount of time allocated to maternal care. Assuming that hours of maternal care is positively related to the quality of maternal care (i.e., \u2202Q M /\u2202J>0) and hours of work is negatively related to maternal quality (i.e., \u2202Q M /\u2202H < 0), a subsidy should have a negative effect on the quality of maternal care among non-working mothers. This relationship is unclear for mothers already in the labor force because subsidy receipt is predicted to have complicated employment effects at the intensive margin (i.e., hours of work) due to opposing income and substitution effects. However, it is unlikely that an employed mother would significantly alter her work effort after starting to use subsidized child care in light of the work requirements tied to these benefits. Therefore, the net effect of subsidy receipt on the quality of maternal care is anticipated to be negative. Finally, a child care subsidy can reduce expenditures on child care, thereby freeing up resources to increase consumption in other areas. However, as noted above, the effect of G on child quality is ambiguous. In sum, the overall impact of child care subsidies on child 15 well-being is ambiguous and therefore an empirical question. The mother maximizes utility subject to the child quality production function and budget and time constraints. This optimization problem is solved to yield a reduced form quality demand function that depends on subsidy receipt (s), all prices, the mother's wage rate, non-labor income, exogenous production shifters (Z), and unobserved components of productivity and preferences. The production function can be formalized with the following equation: where k = {c, g, x, and s}. The coefficient of interest is \u03b1 1 , the impact of subsidy receipt on child well-being. There are a number of obstacles associated with estimating (6). Since labor market earnings is one of the predicted channels through which subsidies can influence measures of Q, a model including hourly wages would no longer be reduced form and would complicate the interpretation of \u03b1 1 . Furthermore, hourly wages is potentially endogenous. Therefore, we substitute its exogenous determinants (e.g., age, race, and education) in the production function. Another complication stems from data limitations in the ECLS-K that prevent us from calculating child care expenditures and subsidy reimbursements, both of which are likely to be endogenous. These inputs to child well-being are assumed to be a function of child care quality, states' child care policy parameters, and the observable characteristics of children and parents (Tekin, 2007). We capture these inputs by substituting their exogenous family determinants and including detailed controls for the neighborhood environment. Finally, state fixed effects are added to account for states' subsidy policies as well as unobserved time-invariant determinants of child well-being that are correlated with subsidy receipt. This results in the following fully reduced form empirical model: where H is a vector of exogenous child and maternal determinants of child well-being; N represents a vector of neighborhood attributes; \u2211 j \u03b4 j is a set of state fixed effects; and \u03bd is an idiosyncratic error term. It is important to note that (7) yields an estimate of the overall impact of child care subsidy receipt that commingles the three channels through which subsidies may influence child well-being (i.e., child care quality, maternal time, and consumption). This is consistent with the main goal of the paper. Estimating 7with ordinary least squares (OLS) will yield an unbiased estimate of the impact of child care subsidies only if the unobserved determinants of child well-being are uncorrelated with subsidy receipt. This assumption is unlikely to hold in practice because parental decisions regarding work and child care are not the result of random processes (Tekin, 2007). For example, highly motivated mothers or those with strong work preferences may be more likely to request child care assistance. Since labor force participation is one of the channels through which subsidies can influence child well-being, failing to control for maternal motivation and preferences may produce a biased estimate of \u03b4 1 . Another selection mechanism deals with the possibility that mothers take children's cognitive ability and temperament into consideration when deciding whether to work and obtain a child care subsidy. If mothers differentially select work and child care choices based on unobserved child characteristics, the coefficient on subsidy receipt will once again be biased. Finally, it is possible that subsidy administrators systematically ration child care benefits according to specific household characteristics. For example, administrators might target the least employable mothers in order to ease their transition into the labor market. Alternatively, case workers may give priority to higher-skilled mothers, thereby generating the greatest \"return on investment\" and allowing states to meet work participation targets. 16 These possibilities suggest that subsidy receipt is correlated with unobserved family and program characteristics. Therefore, we are concerned that estimating (7) with OLS will yield biased estimates of \u03b4 1 . 17"}, {"section_title": "Identification Strategy", "text": "In the absence of a research design that randomly distributes child care subsidies to single mothers, we rely on a novel instrumental variable to generate quasi-experimental variation in child care subsidy receipt. To produce consistent estimates of the impact of subsidy receipt using instrumental variables, we need at least one variable that is correlated with subsidy utilization but uncorrelated with measures of child well-being except through its relationship with subsidy receipt. Our proposed instrument is based on the distance that families must travel from home in order to reach the nearest social service agency that administers the subsidy application process. The plausibility of this instrument rests in part on the assumption that families living in an area with an agency nearby face lower costs of obtaining a subsidy. It is therefore hypothesized that an inverse relationship exists between the likelihood of subsidy utilization and the distance between home and the closest social service agency. Furthermore, as outlined in the behavioral model, it is plausible that mothers' travel distance to an agency influences work and child care decisions only through its impact on subsidy utilization and should not directly influence child well-being. To implement this strategy, we began by creating a database containing the precise location (building number, street name, city, state, and zip code) of virtually every social service agency in the U.S. In doing so, we were careful to ensure that a given agency is involved in eligibility and benefit determination for CCDF child care subsidies. Our database contains location information on over 3,600 social service agencies. The next step in the process involved geocoding the location of administrative offices by assigning a latitude and longitude coordinate to each. In the final step, we calculated the Euclidean (or as-the-crow-flies) distance (in miles) between the location of social service agencies and the centroid (or geographic center) of the census tract in which ECLS-K families reside. We generate the distance measure based on families' census tract because residential addresses are not available in the ECLS-K. Furthermore, given that states' child care subsidy programs are administered primarily at the county-level, we use families' county of residence as the geographic boundary for calculating the distances. 18 Appendix A provides a detailed description of the steps taken to construct the agency database and distance measure. There are several reasons to expect that the geographic accessibility of social service agencies influences the costs and benefits associated with subsidy participation. 19 First, it has been well-documented that low-income families already face substantial work-and child care-related costs because of the limitations of public transportation systems and low car ownership rates (Allard, 2009;Berube & Raphael, 2005;Ong, 2002). Edin & Lein (1997) estimate that single mothers' work commutes sum to an average of 10 hours per week, with another study finding that mothers' daily trip from home to the child care provider adds 28 percent more time to the total commute (Michelson, 1985). It is therefore not surprising that low-income working mothers stress the importance of locating child care services close to home or work (Henly & Lyons, 2000). 20 These preferences appear to translate in practice: a study of child care subsidy recipients in Cuyahoga County, Ohio finds that such families travel only two miles to center-based providers and 1.5 miles to family daycare homes (Bania et al., 2000). Further intuition for a relationship between the distance measure and subsidy receipt is developed by examining states' policies regarding the subsidy application and recertification process. Generally speaking, proximity to a social service agency can impact utilization during multiple stages of a family's interaction with the subsidy system (Herbst & Tekin, 2010c). In particular, most parents are required to make one or more personal visits to an agency to conduct the initial in-take and eligibility screening. 21 The number of office visits largely depends on state-specific rules governing the stringency of income and employment documentation and the extent to which families require assistance locating suitable child care providers. In addition, parents in many jurisdictions are required to report in-person all changes to employment and income. This can be particularly challenging for low-income parents, who tend to have less access to automobile transportation and are more likely to experience frequent job turnover, seasonal or irregular work hours, and highly volatile earnings. Finally, policies regarding eligibility recertification require parents to make multiple trips to the local social service agency. In particular, the time-limited nature of child care subsidies-usually lasting three to 12 months-implies that parents need to restart the eligibility process every few months or risk benefit termination. Empirically, previous work by Herbst and Tekin (2010c) uses the ECLS-K to provide direct evidence on the relationship between the distance to social service agencies and subsidy utilization. Results suggest that increases in the travel distance (in miles) reduce the likelihood that a potentially eligible family receives a child care subsidy. The authors estimate an elasticity of subsidy receipt with respect to distance of -0.13. To formalize this relationship in the context of the current study, we estimate regressions of subsidy receipt on single mothers' travel distance, controlling for a rich set of child and family characteristics. Appendix Table 2 presents coefficients for two variants of this model. The top panel presents results using the natural logarithm of the distance to the nearest social service agency. We also allow for a non-linear relationship by incorporating polynomials in distance. These results are presented in the bottom panel. Column (1) includes only the distance 21 A growing number of states allow families to apply for subsidies via the mail, online, or over the telephone. However, as of 1998-the year subsidy information was ascertained in the ECLS-K-these application modes were substantially less common. Only 14 states in our ECLS-K sample allowed families to request subsidy applications mail, telephone, or email (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington). Another five states (Maine, Michigan, Oregon, Texas, and Washington) allowed families to complete the subsidy application via mail or telephone. Furthermore, although some parents may not be required to visit an office to receive a subsidy, there are numerous factors that may necessitate in-person visits both initially and later at recertification, such as lack of trust by parents in the system, errors made by parents or case workers, and visits required by case workers to provide additional documentation (Adams, Synder, & Sandfort, 2002). Finally, single mothers in our sample may not have the resources to navigate application process through online or telephone interactions. Therefore, it is plausible that distance continues to be costly for families that are allowed to submit subsidy applications through alternative means. Herbst and Tekin (2010c) show that the distance measure is associated with a statistically significant reduction in subsidy utilization irrespective of whether families must make personal visits to the social service agency in the county in which they reside. 20 measure, while Columns (2) and (3) add the child and family characteristics, respectively. As expected, results in the top panel reveal a negative and statistically significant relationship between the distance measure the likelihood of subsidy receipt. The coefficient on the distance variable implies that a one percent increase in the mileage to the nearest social service agency reduces the probability of subsidy utilization by 1.8 percentage points. Results in the bottom panel reveal that the relationship between distance and subsidy receipt is highly non-linear, with the distance variables individually and jointly statistically significant. An implication of the behavioral model is that the monetary and psychic costs associated with a given travel distance are expected to vary according to where a family resides. For example, there is substantial geographic variation in the availability of local roads and highways, the amount of traffic congestion associated with these roads, and the accessibility of substitute forms of public transportation. Such differences within and across states imply that it is not appropriate to constrain the relationship between travel distance and subsidy receipt to be the same for mothers across all jurisdictions. To investigate this issue, we produce county-and state-specific correlations between the distance measure and subsidy receipt. As expected, both sets of correlations are negative on average, but the amount of variation is substantially greater among counties, as evidenced by a comparison of the standard deviations: 0.305 for the county-specific correlations and 0.172 for the state-specific correlations. Additional evidence of between-county variation in the distance-subsidy relationship is provided by comparing correlations across urban and rural counties. Not surprisingly, the average correlation in rural counties is nearly three times larger than that in urban counties, but the spread of correlations around the mean is also greater (SD rural: 0.397 versus SD urban: 0.277). Our identification strategy therefore exploits this county-level variation in travel distance by interacting the distance measure with mothers' county-of-residence indicators. With a p-value less than 0.001, the set of distance-county interactions is highly statistically significant in the first-stage equation. 22 In order for the distance measure to serve as an instrument to identify the impact of subsidy receipt on child well-being, it has to be validly excluded from the child production function. One concern is that the distance measure could be determined in part by the joint location preferences of families and social service agencies. For example, given the low car ownership rates among lowincome families, such individuals may prefer to live near critical support services or employment centers. In addition, administrative offices might locate in low-income neighborhoods to be accessible to large numbers of potentially eligible clients. If these unobserved family and agency preferences influence the distance measure in ways that affect child well-being, the coefficient on subsidy receipt will be biased. Recent empirical work finds little support for the notion that individuals Tiebout sort across space in order to access government-provided goods and services (Rhode & Strumpf, 2003). Furthermore, although endogenous location choices are more plausible for entitlement programs or services with open-ended funding streams, it is highly unlikely that low-income parents move to a given neighborhood to be close to an agency administering child care subsidies. These benefits are heavily rationed by local agencies, and consequently it is common for parents to experience frozen intake or long waiting lists (Herbst, 2008). Therefore, it seems fairly risky to choose a residential location based on the location of these agencies. As pointed out by Allard (2009), the location choices of social service agencies are constrained in important ways, limiting the ability to adjust rapidly to changes in the spatial distribution of low-income families. These constraints help to explain why one-fifth of the social service agencies in Allard's (2009) three-city study had been operating in the same location for six to 10 years, and over half were in the same location for more than years. Another concern is that our distance measure is a proxy for neighborhood and family characteristics that influence child well-being. For example, it is possible that mothers facing shorter distances to an agency do so in part because they reside in high-population-density (urban) and lowincome neighborhoods. Conversely, those with longer distances may reside in largely rural and racially homogenous areas. To the extent that the neighborhood environment directly affects child well-being or is correlated with resident family characteristics, we might be worried that the travel distance is systematically related to child development. If these environmental factors are not properly accounted for in the production function, the distance measure would not constitute a valid instrument. Table 1 explores the relationship between select family characteristics and the distance measure. Specifically, columns two through five present the means for child and maternal characteristics at each quartile of the distance distribution. Column six displays the p-value from an F-test of the equivalence of means before conditioning on the neighborhood environment. Column seven shows the p-value from a specification test that adjusts the means for median household income and population density in the census tract of residence. The raw means indicate that children living closer to an agency are significantly less likely to be white and more likely to be in fair or poor health than children living father away. In addition, mothers living near an agency have higher WIC participation rates and lower levels of educational attainment, and they are more likely to be drawn from the lowest quintile of the SES distribution. 23 Such results justify our concern that child and maternal characteristics may not be random with respect to the distance measure. However, these family-level differences are driven by neighborhood-level heterogeneity across the distance distribution. In particular, families living near an agency tend to be located in low-income and densely populated census tracts with high rates of non-white households and those receiving public assistance. For example, differences in neighborhood household median income and population density by distance quartile are large in magnitude and highly statistically significant (F=110.56 and F=268.08, respectively). In fact, conditioning on these two neighborhood characteristics alone makes each of the child and maternal differences disappear (column seven). It is remarkable that background characteristics like socio-economic status, WIC participation, and maternal education are randomized over the distance distribution after controlling for these neighborhood characteristics. Such results indicate that the neighborhood environment is responsible for generating the observed family-level differences across the distance distribution, and as long as neighborhood controls are included in the production function, the distance measure can serve as a valid instrument. To further bolster our confidence in the identification strategy, we incorporate an additional 13 census tract-and school-level variables in the child production function, for a total of 15 controls. 24 These variables capture several dimensions of neighborhoods' wealth and resources, urbanicity, racial and ethnic composition, and family structure that are either directly related to child well-being or correlated with the relevant attributes of our ECLS-K families. As previously mentioned, we also include state fixed effects to account for state-level policy, economic, and demographic unobservables that may influence child outcomes. Finally, in robustness checks, we estimate the production function separately on children living in urban areas. By making the sample more homogenous, it is an additional check on the impact of endogenous residential choices and unobserved neighborhood characteristics. Results from this exercise are consistent with our main findings."}, {"section_title": "V. Estimation Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Impact of Child Care Subsidy Receipt on Child Well-Being", "text": "Tables 2 through 4 present the main results for this study. We begin by examining raw differences in the fall of kindergarten outcomes for subsidized and unsubsidized children (Table 2). We then present OLS results for the child production function that condition on a rich set of observable child, family, and neighborhood characteristics (Table 3). Finally, we deal explicitly with the potential endogeneity of subsidy receipt by implementing our instrumental variables strategy (Table 4). Table 2 provides the means and standard deviations for the child outcomes measured in the fall of kindergarten. We present these summary statistics for our full ECLS-K sample and for the sub-sets of subsidized and unsubsidized children. Note that the full sample reading and math test scores are below 50, indicating that children of unmarried mothers score lower than the average ECLS-K child. In addition, children in our sample display more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and fewer positive social behaviors than other ECLS-K children. This is not surprising given that single-parent families tend to have fewer resources to invest in the production of child quality. The table also shows that subsidized children score lower on tests of cognitive ability and display more behavior problems than their unsubsidized counterparts. In fact, subsidy recipients perform worse in eight of the nine outcome measures (the exception is fine motor skills), and the raw differences are statistically significant for seven of the outcomes. Such differences should be interpreted with caution, however, as they do not account for the possibility that subsidy receipt is correlated with other factors that determine child well-being. We begin to address the presence of potentially confounding variables in Table 3, which presents OLS estimates of the relationship between child care subsidy receipt and child well-being. Recall that subsidy receipt is measured in the year prior to kindergarten entry, and the outcomes are measured in the fall of kindergarten. Thus, these estimates reveal the short-term implications associated with receiving subsidized child care. Each cell in the table presents the coefficient on subsidy receipt and its standard error (adjusted for clustering at the county level). Column (1) shows the estimates for subsidy receipt without controls. Columns (2) and (3) add the child and family covariates, respectively, and column (4) incorporates the neighborhood-level controls. Finally, our fullest OLS specification is presented in column (5), which adds state fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity at the state-level that might be correlated with subsidy receipt and child well-being. As shown in Table 3, the estimates for subsidy receipt exhibit considerable variation as controls are added to the specification. In the test score models, the impact of child care subsidies decreases in magnitude and loses statistical significance between columns (1) and (5). On the other hand, subsidy coefficients in the motor skills' models generally increase in size and become more precisely estimated. Finally, in the behavioral models, the impact of subsidy receipt is largely robust to the increased number of controls. Nevertheless, the results consistently point to poorer outcomes for subsidized children. Looking at column (5), we find that subsidy receipt is related to lower reading and math test scores and increased behavior problems, although only the behavioral measures show statistically significant results. Children receiving subsidized care, for example, score 2.4 points higher on the measure of externalizing behavior problems and about two points lower on the measures of self-control and interpersonal skills. Findings for the psychomotor outcomes are mixed, with the subsidy coefficient indicating significant increases in fine motor skills and decreases in gross motor skills. In sum, the OLS results are indicative of a negative relationship between child care subsidies and child well-being. These estimates, however, should not be interpreted as causal because the models do not fully account for the possibility that families nonrandomly select into subsidy utilization. Furthermore, the fluctuating estimates create considerable uncertainty about the likely direction of the OLS bias. The instrumental variables estimates consistently point to negative effects of child care subsidy receipt on child well-being. Furthermore, the estimates grow in magnitude and are statistically significant for all outcomes except fine and gross motor skills. The finding that the coefficients increase in magnitude from the OLS to the instrumental variables method is consistent with the presence of measurement error in the subsidy receipt variable. Looking first at the cognitive outcomes, we find that children receiving subsidized care score nearly five points lower on the reading test and four points lower on the math test. These point estimates correspond to effect sizes of about 0.49 and 0.37 standard deviations, respectively, and would move the median child to the 36 th percentile of the reading score distribution and the 29 th percentile of the math score distribution. In the behavioral domain, subsidy receipt is shown to have a deleterious effect on all five outcomes. The parameter estimates are statistically significant, and they correspond to larger effects than those in the cognitive domain. Interestingly, subsidy participation is expected to increase both externalizing (e.g., aggressive) and internalizing (e.g., anxious) behavior problems. The coefficients imply a seven-point increase in the externalizing scale and a three-point increase in the internalizing scale. These translate to effect sizes of 0.71 and 0.29 standard deviations, respectively. Our estimates also suggest that subsidy receipt reduces a number of positive social behaviors, including self-control and interpersonal skills. Parameter estimates consistently imply reductions of approximately five points-or half of a standard deviation-in the various measures of positive social behaviors. Turning finally to the psychomotor domain, the coefficient on subsidy receipt points to negative effects on fine and gross motor skills, but the estimates are statistically insignificant. Furthermore, the effect sizes are smaller than those in the other domains. Such results are not surprising given that these assessments are largely designed to measure bodily-kinesthetic skills (e.g., hand-eye coordination, balancing, hopping, skipping, and walking backward). These skills are less likely to be influenced by short-run home and child care changes associated with subsidy utilization. Unfortunately, the psychomotor assessments were not administered again by the ECLS-K, which prevents us from exploring longer-term effects. In light of the negative correlation between travel distance and subsidy participation rates, if child care subsidies have a causal effect on child well-being, then a reduced form relationship between the distance measure and child outcomes should emerge. Appendix Table 3 reports average values of the fall of kindergarten outcome measures across the quartiles of the distance distribution. We also report p-values from two sets of F-tests: one testing differences in the unconditional means (column five) and another testing differences conditional on child and family characteristics (column six). Unconditional results point to a statistically significant relationship between the distance measure and seven of the nine child outcomes. Controlling for child and family covariates reduces this number to five significant relationships. A consistent pattern emerges from this analysis: measures of child well-being improve monotonically as the distance to the nearest agency increases. Such results, together with the negative correlation between the distance measure and subsidy receipt, imply that the 2SLS estimates of a negative impact on child well-being can be interpreted as causal. To put these findings into perspective, we compare effect sizes in Table 4 with those reported elsewhere in the early care and education literature. Bernal and Keane (2009) (Karoly et al., 2005). It appears that the absolute value of our effect sizes is at the upper end of the range of previous estimates. However, it is important to bear in mind that the impact of subsidy receipt is averaged over potentially large changes in maternal employment, children's child care arrangements, and families' financial resources. Although prekindergarten and Head Start programs introduce changes in the early care environment, parental employment is not likely to be an important channel through which these programs influence child well-being. Thus, the estimates presented here are comparable to those found elsewhere. The 2SLS results discussed above suggest that subsidy receipt leads to significant reductions in tests of reading and math ability. Fortunately, the ECLS-K allows us to unpack these broad effects by exploring domain-specific proficiencies in reading and math. In particular, proficiency probability scores were created to represent a hierarchical progression of knowledge and skills at the beginning of kindergarten. As shown in Appendix Table 4,   whereas subsidy receipt is expected to decrease the probability of reaching proficiency in number and shape recognition (the least complex mathematical task) by 4 percentage points, the impact estimate becomes substantially larger in the relative size (13 percentage points) and ordinality (11 percentage points) domains before decreasing once again in multiplication/division (the most complex mathematical task)."}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneous Effects of Child Care Subsidy Receipt", "text": "Our results so far have assumed that the impact of child care subsidies on child well-being is the same for all children. However, the estimates may vary with the characteristics of the child and mother. To explore this possibility, we estimate 2SLS models for subsets of the full ECLS-K analysis sample. In particular, we examine differential effects of subsidy receipt by children's gender, mothers' educational attainment, and families' socioeconomic status (SES). These analyses are particularly important for instrumental variables given that the impact estimates apply only to the group of unmarried mothers whose subsidy decisions are influenced by the distance instrument. As such, 2SLS estimates are often referred to as the local average treatment effects (LATE) (Angrist & Imbens, 1994). We might be concerned that this subset of unmarried mothers differs from the full sample of unmarried mothers in important ways. In particular, the OLS and IV estimates might differ because OLS recovers the average effect of subsidy receipt, while the IV results apply to a non-representative subset of the sample. It is plausible, in other words, that child care subsidies are beneficial for large numbers of disadvantaged children while showing detrimental effects among specific groups. We address this concern by estimating the 2SLS model on sub-groups of children in our ECLS-K sample. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 present the subsidy estimates separately for boys and girls, respectively. Results in these columns reveal an interesting role for gender in the impact of child care subsidies. In the cognitive domain, boys' math scores are more negatively affected by subsidy receipt. In fact, the coefficient on subsidy receipt for boys is more than double that for girls and is highly statistically significant. Conversely, the impact of subsidy receipt on reading test scores is larger for girls by about 0.10 standard deviations. In addition, subsidy receipt has large negative effects on the behavioral outcomes for boys, while the effects for girls are small in magnitude and usually imprecisely estimated. The finding of a pronounced effect of work-related subsidies on boys' behavior is consistent with several studies which find that boys tend to be more adversely affected by early maternal employment (Blau & Grossberg, 1992;Brooks-Gunn et al., 2002;Desai et al., 1989;Hill & Duncan, 1987;Richards & Duckett, 1991;. It is plausible child care subsidies aggravate the gender disparity in the development of behavior problems (Buchnical et al., 2000;Scarr & Eisenberg, 2003). Several studies find that the negative effects of child care participation and maternal employment are concentrated among economically advantaged children (Anderson et al., 2003;Bernal & Keane, 2009;Brooks-Gunn, et al., 2002;Ruhm, 2004;. It is plausible that such heterogeneity exists with respect to child care subsidies. To explore this possibility, we first estimate the 2SLS models separately for low-and high-skilled mothers. Low-skilled mothers are defined as those with a high school degree or less, and high-skilled mothers are those with at least some college education. We then estimate the models separately for children drawn from the bottom and top quintiles of the SES distribution. As shown in columns (3) through (6), our results largely confirm those in previous work. Looking first at the findings stratified by maternal education, it appears that child care subsidies have similar effects on cognitive ability test scores for children with low-and high-skilled mothers. In the behavioral domain, however, the impact of subsidy receipt is concentrated among children with highskilled mothers. In particular, the estimated effect of subsidy utilization is large and statistically significant for externalizing behavior problems, approaches to learning, self-control, and family-based care. Finally, note that the marginal productivity of maternal time is assumed to be positive in the child production function. It is reasonable to further assume that this marginal productivity is greater for high-skilled (and high SES) mothers. If this is the case, then the subsidyinduced reduction in maternal time inputs (and the attending rise in intensive paid employment) would be expected to adversely affect children in high SES families."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Analyses", "text": "We subject the main results to a number of specification checks to ensure robustness. Results from this exercise are presented in Table 6. The plausibility of our 2SLS estimates hinges on the validity of our identifying assumption that, conditional on the observable family and neighborhood controls and state fixed effects, the distance instruments can be excluded from the child production function. This assumption cannot be tested directly, but we offer some indirect evidence through a falsification test. If our identification strategy is valid, then a variable predicting child care subsidy receipt should not affect children in families that are highly unlikely to be eligible for assistance. Since all families in the ECLS-K have children, we focus the falsification test on two-parent families in the top two quintiles of the SES distribution. We first estimate the first-stage subsidy receipt equation on the sample of single mothers in order to calculate a predicted probability of subsidy receipt for the subset of two-parent families in the top SES quintiles. We then include this variable in the child production function. The falsification test provides no evidence against the validity of our identification strategy: in no case do we find that predicted subsidy receipt negatively influences the well-being of children in high SES two-parent families. 25 Although our expanded instrument set can increase the efficiency of the IV estimates, it can also lead 2SLS to perform poorly. In particular, the \"many-and-weak-instruments\" problem is shown to produce bias in the 2SLS estimates that converge to the OLS estimates as the number of identifying instruments increases (Bound et al., 1995;Hansen et al., 2006). We deal with this concern by using an alternative to 2SLS, the jackknife instrumental variables estimator (JIVE), to examine the impact of child care subsidy receipt on child well-being. The JIVE exhibits finitesample properties superior to those of 2SLS and comparable to alternative estimators such as limited information maximum likelihood in the presence of many weakly correlated instruments (Angrist et al., 1999). The JIVE estimator has also been shown to perform well in Monte Carlo simulations (Poi, 2006). Column (1) in Table 6 presents the JIVE estimates for the impact of subsidy receipt. These results are largely consistent with those of 2SLS, although in most cases the magnitude of the subsidy estimates are slightly larger, suggesting that the 2SLS estimates may be biased toward OLS. Until this point, our IV estimates have been based on mothers' travel distance to the nearest social service agency. As previously discussed, some mothers have multiple agencies from which to choose in the county of residence. For these mothers, we have assumed that the relevant agency is the one closest to the residential location. We believe this is a plausible assumption. However, to make more explicit use of the presence of multiple administrative offices, we estimate the IV models using the sum of the inverse distances as an alternative instrument. 26 An advantage of this measure is that it gives more weight to distances closer to mothers' residential location. As shown in column (2), results using this measure are not substantially different from the main findings. To the extent that our instrumental variables are orthogonal to child well-being, our estimation strategy should produce consistent estimates of the impact of subsidy receipt. We guard against the possibility that the distance instrument is correlated with unobserved child and maternal characteristics by including in the model a detailed set of family, neighborhood, and school controls. To further strengthen our confidence, we incorporate additional controls for parental participation in several cash assistance programs (TANF and food stamps) in column (3) of Table 6. In addition to controlling for unobserved work and welfare preferences that may influence child well-being, inclusion of these variables should account for the possibility that parents need to travel to the same social service agencies to apply for cash assistance. If welfare or food stamp participation is correlated with both the distance measure and various dimensions of child well-being, then failure to include these in the production function would invalidate our distance instrument. Fortunately, our main results do not change when TANF and food stamp participation are included in the model. Next, we explore the impact of omitting Head Start children from the analysis. Note that about 10 percent of children in our analysis sample are enrolled in Head Start. A very small number of these children (11) report receiving subsidies for their Head Start services. Such a small number is auspicious given that Head Start is a fully subsidized program for which CCDF child care subsidies are not necessary to help defray program costs. Therefore, we believe these children have been erroneously coded as receiving a subsidy. Our main results are robust to the exclusion of these 11 children from the analysis. In addition, we test the sensitivity of our results to the exclusion of all Head Start children from the analysis sample. This exercise is important because, while the presence of Head Start might be relevant to the decision to apply for child care assistance, it is considerably less important to mothers' work and child care decisions after obtaining a subsidy. As shown in column (4) of Table 6, our results remain very similar when we exclude Head Start children altogether. We also estimate models in which children living in non-urban areas are excluded from the analysis. We do so because families living in urban neighborhoods are presumably more homogeneous with respect to family and neighborhood attributes that influence both the travel distance to social service agencies and measures of child well-being. In particular, it is plausible that urban families face relatively similar psychic and monetary costs associated with accessing major roadways and public transportation. Therefore, an urban sample is less likely to suffer from endogenous location choices and unobserved neighborhood characteristics that affect child wellbeing. Our empirical estimates are once again robust to this change in sample definition, as shown in column (5) of Table 6. Until this point, all 2SLS models have included a control for the (log of) total family income. Unfortunately, the ECLS-K does not allow researchers to identify the individual sources of parental income, including labor market earnings and various sources of non-wage income. Ideally, we would prefer to omit sources of income that change as a result of utilizing a child care subsidy. For example, the employment effects of subsidy receipt may cause earnings to increase while reducing the amount of income drawn from traditional cash assistance programs. To the extent that subsidized families experience an increase in disposable income, these additional resources can be spent on goods and services that might positively impact child well-being. This is one of the anticipated channels through which subsidy receipt can influence child outcomes. However, the permanent component of family income is likely to be correlated with subsidy receipt and child well-being. Failure to account for such resources may therefore bias the IV estimates. To assess whether our results are robust to the exclusion of total family income, we estimate the 2SLS models without this control. As reported in column (6), exclusion of income as a right-hand-side variable does not significantly alter our results"}, {"section_title": "Longer-Term Effects of Child Care Subsidy Receipt", "text": "The results discussed so far indicate that child care subsidies lower cognitive ability test scores and increase teacher-reported behavior problems in the year following their utilization. An important question is whether these negative effects persist throughout the school-age years. To address this question, we estimate the 2SLS models using the available outcomes measured in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first, third, and fifth grade. Note that the assessments of psychomotor skills are not administered beyond the fall of kindergarten, but all other outcomes measures are available through the fifth grade survey wave. As shown in Table 7, the impact of child care subsidy receipt persists throughout kindergarten. As of the end of kindergarten, subsidized children continue to experience lower reading and math test scores and increased behavior problems. The effects remain sizeable and statistically significant at conventional levels. However, one year later-at the end of first gradethese negative effects largely disappear. The remaining negative and statistically significant effects are found for the measures of self-control and interpersonal skills. The impact of subsidy receipt continues to attenuate in both magnitude and statistical significance throughout the third and fifth grade. In fact, by the end of fifth grade, the effect sizes are substantially smaller than was the case in the fall of kindergarten, and none of the subsidy coefficients are precisely estimated. The evidence presented in Table 7 partially alleviates the concerns raised by the large, negative short-run effects of subsidy receipt. It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a full assessment of the explanations underlying the attenuation of subsidy effects over time. Nevertheless, we offer several observations about these results. First, it is possible that subsidy receipt during the preschool years has a so-called \"sleeper\" effect on children's long-term development. In other words, the attenuation of subsidy effects throughout the first few years of children's schooling may not be representative of its full effects later in life. Future research should therefore consider the possibility that the negative effects of early subsidy receipt might reemerge in other ways as children age. Second, our finding of a declining impact of subsidy receipt is mirrored by studies evaluating other early childhood interventions. For example, recent work finds that the early effects of prekindergarten programs (Barnett, 1995;Magnuson et al., 2007b) and Head Start (Barnett & Camilli, 2002;Currie & Thomas, 1995) tend to fade out within a few years. However, whereas children in these programs experience declining benefits over time, the subsidized children in our study experience declining negative effects. To explain the lack of persistence in program effects, most researchers distinguish between \"fade out\" and \"catch up,\" with the former indicating that the school performance of children who attended early interventions decreases to the level of their peers, and the latter implying that the school performance of non-participants improves relative to program participants. That subsidized children finish first grade at parity with their unsubsidized counterparts-after falling behind throughout kindergarten-strongly suggests that these children \"catch up\" to their peers. 27 A final and related point is that early school experiences likely play a critical role in the extent to which subsidized children are able to catch up. Previous work finds that classroom characteristics matter greatly for whether the positive effects of pre-kindergarten persist over time (e.g., Magnuson et al., 2007b). Thus, it seems plausible that subsidized children placed in high-quality classrooms might be able to fully erase the subsidy-induced academic and behavioral deficits that emerge throughout kindergarten. Such issues are fruitful avenues for future research."}, {"section_title": "VI. Summary and Discussion of Policy Implications", "text": "Parental decisions regarding employment and child care can have important implications for children's well-being. Given that child care subsidies are found to affect both decisions, they also have the ability to shape the developmental trajectory of young children. whereas the key feature of CCDF child care subsidies is the rapid facilitation of disadvantaged mothers to move from welfare to work. Consequently, there are reasons to be concerned about the consequences of child care subsidies for low-income children's short-and long-term well-being. Using rich longitudinal data from the ECLS-K, this paper provides a comprehensive examination of the impact of subsidy receipt on child development. To identify the effect of child care subsidies, we use a novel instrumental variable based on the distance between mothers' residential location and the nearest social service agency that administers the subsidy application process. Our empirical results suggest that subsidy receipt in the year prior to kindergarten entry substantially reduces reading and math test scores and increases a variety of behavior problems at the start of kindergarten. Our estimates indicate that subsidized children score approximately 0.4 to 0.5 standard deviations lower on reading and math tests, and 0.3 to 0.7 standard deviations higher on measures of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The sub-group analyses indicate that the deleterious effects of subsidies tend to be larger for boys and children living in high SES families. Although the negative effects of subsidy receipt persist throughout kindergarten, our results show that they largely disappear by the end of first grade. These results have potentially important implications for child care subsidy policy in the U.S. In particular, the current policy regime intensifies the tension between the twin goals of child care: enabling parents to work and promoting child development. Consistent with the primary goal of welfare reform, the CCDF focuses almost exclusively on facilitating parental employment, while placing few restrictions on child care quality and deemphasizing low-income children's health and well-being. Indeed, eligibility for CCDF subsidies is conditioned on participation in a work-related activity, and as discussed in Section II, there is an array of design features embedded in the CCDF that may discourage parents from purchasing and providers from offering high-quality care. Such design features stand in stark contrast with states' pre-kindergarten programs and \"two generation\" service-based programs such as Head Start. These services are child-development-related and hence generally do not mandate parental employment. There are a few compelling reasons why the government may wish to establish employmentrelated child care subsidies. This type of intervention in the child care market is often justified on the grounds that subsidies increase long-term economic self-sufficiency by generating human capital. Evidence from subsidy take-up data suggests that human capital development is occurring through 39 two channels: fully 80 percent of recipients use child care subsidies for direct work experience, while 12 percent are engaged in education and job training programs. These activities, in turn, might lead to future earnings and tax revenue that exceed the short-run cost of providing child care assistance, thus increasing government's net savings in the long-run (Robins, 1991). Consistent with the concerns raised by Blau (2001) not just those within the subsidy system. It is reasonable to assume that, once informed, parents will increase their demand for high-quality care, and child care providers will be more likely to provide it.

Based on our discussions with Geocoder analysts, we concluded that the Google-based geocodes were of higher-quality, so we use these as the basis for making the distance calculations. Of the 3,659 social service agencies (unique or repeated) in our database, 2,887 (approximately 80 percent) were able to be geocoded to its exact location (i.e., typically to 30 feet or less). Another 543 agencies (15 percent) were goecoded to roughly block-or street-level accuracy. For 229 agencies (six percent), only the city or zip code was available to be geocoded, decreasing locational precision to as many as a few miles. In sum, approximately 95 percent of social service agencies were geocoded with a level of precision at the block-level or better. A potential concern with the geocoding process is that the agency addresses would not match those found in Geocoder's database. For example, slight errors in spelling or formatting in a set of agency addresses could cause a different set of addresses to be geocoded. Fortunately, Geocoder provided us with a measure called the Levenshtein-Damerau, which calculates the \"edit distance\" (or level of textual discrepancy) between the addresses provided and the addresses actually assigned geocodes. We used this measure to double-check the accuracy of agency addresses that were assigned low scores, and we corrected any errors that were discovered. Generally speaking, we found this measure to be quite sensitive to small inconsistencies between the provided and geocoded addresses. Therefore, our data checks were extensive. In the final step, we calculated the distance between the location of social service agencies and the residential location of each family in our analysis samples. Given that we plan to use this distance measure with a number of datasets (e.g., Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort and Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study), we utilized the following approach. Users of the ECLS-K and FFCW contract data are able to observe families' residential locations at the census tract-level. Since child care subsidies are distributed by agencies organized at the county-level, we use the county as the geographic boundary for calculating the distances. As a result, we calculated the Euclidean (or as-the-crow-flies) distance (in miles) between the location of social service agencies and every census tract centroid in the county in which each agency resides. For example, La Paz County in Arizona has one social service agency and six census tracts. Therefore, our database contains six sets of distances associated with this agency: one for each census tract. In Maryland, Montgomery County also has one social serve agency but 176 census tracts. Our database contains the distance from this agency to each census tract in the county. Jurisdictions with multiple agencies have a set of distance calculations for each agency. For example, Baltimore City has nine agencies and nearly 200 census tracts, leading to approximately 1,800 separate agency-tract calculations. In addition to calculating the distance, we produced the census tract identification number associated with each agency-tract combination. We use the census tract code to merge the distance measure with families in our analysis samples. Although this process was extremely time-intensive, the results provide us with the flexibility to append the distance measure to virtually any dataset with census tract codes."}]
