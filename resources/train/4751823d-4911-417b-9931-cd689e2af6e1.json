[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To examine the association between vascular pathology and rate of cognitive decline in older adults independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Community sample. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals from the Einstein Aging Study autopsy series (N = 62).\nThe Blessed Information-MemoryConcentration (BIMC) test was used to assess global cognitive status. AD pathology was quantified according to Braak stage (<3 vs \u2265 3). Vascular pathology was quantified using a previously reported macrovascular lesion (MVL) score. The association between vascular pathology and antemortem rates of cognitive decline adjusted for level of AD pathology was assessed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Mean age was 81.8 at enrollment and 89.0 at death. Participants with more than two MVLs had faster cognitive decline than those with no MVLs (difference in annual rate of change in BIMC 0.74 points/yr, P = .03). Braak stage was also associated with cognitive decline (difference 0.57 points/yr, P = .03). The difference in rate of cognitive decline between those with more than two MVLs and those free of vascular lesions persisted after adjustment for AD pathology (difference in rate of change in BIMC 0.68 points/yr, P = .04). The effect of vascular pathology on cognitive decline was not significantly different according to AD pathology. CONCLUSION: Vascular brain pathology is associated with rate of cognitive decline after adjusting for level of AD pathology.

For analysis, Braak NFT stage was dichotomized as low (<3) or high (\u22653).\nIschemic vascular lesions were identified according to macroscopic examination of 0.5-cm-thick coronal sections of cerebral hemispheres and transverse sections of brainstem and cerebellum. The three types of MVLs used for the purpose of this study were ischemic vascular lesions (large infarcts and lacunar infarcts) and leukoencephalopathy. Circumscribed areas of softening (encephalomalacia), whether cystic or partially cystic, with maximum diameter >1 cm were classified as large infarcts. Lacunar infarcts were defined as cystic lesions < 1 cm in diameter. Lacunar infarcts, which correlate with the presence of small vessel arteriosclerotic vascular disease, were most often found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pontine base, and periventricular white matter. Leukoencephalopathy was assessed based on the presence of rarefaction of the white matter, dilation of perivascular spaces in the white matter, and presence of reactive astrocytes and less often macrophages. Acute and subacute infarcts, lacunes, microinfarcts, or hemorrhages near the time of death were noted but not included in the vascular scores or analyses.

A random intercept and random slope were used to account for within-person variation. Robust empirical estimates of standard errors were used to take into account the skewed distribution in BIMC score. 19 The association between MVL and Braak stage and cognitive decline were evaluated separately and jointly. Possible interactions between MVL score and Braak stage were evaluated by including an interaction term between MVL and Braak stage and time and by examining the association between MVL and cognitive trajectory within each Braak stage group separately.\nA priori level of statistical significance was set at .05.

The rate of global cognitive decline in participants with one or two MVLs was slightly faster than but not significantly different from the rate of decline in those with no vascular lesions.

Furthermore, the effect of macrovascular brain pathology on cognitive decline persisted after adjustment for level of AD pathology.\nThe observation that vascular pathology is associated with rate of cognitive decline independent of AD pathology is consistent with results of other prospective autopsy series. [20] [21] [22] In the Religious Orders Study, the likelihood of dementia was greater with greater AD pathology and more macroscopic infarcts. 20 The same group has also reported that microinfarcts, particularly multiple cortical microinfarcts, increased the odds of dementia independent of AD pathology. 10 In the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, AD and microinfarcts contributed independently to dementia risk, 21 and another study 22 also reported that cerebrovascular disease, AD, and hippocampal sclerosis each contributed independently to cognitive status. Although the relationship between vascular lesions and cognitive decline was defined qualitatively in these studies (multiple lesions having a greater effect than no lesions or a single lesion), results from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 23 showed that there is a direct relationship between number of macroscopic infarcts and odds of dementia. In line with the latter study, the current study results indicated that having more MVLs (>2) was associated with cognitive decline independent of AD pathology.\nAn important question is how vascular and AD pathologies combine to cause cognitive decline. Prior clinical-pathological studies did not yield consistent results regarding an interaction between vascular and AD pathologies in relation to clinical cognitive performance. The Nun Study 24 found that cerebral infarction significantly increased the likelihood of dementia only in individuals with higher levels of AD pathology, but other studies such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 23 the Religious Orders Study, 25 and the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Aging Study 26 did not find evidence that the effect of vascular pathology depended upon the extent of AD pathology with respect to cognitive function. The current data also suggest that the effect of macrovascular brain pathology on cognitive function is uniform in groups with low or high burden of AD pathology. The disparities between prior studies might be due to differences between sample types (community vs clinical cohorts), 27 use of different pathological criteria (subcortical vs cortical vascular lesions), 23 or limitations of small sample size for detecting differences. These incongruent results indicate that further work in larger communitybased samples is required to clarify the interaction between vascular and AD pathology in relation to cognitive performance.\nThe current study supports that addressing vascular risk factors may help prevent or delay cognitive decline. AD and cerebrovascular disease share common risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperhomocystinemia, 28, 29 which are all potentially modifiable. Regardless of whether AD and vascular pathologies are additive or synergistic, these findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that strategies to address these risk factors may reduce the risk of cognitive decline or slow the onset of clinical dementia.\nThe strengths of this study include the detailed assessment of clinical and neuropathological data by experienced examiners and use of validated diagnostic procedures. Although the findings are promising, a few limitations should be noted. First, the temporal sequence of the pathologies before death was unknown, because this was a clinical-pathological correlation study. Thus, it was not possible to assess the concurrent associations between pathology and cognitive performance during antemortem follow-up. Second, neuropathological evaluations were performed on one hemisphere. Third, identification of vascular pathology was based on gross brain sections, which is likely to have resulted in underestimation of the association between vascular lesions and clinical diagnosis of dementia. Use of techniques such as myelin staining of brain sections would improve quantification of white matter pathology, but these techniques may not have clinical or imaging correlates. In this study, the primary focus was on MVLs and Braak staging as measures of vascular burden and AD, but other measures such microscopic vascular lesions and senile plaque burden might also play a significant role in the observed interactions. Therefore, further studies are required to clarify the role of and interactions between other types of pathological lesions in cognitive decline. Finally, the sample size was small and therefore might have been underpowered to detect interactions between vascular burden and NFT pathology. This small sample size also makes comparison between subgroups of dementia types difficult."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In summary, vascular pathology, a common neuropathological finding in older adults, increases the rate of cognitive decline independent of AD pathology.
