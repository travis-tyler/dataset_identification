Numerous technological advances have made possible the quantification of amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration in vivo using imaging and fluid biomarkers. In AD, biomarkers are classified as biomarkers of amyloid accumulation (i.e CSF Ab , [ [2, 3] .\nJack [2] proposed a dynamic biomarker model of Alzheimer's based on vivo biomarker observations conducted in elderly normal individuals as well as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia patients. Jacks' model corroborates the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which posits that the accumulation of b-amyloid acts as an initiating 'upstream' event leading to 'downstream' events such neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive impairment [2, 4] . The dynamic biomarker model of AD describes amyloid accumulation as the dominant biomarker in individuals with predementia, while the combination of amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration characterize the dementia stage of AD [2] . Moreover, this model predicts a plateau of amyloid accumulation and the onset of brain neurodegeneration as part of the MCI stage of AD [2] . However, the dynamics of amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration within the MCI stage are not well understood.\nBased on the data analysis conducted by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), the concept of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) was first introduced by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-Go and ADNI-2 the distinction being made on the basis of modest or advanced impairment of delayed recall of logical memory [5, 6] . The concept of EMCI will bridge the gap between normal elderly and LMCI subjects who are more amnestic than EMCI subjects [5] . It should be emphasized that while EMCI subjects still meet criteria for amnestic MCI, they represent a very early point in the clinical spectrum of AD [5, 6] . The primary purpose of this classification in ADNI-Go and ADNI-2 is to elucidate the disease mechanisms present at a very early stage of AD (i.e. EMCI), with the attendant objective of improving the efficiency of diseasemodification interventions [5, 6] .\nAlthough several studies have focused on MCI and healthy elderly control, the status of brain amyloid deposition remains unknown at the early stage of MCI. The study from Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Research Group showed that the amyloid load of subjects with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), a syndrome characterized by subjective memory complaint but no objective memory impairment, was similar to healthy elderly controls, and thus lower than levels found in MCI and AD [7] . Longitudinal studies using [ 11 C]PIB PET have shown no uptake differences during the follow-up of MCI patients who eventually converted to AD, suggesting that amyloid load plateau has been already reached in the late stage of MCI [8, 9] . In fact, these findings suggest that LMCI may represent an intermediate state between cognitively normal individuals and MCI.\nThe existence of synaptic degeneration in EMCI remains to be clarified, particularly due to the presence of mild but objective memory deficits in these individuals. [ 18 F]FDG PET provides qualitative and quantitative estimates of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption, an index of synaptic functioning and density, which has been proven to be highly related with the clinical symptoms and taken as the symptoms-sensitive measurement in MCI [10, 11] . Several studies have shown that MCI patients displayed cerebral hypometabolism bilaterally in the parieto-temporal areas, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial temporal lobe, and even frontal lobe [10, [12] [13] [14] . It has been suggested that glucose metabolism is a sensitive measure of change in cognition and functional ability in MCI, and has value in predicting future cognitive decline [10, 14] . Furthermore, MCI subjects with abnormal glucose metabolism were more likely to convert to AD than subjects who had normal glucose uptake [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, [\n18 F]FDG PET provides significant information regarding the clinical characterization of synaptic dysfunction already present in EMCI [3, 15] .\nThe main objectives of the present study are thus to examine global and voxel-based neocortical amyloid burden and metabolism within separate groups of cognitively normal (CN), EMCI, LMCI, and AD. We intend to capture the dynamics of amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration within the MCI stage. Assuming the premises of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, we expect a predominance of amyloid accumulation in the EMCI phase."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database Description", "text": "Participants were recruited between September 2009 and November 2011 through ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 from 56 centers in the USA and Canada [16] .

It is relatively well established that abnormal amyloid load is linked to APOE4 status as well as age [23] . A fraction of these individuals might carry, as recently described, reactive amyloidosis [24] . However, the interpretation of these finding remains elusive given the lack of long term longitudinal studies of cognitively normal individuals carriers of high load of amyloid pathology. The amyloid load of subjects with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) was similar to that found in healthy elderly controls, remaining at a lower level compared with MCI and AD [7] . Longitudinal studies of non-demented older adults have shown that amyloid deposition increases slowly from cognitive normality and precedes cognitive impairment [25, 26] . Some of these reports have demonstrated an annual increase of amyloid deposition, in terms of [ 11 C]PIB retention, of 0.9% per year in non-demented older adults, with the amyloid deposition localized to prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and occipital cortices as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortices [26] . However, it is not known how early in the disease course amyloid deposition can be detected. In the present study, the amyloid burden associated with EMCI is relatively lower than LMCI and higher compared to CN. This finding indicates that amyloid deposition characterizes EMCI stage and will possibly continue to accumulate during the progression from EMCI to LMCI [27] .\nA 2 year follow-up longitudinal [ 11 C]PIB PET study showed amyloid load in mild AD remained relatively stable, suggesting that amyloid deposition in the brain might reach a plateau before the early clinical stages of AD [28] . The concept of amyloid plateau has been further supported by cross sectional studies showing similar amyloid load between MCI and AD, [7, 29, 30] . Interestingly, other longitudinal studies of MCI cohorts also suggest that the baseline amyloid load could be a predictor of dementia conversion [8, 9, 21, 31] . Together with the previous studies, the absence of group differences in terms of global amyloid retention between LMCI and AD in the present study indicates that amyloid load reaches a plateau at LMCI but not EMCI stage [9, 21, 29] . Therefore, the findings in the present study further support the dynamic biomarker model of AD, which posits that the amyloid plateau has already been reached in MCI [2] .\nInterestingly, we found higher amyloid load in ACC/PCC and the inferior part of the frontal lobe in EMCI versus CN, along with higher amyloid burden in temporal and parietal lobe, and superior part of frontal lobe in LMCI versus EMCI. This regional pattern of amyloid deposition is consistent with the pathological process described by autopsy studies where amyloid deposition progress from middle to lateral, from anterior to posterior and from basal to top of the brain [32] ."}, {"section_title": "Brain Metabolism in EMCI", "text": "The lack of metabolism decrements in EMCI versus CN is possibly associated with a small magnitude in the [\n18 F]FDG metabolism present in early MCI stages as well as the etiological variability within the MCI group. Indeed, variability across studies regarding brain metabolism in MCI occur due to the differences on the diagnostic criteria as well as the variations in clinical severity of the MCI subjects enrolled [12, 13, 33, 34] . Our estimates of global [ 18 F]FDG excluded metabolically stable brain regions in AD in order to increase the sensitivity for detecting hypometabolism. In fact, [ 18 F]FDG-PET studies have shown that medial temporal lobe (MTL), inferior parietal cortex and PCC are vulnerable to hypometabolism and thus appropriated for the identification of MCI, while the utility of other cortical deficits was deemed debatable [34] [35] [36] . Moreover, studies focusing on the temporal aspects of progression from MCI to AD conversion have suggested that impairment of [ 18 F]FDG uptake in temporoparietal association cortices predicted a rapid progression to dementia in MCI patients and could, therefore, serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of prodromal AD [10, 15, 37] .\nThe most interesting finding of our study is a specific dissociation between brain amyloid deposition and metabolism in EMCI stage. The amyloid load in absence of hypometabolism further supports the view that amyloid deposition precedes neuronal dysfunction in the early stage of MCI [38] . Similarly, the dissociation between amyloid load and metabolic reductions was also demonstrated by another study, in which only 54% of the [ 11 C]PIB positive MCI patients also showed [\n18 F]FDG reductions [34] .\nLower [ 18 F]FDG uptake, primarily in bilateral PCC/precuneus and hippocampus, in LMCI versus EMCI supports that brain metabolic dysfunction develop in these regions during the MCI stage and thus might serve as a biomarker to monitor the disease progression from EMCI to LMCI. The present study also raises the question about the role of amyloid plaque formation in the synaptic dysfunction [39] . The group differences between EMCI and LMCI reported in this study support the assumption that brain amyloid deposition is linked with synaptic damage, especially in the PCC/precuneus and hippocampus during the MCI stage, which is of paramount importance vis \u00e0 vis the use of [ 18 F]FDG PET in clinical trials. Neuronal toxicity might be mediated by high oligomeric forms of Ab [40] [41] ."}, {"section_title": "Implications for the Clinical Trial of Disease Modifying Prevention", "text": "It is accepted that the use of disease-modifying treatments during the dementia stage of AD may not be adequate, since extensive brain damage has already been established and that the best target population for disease-modifying therapy are those at the MCI stage [3, 42] . It is reasonable to assume that the maximal benefit of disease-modifying therapy targeting the amyloid pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying AD should be obtained in the earlier stage before the amyloid load reaches a plateau and irreversible pathological changes occur [3] . The findings in the present study therefore have several important implications. Firstly, the classification of EMCI is a useful concept in terms of early intervention with anti-amyloid therapy. In other words, antiamyloid therapy should be administered in EMCI instead of LMCI in order to maximize the likelihood of slowing or halt amyloid deposition and thus the downstream pathophysiological processes including the decline of brain metabolism. It is likely that intervention in the late stage of disease would have to target other pathological processes since the amyloid load will have reached a plateau at LMCI stage [7] . Secondly, amyloid imaging can be utilized as a diagnostic biomarker for identifying EMCI individuals, whereas [ 18 F]FDG PET imaging might be used as an endpoint biomarker to monitor the rate of disease progression and detect treatment effects in clinical trials for EMCI [3] ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "There are several limitations in the interpretation of the present study, which should be acknowledged. Firstly, since the ADNI-GO was initiated 2 years ago and [\n18 F]AV45 and [ 18 F]FDG imaging are to be performed only every two years from baseline, the present data are cross-sectional. Thus, the follow-up of these EMCI patients in ADNI-2 will be of paramount importance to record the real progress of amyloid deposition and metabolism. Secondly, although EMCI patients were carefully selected according to objective memory impairment and exclusion of any significant neurological disease other than suspected incipient AD, EMCI are still likely to encompass heterogeneous etiologies, thereby masking AD-specific findings to some degree. Since no genetic data of new subjects recruited from ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 are currently available for analysis, the impact of Apoe4 on the amyloid deposition is not included in the present study [43] . Finally, despite of the optimal binding to the fibrillary Ab deposits, [ 18 F]AV45 does not reveal hippocampal Ab 1-42 deposits."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study explored the global and voxel-based cortical amyloid burden and metabolism within separate groups of CN, EMCI, LMCI, and AD.
