[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We conducted genome sequencing to search for rare variation contributing to early onset Alzheimer's 21 disease (EOAD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Discovery analysis was conducted on 493 cases and 22 671 controls of European ancestry. Burden testing for rare variation associated with disease was 23 conducted using filters based on variant rarity (less than 1 in 10,000 or private), computational prediction of 24 deleteriousness (CADD 10 or 15 thresholds), and molecular function (protein loss-of-function only, coding 25 alteration only, or coding plus non-coding variants in experimentally predicted regulatory regions). 26\nReplication analysis was conducted on 16,871 independent cases and 15,941 independent controls. Rare 27 variants in TET2 were enriched in the discovery combined EOAD and FTD cohort (p=6.5x10 -8 , genome-28 wide corrected p=0.0037). Most of these variants were canonical loss-of-function or non-coding in 29 predicted regulatory regions. This enrichment replicated across several cohorts of AD and FTD (replication 30 only p=0.0071). The combined analysis odds ratio was 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.2) for AD and FTD. The odds 31 ratio for qualifying non-coding variants considered independently from coding variants was 2.1 (95% CI 32 1.2-3.9). For loss-of-function variants, the combined odds ratio (for AD, FTD, and amyotrophic lateral 33 sclerosis, which shares clinicopathological overlap with FTD) was 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.3). TET2 catalyzes 34 DNA demethylation. Given well-defined changes in DNA methylation that occur during aging, rare variation 35 in TET2 may confer risk for neurodegeneration by altering the homeostasis of key aging-related processes. 36\nAdditionally, our study emphasizes the relevance of non-coding variation in genetic studies of complex 37 disease. 38\nHere we leveraged a large cohort of 683 patients, many of which have an early age of disease 58 onset (<65), and 856 healthy adult controls (with no known neurological abnormalities) that have 59 undergone genome sequencing to probe both coding and non-coding rare and predicted deleterious 60 variants across the genome for association with disease risk. We assessed variant associations between 61 EOAD and FTD vs. controls both separately and together (all cases versus controls), with the hypothesis 62 that genetic pleiotropy-where variation in a single gene associates with multiple, different phenotypes-63 may play a role, as previously described for neurodegenerative diseases [11][12][13][14][15] . 64 65 METHODS 66\nThe majority of cases were selected from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) 68\nMemory and Aging Center with an intentional selection of early-onset cases when possible to maximize the 69 likelihood of identifying genetic contributors, along with healthy older adult controls (a total of 664 cases 70 and 102 controls, with 71 of these cases previously described in 9 ). All UCSF cases and controls were 71 clinically assessed using methods described in 9 . This cohort was intentionally depleted of cases with 72 known Mendelian variants associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and any cases with known 73\nMendelian variants identified after genome sequencing were excluded (see Results). A small number of 74 samples (19 cases and 21 controls) were obtained from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) 75 from an expert clinician who employed the same diagnostic procedures (case studies described in 16 ). The 76 resulting cohort was enriched for early-onset cases with a median age of presentation of 60 (range 45-84) 77 for AD and 66 (range 29-89) for FTD. Additional neurologically healthy controls sequenced at 78\nHudsonAlpha were also included from two cohorts: a healthy aging control set from the National Institute of 79\nMental Health (NIMH) (132 controls) and healthy unaffected parents from a childhood disease study where 80 de novo mutations are the most common cause of disease 17 , making these parents reasonably 81 representative population controls (601 controls). All participants or their surrogates provided written 82 informed consent to participate in this study and the institutional review boards at each site approved all 83 aspects of the study. 84 85\nThe majority of genome sequencing was performed at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology 87 on the Illumina HiSeq X platform (1,468 samples from UCSF, UAB, NIMH, and HudsonAlpha), while a 88 small subset was sequenced at the New York Genome Center, also on the HiSeq X platform (71 samples 89 from UCSF, described previously in 9 ). Mean depth was 34X with an average of 92% of bases covered at 90 20X. Sequencing libraries at HudsonAlpha were prepared by Covaris shearing, end repair, adapter ligation, 91 and PCR using standard protocols. Library concentrations were normalized using KAPA qPCR prior to 92 sequencing. All variants meeting either Mendelian diagnostic criteria or variants in top hits from the 93 discovery cohort were validated by Sanger sequencing. 94 95\nAll sequencing reads from both sequencing centers were aligned to the hg19 reference genome 97 with bwa-0.7.12 18 . BAMs were sorted and duplicates were marked with Sambamba 0.5.4 19 . Indels were 98 realigned, bases were recalibrated, and gVCFs were generated with GATK 3.3 20 . Variants were called 99 across all samples in a single batch with GATK 3.8 using the -newQual flag to minimize false negative 100 singleton calls. The VCF was quality filtered with a genotype level requirement for 95% of sites to have a 101 minimum GQ of 20 and DP of 10 (applied using VCFtools 0.1.15 21 ), and a variant level filter of VQSLOD > -102 3. The small number of missing genotypes remaining after that quality filtering step were assumed to be 103 reference (filled with bcftools 1.6-19 22 ) in order to avoid errors in downstream processing using the package 104 GEMINI 0.20.2 23 which adds missing genotypes to non-reference counts with its burden function. Goleft 105 indexcov 0.1.17 24 was used for sex checks and samples failing sex checks were excluded. KING 2.1.2 25 106 was used to check for familial relationships and related individuals (up to 4 th degree relatives using IBD 107 segment analysis) were excluded. Ancestry was elucidated by both principal component analysis using 108 plink 1.9 26 compared to 1000 genomes data 27 (using common variation overlapping with 1000 genomes 109 calls) and analysis using ADMIXTURE 1.3.0 28 (Supplemental Figure 1) , and only samples from the largest 110 cluster (European ancestry) were retained for discovery analysis to minimize potential confounding 111 population effects. 112 113 Annotation, filtering, and burden analysis 114\nIn order to facilitate annotation and burden analysis, multi-allelic sites were split using Vt 29 . All 115 variants were annotated with CADD v1.3 30 , including all indels. SnpEff 4.3s 31 was used to annotate with the 116\nGRCh37.75 gene model. Population database frequency annotations included 1000 genomes phase 3, 117\nTOPMed Bravo 32 (lifted over from hg38 to hg19 using CrossMap 0.2.7 33 ), and several population database 118 sets annotated using WGSA 0.7 34 including ExAC 35 , gnomAD 36 , ESP, and UK10K. Variants were also 119 annotated with dbSNP release 151 37 . A final important annotation set was the union of regions called by Variants were filtered using SnpSift 4.3s. In addition to the quality filters described, variants were 126 further filtered by local and population frequency, predicted deleteriousness (CADD v1.3), and 127 segmentation for function. To enrich for rare variation, variants were pre-filtered for a maximum minor allele 128 count of 3 (approximately 0.1% local allele frequency), and a maximum allele frequency of 1 in 10,000 in 129 any population included in the aforementioned population databases. In addition, non-coding variants were 130 more strictly filtered to only variants present in a GenoSkyline-Plus qualifying region as described above 131 and required to be absent from dbSNP 151. 132\nFrom the initial pre-filtered file, we conducted further filtering to arrive at nine total filter conditions. 133\nFirst, we evaluated variants meeting either: 1 in 10,000 population cutoffs and CADD score greater than 10 134 or 15, or: private variation and CADD score greater than 10 or 15; for a total of four conditions that include 135 non-coding variants. We also confined to coding variants with the same allele frequency combinations and 136 CADD cutoffs listed for four total coding-only conditions. For canonical loss-of-function, we only considered 137 the base 1 in 10,000 allele frequency requirement and CADD 10 cutoff for a total of one canonical loss-of-138 function condition (also note that all canonical loss-of-function variants meeting these criteria were included 139 in the other eight filter conditions regardless of allele frequency or CADD cutoff given the known 140 deleteriousness of canonical loss-of-function variants). We note that these are extensively overlapping test 141 sets (See Supplemental Figure 2 for correlations), and thus often yield similar results. For example, all 142 conditions constrained to private variation will be a subset of matched conditions with 1 in 10,000 143 population frequency cutoffs, and all coding-only conditions are a subset of the conditions that allow rare 144 non-coding variation. 145\nA VCF for each of the nine filtering conditions was loaded into a GEMINI 0.20.2 database 23 , which 146 was used to aggregate counts of variants for each individual by gene. By default, GEMINI is constrained to 147 coding variation, so GEMINI python scripts were edited to allow for counting of variants in non-coding 157\nIn order to assess the effect of covariates for the discovery set as well as any replication sets where 159 the necessary covariate data were available, we tested using SKAT 1.3.2.1 39 using the adaptive efficient 160 re-sampling method corrected for sex, number of APOE \u03b54 alleles, the first four principal components from 161 common variant PCA, and ancestral proportions from ADMIXTURE with k=5. Statistical significance was 162 set at a corrected p-value < 0.05. Because of the three main clusters of filter conditions corresponding to 163 case-control test sets (EOAD vs. control, FTD vs. control, or all cases vs. control) (Supplemental Figure  164 2), we applied a correction factor of three to all protein coding genes in hg19 put forth by the HUGO Gene"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 40", "text": "Neurodegeneration with a clinical onset prior to the age of 65 can be devastating for patients, their 41 families, and caregivers, imposing financial burden and hardship during a period of life when individuals are 42 often most productive 1 . Early-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as early-onset Alzheimer's disease 43 (EOAD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are typically thought of as disease forms with highly penetrant 44 genetic contributions, and indeed both can result from Mendelian pathogenic mutations (with Mendelian 45 causes more common in FTD) 2 . However, these diseases exhibit a high degree of heritability that remains 46 unexplained by currently known genetic contributors 3; 4 . This suggests that additional genetic factors likely 47 contribute to disease but have not yet been identified. Despite attempts at genome-wide association study 48 (GWAS) of relatively sizeable cohorts, only modest association signals have been identified for FTD 5 and 49 one form of EOAD, posterior cortical atrophy 6 . In contrast, sequencing studies have been successful at 50 identifying more moderately to highly penetrant contributions to disease by examining rare variation. 51\nSuccesses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) include ABCA7, SORL1, and TREM2 (reviewed in 7 ). Similar 52 successes for the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-FTD spectrum include TBK1 8 , MFSD8 9 , DPP6, 53 UNC13A, and HLA-DQA2 10 . Despite these successes, the rarity of these diseases along with the high cost 54\nof sequencing studies has resulted in limited sample sizes of patient cohorts. Furthermore, prior studies 55 have focused on coding regions of the genome, leaving non-coding regions largely unexplored for their 56 contribution to disease risk. 57\nGenoSkyline-Plus 38 as potential regulatory regions. GenoSkyline-Plus incorporates chromatin marks, DNA 121 accessibility, RNA-seq, and DNA methylation to predict function. All tracks derived from direct human 122 tissue sources were included (sources propagated in culture were excluded), with a total of 50 of 66 tissue 123 and cell types described in Table S2 of 38 used for annotation (see Supplemental Table 1 for included 124 epigenome tracks in the union). 125 regions as well. Variants upstream or downstream (within 5kb, the SnpEff default) were also assigned to 149 their adjacent genes. The number of qualifying individuals was the final count unit, where one or more 150 qualifying variants in a gene for a given individual resulted in that individual having a qualifying count for 151 that gene (i.e., if an individual had two qualifying variants, they would still only be counted once to account 152 for the possibility of a recessive model of inheritance or negligibility of the 2 nd variant if on the same allele). 153 Individuals with more than three qualifying variants in a gene were not counted as qualifying because an 154 excess of rare and predicted damaging variants in a single gene may be indicative of a sequencing or 155 variant-calling error. 156 characteristics, cognitive testing, and genetic sequencing. Participants were diagnosed as either normal 177 controls (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer's disease (AD) (note that some participants 178 progressed from MCI to AD while being followed, with the last assessment used for case designation in the 179 replication analysis, while they may be designated as beginning at the MCI stage in the following analysis). 180\nFor clinical rate of progression analysis we used the Clinical Dementia Scale Sum of Boxes Score 181 (CDRSB) 43 , a broad measure of clinical progression and impairment well-validated in multiple studies 44; 45 . 182 We used linear mixed-effects modeling to test whether variation in TET2 predicts longitudinal 183 clinical progression using R version 3.5.2. We covaried for baseline age, sex, education, and CDRSB score 184 as well as APOE !4 dose. The model was implemented as follows: \u2206 CDRSB = \u03b20 + \u03b21Agebaseline \u00d7 \u2206t + 185 \u03b22Sexfemale \u00d7 \u2206t + \u03b23Educationbaseline \u00d7 \u2206t + \u03b24CDRSBbaseline \u00d7 \u2206t + \u03b25APOE 4dose \u00d7 \u2206t + \u03b26TET2carrier status \u00d7 \u2206t + 186 European ancestry: 493 cases (228 EOAD and 265 FTD) and 671 controls. All demographic available 201 information for each sample (case category, primary clinical diagnosis, sex, age at enrollment, APOE \u03b54 202 status, self-reported race/ethnicity, and principal components 1-4 and 5 ADMIXTURE coefficients) is 203 available in Supplemental Table 3 . The majority of cases were clinically diagnosed and did not have autopsy material available for neuropathological sub-grouping at the time of analysis. Primary clinical 205 diagnoses included as AD were logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (29), posterior cortical 206 atrophy (26), frontal AD (17), language AD (17), vascular AD (8), AD + dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 207 (5), and AD not otherwise specified (126) . Primary clinical diagnoses included as FTD were behavioral 208 variant FTD (83), corticobasal syndrome (65), nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (43), FTD + 209 ALS (20) , primary supranuclear palsy (17), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (17), argyrophilic 210 grain disease (5), and FTD not otherwise specified (15). The expected enrichment in APOE \u03b54 was 211 observed in AD cases (58% with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele versus 28% in controls, *p=1.8x10 -16 by 212\nFisher's exact test), but not in FTD (28% in FTD and controls, p=0.87) . 213\nWe compared EOAD vs. control, FTD vs. control, or a combined analysis of EOAD and FTD vs. 214 control across all variant filtering conditions (see Methods). In the discovery analysis of combined burden 215 across EOAD and FTD vs. control, with variants absent from population databases and with a CADD score 216 > 10 (including non-coding variants in GenoSkyline-Plus regions), one gene-disease association passed 217 the multiple comparison significance threshold: TET2 (SKAT uncorrected p=6.5x10 -8 , corrected p=0.0037; 218 Table 1 , model corrects for number of APOE \u03b54 alleles, sex, principal components 1-4, and 5 219 ADMIXTURE ancestral proportions). Note that, while we applied a multiple correction cutoff of 57,354 220 based on three main clusters of correlated filter conditions (Supplemental Figure 2) , the p value for TET2 221 would also pass a strict Bonferroni correction for 516,186 implicit tests (19,118 genes, 27 filter conditions) if 222 we conservatively did not consider the correlated nature of the different filter sets (Bonferroni p=0.033). 223\nStatistical tests separately comparing EOAD vs. control and FTD vs. control did not pass the same degree 224 of multiple testing correction but results for those comparisons are provided in Supplemental Tables 4 225 (EOAD) and 5 (FTD) and demonstrate that the nominal enrichment level in TET2 is similar in both EOAD 226 and FTD. No other gene reached even nominal significance (p < 1x10 -5 ) in any filter condition, so TET2 227 was the only gene considered for replication analysis. However, in the interest of making data from this 228 study highly available, counts and p values for all genes assessed are provided in Supplemental Table 6 . 229\nAll qualifying variants in cases for TET2 were both Sanger validated and visually evaluated in the 230 Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). Two variants failed Sanger validation (adjacent erroneous indel calls in Table 7 where all qualifying variants in TET2 are listed. In addition, two cases had adjacent variant calls 233 that were found to make up one variant. These were also corrected in all statistical analyses and tables. 234\nThe single control with a qualifying TET2 variant did not have material available for Sanger sequencing but 235 appeared valid in IGV (a single nucleotide variant with 8 alternate allele reads among 18 total reads). 236\nNext, we assessed potential confounding due to stratification by a QQ plot of the p-value 237 distribution for the filter set that produced the top result and observed no genomic inflation consistent with a 238 well-matched case-control dataset (l = 0.95, Figure 1) . 239\nTo help inform the types of sequencing datasets to target for replication, we assessed the variant 240 type (coding or non-coding) and associated disease for all qualifying TET2 variants in the discovery set. 241\nQualifying variants were observed in 11 EOAD cases, eight FTD cases, and one control. Of the 11 EOAD 242 cases, one had depressive symptoms, one had language symptoms and possible corticobasal syndrome, 243 one had logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, and one had a previous diagnosis of behavioral 244 variant FTD revised to frontal AD (seven had no additional noted phenotypes). Of the eight FTD cases, 245 three had corticobasal syndrome (one of whom had AD symptoms and possible posterior cortical atrophy), 246 one had FTD + ALS, and four had behavioral variant FTD (one with AD symptoms and one with seizures). 247\nNine cases in total harbored coding variants, seven of which were canonical loss-of-function variants (four 248 EOAD and three FTD). Because non-coding variants make up a large portion of the signal, we assessed 249 coding and non-coding variants separately. We observed a similar level of enrichment for both coding and 250 non-coding variants in EOAD and FTD cases when these types of variants were considered independently 251 of one another (Figure 2A) . Furthermore, the non-coding variants were prevalent in regions predicted to 252 have regulatory function ( Figure 2B) . Combined with the high number of canonical loss-of-function 253 variants, these data support a model whereby TET2 haploinsufficiency, resulting from either canonical loss-254 of-function variation or expression-altering non-coding variation, may contribute risk to neurodegenerative 255 disease. 256\nTo replicate this finding, we used six additional cohorts (five independent, one internal) with 257 available sequencing data from patients diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder and healthy controls. 258\nBased on the variants discovered in TET2, we attempted to replicate the association between aggregate 259 rare variant burden in TET2 and disease risk using two arms: the same conditions used in discovery applied to other genome sequencing datasets as a primary measure, and canonical loss-of-function only 261 analysis as a secondary measure to allow for incorporation of exome sequencing datasets. We assessed 262 three cohorts with genome sequencing data for replication using the same conditions applied in the 263 discovery set: ADSP (the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project) (2,208 late-onset AD (LOAD) cases 264 and 2,208 controls), the Accelerating Medicines Partnership -Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) cohort (749 265 LOAD, 184 FTD, and 446 controls), and the non-European ancestry individuals from our cohort not 266 assessed in the discovery set (66 EOAD, 79 FTD, and 157 controls). Assessment of these three cohorts 267 revealed replication of the signal for TET2 overall for early-and late-onset AD and FTD combined vs. 268 control (p=0.0071; Table 1 ). Although the statistics for separate analyses of EOAD vs. control and FTD vs. 269 control did not meet significance criteria, secondary analysis of those subgroups revealed similar levels of 270 enrichment within each distinct condition (Supplemental Finally, we assessed predicted loss-of-function variants alone in all aforementioned cohorts (UCSF 277 European discovery set, UCSF non-European replication set, ADSP, AMP-AD, Project MinE) along with 278 exome sequencing data from a second ALS dataset 8 and additional exome samples from ADSP 48 for a 279 total of seven sample sets. We observed a robust signal for association between predicted canonical loss-280 of-function variants and disease across multiple disease cohorts ( Table 2) . Specifically, three of the four 281 largest independent replication cohorts (ADSP genomes (LOAD), ADSP exomes (LOAD), and HA-Duke-282\nStanford ALS exomes) all exhibit independent nominal replication (p<0.05). Meta-analysis of all canonical 283 loss-of-function variants from all available cohorts (across EOAD, LOAD, FTD, and ALS) yields a p-value 284 below commonly used exome-wide significance cutoffs (p=2.5x10 -7 ; Table 2), and subgroup analyses of 285 both AD and FTD-ALS vs. controls were each nominally significant (p<0.05) and suggest similar degrees 286 of enrichment.\nTo assess potential clinical implications of rare variation in TET2, we queried the Alzheimer's 288 Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset [40] [41] [42] , which includes clinical rate of progression data. We 289 used linear mixed-effects modeling to test whether qualifying rare variation (based on the discovery 290 condition that passed multiple corrections testing) in TET2 predicts longitudinal clinical progression. We 291 covaried for baseline age, sex, education, and CDRSB score as well as APOE !4 dose. A total of 786 292 ADNI participants had TET2 genotypes available for analysis. There was no significant difference in the 293 distribution of TET2 rare variant carriers by sex, APOE !4 dose, education, or baseline CDRSB score 294 (Supplemental Table 8 ). There was a significant difference between TET2 rare variant carriers and non-295 carriers by baseline age (Supplemental Table 8 ) but recall that baseline age is corrected for as a 296 covariate along with sex, education, APOE !4 dose, and baseline CDRSB score. Using linear mixed effects 297 regression, we found a significant relationship between carrying any TET2 rare variant and clinical 298 progression as measured by change in CDRSB score (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE = 0.14 \u00b1 0.06; *p=0.03) (Figure 3) . A similar 299\nfinding was observed when our analyses were limited to TET2 loss-of-function variant carriers (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE = 300 0.17 \u00b1 0.09; *p=0.04) (Supplemental Figure 3 ) (although we corrected for covariates for rigor, no 301 covariates were significantly associated with TET2 loss-of-function carrier status (Supplemental Table 9 )). 302\nWe also explored whether rare variation in TET2 predicted changes in CDRSB and cognition (measured by 303\nMini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score changes 49 ) in MCI and control when analyzed separately. To 304 maximize sample size, we limited this analysis to all TET2 variant carriers without further subdivision to 305 loss-of-function variant carriers. When constraining the analysis to MCI, TET2 rare variant carriers (n=8) 306 demonstrated a greater CDRSB change over time compared to noncarriers of a higher magnitude and 307 significance compared to the pooled analysis of control, MCI and AD (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE = 0.64 \u00b1 0.12; *p=6.17x10 -8 ) 308\nwhen correcting for the covariates outlined above. Of note, TET2 rare variant carriers diagnosed with MCI 309 also demonstrated greater decreases in MMSE changes when compared to non-carriers (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE = -0.47 \u00b1 310 0.17; *p=0.01). Within controls (n=6), there were no significant associations between TET2 variant carrier 311 status and either CDRSB or MMSE. 312 In this study, we identified a significant excess of rare, likely deleterious variation in TET2 as a risk 315 factor for multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including EOAD, LOAD, FTD, and ALS. This finding is 316 important for two main reasons. First, TET2 plays an important role in the conversion of methylation to 5-317 hydroxymethylation, implicating dysfunction in a pathway known to be critical during aging 50 and learning 318 and memory 51 in age-associated diseases like LOAD and FTD. Second, it is striking that the effect sizes in 319 both coding and non-coding variant enrichments were comparable. This point suggests that further 320 investigation of non-coding variation in complex disease genome sequencing studies holds potential for the 321 identification of new contributors to disease. 322 TET2 promotes de-methylation of DNA by catalyzing conversion of methylation to 5-323 hydroxymethylation, and is highly expressed in brain (reviewed in 52 ). Defined methylation changes occur 324 with age in humans (\"Horvath's clock\", reviewed in 50 ) and there is some evidence for an association 325 between increased \"methylation age\" and disease (systematically reviewed in 53 ). Taken together, this 326 raises speculation that reduced function or loss of TET2, a critical regulator in methylation processes, may 327 have adverse age-associated effects. Evidence from mouse models further supports this idea. Specifically, 328\npromoting the conversion of methylation to 5-hydroxymethylation by either exercise-induced upregulation 329 of TET2 54 or artificial overexpression of TET2 55 improves memory in mice by increasing neurogenesis in 330 the dentate gyrus. Conversely, reducing TET2 in mouse hippocampus leads to reduced neurogenesis and 331 impaired memory 55 , consistent with its role in promoting adult neurogenesis in mice 56 . Finally, reduction of 332 TET2 in mouse primary neurons also reduced cell survival 57 . All of these observations are consistent with 333 detrimental consequences of loss of TET2 function and suggest that neurons may be particularly 334 vulnerable to these effects. Further support for a generally important role of TET enzymes comes from a 335 preprint implicating mono-and bi-allelic loss-of-function of TET3 in childhood diseases 58 (TET3 is more 336 constrained against loss-of-function based on population database estimates 35 , which (along with bi-allelic 337 contributions) could explain the earlier ages observed). In addition to general evidence for the importance 338 of TET2 and other TET enzymes, an intriguing and more specific role for TET2 has also been proposed in 339 a preprint implicating TET2 in microglial response, particularly around amyloid plaques 59 , suggesting that conferring TREM2 variants result in loss-of-function). Finally, the human data we analyzed from ADNI is 343 consistent with deleterious consequences of TET2 rare variants, with our observations supporting a faster 344 rate of both general clinical decline (CDRSB) and cognitive decline (MMSE). 345\nThe strongest association signal in the discovery cohort was a combined analysis across all EOAD 346 and FTD cases together. While we recognize the drawbacks of a combined analysis across phenotypes, 347\nwe argue that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for two critical reasons beyond the increase in sample 348 size: (1) known effects of genetic pleiotropy, and (2) the possibility of identifying shared pathways between 349"}, {"section_title": "diseases. 350", "text": "The first reason supporting comparison across EOAD and FTD is that genetic pleiotropy-where a 351 single locus contributes variance to multiple, different phenotypes-may play a role in neurodegenerative 352 disease risk. Our group and others have provided support for this idea through several studies investigating 353 multiple neurodegenerative diseases using GWAS approaches [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition to common risk variants, 354 there is clear evidence of moderately to highly penetrant rare variation in single genes conferring risk or 355 causality for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. First, rare variants in TREM2 confer risk for both AD 61 356 and FTD 62 . Second, rare variation in multiple established genes such as TBK1 and C9orf72 confer risk or 357 are causative across the ALS-FTD spectrum 63 . Third, moderately penetrant common risk alleles like APOE 358 \u03b54 are primarily associated with AD, but also associated with risk for Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) 64 , 359 FTD 12 , and age of onset in C9orf72 carriers 65 . Fourth, GBA and SNCA were first identified as risk factors 360 for Parkinson's disease (PD), but also confer risk for DLB 64 . Finally, rare pathogenic variants in MAPT 361 typically cause FTD 66; 67 , but the R406W pathogenic variant has also been associated with an EOAD 362 presentation 68; 69 . Furthermore, common variants near MAPT (tagging the H1 haplotype, associated with 363 higher tau expression 70 ) are associated with AD, PD, FTD, and ALS 11; 12; 15 . 364 A second important reason to analyze across different patient populations is that performing 365 analyses across cohorts of patients diagnosed with different neurodegenerative disorders but with partially 366 overlapping underlying neuropathology (i.e., tau-containing protein aggregates in both AD and 367 approximately half of FTD cases; TDP-43 containing protein aggregates in ALS, approximately half of FTD 368 cases, and some AD cases) may identify shared dysregulated pathways, and has the potential to identify rare variation in TET2 is associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases suggests age-related 371 changes in methylation may be relevant across a broad spectrum of neurodegeneration. 372\nIn conclusion, we provide evidence that loss of TET2 function confers risk for EOAD, LOAD, FTD, 373 and ALS. Specifically, we found that, in aggregate, both coding and non-coding qualifying rare variation in 374 TET2 is associated with approximately a 2-fold risk increase across diverse populations of patients with 375 AD, FTD, and ALS, and that canonical loss-of-function variation in TET2 is associated with approximately a 376 3-fold risk increase for these diseases. We note that, similar to any burden test, it is impossible from 377 aggregate enrichment values to deconvolute variable penetrance levels among disease-relevant alleles 378 and the degree of enrichment for truly associated variation.

Figure 2) , TET2 remains significant if we conservatively do not consider the correlated nature of the different filter sets and instead apply a strict Bonferroni correction (p = 0.033). The primary test was SKAT corrected for number of APOE \u03b54 alleles, sex, principal components 1-4, and 5 ADMIXTURE ancestral proportions. Fisher's exact test yielded similar raw p values and was highly correlated with SKAT (Pearson's r=0.76 of log-transformed p values) and is presented here for consistency with Table 2 : Canonical loss-of-function variation in TET2 is nominally enriched in both AD and FTD-ALS. Because of the high number of canonical loss-of-function variants in TET2 observed in the discovery analysis, we performed a separate assessment of loss-of-function variants alone. Although the loss-of-function model did not pass multiple testing correction in the discovery analysis because of the low number of qualifying counts, TET2 was the highest ranked loss-of-function gene (lowest p-value for enrichment in cases). Note the additional inclusion of ALS exomes (HA-Duke-Stanford). * indicates that the combined analysis across all cases and controls (in bold) was below an arbitrary exome-wide cutoff of 2.5x10 -6 (a commonly used threshold based on correction of p<0.05 for ~20,000 genes). SKAT values could not be calculated for ALS sets (and thus not for summed replication and discovery+replication sets) because necessary covariate data were not available for these cohorts, although both ALS cohorts were independently filtered to only individuals of European ancestry. Below this combined analysis, we also present summaries by each disease, which achieved nominal significance (p < 0.05) for both combined analysis of all AD cases and of all FTD and ALS cases. Note the addition of summary statistics from ADSP exomes in this section as well. For ADSP exomes, the p-value from the VEP HIGH meta-analysis model is shown (publicly available from NIAGADS). For comparison, we have also listed the frequency of TET2 loss-of-function carriers in population databases (gnomAD minus TOPMed set added to counts from TOPMed), which is similar to the frequencies observed in control groups we analyzed. All frequencies are the percentage of individuals harboring a loss-of-function variant (not minor allele frequency) except ADSP exomes for which cumulative minor allele frequency (CMAF) for both cases and controls is listed.
