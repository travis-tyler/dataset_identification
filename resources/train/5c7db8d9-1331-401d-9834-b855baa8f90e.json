[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is scheduled to launch the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), with a new six-beam, green-wavelength, photon-counting lidar system, Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). The primary objectives of the ICESat-2 mission are to measure ice-sheet elevations, sea-ice thickness, and global biomass. However, if bathymetry can be reliably retrieved from ATLAS data, this could assist in addressing a key data need in many coastal and inland water body areas, including areas that are poorly-mapped and/or difficult to access. Additionally, ATLAS-derived bathymetry could be used to constrain bathymetry derived from complementary data, such as passive, multispectral imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). As an important first step in evaluating the ability to map bathymetry from ATLAS, this study involves a detailed assessment of bathymetry from the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), NASA's airborne ICESat-2 simulator, flown on the Earth Resources 2 (ER-2) high-altitude aircraft. An interactive, web interface, MABEL Viewer, was developed and used to identify bottom returns in Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior. After applying corrections for refraction and channel-specific elevation biases, MABEL bathymetry was compared against National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data acquired two years earlier.\nThe results indicate that MABEL reliably detected bathymetry in depths of up to 8 m, with a root mean square (RMS) difference of 0.7 m, with respect to the reference data. Additionally, a version of the lidar equation was developed for predicting bottom-return signal levels in MABEL and tested using the Keweenaw Bay data. Future work will entail extending these results to ATLAS, as the technical specifications of the sensor become available."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "NASA's upcoming Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, with a 91-day repeat period and near-polar orbit [1] , provides a unique opportunity to assess ice sheet elevation change. The sole instrument aboard ICESat-2 will be the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a micro-pulse, photon-counting lidar system operating at 532 nm using a frequency-doubled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser [1, 2] . Although the primary objectives of ICESat-2 will be to measure ice-sheet elevations, sea-ice thickness, and global biomass [1] , the ATLAS design specifications suggest the feasibility of bathymetry retrieval from ATLAS data. If it can be demonstrated that reliable bathymetry estimation from ATLAS is, in fact, possible, this could greatly benefit studies of coastal and inland water bodies, which are often hindered by a dearth of shallow-water bathymetry [3] . The fact that ATLAS is an active remote sensing system makes it of particular interest for bathymetric mapping, since it may be possible to synergistically fuse of airborne lidar remote sensing, including the first practical demonstration of the capability of measuring depth in 1969 [23] . Lidar technology evolved rapidly over subsequent decades, leveraging developments in enabling technologies, including inertial and satellite navigation systems [21, 22] . Conventionally, lasers operating in the near infrared (typically, 1064 and 1550 nm) have been preferred for topographic lidar, while bathymetric lidar has used water-penetrating 532 nm lasers, sometimes in combination with 1064 nm for obtaining water surface returns and simultaneously mapping topography. Industry-standard bathymetric lidar systems include the Optech Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) system and Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging Lidar (CZMIL), Leica Airborne Hydrography AB (AHAB) Chiroptera II and HawkEye II and III, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), United States Geological Survey (USGS) EAARL-B, and Fugro LADS Mk II and Mk 3 [21, 24, 25] . Even more varied than the number of systems are the applications of these systems, including benthic habitat classification [26] [27] [28] [29] , shoreline delineation [30] , inundation modeling [31] , river morphodynamics [32, 33] , geomorphological mapping [34] [35] [36] , and hydrography [21, 37, 38] . The conventional bathymetric lidar systems listed above are all waveform resolving, meaning they record and/or analyze in real time digitized, backscattered pulses containing up to thousands of photons.\nIn the topographic lidar community, an emerging technology is photon-counting lidar, which uses either photomuliplier tubes (PMTs) or avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operated well above the breakdown voltage (i.e., in Geiger mode) to record returns as low as a single photon as individual points. The low power consumption of photon-counting lidar systems, which also have low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), make them ideal systems for spaceborne platforms with strict power budgets. However, photon-counting lidar systems, despite first being identified as a potential mapping technology in 1996 [39] , have received considerably less attention in the ocean and coastal mapping community. Only with advances in photon-detector ranging resolution and dead time have photon-counting systems become viable mapping tools [40] . A number of recent publications target terrestrial and cryospheric applications, such as canopy extraction [41] [42] [43] and sea-ice and glacier profiling [44] [45] [46] [47] , and noise-filtering techniques [48] [49] [50] , but research pertaining to using photon-counting lidar for bathymetric mapping remains limited.\nExamples of photon-counting systems that have been shown to detect bathymetry are the Coastal Area Tactical-mapping System (CATS) [51] and the NASA Airborne Multi-kilohertz Microlaser Altimeter Instrument [40] . MABEL has also been shown to detect bathymetry, in the low-turbidity waters of Lake Mead and depths of up to approximately one Secchi depth [52] . Focused primarily on the retrieval of water surface height statistics, Jasinski et al. [52] includes a brief qualitative discussion of depth profiles observed in the photon-elevation data. However, the study did not account for index-of-refraction and vertical-datum corrections or include a quantitative comparison with existing bathymetry from dedicated bathymetric-mapping instruments. Whereas CATS and the NASA microaltimeter were operational at heights above ground level (AGLs) of 500 to 6700 m, MABEL is operational at an AGL of up to 20,000 m. A detailed investigation of MABEL, which is flown above 95% of Earth's atmosphere, is, therefore, an important step toward evaluating the possibility of measuring bathymetry from photon-counting, spaceborne lidar."}, {"section_title": "Lidar Equation", "text": "In addition to the empirical analysis, it is also of interest to develop a model for predicting the bottom return signal level, given a specified set of environmental conditions and system parameters. Such a model is not only beneficial for evaluating the expected depth ranges in which bathymetry retrieval might be viable using MABEL, but, in future work, it could be extended to ATLAS, as the final system parameters are made available by NASA. In this study, the expected number of photoelectrons corresponding to bottom (seafloor) returns, n bot , is evaluated using a modified version of the lidar equation in [53] :\nIn Equation (1), h is Planck's constant; v is the photon frequency; R w is the pulse travel distance in water; R air is the pulse travel distance in air; \u03b7 q is the detector quantum efficiency; \u03b7 t is the transmitter optical efficiency; \u03b7 r is the receiver optical efficiency; E t is the transmitted energy per channel per pulse; \u03c1 \u03bb is the bottom reflectance at the laser wavelength, \u03bb; \u03b1 t is the incidence angle on the bottom; A r is the collecting area of receiver aperture; r int is the air-water interface reflectance; T 2 \u03bb is the two-way atmospheric transmittance; \u03b1 s is the local incidence angle on water surface; and c \u03bb is the effective attenuation coefficient (for which the water column diffuse attenuation coefficient, K d , establishes a lower bound).

MABEL has 16 green (532 nm) channels and eight near infrared (1064 nm) channels, with a laser pulse length of 2 ns and an operational laser repetition rate of 5-20 kHz. The geometry of the channels is defined by selecting various fibers within the 215-fiber transmitter and receiver arrays located at the foci of the corresponding matched transmitter and receiver telescopes. This study examines data acquired during the \"Transit to KPMD\" mission, for which only 13 of the 16 green channels were configured. The corresponding beam angles, elevations, and relative energy levels for this mission are listed in Table 1 . Only the green channels are considered in this study because ATLAS will operate only at the green wavelength and because it is the only one of the two wavelengths capable of penetrating the water column to provide bottom returns. At a nominal mission AGL of 20,000 m, the 13 green channels cover a swath of 200 m (Figure 3 ) and have a nominal footprint of 2 m. The channels corresponding to the anticipated low-and high-energy levels of ICESat-2, as per MABEL metadata, are also listed in Table 1 ; however, according to NASA, the documented power levels have not been rigorously verified and are affected by a number of environmental factors and configuration procedures [58] . To more closely represent the relative energies \"as flown\", we reclassified the relative ICESat-2 energy level of each channel according to the along-track density of water-surface returns, which was used as a proxy indicator of signal strength. The energy level for each channel was then linearly scaled based on an assumed channel 6 energy level of 0.2 \u00b5J, a value taken from a previous study examining MABEL data acquired 5 months prior under a similar energy regime [45, 59] .

Figure 12 summarizes the average corresponding numbers of expected and observed photoelectrons per pulse for each energy level. Table 4 lists the corresponding values. Overall, the number of observed photoelectrons decreases with increasing depth at a decay rate similar to the expected numbers of p.e. for each energy level. One noticeable exception is the relatively low number of observed photoelectrons in the 0-1 m depth range for both the high and low energy channels. This is not unexpected, as the shallow nearshore zone generally poses challenges for all bathymetric lidar systems [68] [69] [70] . The challenges associated with this depth range stem from a number of environmental factors in the surf zone, such as breaking waves, the associated bubbles, foam, and resuspended sediment, which are often unavoidable.

Spatial variability of bottom reflectance, which was assumed to be constant in our model, is also a plausible contributing factor, because, as mentioned in Section 2.1, the region is characterized by high-reflectance natural white sand and lower-reflectance anthropogenic stamp sands that are transported along the coast.

A detailed approach resolving uncertainties into vertical and horizontal components was not pursued because well-defined discrete features to use for planimetric positional comparisons were not discernable in the sparse photon data; however, we suspect that the MABEL photon positioning contains a horizontal or angular bias because the positioning of the shoreline relative to the channel track lines, which extend landward of the coast, suggests a nominal southwestward offset of the MABEL photon returns. The comparison was performed with the reduced ellipsoid heights and not the calculated depths to avoid introducing errors associated with additional vertical datum transformations. Differences were calculated for all photon returns classified as bottom, including the returns positioned up to 35 m outside of the extents of the reference data due to the suspected horizontal or angular bias.\nThe distribution of differences between the bottom-return ellipsoid heights and the ellipsoid heights of the nearest reference bathymetry data points, as found by a k-d tree nearest neighbor search, are shown in Figure 13 . With an overall bias of \u22120.59 m, the two datasets agree to within an RMS difference of 0.74 m. Numerous factors could explain the general trend of the MABEL-derived depths being generally deeper than the reference surface, including depth and vertical-datum biases in the reference bathymetry and the suspected horizontal bias in the MABEL photon positioning. Conversely, the observed bias may also include a systematic underestimation of depth resulting from the possible penetration of \"surface returns\" into the upper portions of the water column [71] . A small, slope-induced high depth bias is also possible due to the LADS MKII system having a slightly larger footprint (nominally 2.5 m) than MABEL (2 m). A change in actual bathymetry over the intervening two years is also a likely factor, as the project area is characterized by dynamic bedform features, including nearshore sand bars and troughs and offshore shoals likely influenced by migrating sand [72] . The sedimentary regime of Keweenaw Bay has not been fully described, but a key regional sedimentary process occurring along the northern reaches of the Bay is the southwestward long-shore movement and deposition of stamp sands, which eventually migrate laterally to coalesce with deeper, larger bars [55, 56] . Keweenaw Bay's exposure to an approximately 230-km northeasterly fetch could also play a significant role in the sediment dynamics of the project area [57] . 230-km northeasterly fetch could also play a significant role in the sediment dynamics of the project area [57] .

Figure 14 shows the spatial variability of the ellipsoid-height differences plotted over 1-m resolution NAIP imagery. Nearshore clusters of positive and negative differences are consistent with the combined effects of migrating sand bars and the suspected horizontal bias. Although the imagery does not temporally coincide with the MABEL and reference data, it offers insight into the observed spatial distribution of the ellipsoid height differences by revealing the dynamic geomorphological nature of the project area.

Blue colors (negative numbers) represent MABEL depths that are deeper than the corresponding reference depths, and Red colors (positive numbers) represent MABEL depths that are shallower than the corresponding reference depths. Clusters of differences, such as the one highlighted with the black circle labeled 'A', are consistent with a sand bar that has migrated and/or the horizontal positioning error of a sand bar that has not migrated.

Table 5 lists some of the significant parameter differences between the two sensors. Many of the parameter values needed to quantitatively assess ATLAS expected signal levels from the bottom in a particular area using Equation (1) are not currently available. However, given the significantly higher pulse energies and receiver aperture, it is reasonable to expect that the depth penetration capabilities of ATLAS will at least equal, if not exceed, those of MABEL. The much greater altitude of the ICESat-2 satellite (as compared with the ER-2 aircraft during the MABEL flights) impacts the reflected beam solid angle, but has relatively little impact on atmospheric transmittance, since the ER-2 operational altitude is already above~95% of the Earth's atmosphere. The fundamental spatial resolution of ATLAS will also be coarser, given its larger footprint.\nIf ICESat-2 ATLAS is found to have similar or greater bathymetric mapping capabilities than MABEL, the resulting bathymetric data may be useful for small-scale nautical charting in poorly mapped areas, as well as for inundation and storm surge modeling and related coastal zone management and science needs. Only one, small area was examined in this study, but a preliminary review of the suite of existing MABEL data reveals high-probability returns in other parts of Lake Superior, as well as a location along the Northern Icelandic coast. Additionally, Jasinski et al. [52] noted MABEL bathymetry in Lake Meade. (These data were qualitatively assessed, but not included in the quantitative analysis of bathymetry in this study, due to a lack of available reference bathymetry for the sites.)\nAlthough the observed MABEL and anticipated ATLAS data densities and vertical uncertainties do not approach those of dedicated airborne bathymetric lidar using full-waveform systems, a satellite platform allows regular data acquisition in remote, poorly mapped areas, where high-resolution bathymetric lidar and shipborne acoustic data are typically scarce or altogether absent. Hence, there are multiple opportunities to acquire data in areas in which there are large seasonal-or even daily-variations in water clarity. Additionally, the repetitive coverage offered by repeat orbits may densify bottom returns and improve SNR.\nAnother potential application of ICESat-2 bathymetry data is to serve as a constraint in bathymetry retrieval from a variety of synergistic methodologies using various data sources, including passive, multispectral satellite imagery [6, 7, 73] and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) [9, 11, 74] . Imagery-derived bathymetry is inferred from the relative reflectance of different bands (e.g., blue and green), and SAR-derived bathymetry is inferred based on variations of surface roughness. Each of these methods has the advantage of providing dense depth estimates over large spatial extents; however, each method usually relies on \"seed depths\" typically soundings from nautical charts or lidar surveys [6] or shipboard sonar data [75] , to calibrate derived values to meaningful local depths. By providing a more-direct form of depth measurement, MABEL (and, ultimately, ATLAS) bathymetry does not require existing reference soundings. On the other hand, bathymetry from MABEL or ATLAS has the disadvantage of being spatially sparse, as depths are constrained to lie along discrete track lines. MABEL (or ATLAS) bathymetry and bathymetry from multispectral satellite imagery and SAR data are, therefore, highly complementary, such that the fusion of each could potentially combine the strengths and overcome the limitations of each method individually. By providing a nearly seamless transition across the shoreline, ICESat-2 bathymetry is also a natural complement to coastal-mapping applications incorporating infrared, terrestrial lidar [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "MABEL, the airborne simulator for NASA's upcoming ICESat-2 mission, has been shown to detect bathymetry up to 8 m deep in the oligotrophic waters of Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior. The depths were derived by applying index-of-refraction and water-level corrections to the raw MABEL photon elevations and were shown to be in good agreement with the NOAA reference data acquired two years earlier. Resolving positional uncertainty into vertical and horizontal components requires further research evaluating system and procedural parameters such as boresight calibration angles and georeferencing settings; and incorporating a thorough index-of-refraction model, accounting for the orientation of the aircraft, the corresponding angle of incidence of each beam relative to the water surface, and a water-surface model. Before MABEL data-and potentially ICESat-2 ATLAS data-can be reliably reduced to specific vertical data with sub-meter accuracy without directly relying on local water-level measurements at the time of data acquisition, vertical uncertainties resulting from 3-D georeferencing and channel-specific range calculations need to be refined.\nIn addition to assessing the depth accuracy of the derived MABEL bathymetry through a comparison with a high-accuracy reference dataset, a photon-counting version of the lidar equation was used to predict the number of signal events (taken to be one photoelectron) in 2-D bins along each channel track line. Anomalies in the 0-1 m depth range are consistent with known environmental limitations; and uncertainties in the assumed transmit-energy levels limit the applicability of our results, but the general agreement between the average observed and expected numbers of photoelectrons in the 1-8 m depth range for the low-and high-energy channels substantiates our approach and justifies developing our baseline model in future project phases.\nFuture research plans include developing an algorithm to automatically classify and process bottom returns from photon-counting lidar data and a corresponding uncertainty model. Research plans also include collaboration with the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (University of Houston) to extend this MABEL analysis to incorporate theoretical performance characteristics of the ATLAS sensor."}]
