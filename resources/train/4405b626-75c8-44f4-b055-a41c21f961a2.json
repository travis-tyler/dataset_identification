[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Sociologists have long used educational expectations to understand the complex mental processes underlying individuals' educational decision making. Yet, little research evaluates how students actually formulate their educational expectations. Status attainment theory asserts that students adopt their educational expectations early based on family background and social influences, and that their educational expectations are driven by a static mental construct as a result. In contrast, recent research based on Bayesian learning theory hypothesizes that students mostly adapt their educational expectations in light of new information about their academic potential. Comparing models of expectations formation in adolescence, we find that students' expectations do not derive from a static mental construct. However, students adapt their educational expectations only modestly and only in response to very large changes in grade point averages. Thus, adolescent educational expectations stabilize early and are rather persistent over time.\nIn an oft-cited work, Gambetta (1987) poses the question: Are students pushed into their educational attainments by aggregate social influences or do they jump into these attainments by their own purposive choice? This question encapsulates an on-going debate in sociology about the extent to which individuals are cognizant agents who strategically act to achieve well-formulated objectives -educational or otherwise -or to which individuals are passive agents who follow structural paths laid out before them with little strategic reflection.

Educational expectations are an important part of Gambetta's push-jump debate about educational decision making, though not one he emphasized. Educational expectations measure a youth's plans for future educational attainment and have demonstrated, consistent predictive validity vis-\u00e0-vis completed years of education. Scholars interested in educational decision making have used these measures to study the complex mental processes underlying individuals' educational attainments (Sewell, Haller and Portes 1969; Manski 2004) .\nDespite their wide use, little research evaluates how students actually formulate their educational expectations.

Although this model has undergone a number of revisions over the years, one of its important assumptions remains: Educational expectations stabilize by adolescence because they largely depend on a static mental construct adopted from significant others (Haller 1982) . Haller was an original co-author of the Wisconsin model and argued expectations are indicative of a static mental state that could be interpreted as a latent achievement motivation. Morgan (2005) provides a stark counterpoint to Haller's adoption argument. He follows the framework set out by Haller and his colleagues, yet, Morgan (2005) argues that, in contrast to the adoption process highlighted by Haller (1982) , purposive self-reflective processes dominate expectation formation. Morgan bases his argument on Bayesian learning theory and asserts that students adapt their expectations to new information about their academic potential. 2 Although he recognizes that educational expectations may stabilize so as to partially automate behavior, Morgan maintains that high school students mainly invoke Bayesian learning in forming and refining their expected future level of education. In distinguishing his argument from that of Haller and others, Morgan (2005:176) states: \"It may be that future empirical analysis will determine that these normative and imitative processes are dominant and should be at the center of a model of educational attainment. For now, no evidence suggests that this is the case. I therefore offer an alternative and complementary approach. . .For this approach, one would first stipulate that purposive-prefigurative commitment is the primary controlling guide for forwardlooking behavior. . .\"\nMorgan does not formally test whether students adapt their educational expectations over time based on new information about their potential educational success. Rather, he provides estimates from a model of autoregressive correlations among educational expectations measures, net of various social background measures, a 10 th grade test score and expectations of significant others (see Figure 1) . He argues that such residualized autoregressions indicate an underlying dynamic process and goes on to develop a theoretical model of educational decision making and attainments that heavily emphasizes adaptation in educational expectations over time based on new information about potential educational success. The residualized correlations Morgan observes do not necessarily stem from an underlying dynamic process. In fact, these correlations and their pattern could occur for any number of reasons, including not only measurement error, as Morgan recognized, but from an underlying static construct as hypothesized by Haller (1982) . Even if these autoregressive correlations correctly indicate an underlying dynamic process, it is in no way certain that this process is adaptation in educational expectations based on new information as a Bayesian learning model would suggest. Such alternative explanations remain untested in Morgan's work, and adaptation in educational expectations and its importance therefore remain unexamined."}, {"section_title": "Evidence and Arguments on the Formation of Educational Expectations", "text": "Recent work in sociology on educational decision making and Bayesian learning theory moves us away from the notion associated with earlier work in the status attainment tradition that educational expectations are indicators of a stable mental construct formed early in life as the result of social influence. However, the literature suggests caution should be exercised in freely applying Bayesian learning models to educational decision making and expectation formation. Correll (2001) assesses gender differences in students' academic self-assessments and choice of college major in a sample of high school students from the 1990s. In those analyses, male students are more likely to assess their math ability at higher levels than female students with similar math test scores and grades. However, the relationship between gender and academic self-assessment reverses in the case of verbal ability. Students apparently do not adapt subjective assessments and expectations in the face of new information when their prior beliefs are based on socially structured -in this case gendered -notions about academic aptitude and the like.\nOne also finds evidence of inertia in academic self-concept and expectations among students outside the United States. Gabay-Egozi, Shavit and Yaish (2009) assess curricular choices of a sample of Israeli students drawn from four high schools in Tel Aviv. They find that, holding prior academic achievement constant, socioeconomically disadvantaged and female students are more likely to complete less difficult coursework. From the authors' perspective, lower socioeconomic status students hedge their bets and opt to take courses in \"easier\" subjects such as the social sciences rather than courses in presumably more difficult subjects such as math. In contrast, higher socioeconomic status students are more likely to take the majority of their courses in difficult subjects even though they may have similar prior academic achievements.\nThere are many reasons why students like those studied by Correll (2001) and Gabay-Egozi et al. (2009) may not adapt their educational beliefs as Bayesian learning theory suggests. Experimental evidence suggests that individual decision makers may not act on evidence disconfirming their beliefs because they tend to overlook such information (Einhorn and Hogarth 1988) . For example, a student may ignore high levels of math achievement as anomalous because such information does not confirm his or her socially constructed notions about his or her academic self. Indeed, other evidence from the decision-making literature suggests a \"primacy effect\" wherein individuals weigh information from early periods more heavily in making their decisions (Varey and Kahneman 1992) . Kahneman (1983, 1986) provide laboratory evidence also suggesting individuals do not necessarily understand how new information should revise their beliefs due to strongly held dispositions such as guilt or optimism.\nGiven the demonstrated importance of deeply seated dispositions, self-concepts or identities in survey and experimental research, additional evidence as to the exact mechanisms of information processing is necessary if we are to understand how individuals conceptualize and formulate beliefs and expectations about the social world. Neuroscience research provides an opportunity to illuminate this sort of information processing and its exact mechanisms. 3 This body of work generally corroborates survey and experiment-based evidence on the relative inertia of subjective expectations and beliefs. Based on evidence using fMRI technology that traces blood flow in the brain, neuroscientists now largely believe the brain is a selective system that operates under directives of efficiency and automation (Edelman 1987; Bargh and Chartrand 1999) . While higher executive cognitive functions such as language and long-term planning are important capabilities of the human brain, automatic and subconscious processes encompass the bulk of the brain's activity. \"Controlled\" processes similar to those outlined in Bayesian learning models, wherein individuals comprehend and adapt their expectations to new and pertinent information, occur only in special circumstances in which individuals experience unexpected or challenging events or strong visceral emotions. In fact, it takes considerable effort to override automated processes in the brain -the individual must recognize these automatic processes and then deliberately work to correct them (Gilbert 2002) . The automaticity of information processing in the brain undergirds a general pattern-matching process wherein individuals process new information automatically via extant categories the brain uses to maintain its efficiency, categories that are largely the result of social influence (Leboeuf 2002; Medin and Bazerman 1999, Fiske, Gilbert and Gardner 2010) . Research suggests that the general rule of an automated and efficient categorical brain holds across individuals in a variety of situations, but adolescents and children in particular do not execute controlled processes well (Blakemore and Choudhury 2006; Anderson, Anderson, Northam et al. 2001; Casey, Jones and Hare 2008) .\nHere is the problem: While researchers are beginning to apply behavioral decisionmaking theories to the problem of educational expectation formation, even the most recent work does not directly model how students formulate their expectations about their education. The argument that adaptation is the dominant mechanism of expectation formation is particularly questionable because of evidence from experimental, survey and fMRI studies that collectively suggests the adaptation process proposed by Bayesian learning theory does not hold in day-to-day experience. Still, such reservations about the importance of adaptation in educational expectations seem flimsy when there has also been no definitive test of older, counterpoint models asserting that a static mental state adopted early on from significant others is the fountainhead of educational expectations.\nFor these reasons, we test assertions in the literature about adoption and adaptation in educational expectations using structural models of expectation formation. In order to distinguish arguments about the dominant mechanisms of educational expectation formation in the literature, we establish three key features of educational expectation formation: (1. whether educational expectations are based on a static latent mental state, (2. the extent of persistence or stability in educational expectations over time, and (3. whether and to what extent students' educational expectations are the result of their evaluations of their academic potential and subsequent revisions or adaptations to their expectations based on this information. In order to effectively contrast adopt and adapt arguments in the literature, we need only establish the basic dynamics by which educational expectations are formed. Evidence in favor of adaptation of educational expectations over time and against stable expectations, whether this stability is the result of a static mental construct or not, is sufficient for contrasting the starkest points of departure between adoption and adaptation. 4 "}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use a sample from the National Education Longitudinal Study 1988 in our analysis. The NELS88 is a national probability sample of 1,000 schools and 25,000 8 th graders attending those schools in 1988. Data were collected in four waves, following students from the 8 th grade in 1988 until 2000 when students were 26-27 years of age. The study includes surveys of students, principals, teachers and parents as well as high school and post-secondary transcripts. Students were surveyed in all years of the study; parents were surveyed in the first wave in 1988 when students were in the 8 th grade and in 1992 when students were typically high school seniors. The four-panel sample consists of 12,144 individuals.\nMost importantly, we limit the sample to blacks, Latinos and whites. Some research suggests potential race-ethnic differences in the effects of educational expectations and, therefore, potentially adaptation in expectations as well (Kerckhoff and Campbell 1977; Hauser and Anderson 1991) . Thus, we initially estimate models separately by race-ethnic group, imposing equality constraints on coefficients across groups as necessary. Sample restrictions shown in Table 1 leave an analytic sample of 6,669 whites, 759 blacks and 1073 Latinos. Observations with missing data on educational attainment at age 26 and any measure of educational expectations are dropped from the sample. We use imputed values for missing data for all variables other than educational expectations and years of education at age 26 because these latter two measures are of primary interest. 5 We consider a number of exogenous demographic and social background measures in our models. We include a dummy measure of gender indicating whether the student is female. We also include two dummy variables for the immigrant status of the student and his/her parents. These dummy measures denote whether the student or either parent was born outside the United States. We include multiple measures of social background characteristics in order to estimate measurement error in these variables. Social background variables with a student and parent measure from the 1988 surveys include years of each parent's education and the occupational education of each parent. 6 We opt to use occupational education given evidence of its importance relative to other features of occupational standing in the determination of educational attainment (Hauser and Warren 1997 education for fathers or mothers within a race-ethnic group, and dummy variables indicating missingness on these variables are included in the model (Allison 2001) . For family income, we include two parent reports obtained in 1988 and 1992 on the argument that the two measures together characterize the non-transitory income of the household. In addition to multiple measures of the aforementioned social background characteristics, we also use a single student report of whether the family is intact when the student is 16 years old. Parents were not interviewed when most students were age 16 in the study, and, therefore, we are only able to use a student report for this measure. We also include a 1988 parent's report of the total number of siblings (up to six or more). We prefer a parent's report of the number of siblings because this version of the question is more comprehensive than the version asked of students. Students' educational expectations are elicited at multiple waves of the study with the question: \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" Respondents choose among 10 categorical options in ascending order.\nTo facilitate comparison with the bulk of the previous empirical literature (e.g., Morgan 2005), we recode the original categorical variable into years of education. This repeated measure also allows us to explicitly estimate a dynamic structural adaptation model of educational expectations. We include three measures of educational expectations taken in 1988, 1990 and 1992 when students were typically in the 8 th , 10 th and 12 th grades, respectively. 7 We specifically test whether educational expectations are adapted over time in light of new information about grade point average and test scores. We limit adaptation in educational expectations to information about academic achievement since this information is arguably the most important information about students' chances of future educational opportunities. 8 Following Haller (1982) , we treat grade point average and test score measures as information about students' educational performance known to students and that condition their educational expectations and their ultimate years of attained education. The NELS88 includes three grade point average measures based on self-reports and transcript records for the middle school grades (6 th through 8 th ) and for early and later high school grades (9 th through 10 th and 11 th through 12 th ). The middle school grade point measure is derived from student self-reports. Students were asked in the 8 th grade to report whether they received mostly As, Bs, Cs, Ds or Fs in a given subject during middle school. We convert these reports to a four-point scale and average across subjects. The high school grade point measures for grades 9 th -10 th and 11 th -12 th are taken from high school transcripts and constructed in a similar manner. Finally, we use math and reading test scores in the 8 th , 10 th and 12 th grades to construct percentile rank measures. 9 The ultimate dependent variable in the analysis is years of attained education in 2000, when respondents were about 26 years of age. This measure is derived from school transcripts obtained in the final waves of the NELS88 study. Descriptive statistics including proportion missing are shown for all model variables by race-ethnicity in Table 2 . "}, {"section_title": "Model Estimation", "text": "In our analysis, we estimate structural models that span five periods: childhood, 8 th grade, 10 th grade, 12 th grade and young adulthood (age 26). We model absolute levels of expectations, grades and percentile test score rank at three periods -8 th , 10 th and 12 th grades. Thus, the models can be understood in terms of the counterfactual: If we were to change a student's achievement in a given period holding all other measures constant, how much would that student subsequently revise her or his expectations? 10 We estimate two main structural models: (1. a model of educational attainment in young adulthood with a static construct of educational expectations but a dynamic process in grades and test scores across adolescence and (2. a model of educational attainment in young adulthood with a dynamic process in educational expectations, grades and test scores across adolescence. The first model we refer to as the expectations construct model; the second model we refer to as the dynamic expectations model. 11 We freely estimate the relationships among expectations, grade point average and test scores by race-ethnic group, but subsequently impose race-ethnic equality constraints on these coefficients as the data permit and as described in our discussion of the findings.\nThe basic structure of the expectations construct model is illustrated schematically in Figure 2 . 12 This model asserts that students form a static expectations construct based on important social influences and speaks to early status attainment research. In this model, demographic and social background variables affect a static construct, \"Expectations.\" This construct determines educational expectations in each of three periods: 8 th , 10 th and 12 th grades. Demographic and social background variables also affect initial measures of grades and test achievement in the 8 th grade period. The model is block recursive between grades and test scores -that is, prior measures of these variables affect the corresponding measures in the next period. Structural disturbances of grades and test scores within a period are allowed to covary with each other as well as with the structural disturbance of the static construct \"Expectations.\" 13 Turning to the final outcome in the expectations construct model, we allow \"Expectations\" as well as 12 th grade measures of grade point average and test achievement to affect years of educational attainment at age 26. Based on model fit, we also allow measures of father's education and family income to directly affect educational attainment in young adulthood. 14 The dynamic expectations model is represented schematically in Figure 3 . This model explicitly specifies previously untested adaptation mechanisms posited in Bayesian learning models of educational expectations as well as persistence in educational expectations over time. In the dynamic expectations model, we treat educational expectations measures in each period separately, similar to the treatment of measures of grades and test scores in the expectations construct model. Each expectations measure is a self-representing measure based on the student's report. 15 Measures of expectations, grades and test scores in the 8 th grade are determined by childhood demographic and social background measures. We now use the same block recursive structure in the relationships between expectations, grades and test scores across periods that we specified in the expectations construct model between grades and test scores alone (see Figure 3) . That is, we allow expectations, grades and test achievement measures in a given period to affect expectations, grades and test achievement measures in the subsequent period. We refer to the paths from grades and test scores in the prior period to expectations in the subsequent period as (inter-period) adaptation in expectations. Measures of educational expectations, grades and test achievement in the 12 th grade affect years of attained education at age 26 in the dynamic expectations models. As in the expectations construct model, we allow father's education and family income to affect years of attained education directly. In supplementary analyses, we test the robustness of our expectations construct and dynamic expectations models to different assumptions about measurement error and the timing of adaptation in educational expectations as well as to sample definition by including high school dropouts. We specifically consider alternative scenarios where we do not allow for measurement error in social background, expectations and/or grades, and where we allow students to adapt their expectations in a given period based on information about their academic achievement in the same period. We discuss these supplementary findings as necessary."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Formation of Adolescents' Educational Expectations", "text": "We begin by assessing the fit of the expectations construct model relative to the dynamic expectations model, shown in Panel A of We next clarify the pathways or information by which students may adapt their educational expectations and the extent of race-ethnic differences in these pathways. Panel B in Table 3 shows fit statistics for a series of tests of the basic assumptions about relationships among expectations, grades and test achievement measures. In each test, we simply constrain structural paths of interest to zero and compare model fit to the appropriate baseline model. Substantial and clear improvements in fit are evident for all structural constraints in the dynamic expectations model except in one case -constraining adaptation in expectations by grades to zero. First, there is no adaptation in expectations based on test achievement. It is not the case that adolescent students formulate static expectations for their educational attainment, but neither is it the case that expectations are strongly influenced by measures of academic achievement, particularly test scores. The evidence for adaptation in expectations by grades is the opposite. In that case, constraining the path from grades in the previous period to expectations in the subsequent period leads to a decrement in fit that constitutes strong evidence of adaptation in educational expectations.\nNone of these processes significantly varies by race-ethnic group. Panel C of Table 3 displays the fit statistics for models with increasingly narrow definitions of race-ethnic differences in the model. A model constraining all relevant pathways to equality fits the data best. Given the lack of evidence for race-ethnic differences in adaptation in educational expectations, we pool estimates of these relationships across race-ethnic groups in the remaining models."}, {"section_title": "Quantifying Adaptation in Educational Expectations Over Time", "text": "How much do students really adapt their educational expectations? To answer this question, we show unstandardized coefficients from the best fitting model of dynamic expectations in Table 4 . 17 In this table, the effect of 12 th grade expectations on educational attainment at age 26 is significant and indicates an additional year of expected education at the conclusion of high school leads to about .40 years of additional education. Expectations clearly matter for individual educational attainment, as we would expect based on past research. Second, auto-regressions of expectations show very strong persistence in expectations over time, especially between the 8 th and 10 th grades (.97 between 8 th and 10th grade, .90 between 10 th and 12 th grade). Even though educational expectations are not driven by a static mental construct, educational expectations stabilize rather early in adolescence. Such stability in expectations is apparent in the extent of adaptation in expectations based on information about grade point average. For example, a unit increase in 8 th grade GPA leads to a .30 increase in years of expected education in the 10 th grade. This effect is quite small in practical terms. A student would have to increase his GPA, say, from a C average to a B average -a considerable feat -before he would revise his expectations upward by less than a third of a year of education. This effect is even smaller in the following period.\nA unit increase in 10 th grade GPA leads to a .07 increase in expected years of education in the 12 th grade -an effect of marginal substantive and statistical significance. This is as we would expect given the survey, experiment and fMRI evidence of the relative persistence of expectations over time in the face of new information about academic achievement. The decline in adaptation over time suggests very qualified validity of Bayesian learning models: Students very slightly revise their expectations in light of information about their grades, and this revision declines to nearly nil by the conclusion of high school. Thus, this evidence is more in line with Haller's (1982) supposition that adolescents' educational expectations are mostly stable by adolescence. These main findings are consistent with findings from supplementary models. In supplementary models, we also considered a dynamic expectations model that ignores measurement error in grade point average and/or expectations and a dynamic expectations model that allows students to adapt their educational expectations based on information about grade point average and test achievement within the same period. In the case of the intra-period dynamic expectations model, we find that students adapt their educational expectations by .8 years for a unit increase in grade point average at most in periods where intraperiod adaptation effects are plausibly identified in the data. 18 We still see a declining pattern in adaptation consistent with a Bayesian learning model -students only adapt their educational .893*** (.009)\nTest 8th grade (7) Test 10th grade (8)\n.984*** (.012)"}, {"section_title": "Test 12th grade (9)", "text": ".775*** (.012)\nYears of education (10) .383*** "}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "In this article we address a long-standing debate over the exact nature of individual decision making, a debate that has threaded its way through large swaths of the sociology literature and produced more discussion than empirical evidence. We use educational expectations formation to begin to explicate the exact processes driving individual decision making. This general debate in sociology has converged on a moderate position emphasizing the importance of both active and passive decision-making mechanisms. Still, questions remain as to the relative importance of each and their exact operation in the context of educational attainments. Our analysis addresses these specific questions.\nOur findings contribute to the literature in two ways. First, the educational expectations literature has long suggested students formulate a static mental construct that drives their educational expectations. We find relatively weak evidence that such a static mental construct drives reported educational expectations, regardless of the hypothesized source of such a construct. This is an important feature of educational expectations that has not been made explicit before. Second, others have argued that purposive self-reflective processes, particularly adaptation in educational expectations in the face of new information, are the dominant source of adolescents' educational expectations. However, there are no adequate tests of that supposition, and evidence to the contrary exists across a wide array of literatures using experiments, survey data and fMRI technology. Our models consistently demonstrate that adolescents do not easily adapt their educational expectations based on relevant information about their academic achievement. In fact, students must achieve exceptionally large increases in grade point average before adapting their educational expectations by .80 years at most. A more conservative model suggests a much smaller effect of new information about academic achievement on expectations, as little as .07 additional years of expected education for every unit increase in grade point average. This follows evidence from the same model of considerable stability in educational expectations from a rather early age, evidence in line with Haller's (1982) suppositions. Autoregressions of educational expectations across the 8 th , 10 th and 12 th grades demonstrate that a year of expected education in the prior period is equivalent to .90 to .97 years of expected education in the following period.\nIt remains possible that the limited adaptation in educational expectations we find is a feature unique to our data for a single cohort of students following a secular increase in educational expectations. However, the evidence available elsewhere concerning adaptation in educational expectations also supports the conclusions we draw here. Alexander, Bozick and Entwisle (2008) find very few changes in educational expectations during college for a sample of Baltimore students, and Gabay-Egozi et al. (2009) observe certain students in Israel choose less risky coursework regardless of prior academic achievement. If the experimental and fMRI evidence correctly describes basic cognitive processes common to the formation of many expectations, then it is not surprising that similar results are observed among samples of U.S. adolescents, Baltimore young adults and Israeli adolescents.\nIt is also possible that students may vary in their rate of learning so that some students' expectations may be quite adaptable while others are not or that students may require a large amount of pertinent information to accumulate over time before adapting their expectations (Morgan 2005) . These possibilities are interesting but do not fit our results. Recall that autoregressive pathways in educational expectations are quite high across time. This suggests that even if we were able to model the effects of differences in rates of student learning or the effects of different accumulations of information on educational expectations with our data we would not observe more adaptation in educational expectations over time. Moreover, these variations of Bayesian learning theory still highlight executive decision-making processes that find little support in research across a wide array of literatures vis-\u00e0-vis adolescent students. It is hard to imagine that variants of adaptation in expectations such as these would represent a dominant source of expectation formation given the weight of evidence against them.\nFinally, it may be that substantively significant adaptation in expectations occurs in the presence of sharp and drastic exogenous changes, or shocks, in information about and/or perceptions of future academic success and attainments. For example, mentoring may be a particularly important mechanism by which students adapt their educational expectations. Erickson, McDonald and Elder (2009) find that mentors can increase student achievements. One mechanism by which this may occur is through new, outside encouragement that leads students to adjust their educational expectations. The effects of sharp and drastic changes in information about and/or perceptions of future educational success are unknown but likely temper over time in most cases given important foundational sources of students' expectations -family endowments, social contexts and influences, and the like -persist throughout and endure beyond these sharp changes. If any adaptation does occur, it does so most likely in young adulthood and in the face of important and unexpected and unintended life transitions such as early parenthood (Beutel 2000) . These suggestions are all, of course, subject to empirical test and underscore the need for future research that will refine and extend the present findings.\nThe findings here highlight the need to develop appropriate and rigorous models of educational expectations and to more explicitly test the extent of adoption of educational expectations in early childhood and its social nature. Haller (1982) explicitly hypothesizes that educational expectations are relatively stable by adolescence, and our data support this hypothesis. Work should be undertaken to determine how and when in the early educational career expectations are formed and ossify. We anticipate that research on the formation of educational expectations in childhood will support our findings. Social psychology and neuroscience research underscores that children are severely limited in key executive processes approximating Bayesian learning (Blakemore and Choudhury 2006) , and ethnographic research in sociology suggests that children are exposed to subtle social schemas early in life (Lareau 2003) . If children are limited in executive processes approximating Bayesian learning but educational expectations form and ossify during childhood, this reinforces our finding that students do not adapt their educational expectations to any large degree. If normative adoption of expectations occurs informally, begins early in childhood, and is largely completed by adolescence, that process merits careful and nuanced investigation, especially the influence of significant others.\nA number of pieces of early research on educational expectation formation point to the importance of significant others' influence (e.g., Sewell, Haller and Portes 1969; Cheng and Starks 2002) . Although we do not test this mechanism in any of our models, it is even more important given the evidence we present. This is because significant others likely play a particularly important role in individuals' expectation formation if these expectations are formed early on in the educational career. It is necessary, then, to finely model the actual process by which significant others influence students' expectation formation, much as we have done in models of adaptation in expectations. This will require research from a host of literatures as well as a host of methods. Insofar as sociological research is concerned, we agree with Morgan (2005) that network models of expectation formation are an important part of this effort.\nThe work that lies ahead is also more basic than studying children's expectations and modeling social influence processes in expectations. It still is not clear what exactly we are measuring when we ask students to respond to a survey question about educational expectations. Along those lines, it is not certain how educational expectations relate to other academic self-concepts like those used in Correll (2001) or Gabay-Egozi et al. (2009) . Educational expectations have also been used to proxy a host of complex theoretical concepts such as habitus (Dumais 2002) . This work provides a useful bridge with popular theories of culture but is subject to considerable theoretical ambiguity because this body of work does not clearly distinguish an empirical social psychological model of educational expectations from an empirical cultural capital one. Experiments and ethnographic research will prove vital in exploring what survey questions about expectations measure and how they relate to other important aspects of students' perceptions and subjective experiences in the educational career.\nWe conclude by reiterating the need for further work. Our work has addressed but one tension in the literature as to how expectations are formed and decisions vis-\u00e0-vis one's final educational attainments are made. Given the increasing popularity of this topic, we doubt this is the last word on this topic. We certainly hope that is the case."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "1. While the shorthand description \"the adopt-adapt debate\" simplifies the multiplex processes of expectation formation, it aptly highlights recent tensions in the literature. Morgan (2005) and Haller (1982) both recognize that individuals' educational expectations are the result of self-reflection and social influence but highlight one over the other. Haller and Morgan also consider the possibility that individuals imitate their significant others in formulating their educational expectations. However, neither emphasizes imitation as the dominant source of educational expectations. It is not clear how one would empirically distinguish between adoption and imitation processes in educational expectation formation. Previous research suggests that imitation in expectations can be evaluated by modeling the direct effect of significant others' statuses on a student's educational expectations. However, the main difference between imitation and adoption processes in expectation formation appears to be whether significant others' expectations are communicated directly or indirectly, a distinction difficult to make empirically. In a sense, then, imitation is a constituent part of the adoption of significant others' expectations.\n2. The Bayesian theorem is formally expressed as follows. Consider two random events, A and B, in the following equation:\nwhere P(A|B) is the conditional probability of A given B, what is known as the posterior probability; B(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A, P(B) is the probability of B, and P(A) is the probability of A. The equation states P(A) (or the prior) is multiplied by some factor (P(B|A)/P(B)). This factor is sometimes referred to as the normalized likelihood. This equation simply asserts the posterior probability of A is updated by some factor, the normalized likelihood. An introduction to Bayesian inference can be found in Greene (2008) .\n3. Neuro-social science is a growth industry that has generated several key findings over the past 30 years about the architecture and biochemistry of the brain related to the basic mechanics of human behavior. This descriptive work is another way to address the difficult problem of modeling and observing internal psychological processes related to (educational) decision making. While survey and experimental research can deduce information processing mechanisms from constructed measures and observed behavior, the validity of these deductions rely on rather strict assumptions about how individuals perceive and process information. Neuro-social science research using fMRI and other technologies in conjunction with sociological theories provides an opportunity to examine these strict assumptions in detail.\n4. We do not consider the influence of significant others here. While this is obviously an important source of initial expectation formation given prior research, we opt to focus on the explicit structure of students' educational expectations to test opposing hypotheses in the literature about the formation and revision of educational expectations over time. We address the influence of significant others and other future research in the conclusion to this article.\n5. Imputation models include all variables considered here as well as additional measures such as family composition. We assume non-monotone missing patterns in the data and use a Monte Carlo Markov chain model to impute the data. We impute race-ethnic groups separately and drop observations with missing data on educational attainment and expectations measures after imputing (von Hippel 2007) . Imputed responses remain unedited (Horton, Lipsitz and Parzen 2003) .\n6. Occupational education is defined as the percentage of persons in an occupation who have completed at least one year of college. That is, the status of each parent is characterized by the level of education that is typical of their occupation as well as by their actual level of educational attainment.\n7. We focus on educational expectations in adolescence for a number of reasons. Educational expectations are used widely in research in sociology, and detailed, repeated panel measures are available in national studies from adolescence through young adulthood. Recent research assesses the role of expectations in college attendance and finds very small changes in expectations after a student enrolls in post-secondary school. This research, however, finds a rather large effect of educational expectations in high school on expectations during post-secondary schooling (Alexander, Bozick and Entwisle 2008) . Moreover, Morgan (2005) focused on educational expectations from the sophomore year of high school through the end of college. Given Morgan's focus and prior research on educational expectations in post-secondary school, it makes sense to begin with the formation and revision of expectations from early adolescence forward.\n8. It seems that there are actually two arguments in Morgan (2005) vis-\u00e0-vis adaptation in educational expectations. He specifically asserts that adaptation occurs across the educational career of a student and across cohorts. While both are based on information about educational opportunity, Morgan asserts macro-level sources of information such as changing labor market returns to a college degree are important for cross-cohort adaptation in expectations and micro-level sources of information about academic potential are important for intra-career adaptation. It is this latter mechanism that we test here.\n9. We use these measures because the NELS88 test scores capture general test achievement, achievement that transfers across different tests and is well known to the student. Other available test measures in the NELS88 tied more directly to educational outcomes such as the SAT or ACT only apply to students intending to enter a post-secondary institution requiring such a test and are often taken only once towards the end of high school. Because such tests only apply to a select group of students for a unitary purpose, may be taken only at one point in time, and are highly correlated with general test achievement, we use the test score percentile rank measures from the NELS88.\n10. That is, we exploit between-person variation rather than within-person variation. While the latter is a valid source of variation, we prefer our identification strategy because it allows us to more easily compare expectation formation across race-ethnic groups and to model different adaptation models. In the current analysis, our identification strategy specifically allows us to test adaptation in educational expectations based on betweenand within-period information about academic achievement. Our approach also uses a similar identification strategy as Morgan (2005) and other, previous research on educational expectations formation.\n11. Structural models are technically composed of two parts: A structural model describing relationships among exogenous and endogenous variables and a measurement model describing how these variables are measured and errors in those measurements. All models are identified in part by covariance and cross-equation restrictions that are described in an available appendix. Measurement error in expectations and grades is technically identified because we assume social background characteristics only affect measures of expectations, grades and test scores in the 8 th grade directly, because there are no lagged effects between grades 8 and 12, and because only expectations, grades and test achievement in the 12 th grade affect education at 26 years directly. However, we also introduce equality constraints in errors in grades across periods as well as within race-ethnic group and in errors in expectations across groups in order to stabilize model estimates. Estimates based on these constraints are consistent with estimates from a model with errors in expectations and grades freely estimated across and within race-ethnic groups, improve model fit considerably and produce in-range estimates of correlations among structural disturbances. Our reported findings are also consistent with those from structural models that omit measurement errors in self-representing measures of expectations and grades. It is not possible to identify correlations in measurement errors across expectations measures and across grade point average measures without making further assumptions about these correlations.\n12. Please note that certain features are omitted from this and other schematic figures for the sake of simplicity. For example, covariances among structural disturbances are omitted from figures. The reader should refer to the main text for details on the models shown in figures 2 and 3.\n13. The model asserts expectations and academic achievement potentially influence each other but remains agnostic as to the direction of these relationships. This is because our \"Expectations\" construct is endogenous to our grade and test measures, even in the 8 th grade. The 8 th grade measure of grade point average is a self-reported measure taken in the same survey as the 8 th grade measure of expectations. Thus, we cannot identify the direction of the relationship(s) between even the 8 th grade achievement measures and the construct \"Educational Expectations.\"\n14. There are, of course, many ways to test whether educational expectations are determined by a static mental construct. We prefer the expectations construct model presented here because it is a nested version of the dynamic adaptation in expectations model, captures key features of the expectation formation process such as direct effects of social background characteristics on a factor \"Expectations\" and of this factor on years of attained education much like a standard MIMIC model, and allows structural disturbances between the \"Expectations\" factor and grades and test scores to covary (and remains agnostic about the direction of these relationships).\n15. Latent variables for expectations and grades only have one indicator and, thus, are selfrepresenting. In contrast, latent endogenous variables representing \"test\" achievement in any given period are indicated by two observed measures of test achievement -reading and math. We normalize the metrics of observed test achievement measures by constraining the factor loading for reading to one in each period.\n16. We assess fit using chi-square and Bayesian Information Criterion statistics. See Raftery (1995) for a detailed discussion of the BIC statistic. In the present analysis, a more negative BIC statistic indicates a better fitting model. A decrease in the BIC statistic of 10 or more is very strong evidence of better model fit.\n17. This table should be read from left to right, with row variables affected by column variables. Column variables are numbered in correspondence with the row numbers. Looking across the second row, we see the first entry in that row is the effect of 8 th grade expectations on 10 th grade expectations. The same pattern applies throughout the table.\n18. There are a number of reasons one might have reservations about the larger adaptation effects we observe in the intra-period adaptation model, the first and foremost being the endogeneity of expectations with the within-period GPA measures (see endnote 13). The effect of 8 th grade GPA on 8 th grade expectations is not technically identified but suggests students adapt their educational expectations by 1.6 years for a unit increase in 8 th grade GPA. Given the endogeneity of expectations and GPA in the 8 th grade, we limit ourselves to estimates from high school where the effects of expectations on grade point average are better identified in a model of intra-period adaptation."}]
