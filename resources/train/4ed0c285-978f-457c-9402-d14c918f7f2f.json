Potential normal individuals were referred to Alzheimer Disease Pa-tient Registry personnel by primary care physicians. On referral to the Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry, each research participant was thoroughly evaluated by one of several behavioral neurologists (primarily R.C.P., D.S.K., and B.F.B.), who obtained a medical history from the participant and from an informant, completed the short test of mental status examination 15 and the Hachinski Ischemic Scale, 16 and performed a neurologic examination. Study personnel obtained other data, including the Record of Independent Living, 17 the short version of the GDS, 12 and additional family history information. Laboratory studies included standard hematologic tests; vitamin B 12 , folic acid, and sensitive thyroid stimulating hormone levels; and syphilis serologic testing. All participants underwent brain imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging).\nAn extensive neuropsychological battery was administered on enrollment, and a briefer version was administered at subsequent follow-up visits every 12 to 18 months. 2 These tests included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the Wide-Range Achievement Test-III. 18 Additional tests were the Mini-Mental State Examination, 19 the Dementia Rating Scale, 20 the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Task, 21 the Boston Naming Test, 22 the Controlled Oral Word Association Test, 23 and the category fluency procedures. 24 At the completion of the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evaluations, a consensus meeting was held involving behavioral neurologists, a geriatrician, neuropsychologists, nurses, and other study personnel who had evaluated the participant.

However, a history of depression was not an exclusion criterion. We also excluded persons receiving psychoactive medications in amounts that could compromise cognition.

For more stringent age adjustment, age was used as the time scale in the survival analyses. 31 However, graphic display of cumulative incidence curves was based on the more conventional time-to-event scale (accounting for competing outcomes).

Stratified analyses were conducted for men and women separately and by level of severity of depression (GDS scores of 6 and 7-15 vs 0-5). Possible interaction effects with APOE genotype were examined using multivariate models to test for both multiplicative and additive interactions. This same method was also used to test for interaction between newly developed depression as measured by the GDS and a history of depression preceding enrollment in the study (preceding baseline). In addition, we compared the distribution of the individual GDS items in depressed subjects who developed MCI or dementia and in those who did not, to identify the most predictive items.\nStatistical testing was conducted at the conventional 2-tailed \u2423 level of .05.

A total of 143 participants (17.0%) developed depression during follow-up (depression cohort), while 697 (83.0%) did not (referent cohort). Of the 143 subjects in the depression cohort, 68 (47.6%) had a GDS score of 6, 72 (50.4%) had scores of 7 to 11, and 3 (2.1%) had scores of 12 to 15. The baseline characteristics of the depression and referent cohorts are summarized in Table 1 . The depression cohort tended to be older than the referent cohort; however, this imbalance was controlled by using age as the time scale when modeling the survival data.\nOf the 143 subjects with depression, 17 (13.3%) developed MCI, whereas of the 697 referent subjects, only 33 (4.9%) developed MCI. Figure 1 shows cumulative incidence curves (using the conventional time-to-event scale and accounting for competing outcomes). The cumulative incidence curves for the depression and referent groups remained divergent throughout the follow-up for both the primary and secondary outcomes. The hazard ratio (HR) for MCI was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.1), after controlling for age (time scale), education, and sex, and considering dementia as a competing outcome.

The risk was similarly increased when the composite outcome of incident MCI or dementia was considered. The association was stronger in men than women, but did not vary by severity of depression. It is surprising that there was no relationship between the severity of depressive symptoms and the risk of MCI. However, most of the subjects who developed depression in this cohort had mild or moderate depression (GDS scores of 6 or 7-11). In addition, the GDS may be inadequate to measure severity because the score increases by the number of items endorsed rather than by the severity of the items.\nWe found an antagonistic (negative) interaction between depression newly developed during the study and history of depression preceding the study. Subjects who developed depression during the study and also had a history of depression had a smaller risk of MCI than those who developed depression but had no history of depression. This pattern of interaction may suggest a protective effect of antidepressant medications used before recruitment by subjects with a history of depression. Unfortunately, we could not test this hypothesis because we did not collect data on antidepressant medications used either before or during the study.\nWe also observed a synergistic (positive) interaction between APOE genotype and depression: the joint effect of depression and APOE genotype was significantly greater than the sum of the independent effects of the 2 factors. We propose the following 4 alternative mechanisms that may account for the observed association between depression (GDS score \u05466) and incident MCI (Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Causal factor.", "text": "Depression is in the chain of causality leading to MCI by virtue of its effect on the neuroendocrine axis. 33 An important implication of this hypothesis is that an intervention targeting depression may lead to primary prevention of MCI.\n2. Shared risk factor or confounding. Depression is noncausally associated with MCI because a third factor leads to the genesis of both MCI and depression. The third factor (confounder) could be genetic, environmental, or both.\n3. Reverse causality. First, a person who is experiencing some degree of cognitive decline may develop depression as a reaction to the symptoms. Second, depressive symptoms may be an early noncognitive manifestation of dementia. Third, depression may \"unmask\" the clinical manifestations of MCI in individuals with limited cognitive reserve. 34 4. Interaction. Depression leads to cognitive decline only in the presence of a genetic susceptibility factor or another risk factor. We found evidence of a synergistic interaction between APOE genotype and depression. These 4 mechanisms (and other possible mechanisms) are not mutually exclusive and may act in combination.\nThe individual items of the GDS that were significantly more endorsed by depressed subjects destined to later develop MCI or dementia were items 10 (memory) and 13 (energy). These 2 items refer to premonitory symptoms of later cognitive decline or illness in general rather than to mood symptoms per se.\nFew prospective studies have investigated the association between depression and dementia, and the results of these studies have been inconsistent. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] To our knowledge, ours is one of the first studies to investigate Abbreviations: APOE, apolipoprotein E; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; MCI, mild cognitive impairment. *Data on APOE genotype were missing for 1 person. \u2020Calculated using Cox proportional hazards models considering dementia as a competing outcome, with age as the time scale and with adjustment for sex (male sex: HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0-3.2; P = .07) and education (\u03fe12 y: HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9; P = .8). A test for additive interaction was significant (P = .03).\nthe association between depression and incident MCI as measured by the criteria of Petersen et al. 2 Our secondary outcome of incident MCI or dementia is comparable to the outcome used in the Religious Orders Study 35 and in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 36 In those studies, subjects with depression were more likely than referent subjects to become demented or to experience cognitive decline. 35, 36 There are several strengths to our study. First, the longitudinal follow-up of a large cohort of elderly individuals free of both cognitive impairment and depression on enrollment enabled us to observe the association between the independent variable (depression) and the primary outcome of incident MCI. Second, the frequency of follow-up visits was high (every 12-18 months). This allowed us to detect depression and MCI or dementia near the time of their onset (incident events). Third, we adjusted for the difference in age at baseline between depressed and referent subjects by using age as the time scale in survival analyses. 31 Traditional time-to-event survival analyses were also conducted for comparison and showed similar results (sensitivity analyses; data not shown). 31 Fourth, available genotyping data allowed for the exploration of a possible interaction between APOE genotype and depression.\nOur study also had limitations. First, we did not use a structured interview in the assessment of depression, and we did not collect information about treatments for depression. We measured depression using the short version of the GDS (15 items) rather than the original long version (30 items). 9, 12, 13 However, the short version has been validated and shown to be comparable to the long version. 13 Second, because of our stringent eligibility criteria, the subjects included in our sample may have been healthier than a probability (random) sample of elderly individuals residing in the community. This may have reduced the external validity of our study. A future population-based study can rectify this weakness. Third, despite the high frequency of follow-up visits, we may have missed individuals who transitioned from normal cognition to dementia between 2 visits. To account for these incomplete assessments, we assumed that all subjects who developed dementia went through an MCI stage, and we used a composite secondary outcome measure of MCI or dementia.\nOur study suggests that cognitively normal elderly individuals who develop depression are at increased risk of subsequent MCI. In addition, there may be a synergistic interaction between APOE genotype and depression. "}, {"section_title": "Accepted for", "text": ""}]
