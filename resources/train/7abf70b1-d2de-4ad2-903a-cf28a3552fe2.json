On the other hand, 40 percent of education majors were not teaching at the elementary/secondary level in 1994, 1997, or 2003 (table 5). Many of the 1992-93 graduates who became teachers had earned a master's degree or higher by 2003 and had done so at higher rates than graduates who did not teach: 39 percent of graduates who taught had attained a master's degree or higher by 2003, compared with about one-quarter of those who did not teach (table 6). About 42 percent of the late starters had attained a master's degree or higher by 2003, perhaps reflecting their pursuit of graduate studies before embarking on their teaching career.\nThe \"highly qualified teacher\" 7 provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) codified almost a decade of increased attention to the academic preparation of teachers. Data on teacher qualifications from the mid-1980s led to a call for higher licensure requirements for content specialists and increased academic requirements for teacher preparation (Holmes Group 1986;NCTAF 1996NCTAF , 2003. Some teacher education institutions responded by creating 5th-year master of education degree programs requiring a bachelor's degree in a content area prior to completing a master's program focusing primarily on content-specific pedagogy. Others increased the content rigor of their undergraduate preparation. By 2004, there were 31 states that required a major in a teaching content area to obtain a license to teach high school; in 1995 (the earliest year for which such data are available), only 19 states required this level of content preparation (Cavell et al. 2005). Today, teacher education is most notable for its diversity in delivery models and its relative emphasis on content and pedagogy (Levine 2006).

With regard to student demographic shifts, the proportion of Hispanic students in the nation's schools now exceeds the proportion of Black students (KewalRamani et al. 2007). Regarding increased accountability requirements, the adequate yearly progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) require teachers to analyze and address achievement gaps in their classrooms. In addition, the teacher quality provisions of NCLB require some teaching veterans to seek additional certification or otherwise demonstrate content expertise. While major shifts in the demands of teaching have occurred, teacher preparation programs continue to evolve and be scrutinized by researchers and policymakers. Alternatives to traditional teacher education programs have increased in number and scope, thus expanding the pool of potential applicants for teaching positions (Feistritzer 2006). Programs such as the Urban Teaching Partnership, Pathways to Teaching, and Teach for America aim to increase the pool of certified (especially minority) teachers, while promoting rigorous preparation and high-quality teaching (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman 2004). Yet the teacher supply and demand equation depends not only on the number of newly qualified teachers but also on the rate of teacher attrition. Recent research has shown that some 50 percent of beginning teachers leave the profession within 5 to 7 years (Ingersoll 2003;Reed, Ruben, and Barbour 2006). In addition, although some teacher attrition can be attributed to retirement, family responsibilities, or involuntary attrition, almost one-half of teachers leave due to job dissatisfaction or in pursuit of better career opportunities (Luekens, Lyter, and Fox 2004). Introduction were in the top category were twice as likely as those with scores in the bottom category to leave the profession and not return by 1997. Henke and Zahn also found that teacher attrition is no higher than the attrition of college graduates in other occupations. In addition, a recent analysis of data from the 2003-04 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) showed that 91 percent of public and private school teachers began teaching within 10 years of receiving their bachelor's degree (Chandler 2006). The decisions that individual graduates make about whether or not to pursue a teaching career reflect personal decisions about the relative benefits of teaching versus those of other occupations. Such benefits include not only compensation but also less tangible aspects such as working conditions and personal satisfaction. Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, when combined with positive and negative working conditions, influence decisions to enter teaching, stay in teaching, and leave teaching (Johnson, Berg, and Donaldson 2005;Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 2004;Buckley, Schneider, and Yi 2005). The opportunity cost of choosing to teach, and choosing to continue to teach, is defined as the difference between the rewards gained in teaching and the potential rewards of other activities, such as pursuing another profession or deciding to remain out of the workforce for reasons such as child rearing (Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006). Furthermore, the career choices of teachers are individual decisions that have implications in the aggregate for teacher supply and educational policy. To the extent that high-quality teachers choose to enter and stay in the profession, schools will have fewer vacant faculty positions and a larger pool of qualified applicants to fill those positions. The research literature on teacher attrition and retention addresses the policy and practical implications of these individual career decisions. Studies looking at demographic characteristics (including family composition), academic preparation, teaching assignments, and compensation seek to illuminate the relationships between these variables and decisions to enter or remain in teaching. In this report, \"teacher\" and \"teaching\" refer to instructors and instruction in grades K through 12 in public or private schools in the United States, unless otherwise noted. Studies reviewing the association of demographic factors including gender, race/ethnicity, and age with teachers' career choices seem to confirm the view that women are attracted to the profession because it is more compatible with family responsibilities than are other occupations (Allen 2005;Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006). Few studies, however, explicitly explore the association between having children and teachers' careers. With respect to race/ethnicity, while the number of minority teachers has increased in recent years, minorities remain relatively unlikely to enter teaching (Broughman and Rollefson 2000;Henke, Chen, and Geis 2000;Vegas, Murnane, and Willett 2001;Estrada 2004). With respect to age, the association with retention and attrition are similarly well-documented, with young teachers leaving at high rates early in their careers, with teachers having relatively stable work patterns in their middle-career years, and with teachers having increased attrition as they mature and approach retirement (Boe et al. 1996;Grissmer and Kirby 1997;Ingersoll 2001). The academic preparation of teachers has received much attention from both researchers and policymakers over the past decade. In the mid-1990s, reports analyzing data from SASS detailed the percentage of high school mathematics and science teachers with less than a major in their main teaching field (Bobbitt and McMillen 1995;Ingersoll, Han, and Bobbitt 1995). These data findings led to a call for higher licensure requirements for content specialists and increased academic requirements for teacher preparation (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future 1996). Research results on the relationship between indicators of academic preparation and teacher attrition and retention vary across studies. While some studies indicate that advanced content preparation is associated with increased teacher attrition, others report associations between having an advanced degree and improved teacher retention (Johnson, Berg, and Donaldson 2005). Studies of two measures of academic achievement of prospective and new teachers, college entrance examinations and grade point averages (GPAs), demonstrate that these measures differ in their association with teaching status. While research conducted since the early 1980s has shown that college graduates who teach tend to have lower ACT and SAT scores than those who do not teach (Murnane et al. 1991;Schlecty and Vance 1983;Weaver 1983), other studies show that teachers tend to have higher GPAs than graduates pursuing other occupations (Henke et al. 2005). Working conditions and teaching assignments may influence teachers' perceptions of the intrinsic rewards of their chosen occupation. While authors of policy reports have discussed the number of out-of-field teachers, especially in mathematics and science, research shows that teachers themselves desire to teach in their field of preparation (Johnson, Berg, and Donaldson 2005). Working conditions such as class size, administrator support, peer support, and student discipline are associated with teacher retention and attrition. In 2004, Johnson and her colleagues found that new teachers in low-income schools received significantly less support, and had higher attrition, than teachers in high-income schools. 1 Research on induction and mentoring programs, on the other hand, indicates that such support may ameliorate new teacher stress that can lead to attrition. Smith and Ingersoll (2004) found that \"beginning teachers who were provided with mentors from the same subject field . . . were less likely to move to other schools and less likely to leave the teaching occupation after their first year of teaching\" (p. 681). Analyzing data from the NCES Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS), Luekens, Lyter, and Fox (2004) found that an opportunity for a better teaching assignment, dissatisfaction with support Introduction from administrators, and dissatisfaction with workplace conditions were among the most common reasons teachers gave for moving to a new school. Similarly, a 2005 survey of new teachers sponsored by MetLife (2005) found that new teachers who were satisfied with the support and collegiality in their school planned to leave the teaching profession within 5 years less often than those who reported not being satisfied. Salary and other forms of compensation such as benefits and professional development time make up the external rewards of teaching. Research indicates that compensation and working conditions interact and are associated with teacher retention and attrition. While higher salaries might induce teachers to remain in less than ideal working environments, positive working conditions may offset lower pay (Johnson, Berg, and Donaldson 2005). Data from the NCES Teacher Follow-up Survey confirm that both salary and working conditions play a role in teachers' decisions to change schools or leave the profession entirely (Luekens, Lyter, and Fox 2004). According to these data, male teachers, in particular, leave the profession in search of higher salaries more often than female teachers. The Third Follow-up of B&B:93/03 provides a unique opportunity to further examine the timing of teacher careers using longitudinal data to look at three snapshots of the postbaccalaureate career experience. B&B:93/03 includes data on graduates' occupations in 1994, 1997, and 2003, approximately 1, 4, and 10 years after they had received the bachelor's degree, respectively. These data track the experiences of a cohort of college graduates who received their baccalaureate degrees during the 1992-93 academic year, using the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) as the base year. This report follows the original cohort at three time points during a 10-year period, looking specifically at how many bachelor's degree recipients reported teaching at one or more time points. It also addresses the characteristics of graduates who enter teaching immediately after graduation or at a later point, focusing specifically on their demographic characteristics, academic preparation, teacher working conditions, and compensation.  \n"}, {"section_title": "Graduate", "text": "To facilitate discussion in the report, each of the five career categories has been assigned a label that describes the status of graduates' teaching careers at the time of the three follow-ups: Category #1-Taught Consistently: These respondents were teaching in grades K-12 during each of the three interviews in 1994, 1997, and 2003. 2 "}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Category #4-Other Teachers: These respondents were either teaching in 1994 and 2003 but not in 1997, or were teaching in 1997 but not in 1994 or 2003.

Those remaining employed during the time when they have young children may seek family-friendly professions or employers. This analysis, therefore, takes into consideration the relationships between these life events and graduates' choices as they move into and out of the teaching profession. In particular, this section looks at the relationship between career paths and whether 1992-93 graduates had dependents at the initial interview in 1993 and then at the 1997 and 2003 follow-ups. Because mothers have traditionally carried most childrearing responsibilities, the tables present results for all graduates and then for female and male graduates separately. The results indicate that among those who taught, graduates with dependents in 1993, 1997, and 2003 taught consistently at higher rates than graduates without dependents (table 3). This pattern was also found for male graduates; those who had children in 1993 taught consistently at almost twice the rate as male graduates who did not have children at that time (43 percent versus 23 percent). Results for female graduates generally mirror those for all graduates. Overall, a higher proportion of graduates with dependents in 1993, 1997, and 2003 had taught than graduates without dependents at these points.

Among graduates who had taught, 43 percent of those with dependents in 1993, some 39 percent of those with dependents in 1997, and 35 percent of those with dependents in 2003 taught consistently. Among graduates without dependents in each year, a smaller proportion taught consistently. Within each teacher career category, a higher percentage of graduates who had taught had dependents than those who had not taught, and this pattern was found at each time period (table 4). About 19 percent of those who had taught had dependents in 1993, as did 34 percent in 1997 and 63 percent in 2003. Comparable percentages for those who had not taught were 11 percent, 24 percent, and 56 percent. The percentages of graduates within each teacher career category who had dependents also varied across teacher career categories for those who taught. Compared with late starters or other teachers, higher percentages of those who taught consistently had dependents at each time period. Also, a higher percentage of graduates who had left the teaching profession by 2003 had dependents in 2003 than those who were late starters or other teachers.

However, college entrance exam scores are useful as an indicator of academic ability because they share a common metric across all testtakers (Henke et al. 2005).

For example, if undergraduate programs that prepare teachers tend to give students higher grades than other programs, graduates of those programs (who go on to teach at higher rates than graduates of other programs) would have higher GPAs. Conversely, if undergraduate teacher education programs tend to give students lower grades than other programs, their graduates would tend to have lower GPAs.

For example, those 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who delayed entering teaching to pursue a master's degree would have gained a salary advantage by earning a higher degree that could be somewhat offset by the loss of years in service.

For the purposes of this report, a taxonomy of five teaching career categories was developed based on the B&B:93/03 and NPSAS:93 data. Bachelor's degree recipients in 1992-93 were placed into one of the five career categories related to teaching in elementary and secondary schools at the three follow-ups in 1994, 1997, and 2003. As noted in the Limitations of Data section in the Introduction, the B&B:93/03 data do not include comprehensive job histories of the graduates but do permit analyses of what graduates were doing when the data were collected. The category labels, therefore, serve as shorthand for the various combinations of teaching and not teaching at the time of each of the three follow-up interviews. Graduates in any of the five categories could have had unreported teaching or nonteaching spells between data collection years. As of 2003, some 87 percent of graduates had not taught at any of those three points. Of the remaining graduates who were teaching at one or more of the three follow-up points between 1994 and 2003, some 31 percent taught consistently, about 41 percent began teaching later in their career, and 12 to 16 percent taught at some point over the 10 years, but irregularly (i.e., other teachers or leavers). The analysis shows that among those who taught, a higher proportion of female graduates than male graduates taught consistently, White graduates taught consistently at higher rates than Black graduates, and older graduates at higher rates than younger graduates. Marriage and family formation were related to the timing of teachers' careers. A higher proportion of graduates who had been married by 2003 taught consistently than those who had remained single. Among those who taught, graduates with dependents taught consistently at higher rates than graduates without dependents. Male graduates who had dependents by 1994 taught consistently at higher rates than male graduates without dependents. Among graduates who taught with college entrance exam scores available for analysis, a lower percentage of those with scores in the top 25 percent taught consistently than did those who scored at the lower levels. Having a low GPA was associated with being a late starter in the teaching profession, with 49 percent of those with GPAs of 2.74 or lower being late starters, compared with 36 percent of those with GPAs between 3.23 and 3.75 and 29 percent of those with GPAs of 3.75 or higher. About 39 percent of the 1992-93 graduates who became teachers had earned a master's degree or higher by 2003, and they had done so at higher rates than those who had not taught (24 percent). Forty-two percent of the late starters had attained a master's degree or higher by 2003, in part reflecting the pursuit of graduate studies before embarking on teaching careers. Of those 1992-93 graduates who taught consistently, 69 percent taught in elementary schools, compared with 55 percent of late starters. Public school teachers taught consistently at higher rates than private school teachers (48 vs. 28 percent). Staying in teaching was associated with teaching salary. A higher proportion of those in the lowest academic year base salary category (less than $26,000) for the most recent teaching job were leavers and other teachers compared with those in the middle ($26,000-40,000) and highest (more than $40,000) salary categories.

These variables included the following: \u2022 Age in the base year (NPSAS:93); \u2022 Race/ethnicity; \u2022 Gender; \u2022 U.S. citizenship status; \u2022 Attendance status in the base year; \u2022 Institution control; \u2022 Bureau of Economic Analysis Code (OBE) Region; Appendix B-Technical Notes and Methodology B-5 \u2022 Type of institution/enrollment category; \u2022 B&B institution stratum; \u2022 B&B student stratum; \u2022 Whether applied for aid in the base year; \u2022 Receipt of federal aid in the base year; \u2022 Receipt of Pell Grant in the base year; \u2022 Receipt of Stafford Loan in the base year; \u2022 Receipt of state aid in the base year; \u2022 Receipt of institution aid in the base year; \u2022 Receipt of any aid in the base year; \u2022 Prior respondent to either 1994 or 1997 interview; \u2022 Income in the base year (parent income for dependent students and student income for independent students); \u2022 Number of telephone numbers available during B&B:93/03 data collection; \u2022 Number of times an answering machine was encountered during B&B:93/03; and \u2022 Whether the student was located in a field cluster for B&B:93/03. The steps for nonresponse bias analysis included estimating the nonresponse bias and testing (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level. Second, nonresponse adjustment factors were computed using a subset of variables listed above. The nonresponse adjustments were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for variables included in the corresponding models. Third, after the weights were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above and statistical tests were performed to determine the significance of any remaining nonresponse bias. The weighting adjustments reduced, and in some cases eliminated, bias for students. Prior to the nonresponse weighting adjustment, the response bias was statistically significantly different from zero for 21 percent of the variables; the mean of the absolute values of the biases was 0.40 and the median was 0.20. After the nonresponse weighting adjustment, none of the biases were significantly different from zero; the mean of the absolute values of the biases was 0.01 and median was 0.002. se where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the formula: (2) where r is the correlation between the two estimates. 3 This formula is used when comparing two percentages from a distribution that adds to 100. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used: (3) where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 4 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are some hazards in using statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading because the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in using statistical tests is the possibility of a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the"}]
