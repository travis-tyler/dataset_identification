[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The hippocampal formation is a complex brain structure that is important in cognitive processes such as memory, mood, reward processing and other executive functions. Histological and neuroimaging studies have implicated the hippocampal region in neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. This highly plastic limbic region is made up of several subregions that are believed to have different functional roles. Therefore, there is a growing interest in imaging the subregions of the hippocampal formation rather than modelling the hippocampus as a homogenous structure, driving the development of new automated analysis tools. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand the stability of the measures derived from these new techniques. In this study, an automated hippocampal subregion segmentation pipeline, released as a developmental version of Freesurfer (v6.0), was applied to T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 22 healthy older participants, scanned on 3 separate occasions and a separate longitudinal dataset of 40 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Test-retest reliability of hippocampal subregion volumes was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), percentage volume difference and percentage volume overlap (Dice). Sensitivity of the regional estimates to longitudinal change was estimated using linear mixed effects (LME) modelling. The results show that out of the 24 hippocampal subregions, 20 had ICC scores of 0.9 or higher in both samples; these regions include the molecular layer, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3 and the subiculum (ICC > 0.9), whilst the hippocampal fissure and fimbria had lower ICC scores (0.73-0.88). Furthermore, LME analysis of the independent AD dataset demonstrated sensitivity to group and individual differences in the rate of volume change over time in several hippocampal subregions (CA1, molecular layer, CA3, hippocampal tail, fissure and presubiculum). These results indicate that this automated segmentation method provides a robust method with which to measure hippocampal subregions, and may be useful in tracking disease progression and measuring the effects of pharmacological intervention. "}, {"section_title": "| I N TR ODU C TI ON", "text": "The hippocampal formation is a brain region forming part of the limbic system that has been implicated in many psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Arnold, 1997; Bartsch, 2012; Chakos et al., 2005; Du et al., 2001; Kempton, Salvador, Munafo, Geddes, Simmons, Frangou, & Williams, 2011; K\u20ac uhn & Gallinat, 2013; Laakso et al., 1998; Videbech & Ravnkilde, 1957) . Evidence suggests that the hippocampal formation is highly plastic and sensitive to stress and is believed to have a critical role in cognitive processes such as memory formation, reward processing, fear regulation, mood and other executive functions (Andersen, Morris, Amaral, Bliss, & Okeefe, 2006; Scoviille & Milner, 1957) . The cornu amnonis (regions CA3, CA2, CA1), dentate gyrus, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex constitute the hippocampal formation and much like the cerebral cortex, these subregions have connections both between one another and to other brain regions via the entorhinal cortex, making this a complex, heterogeneous structure. Limitations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, resolution and segmentation have meant that in vivo neuroimaging studies have typically been forced to model the hippocampus as a homogenous structure. This approach has been successful in identifying the hippocampus as a region that is sensitive to disease processes and reduced hippocampal volume is evident in many neurological and psychiatric conditions (Small, Schobel, Buxton, Witter, & Barnes, 2011) . Furthermore, evidence in PTSD suggests that hippocampal volume may be sensitive to pharmacological intervention (Vermetten, Vythilingam, Southwick, Charney, & Bremner, 2003) .\nDespite the advances made from modelling the hippocampus as a whole, rodent and primate studies suggest greater focus on hippocampal subregions may be highly informative (Malberg, 2004; Malberg, Eisch, Nestler, & Duman, et al., 2000) . Several research groups have developed manual segmentation protocols for hippocampal subregion segmentation (Adler et al., 2014; Kulaga-Yoskovitz et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2007; Wisse et al., 2012) , however, inconsistencies in terms of labels used, extent of labels and label boundaries make it difficult to compare findings across research groups (Yushkevich, Amaral, et al., 2015) . Although manual delineation allows for a great deal of precision, it can also be time-consuming and reliant upon expertise, which is especially troublesome in large datasets that are now frequently analysed such as Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\nSeveral automatic or semi-automatic techniques have been developed for application to either a T1-weighted MRI scan, or a T1-weighted plus a high resolution T2-weighted scan (Leemput et al., 2009; Mri et al., 2010; Yushkevich, Pluta, et al., 2015) , relying on image intensities and probabilistic atlas for segmentation. Most recently, a pipeline released as part of the FreeSurfer package (v6.0) (Iglesias et al., 2015) and is compatible with Freesurfer v5.3 (developmental version available at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Hippocampal Subfields), offers the possibility of automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions, utilising a probabilistic atlas that has been built from manual segmentation of in vivo and ultra-high resolution ex vivo data.\nThis method is recommended for use with a T1-weighted and highresolution T2-weighted MRI scan, but can also be applied to a standard T1-weighted scan alone. This method utilises an atlas that closely matches the regions defined during histological investigations, and reportedly improves classification accuracy of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients by a notable 5.9%, compared to whole hippocampus measures (Iglesias et al., 2015) . While clearly promising, the reliability of these novel measures is yet to be established.\nA popular measure of test-retest reliability is the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979 ) that can be used to assess how consistent data are between sessions or participants. Whilst others have applied reliability metrics to the FreeSurfer segmentation and parcellation previously (Liem et al., 2015; Morey et al., 2010) , Whelan and colleagues have more recently shown that using the new automated segmentation method, 12 hippocampal subregions are reliable across two sessions in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-2) dataset (Whelan et al., 2016) . However, this study has focused on cross-sectional segmentation and the reliability of these measures has not yet been assessed for data segmented using the popular longitudinal method (Reuter, Schmansky, Rosas, & Fischl, 2012) . Here we address this gap in the literature and provide the first assessment of the test-retest reliability of automated hippocampal subregion volumes using both the cross-sectional and longitudinal processing approaches in two independent datasets consisting of healthy control participants and AD patients. Furthermore, we use data that has been acquired over three scanning sessions rather than two. The inclusion of an AD sample where there is likely to be greater within subject and between subject variation; as the segmentation of hippocampal subregions may be particularly relevant to research in this population. We have also included metrics for percentage volume difference and percentage volume overlap; the latter is particularly interesting as it provides some information about the variation in shape of the segmented regions. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of hippocampal subregion volume to detect longitudinal change using a linear mixed effects model (Verbeke, 1997) . The primary aim of the study was to provide metrics on the betweensession reliability of automated hippocampal subregion segmentation on standard T1-weighted MRI data using ICC, percentage volume difference and percentage volume overlap (Dice)."}, {"section_title": "| M ET HOD S A N D M A TE R IA L S", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Healthy control cohort", "text": "Twenty-four healthy right-handed older adults aged 50-73 were recruited (M 5 13, F 5 11).

Participants were scanned at intervals from 2 weeks to 2 years. For the reliability analyses, the data used included the first scans of the baseline, 2 week and 6 week follow-ups, whereas linear mixed-effects modelling also included data acquired at the 12 months, 18 months and 24 months follow-ups.

These well-validated and fully automated procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (Fischl et al., 2002) . In brief, T1-weighted scans undergo an affine registration to MNI305 space and skull stripping. This is followed by labeling of volumetric structures based on normalised intensity and neighbour constraints. The subcortical volume segmentation procedure is completed with a high dimensional nonlinear volumetric alignment to the MNI305 atlas.

Longitudinal processing was carried out using FreeSurfer v5.3.0 (Reuter et al., 2012) . First, a within-subject template was created for each subject using a robust, inverse consistent, registration, containing common information from each timepoint. Each timepoint was then initialised to this withinsubject template, which includes normalisation (affine registration to the within-subject template) and non-linear atlas registration (same parameters applied to data from all timepoints) and then segmentation using an intensity based probabilistic voting scheme, which is driven by all timepoints initial cross-sectional segmentation thus improving reliability and statistical power. This method (hereafter referred to as 'Long') avoids processing bias by treating each timepoint in the same way, independent of order.

With the inclusion of two timepoints, all regions with the exception of the fissure and left HATA achieve ICC scores of > 0.9 in the HC sample, whilst all regions achieve ICC scores > 0.9 in the AD sample.

"}, {"section_title": "| D I SCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we have assessed the test-retest reliability of automated hippocampal subregion segmentation of standard, ADNI-compatible; T1-weighted MRI scans. The results from this study show that almost all hippocampal subregion segmentations achieve high ICC scores (ICC > 0.85), after longitudinal processing compared to just over half after cross-sectional processing. To our knowledge this is the first study to assess the test-retest reliability using ICC of automated hippocampal subregion segmentation applied to cross-sectional and longitudinal data using Freesurfer's pipeline, in two independent datasets consisting of three separate timepoints, spanning 4 weeks in healthy controls and 6 weeks in AD patients.\nOur results show that almost all regions are highly stable, whilst the fissure is the least stable in healthy control participants. These should be noted that while the volumes measured appear to be highly reliable, the overlap measures were less consistent across the regions.\nIn healthy controls, the longitudinal pipeline provides overlap scores in many regions that approach that seen for the whole hippocampus but importantly the cross-sectional segmentation provides poorer levels of overlap. Unsurprisingly, for data acquired over a 6-week period, in the AD patients regional overlap is poorer across sessions although perhaps surprisingly ICC scores remain high. Together, these findings suggest that there are additional factors that need to be addressed. Some of these issues could arise as a consequence of partial volume effects, one could address these issues by using <1 mm voxels (Ekstrom et al., 2009 ) and/or including an additional T2-weighted or Proton Density volume in the processing stream (Iglesias et al., 2015) . The results presented here reflect test-retest reliability of measures estimated from a T1-weighted scan, however it is important to emphasise that the algorithm has not yet been validated against manual segmentations and in the present study we have not assessed the accuracy of segmented regions. In future studies, a comparison will need to be made between automated and manual segmentation. Manual segmentation of hippocampal subregions itself is a vast area of research (Adler et al., 2014; Kulaga-Yoskovitz et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2007; Wisse et al., 2012) , where there is great variation in the size, shape and position of labels used (Yushkevich, Amaral, et al., 2015) making it difficult to compare automated measures with existing manual delineations.\nYuskevich and colleagues have identified major areas of disagreement and taken steps towards a universally agreed method of labelling the hippocampal formation. As a result of this ambiguity, any inferences drawn from our findings are likely applicable only to datasets acquired with the same image parameters, processing pipeline and anatomical atlas as described in the methods section of this article.\nThis study offers several additional and informative results over the previously published reliability work of (Whelan et al., 2016) , with the inclusion of volume overlap and volume difference metrics along with a longitudinal model of volume change in AD compared to HC.\nFurthermore, the ICC scores reported here reflect test-retest reliability of data collected across three timepoints on separate days as well as healthy controls, such ICC differences are small when using one additional scan for the longitudinal pipeline, it should be noted that the confidence intervals on those estimates tended to be smaller. For the cross-sectional pipeline, the ICC values differed more for two timpoint and 3 timepoint ICC calculations, but not systematically. The confidence intervals for the data processed with the cross pipeline also tended towards being tighter when the ICC was calculated over 3 data-points.\nFinally, a similar pattern was also evident within the AD sample.\nWhile overall, we found that the difference between using two or three timepoints to be modest, there is a growing trend in trials to use longitudinal designs, rather than simple cross-over protocols, and a general growth in large-scale prospective imaging studies. Consequently, reliability estimates over more than two scanning sessions should results in greater confidence in stability of the data and our estimates of that estimate. Due to the small sample sizes included in the present study, we suggest that it would be beneficial in future to assess these reliability metrics in a larger sample with three or more timepoints to validate our findings.\nMethods specifically developed for the processing of longitudinal structural MRI have been applied to the data in this study (Reuter et al., 2012) , differing from the approach used by Whelan and colleagues (Whelan et al., 2016) . Longitudinal data analysis is often limited by random variation in the data that is due to anatomical variations, acquisi- show test-retest reliability scores comparable to those achieved with only two-sessions (Whelan et al., 2016) and when data was acquired on the same day (Liem et al., 2015) demonstrating the ability of this method to deal with random variation without compromising reliability.\nFinally, the inclusion of an AD sample in this study offers added information on the applications of these methods in samples that are likely to have pathology of the hippocampus leading to greater between and within subject variability. This atrophy is also likely to challenge the anatomical priors of an atlas that has been built on a healthy control sample. The results reported here show that even in an AD sample the measures are stable across time, which further emphasises the need to validate these measures against manual delineation.\nResults from our linear mixed effects model show that in AD there is significantly greater atrophy over a two year period in hippocampal subregions that have previously been identified by manual delineation and histological examination, such as CA1 and whole hippocampus Simic, Kostovic, Winblad, & Bogdanovic, 1997; Wisse et al., 2014) . We also find greater volume loss in the molecular layer, previously associated with MCI subjects (Iglesias et al., 2015) , CA3, hippocampal tail, presubiculum and HATA and a trend towards volume loss in the subiculum, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and CA4. Whilst our findings generally support those published previously (Iglesias et al., 2016) we find more modest results that do not fully replicate findings using the same technique and this is likely to be due to variation in processing methods and software. Ultimately, our results indicate that firstly, the hippocampal subregion segmentation produces volume estimate which are stable over a short period, but this method is also sensitive to biologically plausible rates of volume change over time in a region specific manner (CA1), which accords with previously published literature. However, we must interpret these results with caution as it is possible that methodological issues are contributing to this effect. The hippocampus is a region that is sensitive to motion artefact and signal dropout and it is possible that the AD group is more susceptible to this; therefore, we cannot conclude that this is a true biological effect without further investigation.\nMeasuring the individual subregions of the hippocampus has typically been difficult due to the limited spatial resolution in human MRI, therefore neuroimaging studies have relied on measuring the hippocampus as one structure (Chupin et al., 2009; Kempton, 2011; Videbech & Ravnkilde, 1957; Erickson, Voss, Shaurya, Basak, & Szabo, 2011) , or manual tracing of subregions (Kulaga-Yoskovitz et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2007; Wisse et al., 2012) . Treating the hippocampus as one structure may mean that crucial information is missed, while manual tracing of the structure can be time consuming and subjective. Thus reliable, automated segmentation of the hippocampal subregions is advantageous and has many potential applications in psychiatry and neurology. The dentate gyrus is one of the few regions where neurogenesis is known to continue into adulthood in humans (Eriksson et al., 1998) and animal studies show that therapies such as exercise and drug treatment can actually promote neurogenesis (Ho, Hooker, Sahay, Holt, & Roffman, 2013; Malberg et al., 2000) and that this is in line with the time frame of therapeutic effect in humans (Duman, Heninger, & Nestler, 2017) . There is currently no definitive measure of neurogenesis in vivo in humans, but neuroimaging offers the possibility of bridging the gap, by using structural and functional indices as a proxy measure of neurogenesis. Vermetten et al. (2003) report a 4.6% increase in whole hippocampal volume in PTSD patients after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); this effect was seen over 36-48 weeks of drug treatment in a relatively small sample of twenty three patients. It would be of great interest if this effect could be definitively localised to the dentate gyrus.\nIn conclusion, we have presented test-retest reliability of automated hippocampal subregion measures in two independent longitudi- "}]
