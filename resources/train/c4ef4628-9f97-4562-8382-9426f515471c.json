[{"section_title": "Parent Involvement in Education and School Sector", "text": "What is it about Catholic schools that accounts for the higher performance of students on standardized tests? One conjecture is that there is something different about parents who send their child to Catholic school, and therefore something different about the students themselves that is associated with better preparation, ability and performance. It is true, by definition that parents who choose Catholic school for their child are engaging in one form of parent involvement: school choice. Evidence suggests that this form of involvement does make a difference in the academic performance of a child. But do these parents act measurably different in other ways also? If so, then the ways that they differ may shed light on one mechanism by which Catholic school students, on average, outperform public school students. There are many other ways parents might be involved. Implicit in some arguments about selection is the idea that parents who send their child to Catholic school are also more involved with their child in other ways than parents who send their child to public school.1 This paper examines whether this is in fact so, and if so whether it makes a difference in the performance of the student. Here I seek to answer two main questions. First, are parents who send their child to Catholic school involved in their child's education differently than parents who send their child to public school, and if so, what are those differences? Second, does parent 1There is also choice within the public sector, and according to this argument parents who exercise public sector choice may be involved in ways that are similar to Catholic school, or other private school choice. Because of data limitations this cannot be examined here involvement have the same affect on performance for public and Catholic school students? Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982), in their controversial study of Catholic schools, hypothesized that one factor that might account for differential performance of students in Catholic compared to public schools is the involvement of parents in the community which also includes the school. They suggested that the normative structure and disciplinary climate inherent in Catholic schools could, in part, be attributed to the greater degree of closure of the community made up of parent friendships. When parents know each other students in the school are likely to act differently, and these differences in behavior may be associated with differential performance. There is an growing body of research on parent involvement in the school to support the idea that parent involvement has a positive influence on a child's achievement (c.f. Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, and Fraleigh, 1987;I3aker and Stevenson, 1987;Fehrmann, Keith, and Reimers 1987;Epstein, 1991;Muller, 1993). Rumberger, Ghatak, Poulos, Ritter, and Dornbusch (1990) suggest that parent involvement reduces negative behavior such as dropping out of school, although they refer mainly to parenting style, which includes mostly activity outside the school. Muller (1991Muller ( , 1993 distinguishes between the context of involvement (in the home, community and school) and between motivation for involvement (instrumental and affective) to find that differences in involvement have different relationships with academic outcomes. In general, affective involvement in the home is most related to test score performance and to preparation for learning while instrumental involvement at school is most related to positive evaluations by teachers, independent of ability and test performance. In other words, not all forms of parent involvement appear to be associated with uniform consequences for the student. Even though research on parent involvement may have been, in part, motivated by the findings of Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982) and others about school climate and the differential impact on student learning, very little research has been done to systematically examine differences in parent involvement in Catholic schools compared with public schools."}, {"section_title": "Method Data", "text": "The database upon which this analysis will draw is the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). It is the first wave of a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of American youth. The data collection is sponsored by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. The sampling was carried out in two stages following a two-stage stratified probability design. The first stage resulted in the selection of 1,234 schools, of which 1035 participated in the regular sample, induding 802 public school and 233 private schools, of which 105 were Catholic, 68 other religious and 60 private schools with no religious affiliation. The second stage produced 26,435 randomly selected eighth grade students, 24,599 of whom participated. Thus, each school has, on average, almost 24 students in the sample. Students were asked to complete an interview questionnaire about their background, school work and activities, home life, attitudes and social relationships. In addition each student was administered a series of curriculum based cognitive tests prepared by Educational Testing Service to measure ability in reading, mathematics, science and social studies. Ninety-six percent (or 23, 697) of the 4 students interviewed completed the test battery. Parents of each student were asked to complete a questionnaire asking about family characteristics, involvement with the educational process, commitment of family resources to education and attitudes of the parents about the child's school and education. The completion rate for parent questionnaires is 92%, or 22,651 parents. A complete description of the data base may be found in NCES (1989). Native Americans will be excluded fiom the analysis. They account for only 1.3% of the weighted sample, thus are not a large enough group to comprise a separate racial category, yet exploratory analysis suggests that they are distinct from the other racial and ethnic groups and should not be included as part of any other subgroup. The exclusion of native Americans reduces the sample size to 24,300 students."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Parent Involvement", "text": "The central theme of the analysis has to do with the actions taken by parents and the ways they are involved with the education of their child. From this data base, which includes some 160 measures of parental involvement, ten have been selected for analysis here.2 The measures are briefly summarized in table A of the appendix. A detailed expository summary of each measure may be found in Muller and Kerbow (1993). They include five measures which originate in the home and vary primarily according to individual characteristics of the family including 1discussion with parents about current school experiences; and (2) discussion about high school program planning; (3) the frequency a parent checks homework; (4) the frequency a parent restricts television on weekdays; (5) the amount of after school 2They were selected after exploratory analysis suggested that they each represented a different aspect or dimension of nvolvement and that they had reasonably high face validity. 5 supervision provided for the child; and (6) whether the child is enrolled in extra music classes. Also, (7) parent ties to the social community of the child are measured by the number of parents of the child's friends who are known by the parent; and ties of parents to the school are evaluated by (8) the frequency of parental contact of the school; (9) the level of parent participation in a parentteacher organization; and (10) whether the parent volunteers at the school. The forms of involvement which demand an interaction with actors outside the family, especially other parents and the school are likely to be forms of involvement which are most subject to additional constraints and therefore may be less stable or reflective of individual characteristics of the family including values and priorities."}, {"section_title": "Background Measures, Mathematics Achievement Test Scores and Grades", "text": "Achievement test scores and grades are the two most common measures of academic outcomes. The NELS:88 data base includes four achievement tests, in reading, mathematics, science and social studies (history and government). The measure used here is the standardized mathematics test scores compiled by NCES. Students in NELS:88 were asked to report their grades \"from sixth grade up till now\" in four subject areas (English, mathematics, science and social studies). The measure used here is the student report of math grades. Since this measure has a historical and cumulative component because students were asked about their grades over almost a three year period it is conceivable that the student's grades affect their score on the achievement test administered for NELS:88. This could come about because a student may have been tracked according to grades given in the sixth or seventh grade, from which the student would then have been provided with more or less opportunity for learning material relevant to test performance. The background variables which are used throughout the analysis are derived directly from NCES variables. They include family income, parents' highest education, sex of student, family structure (single mother, stepparent, or intact family), race and ethnicity, and urbanicity. Parent reported educational expectations of the child are also included in analyses presented here since they are associated with both involvement and school choice."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Level of Parent's Involvement", "text": "The first question of interest is whether parents in Catholic schools differ from public school parents with respect to forms of involvement other than school choice. Table 1 shows the regression coefficients for the dummy variable for Catholic school from a regression of student background characteristics, parents' educational expectations for the child and school sector on each of ten forms of parent involvement. This allows us to examine the difference in level of involvement between parents whose child attends Catholic compared with public school when other iMportant background characteristics like family income, parents' highest education and race are held constant.3  volunteer, participate much more in the parent teacher organization, and know more parents of their child's friends when compared to parents with similar characteristics who send their child to public school. The ways Catholic school parents do not differ from public school parents also follows a clear pattern. They tend not to engage in forms of involvement that are home-based at higher rates. Public and Catholic school parents show no difference in frequency of talking with their child about current school experiences which is possibly the best measure of the history of the parent child relationship and of the early learning environment of the child. Parents also do not differ in the amount they restrict television, enroll their child in music class, and supervise them after school. Restriction of television and after school supervision are probably also related to the extent to which parents are positioned to regulate and structure their child's out-of-school environment for learning. Thus, both on measures of an everyday verbal relationship, and on regulation in the home environment there is no measurable difference. It may be quite significant that the Catholic school students do not differ appreciably from public school parents on so many of these home-based measures. It is likely that these home-based measures are indicative of aspects of the child's home environment from an early age. Involvement in the home is less likely to be constrained by outside forces than forms of involvement that are external to the home. For instance, parents who talk with their child about current school activities probably have an ongoing verbal relationship with their child that indudes talking about school. On the other hand, parents' involvement outside the home, say knowing other parents, is likely to be limited by the availability of other parents for acquaintance. Likewise, involvement in the school may also be related to the extent to which the school encourages (or in some cases possibly requires) involvement. As we shall see in the next section, homework checking is probably an intervention activity of parents in response to poor grades. It may be that parents of children in Catholic schools respond differently to poor grades, or that Catholic schools expect (and encourage) parents to respond differently to poor grades. Possibly, in some fashion, Catholic schools manage the question of the adequacy of the child's homework differently than public schools. Where public schools may view it as the parents' responsibility that homework be completed properly, Catholic schools may view ensuring proper completion as part of the task of the school. Taken together, these findings suggest that the spheres of educational activity for the child may be more merged between the school and family for Catholic school students and their families compared with public school students. It appears that families of Catholic school students may be more integrated into school life and the community of other parents than public school students and families. In addition, the distribution of responsibility for educating the child may be viewed differently in public and Catholic schools, with the expectations of parent activity different depending on sector."}, {"section_title": "Involvement and Achievement Test Performance", "text": "We have seen that there are differences in the ways parents get involved depending upon the sector of their child's school. They differ least in home-based forms of involvement. An important, but unanswered question, then, is if the associations between performance and involvement are the same for public and Catholic school students. Does parent involvement make the same kind of difference in test score performance among Catholic and public school students? It is to this question that we now turn. Involvement might be associated with achievement test performance differently depending on school sector for several reasons. For instance, some forms of involvemeat have more to do with preparation while others have to do with managing or with supporting the child's current educational environment. Each form of involvement could potentially have different associations with performance depending on school context because of the additional relationships between school characteristics and performance. One argument made about Catholic schools, for example, is that they teach students differently and that students who might be at risk in public school would perform better in Catholic school. Table 2 shows results from regressions of background and parent involvement on math achievement test scores for public and Catholic school students separately. I have included math grades in each model since grades influence opportunity to learn, which in turn influences test scores. I have also included parents' educational expectations for their child, since expectations make a difference in involvement, in test scores and in choice of school. While the amount of variation explained in the two models is essentially the same (about 35% in both cases), the variables that predict test scores gre different depending on sector. Among both Catholic and public school students, talking with parents about current school experiences is strongly associated with math test performance. In fact, as a predictor of test scores, talking about current school experiences is about as good a predictor as parents' highest education for public school students, and is 10 more powerful for Catholic school students. Enrollment in extra music classes is also highly associated with math test scores for both groups of students, however the relative association is slightly higher among Catholic school students. Enrollment in outside music classes probably represents an array of factors associated with learning. First, there is the parents' willingness to invest in outside classes (both financially and with time). Also, music class involves practice outside of class, representing additional structuring of the child's out-of-school time. Interestingly, there is also a positive association between test scores and three forms of parent involvement that may have to do with the extent to which parents are in a position to regulate the child's activities among public school students, but not among Catholic school students. The amount parents restrict television on weekdays, the amount their child is supervised by an adult after school, and the number of friends parents known are all good predictors of math test scores for public school students, but make no difference for Catholic school student. Possibly explanation for this is that Catholic schools impose more regulation on the lives of all students than public schools, and in so doing remove any association between the activity and performance for any individual child-parent relationship. It is interesting to note that the association between family background variables and test scores relative to the association between math grades and math test scores are larger for public school students. The same may be said about parents' educational expectations for their child. In other words, Catholic school students are more likely to have grades consistent with their tests score than students in public schools, who have test scores that are associated with factors related to family background and characteristics of the parents. Both Catholic and public school parents are more likely to check homework and contact the school at higher rates if their child's test scores are lower. Each of these activities is probably an attempt on the part of parents to intervene in a negative situation. The relative magnitude of the coefficient is greater for Catholic school parents, suggesting that they may respond even more to negative test score performance than public school parents. This might be because they are more likely to intervenr,,, or it could have to do with the higher association between grades and test scores in Catholic schools. When there is more consistency between the two, parents are more likely to get more consistent danger signals about a problem, which could prompt action. In summary, the relationships between parent involvement and math test performance are somewhat different depending on whether the child attends public or Catholic schooi. In both sectors, a strong verbal relationship is strongly associated with a child's test scores. To a lesser extent enrollment in extra music class also makes a difference in both sectors. Beyond that, when parents are in a position to regulate a child's environment, especially outside of school, as measured by television restriction, after school supervision and parent acquaintance networks, it makes a difference in pubiic school student test scores but not those of Catholic school students. It is interesting that the elevated levels of school involvement among Catholic school parents do not translate directly into higher test performance for their child. It is impossible to tell from these analyses what the sources of the observe differences in school-based involvement are. It may be that parents who send their child to Catholic school are already selected according to their level of involvement, since choice is a form of involvement. If this were the case one would expect that these parents would be uniformly more involved, which they do not appear to be. One might argue that these parents have a different style of parenting, perhaps emphasizing regulation more than a verbal relationship. If this were so, however, again one would expect to find that Catholic school parents would have higher levels of involvement associated with restrictive behavior. It seems most plausible that Catholic school parents differ most from public school parents in the degree to which they make the school a part of their involvement. The direction of causality is impossible to determine. It may be that they have a propensity to reach out to the school more, and that is why they choose Catholic school, or it may be that there is something about the school which encourages parents to reach out. Differences in levels of involvement in the school may also be related to the schools themselves. That Catholic school parents are so much more involved in school and community suggests that Catholic schools may encourage or even 13 require mote involvement of parents. This argument seems particularly persuasive about volunteering because of the extraordinary differences in rates of volunteering. Remember, however, that the eleva ted levels of involvement make no difference in the test scores of individual students in Catholic school. And only parent acquaintance networks make a difference in the performance of public school students."}, {"section_title": "The School Context of Involvement and Math Test Performance", "text": "Levels of parent involvement in the school may also make a difference in the climate of the school itself. It is partly along these lines that Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore hypothesized that Catholic schools differ from public schools. They suggest that parents whose children attend Catholic schools are more likely to know one another, creating a normative environment for the students and a climate more conducive to academic learning, which in turn influences performance. It is not possible with these data to assess whether a difference in environment causes higher performance. It is, however, possible to examine some of the schools in the sample to evaluate whether there are differences in average levels of involvement, and if those forms of involvement are associated with performance. Table 3 shows distributions for the three school averages of forms of involvement external to the family that are positively related to test performance. Not surprisingly, Catholic schools have higher average levels of involvement, however there is substantial variation even among them.4 4Each variable only includes schools with responses from ten or more students (or parents) in any given school to eliminate instability of estimates due to very small n.  Table 4 shows the regression coefficients for each of these forms of involvement when regressed on math test scores.5 Previous research has shown that involvement is related to parents' level of education (c.f. Baker and Stevenson, 1986;Lareau, 1989;Muller, 1991). Moreover, there is preliminary evidence that involvement may be clustered in certain schools, possibly related to the characteristics either of parents or the school. For this reason I include as a control This suggests that there may be something about the school climate which is associated with parents knowing one another and working with the school which makes a difference in the performance of all students in Catholic schools but not in public schools. The association between average level of parents' education and performance of all students is well known (e.g. Coleman et al., 1966). Apparently, however, for Catholic school students there is additional benefit of parents involvement in the school regardless of the participation of an individual student's parents. How this benefit works, that is the mechanism, remains only source of speculation. It may be that it is a form of normative control and regulation in Catholic schools. In public schools a similar need of the child might be provided by the individual child's parents in the form of restrictive activity at home, possibly measured here by television restriction, after school supervision, and parent acquaintance networks. This could explain the relationship of those restrictive activities to performance among public school students but not Catholic school students. Yet it seems unlikely that the climate is a direct 6The entire regression may be found in the appendix."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "substitution for parental regulation. Undoubtedly the process is considerably more complex."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "The questions this paper set out to answer were whether there are discernible differences in the involvement level of parents depending on the sector of school their child attends, and if any differences lound matter in the academic performance of the child. First, it appears that there are some differences in levels of involvement, but primarily in involvement that is external to the family, in parent acquaintance networks, PTO participation, and volunteering. There were few measured differences in the ways Catholic and public school parents interact within the home. Talking about high school program planning was one difference. It is not dear why this difference (which is small) exists, but it may be because parents of Catholic school students perceive more school options. Second, we found some differences between the relationship of involvement and p'erformance depending on sector, however there were similarities, as well. A strong verbal relationship between parents and child is important in each sector, and to a lesser extent so is enrollment in outside music classes. The main difference in the relationship between involvement and test scores was found in activities that are 15iiibably most clearly assodated with parents being in a position to regulate the child's activities outside of school, both through normative pressure, in the case of parent acquaintance networks, and more directly with after school supervision and regulation of television watching. If these out of school activities are restricted then there is a better chance that they will be conducive, or at least consistent with a positive environment for learning and completion of school work. These forms of involvement that probably measure parents a position to regulate the child's out of school activity make a difference for public school students, but not for Catholic school students. One explanation for 18 this difference is that there is something about Catholic schools that provides a structure, making this kind of activity less important for individual parents. It may also be that all Catholic school parents are doing something else which is unmeasured (aside from sending their child to Catholic school) whiet serves the same function. Recall, however, that only on parent acquaintance networks did Catholic school parents indicate significantly higher levels of these kinds of regulatory involvement. Finally, differences in the association between contextual variables (measuring something about the climate related to higher levels of parent participation) and performance were examined. When more parents know one another, the performance of all students in Catholic school is likely to improve. The same maybe said about PTO participation in Catholic school. Neither of these is true for public schools. In public schools the only contextual variable that is related to math test scores is the average level of parents' education. Thus, even in public schools in which there are high levels of parent participation there is no increase in performance of all students on math scores which is attributable to those higher levels of parent participation independent of the average level of parents' education. These findings suggest that there may be some measurable differences in the climate of public school compared with Catholic schools and in the association of climate with performance. Much of the difference appears to be related to the ways that parents interact with their children outside of the home, in the context of the school and community. Coleman et al. (1982) have suggested that these differences may also be associated with the way the child's environment is structured, which may also have a positive relationship with test score performance, although that relationship has not been examined empirically here.
