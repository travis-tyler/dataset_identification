[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The co-development of technology and engineering with military technology is historically well established. Indeed, many early mechanisms were designed for waging battle, and countless engineers throughout history have worked for military institutions. Likewise, many of the first institutions of higher education to offer degrees in science or engineering have military origins. We review some of the history of engineering to substantiate this account. We show that research and development in engineering continues to be closely related to the military and defense sectors. Using two fundamental measures -federal employment statistics and federal research obligations -we demonstrate that amongst all professions, engineering has a much higher than average proportion of disciplinary activity devoted to defense-related endeavors. For example, as derived from data provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Department of Defense, about 3% of US workforce effort is devoted toward producing defense-related goods and services, compared with 9% for engineers, and higher in some specialized engineering fields (e.g., over 20% for aerospace engineering). As will be demonstrated, these fractions of overall disciplinary effort can be construed to underestimate the actual numbers of engineers who work on defense-related projects. With respect to research efforts, based on data from the National Science Foundation, about 50% of federally supported research in engineering is defense-related, far higher than for most other disciplines. A variety of ethical questions surround the engineer's participation in military or defenserelated work. But despite this, and despite the historically strong and persisting association between engineering and the military, surprisingly little attention is paid to questions of military, defense, or weapons research and development in engineering ethics literature. We surveyed several engineering ethics textbooks and found that less than half provide any direct attention to these issues, and fewer do so systematically. Similarly, our survey of two primary online sources, Online Ethics and the Engineering Case Library, shows that very few published cases cover these issues. As part of their ethics education, engineering students must become aware of likelihood to encounter ethical questions in their work, and educators have a responsibility to help Page 13.725.2 students develop this awareness. We argue that questions arising from military, defense, or weapons technology, research, or development are crucial for engineering students and educators to consider, not only because such work intrinsically raises serious moral questions, but also because our analysis of employment data and research funding suggests that the probability is significant that engineers will encounter such questions. Finally, careful consideration of the relationships between engineering and military or defense endeavors is essential to the engagement of engineers in the enterprises of global peace building, sustainable development, and humanitarian service."}, {"section_title": "Brief History of the Relationship Between Engineering and the Military", "text": "Historically, technology and the related disciplines of science and engineering have evolved in tandem with military endeavors (although our general focus is on engineering as distinct from science, the distinctions between engineering and science are less sharp during earlier periods in history). Many, if not most, technological developments have been developed in tandem with or as a result of military requirements and objectives. Work of even the earliest engineers and scientists, such as the work of Archimedes to improve the catapult (c. 250 BC), have been directed toward serving military purposes. Accounts by many historians of engineering underscore the nearly inseparable links between engineering and the military, particularly during the era (c. 17 th Century) when engineering emerged as a profession in the sense defined by Davis 9 . So identified was engineering with military projects that, according to Hacker 15 , \"the very term 'civil engineer' appeared in the 18 th century to name a new kind of practitioner: one who engineered something besides fortifications or weapons\". Similar accounts of the birth of civil engineering are given in Davis 9 and Vesilind 46 . Yet, ironically, despite the emergence of the apparently separate field of civil engineering new complicities between military and civilian projects evolved. For example, from the earliest stage, Hacker 15 notes that \"roads, bridges, railways, and other state-sponsored civil projects may themselves betray more than a trace of military motive\". The issue of dual-use technology remains perhaps more than ever at the crux of many questions surrounding the appropriate use of technology and engineering ethics. Not surprisingly, engineering education, particularly in France and the United States, has its roots in military academies. The first institution of higher education in the United States to grant a degree in engineering was the United States Military Academy at West Point (Davis 9 ; Hacker 15 ). Streett 34 describes in detail how the military culture of regimentation has infused engineering education through the 20 th century. Despite the strong historical connections between engineering and the military, the period after World War II ushered in a new era in which military support for engineeringparticularly through organized, funded research & development -became dominant and institutionalized. Seely 32 describes the nearly singular support of the Department of Defense in funding basic research during the 1950s. Even the National Science Foundation was founded largely on the basis to support militarily-relevant research, as envisioned by its leading proponent Vannevar Bush 6 : \"There must be more -and more Page 13.725.3 adequate -military research in peacetime. \u2026 This can best be done through a civiliancontrolled organization with close liaison with the Army and Navy \u2026\". These relationships are evidenced by funding data. Mitcham 25 reports that between 1950 and 1985, 65%-70% of federal R&D funds were channeled through DOD, compared with only 1%-3% through NSF. Based on data published by AAAS 19 , for the period 1986-2006, US defense R&D accounted for approximately 57% of all federal R&D expenditures (in 2006, the fraction was approximately 58%). In addition to research, a many engineers are employed in military and defense-related work. As quoted in Shinn 33 , Brown 5 observed that during the 1970s, \"perhaps 40% of the world's total pool of highly qualified research people are dedicating their research skills to military projects\". And according to emeritus science professor Robert Rutman in a documentary produced by the Center for Defense Information 8 , \"two-thirds of the scientists and engineers in the United States work for defense contractors or on defense contracts in institutions and universities\"."}, {"section_title": "Recent Data Indicating the Relationship between Engineering and the Military", "text": "We present further data to shed light on the relationship between engineering and the military.  [37] 299,398 100.0 Degree-aged (2006 est.) [37] 212,354 70.9 College Degreed Individuals (2003) [39] 40,621 13.6 US Workforce* (2006 est.)

We defined \"Degree-Aged\" as those aged 21 and over. Normalizations are manually calculated. *Excludes self-employed.  36 , whereas the \"Equivalent FTE Employed in Defense\" is provided by the Department of Defense (DOD) Projected Defense Purchases (DEPPS) 38 . The \"Defense Share\" is manually calculated as the percentage of the occupational total comprised by equivalent defense employment. Although the BLS and DOD data are derived by different methods, we compare these data because entirely self-consistent data appears to be unavailable. Some consistency exists in that each data source is based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system for defining employment by occupation. However, the SOC designations are somewhat crude because a given company is classified as belonging to a single industry based on its primary sales. It is important to understand the meaning of \"equivalent FTE employed in defense\" that is provided by DOD 38 . DOD does not attempt to directly count workers. Rather, a survey of purchases by the DOD is conducted, and from this data the equivalent full time employment necessary to deliver those goods and services is estimated by employment category. These estimates include total employment efforts required to deliver both direct (e.g., the purchase of ammunition) and indirect (e.g., the purchase of paint) defense-related goods and services. However, these estimates do not include defenserelated purchases by agencies other that DOD, such as DOE or NASA; whether or not the data reflects effort related to defense sales to foreign governments is unclear. Further muddying the data is the fact that some of the engineering effort reflected in the DOD data is provided by engineers in foreign countries under contract with US companies. With these caveats in mind, our complied data indicates that about 8.8% of professional engineering effort is devoted to defense-related activities -about 3 times higher than for the overall workforce defense effort (2.8%). Some specializations, such as aerospace engineering and electrical engineering, are especially tied to defense-related activities. Somewhat greater estimates are reported by Thomson 35 and Meade & Lile 23 in the late 1990's, and our perusal of BLS and DOD data from this era corroborates these findings. Finally, we note that because federal definitions do not identify computer and software engineers as \"engineers\", they are excluded from Table 2. About 5.8% of workforce effort in these fields is defense-related 36 . Page 13.725.5 At first glance, our calculation that 8.8% defense-share of engineering workforce effort appears to sharply contradict the previously cited estimates by Brown 5 and Rutman 8 that upwards of 40% of engineers work in defense-related industries. On further reflection, however, these data can be plausibly reconciled with our calculations. Because our calculations rely on DOD data of equivalent full time effort, it is quite possible that if the overall disciplinary effort is 8.8%, in reality, a much higher percentage of engineers are likely to be engaged in significant defense-related work as part of their employment. From Table 2 we can also extract complementary employment effort data to indicate the share of defense productivity contributed by engineers compared with other disciplines. Approximately 3.4% (126.4/3724.0) of the total defense workforce effort is contributed by engineers. For comparison, engineers comprise only about 1.1% (1436.9/132604.9) of the national workforce. This suggests that the defense workforce is more reliant on technically trained engineers than workers in other fields. Research Expenditures. We next consider research expenditures. Data for federal research obligations, broken down by both agency and discipline, is available from the National Science Foundation 40 . Table 3 provides projections of research obligations for FY 2007 for all designated research fields (as federally defined) and selected agencies. To illuminate the relative sources of funding within each discipline by agency, we normalize research obligations by field in Table 4. The last row of Table 4 indicates the portion of each agencies research obligations that are categorized as engineering.   4 reveals that the field of research with the highest proportion of funding derived directly from the Department of Defense (DOD) is Engineering (38.4%), followed by research in Math and Computer Science (32.0%). Feldman 11 reported somewhat higher percentages in late 1980's for several sub-disciplines of engineering and the physical sciences. Moreover, NSF reports that about 32% of research sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE) is defense-related 40 (a previous report 41 indicated 41%). A significant portion of the NASA research budget is also defense-related 8,28 , but data specifying this appears not to be readily available. Assuming that 33% of research in DOE and NASA in each field is defense-related, about 51% of federally funded engineering research is defense related (and about 42% for Math and Computer Science). For clarity, observe that the data in Table 4 illustrates that research obligations channeled through Health & Human Services dwarfs those of the other agencies and accounts for more than 50% of the total federal research obligation. At first glance, this appears to contradict the evidence presented in the Introduction that nearly 60% or more of all federal R&D is defense-funded 19,25 . This apparent discrepancy is reconciled by realizing that the Table 4 tallies only research obligations; development is not included (readers familiar with federal R&D data will realize that the reported total obligation in Table 4, $55,089 million, is less than half of total federal R&D expenditures). We confirmed this understanding through a discussion with a statistician at NSF, and further learned that the federal government does not track \"development\" funding by agency and discipline 24 . Also note that the data in Tables 4-5 is limited to federally sponsored research, which accounts for only about 30% of all US research expenditures 29 . We discovered that little data is available that can indicate the portion of privately funded engineering research that is defense-related. As with the employment data, statistics that have been collected to measure research activities in private industry use a classification scheme that designates a single industry description to an entire company, and these descriptions do not include designations that would distinguish defense-related activities 24 . A recent NSF report sheds some light on the defense share of engineering research in the private sector. According to this report 42 , unlike research in most industrial sectors, research in the aerospace industry is primarily funded by the federal government. While this does not directly imply that engineering research in the aerospace sector is dominated by defense activities, this would be a reasonable conjecture given that defense-related employment dominates aerospace engineering more than any other category engineering [ Table 2]."}, {"section_title": "Relevance to Engineering Ethics", "text": "Ethical and moral questions surrounding military actions, development and deployment of weapons, and other defense-related activities have been debated for centuries. The basis of these questions revolves around the appropriate uses and threats of lethal force. These questions are relevant to engineering because engineers are fundamentally necessary for building the weapons of war. As Vesilind 46  Yet it appears that students are unaware of the connections between engineering and the military as they begin their education. In our experience, when discussed, students find ethical questions relating engineering and the military or defense applications to be intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking, but they less frequently perceive them to be relevant. This is unfortunate, for there is a reasonable chance that they will encounter these questions as they seek employment or graduate studies. Unger describe this situation as follows 43 : In another piece, Unger further remarks that a dilemma faced by engineers is that even when not readily apparent, an engineer's work might contribute to causes that he or she does not support 44 . This view was recently voiced by Manion & Kam 20 , who wrote \"one only needs to look at the history of the engineering profession to see how closely engineering schools and large corporations work together to tailor an engineering curriculum suited to the immediate needs of the military-industrial complex, and Riley 27 , quoting sociologist Robert Zussman, points out that \"because engineers are embedded in industry or the military, they typically serve the ends of profit-making, or defense, and it has not traditionally been considered a professional duty to question those ends\". Our data analysis of employment and research funding data substantiates many of these observations, and shows that the possibility of the engineer performing of military-related work is high. Therefore, we contend that related ethical questions and topics must be included in engineering ethics. However, from our own experience, ethical questions related to engineering and the military do not appear to be raised in most standard treatments of engineering ethics. This observation seems to correspond with the description of engineering ethics provided by Manion & Kam 20 , in which initial approaches to engineering ethics were narrowly defined and excluded larger questions of the role of the engineer in society: Prior to the 1980s, the primary focus for professional ethics tended to be 'internalist' in nature. The primary focus was with interpersonal behavior among professionals or between professionals and client. Relevant topics included codes of conduct, conflict of interest, questions of fair advertising, and improper competition. Since then, the scope of professional ethics has broadened to include responsibilities of individual practicing engineers to society, as well as the larger, social responsibilities of engineers. This broadened sense of professionalism and ethics implies broad responsibilities for professional engineers, such as ensuring the safety, health, and welfare of the public in the practice of their professional duties, protecting the environment, and, generally, guarding the interest or welfare of society in all aspects where engineering activity might have an effect. Although not everyone subscribes to such a broad definition of engineering responsibility, the literature is growing in this direction. We decided to quantify the presence of questions related to military or defense-related engineering in primary engineering ethics resources by surveying 17 engineering ethics texts that were locally available to us. We studied these texts for specific references to defense, military, weapons (and examples thereof, such as bombs and missiles), war, conflict, and other similar topics. We determined the degree to which any of these topics or issues were covered, particularly by documenting if any of these topics or issues were referenced in the index, constituted case studies or extended topics of discussion, or were prominently presented, such as by appearing in the table of contents. The results of our survey are summarized in Table 5. In agreement with our informal observations, we found a general absence of these issues in the standard literature. Even among texts that reflect the broader sense of professional and social responsibilities, several omit treating matters of military, defense, or weapons engineering directly. Specifically, of the 17 textbooks surveyed, only 7 include any substantive coverage of military or defense-related issues, and fewer place these questions prominently. Of the 6 Page 13.725.9 published since 2000, 3 cover such issues. While these issues are covered by several of our colleagues in their courses, general treatment is largely absent in the standard texts. As another measure of coverage of military and defense questions in engineering ethics literature, we surveyed online sources. At the Online Ethics website 26 , we examined 165 cases and essays under the heading \"Professional Practice\". Of these articles, 4 (2.4%) covered the topic, compared with 16 (9.7%) dealing with conflicts in the workplace related to reporting problems to management and 12 (7.3%) dealing with environmental issues. We also examined 297 cases and essays under the heading \"Responsible Research\". Of these articles, 1 (0.3%) dealt with military or defense issues. For Page 13.725.10 comparison, 43 (14.5%) dealt with issues in human subject research, and 39 (13.1%) dealt with authorship issues. We also examined Engineering Case Library 10 (ECL). Of the 261 cases contained in the ECL, only 15 (5.7%) were identified that contain at least one key word from the following set: {military, defense, weapon, war, army, navy, marine, missile, bomb, gun}. Of these 15 cases, only 6 dealt directly with some aspect of ethics related to performing military or defense engineering. Given the great influence that military and defense-related interests exert in engineering and engineering education, the data that we collected demonstrates that ethical questions related to military or defense-related engineering are insufficiently treated. While many individual instructors are addressing these questions in their courses, we recommend that they be more frequently and thoroughly treated in the standard texts and resources in engineering ethics education."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Discussion", "text": "We reviewed the strong institutional ties between the profession of engineering and the military, citing historical evidence and providing our own recently compiled evidence from employment and research funding data. Despite the fact that there are limitations in our data, we argued that there is a high probability that an engineer, whether in professional practice or research, will confront the possibility of conducting defenserelated work during the course of his or her career. To improve the quality of the evidence on which we base these conclusions, we intend to conduct further research by, for example, attempting to collect direct counts of engineers who are employed in defense-related activities. Such data might be available from the Survey of Industrial Research and Development, but this data is not readily available to the public 24 . Given the strong connections between engineering and the military, and the array of important and related ethical questions, it follows that ethical questions of military or defense-related work should be substantively treated in engineering ethics courses and textbooks. However, our review of several standard engineering ethics teaching resources illustrates that these questions are treated infrequently and insufficiently. We strongly advocate for more standard and general inclusion of these issues in engineering ethics teaching materials, and we otherwise urge engineering educators and other ethics educators to address issues of military and defense-related work in some meaningful way. We believe that one useful approach to augmenting the literature is to develop case studies and that articulate the experiences of engineers who have chosen or avoided military or defense-related work specifically for ethical or moral reasons. While many such accounts seem to be written about scientists (particularly atomic scientists), relatively few seem to be available about engineers. Just as with the discussion of any ethical matter, students will hold varying perspectives and opinions regarding the role of the engineer in military and defense-related Page 13.725.11 engineering. Certainly the role of the educator is not to indoctrinate students with his or her own point of view, but it is paramount that the educator prepare his or her students to exercise their own ethical judgment by helping them to build awareness of situations -in this case the possibility of performing military or defense-related work -that they are reasonably likely to encounter. Moreover, echoing Riley's general point, it is imperative that engineers understand the broader contexts in which they work in order that they might actively choose how to direct their energies 27 . Indeed, in addition to their relevance to individual moral decisions, ethical questions must be dealt with at the level of the discipline. In his recent book Peace Engineering: When Personal Values and Engineering Careers Converge, Vesilind 46 argues that the evolution of a new type of engineering called \"Peace Engineering\" is emerging as more and more young engineers are seeking applications of engineering beyond the entanglement between military and civilian engineering applications. And engineering researchers and organizations are sponsoring conferences and activities oriented around humanitarianism, peace, and social justice. In particular, Catalano 7 recently articulated how a peace paradigm might be incorporated into the ABET criteria. An invigorated discussion of ethical issues in engineering relating to military and defense-related applications will greatly complement these movements and provide a body of knowledge that will help engineering students decide how to direct their efforts, particularly with respect to the enterprises of humanitarian service, sustainable development, and global peace building."}, {"section_title": "Bibliography", "text": ""}]
