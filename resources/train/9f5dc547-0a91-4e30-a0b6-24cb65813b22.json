[{"section_title": "", "text": "The NORC reports are based on self-reported data provided by graduate students upon completion of their doctorate. Every Graduate School in the United States requires their students to complete the doctoral survey prior to graduation. Students must identify their major area of emphasis, and there is a unique code for mathematics education (#874). However, there are also codes for Mathematics, Education, Curriculum and Instruction, Elementary Education, and Secondary Education. Some graduates who pursue the study of mathematics education report that they do not mark \"mathematics education\" as their major emphasis. Instead, they indicate the department within which the mathematics education program resides (e.g., Curriculum and Instruction). In other cases, a graduate may mark mathematics education because it is the primary focus of their dissertation although their program of study is in another area (e.g., Educational Psychology). Despite these issues, the data summarized in this report is based on graduates who coded \"mathematics education\" as their major area of emphasis on the NORC survey. A special request was made to NORC for a summary of the production of doctorates in mathematics education from 1960 (the earliest data available) to 2005 (most recent data available). Since 1960, 167 different institutions have produced doctoral graduates with mathematics education as their designated major area of emphasis. Figure 1 summarizes the number of institutions graduating doctorates in mathematics education over the past 45 years.  , 1960-2005 Surveys of Earned Doctorates.) Figure 2 reports the number of graduates listing mathematics education as their emphasis area by decade. The era with the largest production was the 1970s (1095 students). While many reasons may account for this significant bump in graduates during the 1970s, it is likely that the NSF institutes (both summer and year-long) played a significant role in encouraging more people to pursue doctorates in the sciences, including mathematics education. The data from the current decade span 6 years . Assuming the same rate of annual graduations for the entire decade, the results are shown in Figure 3. If the current production rate continues throughout this decade, Figure 3 shows the averages over the last two decades are stable. These data suggest that the 70's were the boom era for producing doctorates in mathematics education, and the degrees during this decade were awarded by 85 different institutions. Figures 1 & 2 show that although more institutions began to graduate doctorates in mathematics education after the 1980s, the number of graduates did not rise significantly. Using the average number of doctorates produced per institution for each decade and the projected figures for the current decade Figure 4 results. "}, {"section_title": "Decade", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Doctorates per institution", "text": "Mathematics has often been characterized as a male dominated domain. Indeed, an examination of the annual production of doctorates in mathematics provides evidence of the dominance of degrees awarded to males. Over the last decade the ratio of males to females receiving PhDs in mathematics is between 2 to 1 and 4 to 1. However a look at gender differences in doctorates in mathematics education provides a very different picture, and one that has changed dramatically over the years. Figure 5 reports the number of males and females receiving doctorates in mathematics education over a 45-year period. In the 1960s, the ratio of male to female doctorates graduating in mathematics education was 5 to 1, and in the 1970s about 3 to 1. The ratio of male to female has shrunk in recent years and currently is about 2 to 3, or two males graduating with a doctorate in mathematics education for every three females. Minorities are also greatly underrepresented in mathematics education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. While Figures 1-5 report NORC data from 1960, the collection of data on the ethnicity/racial background of mathematics education degree recipients (Asian, Hispanic, Black, and Native American) began in 1973. Figure 6 reports frequencies of Caucasian and underrepresented group degree recipients from 1973 to the present. In 1973, six graduates representing various minority populations and 78 Caucasian graduates received doctorates in mathematics education. While there has been a slow decline in the number of doctorates awarded to Caucasians since 1973, there has been a steady increase in total graduates from underrepresented groups with a peak of 17 in 1999. During the lean period of the 1980s, the Caucasian graduate levels fell sharply, while the minority graduate levels stayed relatively constant. 1 9 7 3 1 9 7 5 1 9 7 7 1 9 7 9 1 9 8 1 1 9 8 3 1 9 8 5 1 9 8 7 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 5"}, {"section_title": "Year", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Number of Doctorates", "text": "Caucasi an Mi nori ty Figure 6.

Figures 1-6 provide an overall summary of the number of doctorates awarded in mathematics education over the last 45 years. Next, let's look at the role different institutions have played during this time in producing doctorates in mathematics education. Figure 1 shows the number of institutions awarding doctorates in mathematics education grew from 70 in the 1960s to 115 in 2000s. These programs vary greatly in the number of graduates produced. An examination of the number of doctorates awarded over time by institutions is constantly changing. Table 1 shows the largest producers of doctorates during the last fifteen years and Table 2 reports institutions that have awarded the most doctorates in mathematics education from 1960 to 2005. Examining these tables reveals that seven of the institutions in Table 1 were not in Table 2, yet they are now the institutions awarding the largest number of doctorates in mathematics education. This is a reminder that programs are constantly evolving, and these changes impact their production of the number of doctorates in mathematics education awarded. While these changes impact many programs, an examination of the largest producers of each decade shown in Table 3 reveals stability in the top five producers over the 4.5 decades. Teachers College, Columbia University has consistently been the largest producer of doctorates in mathematics education since 1960. The top 5 overall producers also ranked among the top 20 for each decade. Three of the overall top 5 institutions (Teachers College, Ohio State University and Florida State University) were among the top 10 producers for each decade, with the other two institutions (University of Georgia and University of Texas) among the top 10 for all but one decade (1960's). Seven of the top 10 producers were among the top 20 for all 5 decades."}, {"section_title": "Production of Doctorates in Mathematics Education by Institutions", "text": "A total of thirty-nine institutions graduated doctorates in each of the five decades from 1960 to 2005. These institutions, along with the number of doctorates in mathematics education awarded, are shown in Table 3. While many institutions produce graduates, the majority of institutions produce only a few graduates each decade. On the other hand, Table 4 shows the five institutions that produced the most graduates from 1960-2005 contributed about a fourth of all graduates during this 45 year period. Furthermore, the top 30 producers contributed about threefourths of the doctorates in mathematics education over this time period. Table 4.

If there is any trend, it appears that the percentage of doctorates produced by the top producers may be decreasing slightly. If so, this is probably related to the increase in the number of different institutions offering a doctoral program in mathematics education in later decades. Table 5 provides a summary of each of the 167 institutions that NORC reported graduating at least one doctoral student with an emphasis in mathematics education. It reports the number of doctorates in mathematics education awarded each decade by institution. Among other things Table 5 shows that since 1960 only 24 institutions have averaged awarding one or more doctorates a year with an emphasis in mathematics education. increased over the past 45 years, the overwhelming majority of doctoral graduates in mathematics education are Caucasian with the ratio of Caucasian to minority graduates about 5 to 1 for the last decade."}]
