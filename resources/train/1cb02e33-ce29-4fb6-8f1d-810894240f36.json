These steps were defined in terms of a \"pipeline\" to college enrollment and include: aspirations for a bachelor's degree (step 1), academic preparation for college (step 2), taking entrance exams (step 3), applying to college (step 4), and enrolling in college (step 5). Students were considered at risk if they had one or more of the following characteristics: were from a single parent household, had an older sibling who dropped out of high school, changed schools two or more times other than the normal progression (e.g., from elementary to middle school), had C's or lower grades between sixth and eighth grade, were from a low SES family, or repeated an earlier grade.

The size of the blue-collar job sector has declined markedly over the last two decades.1 At the same time, there has been a parallel decline in entry-level wages, and the wage drop for high school graduates entering the labor force has been more than three times that of college graduates (in constant dollars).2 In the past, students who either dropped out of high school or entered the labor market immediately after high school graduation may have relied on getting relatively well paying entrylevel manufacturing jobs. However, now that the economy demands a more technologically sophisticated labor force, these youth may have limited opportunities for economic advancement unless they continue their education beyond high school. These changes may have especially adverse consequences on students who are characterized as \"at risk.\" These are students whose family background or early educational experiences place them at greater risk of dropping out of high school. For those who manage to graduate from high school, at-risk students are much less likely to pursue further education. For example, among 1988 eighth graders in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile, about one-third enrolled in some form of postsecondary education by 1994, compared to most (88 percent) of the students in the highest SES quartile.3\nThe second part of the analysis compares at-risk students who progressed through the college pipeline and enrolled in a four-year college with their at-risk peers who either enrolled in a subbaccalaureate degree institution, such as a community college, or who did not pursue further education (at least within two years) after high school. Comparisons are made in three areas: math course taking, school assistance in the applying to college, and activities and behaviors associated with school engagement."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Until recently, much of the research on \"at-risk\" populations has concentrated on identifying exactly who is at risk.4 That is, outside of ability, what are the factors that distinguish students who drop out or fail in school from those who do not?

For example, according to Mishel and Bernstein, the entry-level hourly wage for high school graduates in 1993 dollars declined from $8.82 in 1973 to $6.61 in 1993. College graduates' entry-level hourly wage declined from $12.55 to $11.67 for the same time period.

For example, a study conducted by Finn (1993) revealed that higher achieving at-risk students were more engaged in their school life from the very start of their education.5 These students were more likely to have attended kindergarten than their 'lower achieving peers, and later in their school life, exhibited stronger participatory behaviors both inside and outside the classroom. As eighth graders, these students attended class more often, came to school more prepared, did more homework, and participated in extracurricular activities at higher rates. More recently, Chen and Kaufman (1997) analyzed the influence of \"protective\" behaviors exhibited by successful at-risk students in high school.6 In their study \"success\" was defined as graduating from high school, and the protective behaviors were ones that lowered the odds of dropping out. These behaviors were defined within three domains: family, individual, and peer associations. A number of these variables significantly reduced the odds of dropping out of high school independent of SES and raceethnicity. The study reported on here builds on Chen and Kaufman's research by beginning with a \"resilient\" population of at-risk studentsthose who graduated from high schooland tracking their progress through the \"pipeline\" to college enrollment. The purpose is twofold: first, to determine junctures in the pipeline to college enrollment where at-risk students leave at substantially higher rates than their counterparts not at risk; and secOnd, to compare at-risk students with different postsecondary enrollment outcomes in order to identify factors that may contribute to their successful navigation of the pipeline to college enrollment. To set the context, the analysis first compares students who are at risk with those who are not. It is loosely modeled on the \"pipeline\" study developed by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which identifies various junctures in the pipeline to attaining a college degree in mathematics, science, or engineering.7 In the current study, the pipeline represents the path from high school to enrollment in a four-year college.8 The pipeline has five major junctures: having aspirations for a bachelor's degree, academic preparation for college, taking entrance exams, applying to college, and enrolling."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND DEFINITIONS", "text": "\nThis analysis, therefore, used the same definition of risk that was developed by Chen and Kaufman which controlled for racialethnic group differences. All of the risk factors were identified in 1988 (when students were in the eighth grade) with the exception of having older siblings who dropped out of high school, which was asked in 1990. In summary, students were considered at risk if they had one or more of the following characteristics: Lowest SES quartile; Single parent family; Older sibling dropped out of school; Changed schools two or more times; Average grades of C's or lower from sixth to eighth grade; and Repeated a grade. The analysis also distinguished students' level of risk by identifying those at low risk (one risk factor), moderate risk (two risk factors), and high risk (three or more risk factors)."}, {"section_title": "STUDY SAMPLE", "text": "The data used for this analysis are drawn from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88/94), a survey that began with eighth graders in 1988 and followed them every two years through 1994.

However, Chen and Kaufman identified five factors that increased the odds of dropping out of high school even after controlling for SES and race ethnicity.'\u00b0 These risk factors included being from a single parent household, having an older sibling who dropped out of high school, changing schools two or more times other than the normal progression (e.g., from elementary to middle school), having poorer than average grades, and repeating an earlier grade. While it is true that college enrollment rates vary according to racialethnic groups,\" there are a number of other factors including socioeconomic status that are associated with these trends. For example, Hauser (1992) reported that black students were more likely to attend college than whites once SES was taken into consideration.12 9P. Kaufman and D.

It begins with a student's desire to continue her or his schooling beyond high school and ends with matriculation in a four-year college. While the steps primarily concern the track to a four-year college, the postsecondary status of students who did not follow this path is also presented. Step 1: Aspirations Students' educational aspirations are highly correlated with their eventual attainment.13 Moreover, the differences in aspirations between students from low-SES backgrounds and their more advantaged peers are also well known.14 Among 1988 eighth graders, for example, less than half (42 percent) of low-SES students aspired to a bachelor's degree, compared with 64 per-13S.L.

For this analysis, students' tenth-grade aspirations signal the starting point of the pipeline to college. Tenth-grade aspirations were chosen over those reported either in the eighth grade or the twelfth grade because in tenth grade students probably have a better idea of what it takes to prepare for college than they do in eighth grade, and unlike twelfth graders, they still have time to take the classes required to enroll. Step 2: Academic Preparation Obviously, if students are not prepared academically for further education, it is highly unlikely that they will advance to higher education immediately after high school. To identify students who are academically prepared to enroll in college, this study draws upon recent research conducted by Berkner and Chavez (1997). Their study addressed the issue of college access and choice especially for low-income and racialethnic minority students.I6 In doing so, they developed an index that identifies whether or not students are \"qualified\" for admission to a four-year college. The index is a composite measure of academic qualification based on several criteria including rank in class, ACT/SAT scores, high school grades, and the 1992 NELS math and reading test composites. Minimal qualification was based on meeting at least one of the following criteria: ranked at the 54th percentile or higher in graduating class; a grade point average of at least 2.7 in academic courses; a combined SAT score of 820 or higher (or ACT score of 19 or higher); and a score at the 56th percentile or higher on the 1992 NELS math and reading composite test. Students who met or surpassed any one of these criteria were identified as being at least minimally prepared academically for college enrollment. If a student did not meet the minimal academic criteria, but had enrolled in a four-year college, the student was also classified as academically prepared (about 10 percent of enrollees).17"}, {"section_title": "Steps 3 and 4: Entrance Exams and College Application", "text": "One of the most crucial junctures in the transition from high school to college, especially for students who are at least minimally prepared academically, is making the necessary prepara-15lbid. 16L.

In addition, calculus is greatly encouraged and is also a prerequisite for math and science majors.21 To examine the math course taking of at-risk youth who enrolled in college with their counterparts who did not, this study used a course level index based on the NELS high school transcript data. University of Michigan researchers originally constructed the index to determine the highest sequence of math courses that students completed in high schoo1.22 The index is aggregated to four levels of course taking: low level (including no math, nonacademic or low-academic courses); middle level (at least two years including algebra "}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "DATA AND DEFINITIONS I and geometry); high level (completed algebra II); and advanced course taking (completed algebra III, calculus, trigonometry, analytic geometry, or other advanced courses).23"}, {"section_title": "School Assistance With the College Application Process", "text": "At-risk students are often the first generation in their family to attend college. For example, about one-third of students at risk had parents who completed no more than a high school education, compared with one in twelve of students not at risk.24 Thus, for a substantial proportion of at-risk students, there may be no one in their family who has had firsthand experience in applying to college. These students are more dependent on schools and teachers for obtaining information and getting help with the application process. To determine if there were differences in the way at-risk students with different postsecondary enrollment outcomes prepared for applying to college, comparisons were made in the rates at which students in different outcome groups reported taking a special course offered by the school to prepare for entrance exams, and receiving help from their school or teachers in filling out college applications.

The learning activities indicator was based on several items that asked students how important their friends thought the following activities were: attending classes, studying, getting good grades, finishing high school, and continuing their education after high school graduation.\nThe final set of engagement indicators concerns the extent to which students' friends were involved in school activities. Both peer engagement indicators are based on items reported by the students about their friends. The first indicates how important students thought their friends considered the following learning activities: attending classes, studying, getting good grades, finishing high school, and continuing education past high school. The second was the number of students' friends with plans to attend a four-year college. Among at-risk students who aspired to a bachelor's degree and were at least minimally prepared to enroll in a four-year college, there was no difference in the level of importance that friends attributed to learning activities relative to postsecondary enrollment outcomes. Roughly one-third of students reported that their friends considered these activities very important regardless of their enrollment status (table 13). The number of students' friends with plans to attend a four-year college, on the other hand, was strongly associated with enrollment outcomes. Students who enrolled in a four-year college were much more likely to report that all or most of their friends planned to attend (80 percent), compared with those who enrolled in other postsecondary education (60 percent) or those who never enrolled (49 percent)."}, {"section_title": "OVERVIEW OF STUDENTS AT RISK DISTRIBUTION OF RISK FACTORS", "text": "Among all 1992 high school graduates, more than half (58 percent) had at least one risk factor that increased their chances of dropping out of high school (table 1).

The same was not true of Hispanic students, however; their representation did not change appreciably among the three risk groups (11 to 14 percent). The proportion of Asian/Pacific Islander students and American Indian/Alaskan Native students was also similar at all three levels of risk. One reason for the relatively high proportion of black students among high-risk students relative to their Hispanic peers was their likelihood of being from a single parent family. Onequarter of students from single parent homes were black, compared with 9 percent of their counterparts who were Hispanic.

The postsecondary enrollment outcomes of students with each individual risk factor compared with those without the risk factor is also shown in table 5. For all six risk indicators, students with the risk factor were less likely to enroll in a four-year college and more likely not to enroll in postsecondary education.28 While these outcomes are consistent with earlier studies, the specific question for this analysis concerns students who had both college aspirations and were at least minimally prepared academically to attend. Specifically, if students at risk entered the four-year college pipeline and made the necessary preparations to go to college, were they still less likely than those not at risk to enroll in a four-year college? 28It is also true that students with each risk factor generally have more than one risk factor (see table 1). However, a linear regression model also found a significant negative effect on enrolling in a four-year college for each risk factor independent of all others (see appendix table Cl).

There is an implicit assumption that each step in the pipeline is essential for college enrollment. However, the analysis showed that there was an exception to this assumption. Five percent of high school graduates who enrolled in a four-year college did not have a bachelor's degree goal in the tenth grade, but completed the remaining four pipeline steps to enrollment.29 Presumably, these students changed their minds about pursuing a college education after they had reported their tenth-grade aspirations. However, there was no difference in risk status among students who followed this pattern: at-risk students were just as likely as those not at risk to do so. Virtually all other students who enrolled in a four-year college completed all five steps of the pipeline.30 Figure 1 and table 6 illustrate these students' sequential progress through the pipeline to college. The proportion of students at each step is based on those who successfully completed all the preceding steps. For example, the proportion in step 2 are students who had both a bachelor's degree goal in the tenth grade (step 1) and were at least minimally prepared academically to attend a four-year college (step 2); those in step 3 are students who had a bachelor's degree goal (step 1), were minimally prepared (step 2), and took college entrance exams (step 3); and so on. The first two steps of the pipeline are clearly the junctures where most at-risk students leave the pipeline relative to students not at risk. About 56 percent of at-risk students entered the pipeline by aspiring to a bachelor's degree in the tenth grade, compared with 81 percent of those not at risk. Similarly, the proportion of at-risk students who progressed from having a bachelor's degree goal to being at least minimally prepared academically to attend a four-year college (44 percent) was much lower than the proportion of students not at risk (75 percent). One might expect at-risk students who had a bachelor's degree goal and who had performed well enough in school to at least minimally prepare themselves academically to enroll in a four-year college, to progress through the rest of the pipeline at similar rates as students not at risk. However, this was not the case (figure 2). While the proportions who were lost in steps 3 to 5 were relatively small compared with those lost in step 1, at-risk students were much less likely 29NELS:88/94 Data Analysis System. \"There were a few instances where students who enrolled in a four-year college did not report taking entrance exams (0.5 percent); they were recoded as having done so (NELS:88/94 Data Analysis System). 19 33 PIPELINE TO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE than those who were not at risk to take step 3 (entrance exams) (9 percent did not take exams versus 3 percent); and if they took entrance exams, they were less likely to apply to college than those not at risk (13 percent did not apply versus 9 percent).

The italicized row is the comparison group for significance testing. The asterisks indicate instances where a percentage for a specific row is significantly different from the comparison group within the row category. For example, both before and after adjustment, the proportion of at-risk students enrolled in a four-year college was much higher for students who took at least one advanced math course than for at-risk students who took non-or lowacademic math courses (5 percent versus 68 percent, unadjusted; 31 percent versus 47 percent, adjusted). Once the other variables are controlled for, the magnitude of the difference between the group taking non-or low-academic math courses and the group taking an advanced course appears smaller, but still remained significant. In contrast, the differences between the other math groups (algebra I/geometry and algebra II) and the comparison group (no higher than lowacademic courses) were no longer significant after adjustment (28 to 31 percent). This result may be due to controlling for students' academic preparation. Those who are prepared are more likely to take higher level math courses. For example, as was shown in table 9, nearly all at-risk students who were at least minimally prepared academically to enroll in a four-year college and who aspired to a bachelor's degree had completed algebra I and geometry. Alternatively, for similar reasons, controlling for the educational expectations of students' parents may also account for this result. Those whose parents expect them to earn a bachelor's degree may be more likely to complete math courses through algebra II than students whose parents expect less education. For the other variables included in the model, the adjusted results differed very little from those found in the tabular analysis (which was limited to at-risk students with aspirations for a bachelor's degree and academically prepared to enroll in a four-year college).37 As was found in the tabular analysis, two engagement variables had no significant effect on the likelihood of enrolling in a four-year college: students' high school attendance level and parents' educational expectations. Once academic preparation and degree aspirations are controlled for, there is little variation for these indicators. Most students who are academically prepared have parents who expect them to attain a bachelor's degree (see table 12). Similarly, academic preparation is also associated with a higher attendance leve1.38 On the other hand, the other student engagement indicator (participating in two or more extracurricular activities compared to participating in none) remained significant with respect to increasing the likelihood of enrollment. 37Note that the unadjusted proportions in table 13 are those for all at-risk students, whereas in the tabular analysis, comparisons were made only for students who had a bachelor's degree goal and were academically prepared. This was done to control for the effect of these variables on college enrollment. In the regression model, however, educational aspirations and academic preparation are included as independent variables. 38For example, among academically prepared students, 17 percent had low attendance levels, compared with 25 percent of those not prepared; the opposite pattern was found for high attendance (NELS:88/94 Data Analysis System).

Note, if students enrolled in a 4-year college and did not meet any of these academic criteria (about 10 percent of those enrolled), they were also coded as academically prepared. A change of relationship was found affer adjustment for the peer engagement variable that indicates students' perception of the importance that friends attribute to learning activities. Having friends who placed high importance on learning activities actually had a small but significant negative effect on four-year college enrollment, compared to those whose friends placed low importance on learning activities. Before adjustment the relationship was strongly positive: 47 percent of students whose friends placed high importance on learning activities enrolled in a fouryear college, compared with 24 percent whose friends placed low importance on them.

To this end, students were identified according to postsecondary enrollment patterns that have been shown to reduce students' chances of completing a degree. These indicators include delaying postsecondary education by a year or more after high school graduation, beginning postsecondary education on a part-time basis, or not attending continuously from the time of enrollment (i.e., 31Note that once students were accepted, those at risk were as likely to enroll as those not at risk (about 91 percent).

Likewise, those with two risk factors (21 percent) were more likely than students with three or more risk factors (10 percent) to do the same. Large differences between students at lower risk and those at high risk appeared at steps 1 and 2 of the pipeline: educational aspirations and academic preparation.

This may be due to the policy that most four-year colleges require a certain level of participation in extracurricular activities as part of their admissions criteria, while sub-baccalaureate institutions generally have open admission policies. Alternatively, some extracurricular activities may be specifically tailored for students with intentions to enroll in a four-year college.

Note, if students enrolled in a 4-year college and did not meet any of these academic criteria (about 10 percent of those enrolled), they were also coded as academically prepared. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The primary focus of this study was to explore why some students with a family background or early educational experiences that increased their risk of dropping out of high school exhibited considerable resiliency by successfully navigating the pipeline leading to college enrollment. To set the context, comparisons were first made between high school graduates at risk and those not at risk according to the rates at which each group completed five steps leading to college enrollment. These steps included having aspirations in the tenth grade for completing a bachelor's degree, being academically prepared to enroll in college, taking college entrance exams, applying to one or more four-year institutions, and enrolling in a four-year college. The results indicated that 1992 high school graduates with risk factors associated with dropping out remained at risk with respect to gaining access to higher education. Specifically, students at risk were far less likely to have aspirations for a college degree, and if they did have college aspirations, were less likely to be academically prepared to enroll. While these results are consistent with those from earlier studies, this analysis also found that even at-risk students who navigated the educational system well enough to at least minimally prepare themselves for admission to a four-year college were less likely than their peers not at risk to take the subsequent steps necessary to enroll. That is, academically prepared at-risk students were less likely to take entrance exams, and if they took entrance exams, were less likely to apply to a four-year college. Thus, it appears that some at-risk students who were likely to be admitted, completed the fouryear college pipeline at lower rates than their counterparts not at risk (at least within two years of high school graduation). Furthermore, among students who enrolled in any postsecondary education, students at risk were less likely to exhibit strong indicators of persistence than their counterparts not at risk. This was true both for students who enrolled in a four-year college and for those who enrolled in a community college. Nevertheless, despite differences that do exist in postsecondary enrollment outcomes between students at risk and those not at risk, approximately one-third of 1992 high school graduates at risk enrolled in a four-year college, and an additional one-quarter enrolled in a public twoyear institution. Moreover, among those who enrolled, more than two-thirds exhibited strong indicators of persistence in postsecondary education. How these students differed from their at-risk 45 GO SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS counterparts who did not enroll in any postsecondary education by 1994 was next addressed in this report. The analysis also compared students who enrolled in a four-year college with those who enrolled in a subbaccalaureate institution. Comparisons were made in three areas: completion of math \"gatekeeping\" courses, the rate at which students reported receiving help from their school in the college application process, and last, the level of school involvement of students, their parents, and their peers. This part of the analysis was limited to students who both aspired to a bachelor's degree and were at least minimally prepared academically to enroll in a four-year college. Among these students, there were noticeable differences in the level of math courses completed between students who enrolled in a four-year college and those who either enrolled in a subbaccalaureate institution or who did not enroll. While a majority of students had completed a sequence of math courses through algebra II, those who enrolled in a four-year college were much more likely than students who enrolled in other postsecondary education or who had not enrolled to have taken at least one advanced math course such as calculus. Students who enrolled in a four-year college were also more likely to report receiving help from their school in filling out their application than were students who enrolled in other postsecondary education or who did not enroll. Similar proportions of the latter two groups reported receiving such help. Finally, the results demonstrated the relative importance of several engagement indicators, especially those for parents and peers. Students who enrolled in a four-year college were more likely than students who did not enroll in any postsecondary education to have parents who reported frequently discussing school-related matters with them.

Enrolling in a 4-year college Each step was coded based on one or more items in the survey. In addition, a student had to complete all preceding steps to be coded for the next step. For example, to complete step 2, a student had to have a bachelor's degree goal in the tenth grade (step 1) and be academically prepared (step 2). To complete step 3, a student had to have a bachelor's degree goal (step 1), be academically prepared (step 2), and have taken entrance exam (step 3), and so on.

For more information about pipeline steps see PIPEL SAT and ACT college entrance examination scores. Since admission standards and requirements vary widely among 4-year colleges and universities, the approach used the actual distribution of these five measures of academic aptitude and achievement among those graduating seniors who did attend a 4-year college or university. Data sources were available for approximately half (45 percent) of the NELS graduating seniors for four or five of the criteria: class rank, GPA, the NELS 2nd follow-up test, and ACT or SAT scores or both. For about one-third of the seniors only three data sources were available because they had no ACT or SAT scores. In order to identify as many students as possible who were potentially academically qualified for a 4-year college, even if data were missing for these students on some of the criteria, the seniors were classified according to the highest level they had achieved on any of the five criteria for which data were present. Finally, students who did not meet the minimum criteria but who actually enrolled in a 4-year institution (about 10 percent of 4-year college enrollees) were coded as minimally qualified.41 If CQCOMV1 was missing (about 10 percent of high school graduates), a student who had indicated bachelor's degree aspirations, taken entrance exams, applied to college, and enrolled was coded as academically qualified (5 percent recoded). Conversely, if CQCOMV1 was missing and a student had done none of the above, the student was coded as not qualified (1.7 percent recoded). For this analysis, the variable was aggregated as follows: At least minimally prepared Students whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 75 percent (i.e., in the third quartile) of 4-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=2.7, class rank percentile=54, NELS test percen-tile=56, combined SAT=820, composite ACT=19.

In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors and weighted sample sizes for these estimates.44 For example, table B1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 2 in the text, and was generated by the DAS. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (less than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the NELS:88 stratified sampling method. (See discussion under \"Statistical Procedures\" below for the adjustment procedure.) \"The NELS:88/94 sample is not a simple random sample and, therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data.

(1) where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and set and see are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup that is included in the total), a covariance term must be added to the formula. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used: ( 2)where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup.45"}, {"section_title": "Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the fol-", "text": "When comparing two percentages from a distribution that adds to 100 percent, the following formula is used: E, E2 11 Se; + Se22 2rSel2Se22 45U.S: Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, A Note from the Chief Statistician, No. 2, 1993. 637 7 (3) where r is the correlation between the two estimates.46 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p< .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p< .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p< .05.47 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of students at risk to those not at risk who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (at-risk versus not-at-risk students). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be p< .05/10, or p< .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: 47The standard that p<.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p<.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p<.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association DU l'JVJ ). ..JZ-V\"t where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of raceethnicity, there are five racialethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 2, k= 5 5 11 0 2"}, {"section_title": "Adjustment of Means to Control for Background Variation", "text": "Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to socioeconomic status (SES) differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such as type of institution attended, intensity of enrollment, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended, within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of-variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables.48 Adjusted means for subgroups were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as parents' education, students' academic preparation, students' educational aspirations, etc. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, race ethnicity and income, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as attending a four-year college). The variables raceethnicity and family income are recoded into a dummy variable representing raceethnicity and a dummy variable representing family income: The following regression equation is then estimated from the correlation matrix output from the DAS: A Y = a+ biR+ b2F To estimate the adjusted mean for any subgroup evaluated at the mean of all other variables, one substitutes the appropriate values for that subgroup's dummy variables (1 or 0) and the mean for the dummy variable(s) representing all other subgroups. For example, suppose we had a case where Y was being described by raceethnicity (R) and family income (F), coded as shown above, and the means for R and F are as follows:  To estimate the adjusted value for black students, one substitutes the appropriate parameter values into equation 4.    This table represents all high school graduates who did not enroll in a 4-year college with respect to the number of pipeline steps taken. For each number of steps, the total percent who took that number of steps appears at the top of the \"percent\" column for that group. For those who took one to three steps, the percent taking various combinations is shown below the total percent. For example, 19.8 percent took two steps, consisting of 6.2 percent who were academically prepared and took exams, 5.7 percent who had a bachelor's degree goal and took exams, 5.2 percent who had a degree goal and were academically prepared, and so on.
