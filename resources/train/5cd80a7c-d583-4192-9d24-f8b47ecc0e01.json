It started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1] but has spread to most countries in the world. As the global community battles this novel virus through aggressive screening of individuals for the presence or absence of infection, there is also a salient need for a genetic characterization which will help in the long-term management of the infection. A pool of sequences from various countries of the world would help in assessing the mutational tendencies of the virus as it crosses different geographical conditions and people of different cultures, genetic variations and immune status [2] . Complete genome sequencing of viruses is an essential tool for the development of diagnostics and vaccines, studying virus pathogenicity and virulence, tracking evolutionary paths and studying the genetic association between viruses and their hosts [3] . Optimized sets of primers for Sanger sequencing could be of help for whole genome generation especially for laboratories who lack Next Generation Sequencing platform but have Genetic analyzer. This method though an older methodology in genome sequencing, with its 99.99% accuracy, remains a 'gold standard' for clinical research sequencing (https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/behindthebench/when-do-i-use-sanger-sequencing-vsngs-seq-it-out-7/). A critical determinant for successful full genome Sanger sequencing of any pathogen is the availability of primers that target only the pathogen of interest reliably but not the sequences of host genes or other pathogens [4] .\nThe rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 across countries calls to questions on whether its evolution is mutation driven. It is reported that genomes with new variations are emerging as the virus moves across diverse environmental conditions [5] . Hence, there is a need for mutation monitoring of the virus. A study reviewed that RNA viruses' mutation rate is higher than that of their hosts and this rate plays an important role in virulence modulation and in the development of traits that are useful for viral adaptation [6] . Also, variations have been noticed at ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N regions, in which nt28144 in ORF8 and nt8782 in ORF1a showed variation rates of 30.53% and 29.47%, respectively [7] . Variations at the nucleotide level which is proposed to be one of the most significant measures of viral evolvement, also contributes to the adaptation of the virus in every condition it finds itself thus creating a balance between its genetic information and genome variability [8, 9] .\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Studies showed that it has a zoonotic origin with genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses [10, 11] . The whole genome size of the SARS-CoV-2 varies from 29800bp to 30000 bp and it consists of a long open reading frame (ORF1ab) of about 21290bp encoding orf1ab polyproteins, structural proteins such as surface (S) about 3822bp, envelope (E) about 228bp, membrane (M) about 669bp, and nucleoprotein (N) about 908bp. It also has additional 6 accessory proteins, encoded by ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 genes [12] .\nThis study explored the use of Sanger technology to sequence and characterize the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 using specific overlapping primers designed from the various genes of the virus."}, {"section_title": "Ethics", "text": "Ethical approval (IRB/19/025) was obtained from Nigerian Institute of Medical Research Internal Review Board for the collection of samples for this study.

The cDNA synthesized from the RNA according to the process described above gave a yield of 4.08 ng/\u03bcl. The amplicons from PCR process were loaded on 1.8% agarose gel and ran on CyFox 1 live imaging and gel electrophoresis device (Sysmex Partec, GmbH).\nThe primers developed and successfully used in this study to generate a whole genome will enable laboratories with access to only Sanger technology, to generate sequence data for their countries. This could increase representation of SARS-CoV-2 genome data from more countries to available genome data in various data banks across the world. The Sanger method, an older technology when compared with NGS, has a lower throughput, is more expensive if you want to use it for several samples and pathogens with large genome length. Also, the quality of Sanger sequences is often not very good at the extremes due to the fact that those are the sites where the primers bind before extension. However, with high quality read lengths of between 500-900bp per primer, it tends to minimize errors during assembly when compared to NGS reads. The primers used in this studies are able to amplify amplicons from RNA with Ct values of \ufffd 30 in first round amplification.

Sanger sequencing platform provides a good alternative method to generate sequences by laboratories that lack NGS methods. This study reports an identity of 99.97% between the full genome sequence generated and the reference strain at the nucleotide level and a 99.95% at amino acid level. Other sequences sampled from GenBank as shown in Table 2 had identity of 99-100% at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. The sequence analysed is not 100% identical to the reference genome, but 99.97% identity shows that there is a minimal or insignificant variation as the virus spreads across several environmental regions, from China to Nigeria at the moment. However, this seemingly insignificant variation, needs to be further studied as its corresponding changes in the protein building block could result in a mutation that will alter the behaviour of the virus. Lu and colleagues [16] established that coronaviruses have an average evolutionary rate of \nabout 10 \u22124 base substitution site per year with mutations arising at every replication cycle however that has not been the case with SARS-CoV-2 which has remained majorly conserved even after 6 months of its outbreak [7] .\nNevertheless, in this study, we have observed some variations at ORF1b, S-region and Nregion leading to changes in the corresponding amino acid sequence as highlighted in Table 3 above. ORF1b which covers from 13468nt to 21555nt of the entire genome partly codes for the RdRp gene which is involved in genome replication, mRNA synthesis, or RNA recombination. It is also important for the survival of viruses and play a role in their evolution [5] . Though there is 100% identity at the RdRp gene among our sequences, the reference and other sequences (Table 2) , surveillance is needed as the virus evolves.\nThe spike (S) gene is an important gene in the virus morphology and plays a major role in attachment of the viral particle to the receptor cells in its host range determination and in membrane fusion [17] . In this study, a nucleotide variation was noticed at nt23363 which resulted in a corresponding amino acid change from D (Aspartic acid) to G (Glycine) at amino acid position 614 as seen in Fig 5 above. We are of the opinion that further studies are \nnecessary to investigate the possible origin and effect of this variation especially with respect to the pathogenesis of the virus.\nFurthermore, mutations at the nucleoprotein region nt28841, nt28842 and nt28843, where \"AAC\" replaces \"GGG\" of the reference strain were also observed. This led to corresponding variations in the amino acid coding, at position aa203, where K (Lysine) replaced R (Arginine) and at position aa204, where R (Arginine) replaced G (Glycine) as seen in Fig 6 above . It has been suggested that the C-terminal domain of the Nucleoprotein of coronaviruses plays an important role of binding the gRNA packaging signal leading to selective genome incorporation [18, 19] . The nucleoprotein has also been associated with viral RNA replication and transcription; protection of the genome and possibly facilitate genome transport to the budding site [20] . Thus, a possible mutation at that region could play a vital role in viral fitness and even pathogenesis. Further investigation is required to elucidate the possible effect of these variations."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The use of Sanger sequencing technology for successful sequencing of whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 in this study is instructive that the technology could be useful for facilities, lacking NGS but have Sanger technology, especially those in resource constrained settings. The variations in the sequence obtained, highlight the need for molecular surveillance to generate more genomic data from Africa, even as SARS-CoV-2 spreads and adapts to various environmental conditions globally.
