[{"section_title": "", "text": "Introduction and purpose of the study: For the year 2000, the total enrollment of Head Start reached 857,664 with a budget of $5,266,211,000. It is noted that 69% of children enrolled in Head Start are minority children, with 34.5% being black, and 28.7% being Hispanic (Head Start Bureau, 2001). This figure is likely to rise reflecting the trends of the US national population. There is an increasing awareness that research should acknowledge the demographic diversity, social changes and address specific community needs (Takanishi & DeLeon 1994;Zigler & Styfco, 1994). In recent years, the program has been challenged to demonstrate its effectiveness through rigorous research. The Advisory Committee on Head Start Research and Evaluation Committee was established in 1998 to provide recommendations for national analysis of the impact of Head Start. Some of the recommendations include random assignment of children and families, diversity of sites, quality of sites, and outcome measurement focusing on multiple domains (Head Start Bureau, 1999). The purpose of this study is to utilize data from a national longitudinal study to examine a sample of Head Start children and families. More specifically, the current study intends to control several family variables such as income level, family structure, and parent education level while predicting kindergarten and first grade success for Head Start children."}, {"section_title": "Related literature on predictors of academic growth", "text": "A number of studies have sought to predict academic growth using income, parent education, and family structure as risk predictors. Income (Patterson, Kupersmidt, & Vaden, 1990; Entwisle & Alexander, 1990) and SES (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, & Carta, 1994) have predicted substantial variance in academic outcomes. Parent education (Greenberg, Lengua, Coie, & Pinderhughes, 1999;Walker et al.) has been associated with reading achievement. Race (Greenberg, et al.), SES, early language development, and IQ (Walker, et al.) (Fagan, Newash & Schloesser, 2000). In the current study, we would expect income level to relate to all three academic achievement measures, and parent education to predict reading, but not necessarily math. Family structure may relate to any of the three academic achievement outcomes in the absence of more discriminating predictors."}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "Data for this study comes from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-Kindergarten-First Grade) database for public use version 2.9.2.1 (Westat, 2000). "}, {"section_title": "Data analyses and results", "text": "The major purpose of the study is to model Head Start children's academic growth from kindergarten through first grade in the domains of reading, math and general knowledge, while controlling family variables such as income level, parent education level, and family structure. We used the original weight variable C124CWO to create a new weight to normalize the weights so that they sum to the sample size in the data set (rather than the population of kindergarten children by applying the formula 'New Weight = (C124CWO * n) /sum(C124CWO)'. The new weight then was applied to all the analyses in the study. There were two phases for the data analyses. In the first phase, we conducted three "}, {"section_title": "Repeated Measures ANOVAs", "text": "The results from the Repeated Measures ANOVAs show that both income level and parent education level had statistically significant (p < .05) effects on reading, math, and general knowledge IRT scale scores, while family structure had a much weaker effect (non-significant) on reading, math, and general knowledge IRT scale scores (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Further, the means of Head Start children from families at or above the poverty level were higher than children from families below the poverty level (Tables 4, 5, and 6).        12, (Muthen & Muthen, 2002) to conduct Latent Curve Analysis (LCA). According to Curran (2000), latent curve analysis is a highly structured type of structural equation model, since it incorporates information about both covariance and mean structures of observed measures. LCA uses the observed repeated measures to define one or more underlying latent growth factors. Figures 4, 5, and 6 in Appendix A describe the models with path coefficients tested with LCA. The three LCAs have yielded different findings to describe the growths in three different subject areas. If we fix the intercepts at three data points (Fall 98, Spring 99, and Spring 2000) as 1, and fix the rate of change for the first data point as 0, and the second data point as 2, the rate of change at the third data point varies for the three subject areas. The rate of change is 3.3 for reading, 3.1 for math, and 2.6 for general knowledge. Further, the dummy coded (` l' for below poverty level, '0' for at or above poverty level) income level variable had a negative effect on the intercepts, suggesting that the below poverty level characteristic inversely influenced the intercepts."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "Apparently the below poverty level characteristic had the strongest negative effect (-3.313) on the knowledge intercept, second strongest negative effect (-3.283) on the reading intercept, and weakest negative effect (-2.083) on the math intercept. Parent education level, however, had a positive effect on all the three intercepts. The values reflect the positive effect of the higher parent education level, since parent education level has been coded with higher value reflecting higher level of parent education. It appears that parent education level had the strongest effect on the reading intercept (.954), the second strongest effect on the knowledge intercept (.935), and the weakest effect on the math intercept (.569). Family structure had a relatively weaker effect on the three intercepts (.608, .06, and 0.396 for reading, math, and general knowledge, respectively). Income level showed a negative effect on the rate of change for reading (-.807). Parent education level showed weak positive effect on the rate of change for math (.174). Other effects on the rate of change were small. Table 7, in Appendix B, compares model fit statistics for the models tested. The growth models for reading appear to provide the best-fit statistics. The growth models for knowledge provide the second best-fit statistics. The growth models for math fit well overall, although the fit statistics are not as ideal as the reading and knowledge growth models. Discussion and educational significance of the study We have attempted to model Head Start children's growth in the areas of reading, math, and general knowledge, while controlling the family variables of income level, parent education level, and family structure. We recommend that when predicting academic success longitudinally, we need to control for the family variables, which have been theorized to contribute to academic growth. We further recommend the need to look at specific domains where the Head Start program has been effective in helping economically disadvantaged children. One of the findings of the .41 current study is that the growth model for math does not fit as well as the growth models for reading and knowledge. The implication is the model might have excluded some important family variables or intervention variables. We suggest that further research in the direction."}]
