Today, tidal flooding affects low-lying, mainly wetland areas of NSB Kings Bay, just a couple of times per year on average.

With such regular flooding, areas that are currently wetlands would be at risk of shifting to open water, depending on the ecosystem's ability to keep up with rising seas. Since wetlands typically provide flood protection to inland areas, their health and integrity have bearing on the vulnerability of the installation itself.\nAs sea level rises, flooding associated with extreme tides is expected to become more extensive and frequent. NSB Kings Bay contains large swaths of low-lying marshland, much of which already floods during occasional extra-high tides.

Roughly one-quarter of the base's approximately 18,000 acres consist of protected wetlands (JDA Camden County 2014). The mainland installation is somewhat protected by Cumberland Island, the state's largest barrier island (JDA Camden County 2014). As the home for the Navy's Atlantic-based nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic or guided missiles, NSB Kings Bay is an important part of the country's strategic defense system (CNIC 2016;DOD 2016). Additionally, the base's Trident Training Facility trains sailors to operate submarines, and the Trident Refit Facility maintains and repairs them. 4 Camden County is home to nearly 3,400 current members of the Armed Forces and more than 7,000 veterans (US Census Bureau 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Historic Exposure to Storm Surge and Flood Hazards", "text": "The Naval Research Laboratory has found that NSB Kings Bay is extremely vulnerable to the effects of a hurricane strike, and it is expected to experience sustained hurricane winds once every 28 years, on average (Handlers and Brand 2004).

Since 1985, no significant storm surge has occurred in Kings Bay, which is somewhat protected from open ocean swell and waves generated in the deeper areas of the adjacent tidal sounds (Handlers and Brand 2004).

In the intermediate scenario, an But here and across coastal installations there is still far to go: the gap between the military's current sea level rise preparedness and the threats outlined by this analysis is large and growing. Low-lying federal land inundated by rising seas, daily high-tide flooding of more elevated land and infrastructure, and destructive storm surges-most of the installations analyzed, including NSB Kings Bay, face all of these risks. This analysis provides snapshots of potential future exposure to flooding at NSB Kings Bay. For the military to take action on the front line of sea level rise, however, it will need more detailed analysis and resources to implement solutions. Congress and the DOD should, for example, support the development and distribution of high-resolution hurricane and coastal flooding models; adequately fund data monitoring sys-additional 1,000 acres-an area larger than Central Park-will be exposed to flooding from such a storm by 2100. In the highest scenario, the area exposed to flooding during a Category 1 storm in 2100 is equivalent to the area exposed during a Category 2 storm today. Sea level rise also changes the depth of flooding NSB Kings Bay can expect with major storms. Whereas only about 20 percent of the base is exposed to five feet or more of flooding during a Category 1 storm today, nearly 50 percent of the base will be exposed to such flooding in 2100. For this region, a Category 4 storm occurring after more than six feet of sea level rise represents the worst-case scenario in our analysis for future storm surge inundation. Today, a Category 4 storm would expose about 75 percent of NSB Kings Bay-including most of its utilized land-to flooding. In 2100 in the highest scenario, roughly 95 percent of NSB Kings Bay would be exposed to storm surge flooding.
