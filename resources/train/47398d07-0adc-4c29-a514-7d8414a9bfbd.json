Whether or not these same mechanisms are relevant for the potential eff ects of FTO on brain structure remains currently unclear.\nAs with any genetic association fi nding, the new results outlined above have some limitations and their potential relevance on brain function and dysfunction currently remains elusive. First, the investigated ADNI cohort was relatively small (n = 206), which increases the chance of sampling error and other biases, possibly leading to artifactual results. Small sample size also decreases power, which at least partially explains the rather modest degree of statistical support for most of the reported FTO fi ndings. For instance, the study could not entirely exclude the possibility that the observed association between FTO and structural brain changes was merely a result of confounding with the -much more pronounced -BMI eff ects on brain volume, or a bona fi de independent signal. Replication analyses in suffi ciently powered and independent datasets will help to resolve this issue.\nSecond, FTO is not the only gene associated with BMI and obesity in humans. Several other loci -such as MC4R, NPC1, MAF, and PTER -have recently been identifi ed to also play signifi cant roles [8] . Assessing whether these genes also exert specifi c eff ects on brain structure would therefore be of interest. Conversely, it would be interesting to see whether other genes not related to obesity and BMI possibly show an even more pronounced association with brain atrophy than FTO; for example, after genome-wide screening.\nTh ird, it will be interesting to see whether and how the reduction in brain volume in the frontal and occipital lobes exerted by FTO translates into altered cerebral function (for example, as measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging), and/or behavior in healthy subjects.\nFinally, whether or not the reported FTO-brain connec tion has any relevance to neurodegenerative conditions, such as AD, remains to be seen. Only healthy older subjects have thus far been investigated, and the brain regions possibly aff ected by FTO (that is, the frontal and occipital lobes) are not typically struck early in the course of AD. A related study from the same ADNI investigators recently reported an association between ele vated BMI and lower brain volume in subjects suff ering from AD and mild cognitive impairment [9] , although no results were reported on whether these eff ects were also correlated with FTO genotype. Furthermore, no study -including the several published genome-wide association studies [10] -has yet reported evidence for signifi cant association between polymorphisms in FTO and AD risk or related phenotypes [11] . Based on the most recent ADNI data, however, this would seem a logical and promising hypothesis to test next. In summary, the new ADNI data provide the fi rst evidence for a possible link between one of the most important obesity genes and brain structure. Additional investigations are necessary to corroborate these fi ndings, and to determine their relevance for normal brain function and disease.\nAbbreviations AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADNI, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; BMI, body mass index; FTO, fat mass and obesity-associated protein; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism."}]
