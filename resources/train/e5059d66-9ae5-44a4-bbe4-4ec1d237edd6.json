A subset of 669 participants additionally had longitudinal MRI scans to assess hippocampal volume. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were estimated with summary statistics from previous large-scale genome-wide association studies of AD dementia. We examined relationships between APOE e4 status and PRS with longitudinal A\u03b2 and cognitive and hippocampal volume measurements.\nResults APOE e4 was strongly related to baseline A\u03b2, whereas only weak associations between PRS and baseline A\u03b2 were present. APOE e4 was additionally related to greater memory decline and hippocampal atrophy in A\u03b2+ participants. When APOE e4 was controlled for, PRS was related to cognitive decline in A\u03b2+ participants. Finally, PRSs were associated with hippocampal atrophy in A\u03b2\u2212 participants and weakly associated with baseline hippocampal volume in A\u03b2+ participants.\nGenetic risk factors of AD dementia demonstrate effects related to A\u03b2, as well as synergistic interactions with A\u03b2. The specific effect of faster cognitive decline in A\u03b2+ individuals with higher genetic risk may explain the large degree of heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories among A\u03b2+ individuals.

Previous work has identified limited associations between genetic risk and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation 3, 4 and has suggested mechanistic pathways not directly linked to abnormal A\u03b2 accumulation such as inflammatory pathways. [5] [6] [7] Thus, genetic risk variants associated with AD dementia may not solely confer risk by promoting A\u03b2 aggregation but may make an individual more likely to decline when faced with A\u03b2 accumulation.\nA synergistic effect between genetic risk and A\u03b2 is consistent with a framework in which A\u03b2 may be necessary but insufficient for clinical symptoms of AD dementia 8 and may offer an explanation for the presence of clinically normal (CN) older individuals who have high levels of A\u03b2. 9 Along these lines, it is known that although A\u03b2+ CN individuals show group-level reductions in cognitive performance over time, 3, [10] [11] [12] many A\u03b2+ individuals remain cognitively normal even after extended follow-up. 13 Heterogeneity in cognitive decline has also been reported in symptomatic patients with AD dementia, which may be related to differences in genetic risk factors. For instance, although the APOE e4 allele is consistently associated with abnormal accumulation of A\u03b2, 14 A\u03b2+ individuals without dementia who are also APOE e4 carriers show faster rates of cognitive decline than A\u03b2+ individuals who are APOE e4 noncarriers. 15, 16 A similar effect modification has been shown for the BDNF gene such that A\u03b2+ individuals with the BDNF Met allele show faster cognitive decline than A\u03b2+ individuals without the Met allele. 17 Given that these a priori genetic risk factors have been shown to influence cognitive decline among A\u03b2+ individuals, it is possible that other established genetic risk factors have a similar influence.\nThe overall goal of the present study was to investigate whether APOE e4 and polygenic risk of AD dementia influence A\u03b2, cognition, and hippocampal volume measurements and to determine whether their associations with cognition and hippocampal volume are modified by A\u03b2 status."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; adni.loni.usc.edu) as of March 25, 2017 .

The reduced model contained all covariates and their interactions with time. Then, variation in the rate of decline explained by each genetic risk factor is defined as R 2 slope = 1 \u2212 V full =V reduced . R 2 slope measures the proportion of interparticipant variation in the slope that can be explained by adding the genetic risk factor into the model. R 2 slope was calculated for APOE e4 by adding APOE e4 to the reduced model. PRS was then added to this model to estimate R 2 slope for PRS.

Furthermore, controlling for APOE e4, higher polygenic risk was strongly associated with higher rates of decline in memory and executive function in A\u03b2+ individuals across a range of PRS p value thresholds. These associations explained approximately 8% to 10% of the variation in the rate of cognitive decline across A\u03b2+ participants.

Specifically, APOE e4 was related to elevated baseline A\u03b2 and the accumulation of A\u03b2 over time in A\u03b2\u2212, whereas PRS showed minimal associations with A\u03b2 but was strongly associated with faster cognitive decline in A\u03b2+ participants. The influence of PRS on longitudinal cognitive trajectories was above and beyond the effect of APOE e4 status, diagnosis, and hippocampal volume, highlighting the value of a priori genetic risk factors as a predictor of short-term decline among A\u03b2+ individuals. Furthermore, polygenic risk was not related to rates of cognitive decline in the A\u03b2\u2212 group, suggesting a synergistic effect between abnormal A\u03b2 and genetic risk on cognitive decline. Finally, polygenic risk showed associations with hippocampal volume across both the A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 groups, suggesting that genetic risk of AD may have an effect on non-A\u03b2 pathways that influence brain structure in regions central to AD dementia.\nWe did not find strong evidence that an aggregate measure of genetic risk of AD dementia was directly associated with abnormal levels of amyloid, assessed either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. However, our analyses consistently showed an association between polygenic risk and cognitive decline that was specific to the A\u03b2+ group. This finding is in line with previous studies that have shown that A\u03b2 and APOE e4 interact to accelerate cognitive decline and hippocampal degeneration in CN individuals, 16, 17, 28 highlighting synergistic interactions between genetic risk of AD and the presence of abnormal A\u03b2. Furthermore, we have previously observed that elevated PRS is associated with greater longitudinal cognitive decline in older individuals without dementia. 29 However, other studies investigating PRS of AD dementia have failed to identify an association with cognitive decline 30 or clinical progression. 31 One source of this discrepancy may be that these previous investigations of polygenic risk did not examine decline in the context of AD biomarkers. Our results indicate that elevated PRS is associated with cognitive decline only among A\u03b2+ individuals, suggesting that genetic risk factors and A\u03b2 act synergistically to influence cognitive decline. Recent work from Tan et al. 32 and Desikan et al. 33 also using the ADNI dataset has reported a similar pattern: cognitive decline was greatest in individuals with both abnormal CSF AD markers (amyloid and tau) and elevated genetic risk of AD as assessed with a polygenic hazard score. Although this study implemented a different methodological strategy to aggregate genetic risk across multiple genomic loci, the consistency across our study and theirs highlights a synergistic effect between genetic risk and AD pathology on cognitive trajectories. Given that genetic risk of AD has been implicated in non-A\u03b2 pathways such as the immune system and cytoskeletal function, [5] [6] [7] it is possible that the convergence of these non-A\u03b2 pathways with late-life A\u03b2 accumulation is an important predictor of subsequent decline.\nWhereas polygenic risk was related to decline in both memory and executive function among A\u03b2+ individuals, APOE e4 was specifically related to decline in memory and not executive function. This finding is consistent with analyses in patients with AD dementia that have suggested that APOE e4 carriers tend to show memory impairment whereas patients with AD dementia who are APOE e4 noncarriers show impairment in executive function. 34 Likewise, examination of pathologically defined subtypes of AD dementia suggests that APOE e4 is associated with a limbic predominant presentation among late-onset AD cases. 35 The finding that polygenic risk influences both memory and executive function implies that polygenic risk of AD dementia may influence a more distributed set of brain regions compared to APOE e4. Along these lines, we previously found that polygenic risk was associated with multiple cortical regions, including frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, 36 which may explain the broad effect of polygenic risk on cognitive decline. Given that calculation of polygenic risk aggregates information across many genomic loci and potentially many genetic pathways, it is unclear whether there are certain subgroups of genetic risk factors that relate to more specific brain networks and would demonstrate an effect on cognition that was domain specific. If so, a participant's composition of these genetic risk factors may be predictive of the specific cognitive domain that is most vulnerable in an individual and provide an explanation for the heterogeneity in clinical expression of AD dementia that exists across individuals. Future work that refines polygenic risk to encapsulate variability across different cognitive domains may offer insights into the known heterogeneity of the clinical expression of AD. 37 In contrast to memory and executive function, we found that in A\u03b2+ participants, PRS did not strongly influence longitudinal hippocampal atrophy but was associated with baseline volume, while in the A\u03b2\u2212 group, PRS was strongly associated with the longitudinal change in hippocampal volume but not its baseline measurements. This finding highlights that although polygenic risk influences hippocampal volume regardless of A\u03b2 status, the time course of this effect varies. It is possible that the effect of polygenic risk on hippocampal atrophy occurs before late-life A\u03b2 accumulation and that once abnormal levels of A\u03b2 have occurred, there are stronger drivers of subsequent atrophy compared to polygenic risk (such as tau-mediated neurodegeneration 38 ). This framework is consistent with previous work that has shown a relationship between polygenic risk of AD dementia and hippocampal volume in young participants, 29, 39 well before the age at which abnormal A\u03b2 is anticipated. 40 Thus, the effect of polygenic risk on hippocampal volume in stages preceding A\u03b2 accumulation (as supported by findings in both younger participants 29, 39 and older A\u03b2\u2212 participants in the current study) may ultimately make an individual more vulnerable to cognitive decline in late life when additionally faced with A\u03b2 accumulation.\nOur analyses have several limitations. First, the PRSs were calculated from summary statistics from cross-sectional casecontrol GWAS. 26 Therefore, the estimated effect sizes of genetic variants may not reflect their strength of influences on longitudinal change in AD markers, and the constructed PRS may thus be suboptimal for investigating the genetic basis of cognitive decline and AD progression. Conducting large-scale GWAS of longitudinal neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD may improve genetic prediction of longitudinal decline. Second, although we focused on hippocampus volume, other MRI-derived neuroimaging markers of AD progression may also be relevant, especially given the association we identified between PRS and executive function. Third, although we report that \u224810% of the variance in cognitive decline among A\u03b2+ individuals can be explained by genetic risk factors, the majority of variance remains unexplained. Thus, the consideration of additional factors such as the regional deposition of tau (via PET), as well as vascular, lifestyle, and other genetic risk factors that were not captured in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project GWAS analysis, will be necessary to optimize our ability to predict risk at the individual participant level. Lastly, replication of the findings in this study is needed in other large cohorts with biomarker data and prospective neuropsychological follow-up.\nWe observed that APOE e4 status and higher polygenic risk of AD dementia were associated with higher rates of decline in neuropsychological assessments of memory and executive function in A\u03b2+ individuals. The effect of polygenic risk on cognitive decline was above and beyond APOE e4 and specific to the A\u03b2+ group, suggesting a synergistic effect between abnormal A\u03b2 and genetic risk. Polygenic risk was also associated with hippocampal volume, an effect that was not dependent on A\u03b2 status. These findings suggest that although this aggregate measure of genetic risk is not strongly associated with amyloid, it may moderate an individual's risk of decline once abnormal levels of amyloid are present, ultimately improving efforts to identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline. Summary answer APOE e4 status and higher polygenic risk of AD dementia were associated with higher rates of decline in memory and executive function among A\u03b2-positive individuals. Polygenic risk was also associated with hippocampal volume."}, {"section_title": "What is known and what this paper adds", "text": "Genetic risk variants associated with AD dementia do not only confer risk by promoting A\u03b2 aggregation but may make an individual more susceptible to decline when faced with A\u03b2 accumulation.
