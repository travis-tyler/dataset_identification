[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated \"COVID-19)\" is an infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is large class of virus that have been relatively widespread all across the world. The virus has low pathogenicity and high transmissibility capacity [1] . The Chinese authorities in Wuhan City, the capital of the province of Hubei, China, first announced this at the end of December 2019 [2] [3] [4] [5] . After originating in Wuhan China last December 2019, COVID-19 has spead to atleast 200 countries and regionos. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [6] . According to the WHO, the outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID -19) has been a pandemic that infected more than 5 million people at the time of writing this protocol and caused more than 324,000 deaths and 1.7 million recoveris worldwide within the six months duration [7] . Off the total cases 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, and 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multi-organ failure [8] . In Africa, morbidity and mortality reached greater than 12,492 and 649 respectively [7] .\nCurrently, COVID-19 affect 54 African countries with a total 103, 875 casese, 3,184 death,41,576 recoveries (with the highest cases in South Africa) and 64, 388 cases were in the WHO African region [9] .\nA modelling study in Africa, classifying African countries as having high risk with 13 top WHO highest pririty(Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa), moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) and all other countries had low to moderate importation risk and low to moderate. The fatality rate of COVID in north African countries expected to be 11.02% [10, 11] .\nAt the end of the pandemic, Africa will have some of the worst consequences of this COVID-19 pandemic. Generally speaking, African countries have poor health systems and this remains a source of concern, particularly in the event of an increase in outbreaks [12] .\nIn WHO Africa region 83,000-190, 000 people could die of COVID-19 and 29 million to 44 million could get infected in the first year of the pandemic if coinainment measures fails. The research, which is based on prediction modelling, looks aat 47 countries in the WHO African Region with a total population of one million. There would be an estimated these 3.6-5.5 million COVID-19 hospitalization, of which 82,000-167,000 would be severe cases requiring oxygen, and 52,000-107,000 would be critical cases requiring bbreathing support [13] .\nThere were different reports regarding the COVID-19 [10, 12, 14] but; there is no pooled results regarding the burden, admission and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa. Therefore, this study protocol will be guided to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa."}, {"section_title": "Protocol registration", "text": "This review is registered in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic reviews (CRD42020179321) (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ PROSPERO) and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and MetaAnalysis protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines [15] (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Search strategy and data extraction", "text": "The search strategy has been applied using Online Databases (PubMed / MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, EMBASE,Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochran Library, Africa Wide Knowledge, and Africa Index Medicus) from December 2019 to May 2020 (Table 2 ).

This review will be created using the metadata of the \"COVID-19 Open\nResearch Dataset\" (https://pages. semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) (updated May 2020). We only uploaded the metadata (reference) file of 63k+ coronavirus and COVID-19 research articles with links to PubMed, Microsoft Academic and the WHO COVID-19 database of publications. We had to transform the metadata file (using https:// github.com/rayyanqcri/CORD-19-importer) to make it compatible with Rayyan.
