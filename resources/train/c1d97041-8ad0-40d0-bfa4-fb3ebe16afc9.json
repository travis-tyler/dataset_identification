[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Principal Indicators is a descriptive account of the major features of the postsecondary academic experience and attainment of traditional-age students during the period 1972-2000, with an emphasis on the period 1992-2000. To provide this account, the report draws on three gradecohort longitudinal studies that were designed and carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics, and within those studies, high school and (principally) college transcript records: \u2022 The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72), which began with a national sample of 22,500 12th graders in U.S. high schools in the spring of 1972 and followed subgroups of the cohort to 1986. The postsecondary transcripts for 12,600 members of this cohort were gathered in 1984, when most were 30 or 31 years old. \u2022 The High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Sophomores (HS&B/So:80-92), which began with a national sample of 30,000 10th graders in U.S. high schools in 1980 and followed subgroups of this cohort to 1992. The postsecondary transcripts for 8,400 members of this cohort were gathered in 1993, when most cohort members were 29 or 30 years old. \u2022 The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988(NELS:88/2000, which began with a national sample of 25,000 8th graders in U.S. schools in 1988 and followed subgroups of this cohort to 2000. The postsecondary transcripts for 8,900 members of this cohort were gathered in 2000, when most cohort members were 26 or 27 years old. More than half the tables in Principal Indicators are confined to the history of this-the most recent-cohort. To provide consistency in comparing the experience of students in the three cohorts, the populations used for the data tables in Principal Indicators are confined to those students who were in the 12th grade in the year they were scheduled to graduate from high school. This parameter was determined by the earliest of the grade cohorts, NLS:72, which began in the 12th grade. Hence, the three cohorts are referred to throughout the document as By confining the universe to 12th graders, high school dropouts who had not returned to be with their scheduled class and early graduates are excluded from this account of the postsecondary histories of the classes of 1982 and 1992. The tables in Principal Indicators cover topics of geographic mobility, postsecondary access and degree of participation, postsecondary attainment (degrees, credits, time-to-degree), attendance patterns, majors, curriculum clusters, grades, and remediation. A companion document-The Empirical Curriculum: Changes in Postsecondary Course-Taking, 1972-provides a more detailed account of the curricular experience of the three grade cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Major Topics and Illustrative Observations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demography and Geography", "text": "One of the more important changes in the behavior of postsecondary student populations over the past quarter century is geographic and inter-institutional mobility.

(table 2.3). # Seventy-seven percent of the high school class of 1992 attended at least one postsecondary institution within 8.5 years of scheduled high school graduation. This v access rate compares with 63 percent for the class of 1982 over an 11-year period, and 58 percent for the class of 1972 over a 12-year period. The gaps in access between the highest and lowest socioeconomic status quintiles over the three cohorts are more pronounced than those by race/ethnicity (table 2.4).\nWhen the universe is confined to students in the class of 1992 who earned standard high school diplomas within a year of scheduled graduation, the differences in access rates between White and both African-American and Latino students are statistically insignificant (table 2.7) while differences by socioeconomic status quintile remain (table 2.8).\nOne out of eight students in the class of 1992 who entered postsecondary education became an \"incidental\" student, that is, earned 10 or fewer credits and no credentials (table 3.1). Over 40 percent of these students delayed entry to postsecondary education (compared with 15 percent of nonincidental students); 75 percent started out in a community college (compared with 36 percent of nonincidental students); two out of three were enrolled for less than1 year; and 42 percent never got beyond Algebra 1 in high school (vs. 11 percent of nonincidental students) ( table 3.2). # One out of 10 students in the class of 1992 who entered postsecondary education earned 60 or more credits but no degree within 8.5 years of high school graduation. There were no differences by race/ethnicity in this group, although men were more likely than women to fall into this category (table 3. 1). When compared to their peers who earned associate's and/or bachelor's degrees, this group was characterized more by noncontinuous enrollment, multi-institutional attendance, a higher proportion of courses from which they withdrew, and a low number of credits earned in the first calendar year of postsecondary attendance (table 3.3). # Eighty-eight percent of the students from the class of 1992 who entered postsecondary education persisted from their first to second year. Among those who did not persist, two-thirds started in community colleges and 70 percent earned less than 10 credits in their first calendar year of attendance (table 3.4). # Fifty-seven percent of students in the class of 1992 who earned more than 10 credits attended more than one school as undergraduates, compared with 51 percent for the class of 1982 and 47 percent for the class of 1972. Among those who earned bachelor's degrees, nearly 60 percent attended more than one school as undergraduates in the class of 1992, 58 percent in the class of 1982, and 57 percent in the class of 1972 (table 4.1).\nAmong those in the class of 1992 who started in a 4-year college and earned a bachelor's degree, one out of five earned the degree from an institution other than the one in which they began their postsecondary careers (table 1.6). vi # Of all students who began their postsecondary careers in community colleges and earned more than 10 credits from community colleges, 36 percent of those in the class of 1992 formally transferred to a 4-year college, compared with 27 percent in the class of 1982 and 28 percent for the class of 1972. Of these transfer populations, the bachelor's degree attainment rate was 72 percent for the 11-and 12-year histories of the classes of 1972 and 1982 and 62 percent for the 8.5-year history of the class of 1992 (table 4.4). # Twenty-seven percent of African-American college students in the class of 1992 attended one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) at some time in their undergraduate careers (table 4.5). # Forty-eight percent of Latino college students in the class of 1992 attended a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) at some time in their undergraduate careers. Nearly two-thirds of Latino students who attended HSIs started in a 2-year HSI (table 4.6). # Nineteen percent of postsecondary participants in the class of 1992 earned college credits while still enrolled in high school and/or by examination. For bachelor's degree recipients with no such acceleration credits, the average time-to-degree was 4.65 calendar years; for those with more than 9 acceleration credits, the average time-to-degree was 4.25 calendar years (table 4.7).\nThe proportion of all students earning bachelor's degrees in business and allied fields rose from 17 percent in the 1970s to 25 percent in the 1980s, then fell back to 17 percent in the 1990s (table 5.1). # Conversely, the proportion of all students earning bachelor's degrees in education fell from 16 percent in the 1970s to 6 percent in the 1980s, then rebounded to 9 percent in the 1990s (table 5.1). # Among African-American bachelor's degree recipients, the proportion earning degrees in engineering in the class of 1992 (12.6 percent) was nearly double that for the class of 1982 and six times that for the class of 1972. Conversely, the proportion of African-American bachelor's degree recipients earning degrees in education fell from 22 percent in the 1970s to 6 percent in the 1980s and 1990s (table 5.2). # The proportion of Asian-American bachelor's degree recipients majoring in engineering fell from 20 percent in the class of 1982 to 11 percent in the class of 1992 (table 5.2). # With the exception of engineering among men and elementary education among women (where the differences were not statistically significant), psychology was the most popular major among bachelor's degree recipients of the class of 1992, claiming 10 percent of female bachelor's degrees, 5 percent of male bachelor's degrees, and 8 percent of all bachelor's degrees (table 5.3).\nOf community college students who earned associate's degrees, the proportion who earned those degrees in General Studies (the classic transfer curriculum) fell from 39 percent for the class of 1972 to 30 percent for the class of 1982, but rose to 43 percent for the class of 1992 (table 5.4). # The proportion of women earning associate's degrees from community colleges in health sciences and services ranged between five and eight times that for men in all three cohorts. Conversely, the proportion of men earning associate's degrees from community colleges in engineering technology and other technical fields ranged between five and eight times that for women in all three cohorts (table 5.4). # Among students who earned more than 30 credits and those who earned bachelor's degrees, there was no significant difference between the class of 1982 and the class of 1992 in the proportion earning any credits in calculus and advanced mathematics (table 5.5). # One of the reasons there was no significant difference in the proportion of bachelor's degree recipients earning postsecondary credits in calculus and advanced mathematics between the class of 1982 and the class of 1992 may be that 23 percent of this group in the class of 1992 had already completed calculus courses in high school, compared with 15 percent for the class of 1982 (table 5.6).\nThe most notable change in the distribution of letter grades over the history of the three cohorts is the rise (from 4 percent for the class of 1972 to over 8 percent for the class of 1992) in the proportion of grades that were no-penalty Withdrawals (Ws) and No-Credit Repeats (NCRs) (table 6.1). Of all grades given in open door institutions (including community colleges), the proportion that were Ws and NCRs rose from 12 to 16 percent between the histories of the classes of 1982 and 1992 (table 6.3). # For the class of 1992, the higher the number of grades of W and NCR on students' records, the lower the percentage of students who earned bachelor's degrees. For those with no Ws or NCRs, the bachelor's degree attainment rate was 68 percent; for those with 7 or more Ws and NCRs, the bachelor's degree attainment rate was 25 percent (table 6.2a). viii # Among bachelor's degree recipients in the class of 1992, those with no W or NCR grades completed their degrees in an average of 4.14 calendar years. With one or two grades of W and/or NCR, the average time-to-degree jumped to 4.45 calendar years, and with 7 or more Ws and NCRs,to 5.97 calendar years (table 6.2). # In two of the three cohorts, students earning bachelor's degrees from highly selective institutions had higher undergraduate GPAs than those who earned degrees from selective institutions, and these students, in turn, had higher GPAs than students who earned degrees from nonselective institutions (table 6.4). # The list of courses with the highest percentages of failures (penalty grades, Ws, and NCRs) is dominated by remedial English and precollegiate mathematics, other mathematics, introductory-level business and accounting, and major lower-division distribution courses such as U.S. history surveys, computer programming, general psychology, and introduction to fine arts (tables 6.6 and 6.7).\nThe proportion of all students who took at least one remedial course dropped from 51 percent in the class of 1982 to 42 percent in the class of 1992. This decline took place principally for students who started in 4-year colleges, where the remediation rate fell from 44 to 26 percent. At the same time, the proportion of students starting in community colleges who required at least one remedial course showed no significant change, remaining in the 61-63 percent range (table 7.1).\nThe proportion of students requiring remediation in reading was 11 percent in both the class of 1982 and the class of 1992 (table 7.1). Remedial reading was the only one of five types or intensities of remediation that was directly related to senior-year test score quintile in both cohorts (table 7.2); and the proportion of students requiring remedial reading who earned no postsecondary credentials rose from 57 to 70 percent (table 7.3).\nElapsed calendar year versus academic year. This is an important distinction when talking about how much time it takes students to earn credentials. The traditional academic year, whether semester or quarter calendars, is 9 months. A student who entered college in September 1998 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in June 2002 is said to have earned a \"4-year degree\" on time, no matter when the student was enrolled between those dates, and no matter whether the academic calendar system(s) in the institution(s) in which they were enrolled were semester, quarter, trimester, clock hour, irregular, or some combination of these. Yet the elapsed calendar time between those dates is not 4 years, but 3.75 years. If the student had not received the degree until December 2002, the elapsed time would have been 4.25 calendar years and 4.5 academic years. There is always a .25 difference between the two metrics. This document employs the elapsed calendar year as its metric because of the extent of multi-institutional attendance, use of summer terms, accumulation of credits by examination and in special terms with no set parameters such as a semester, and other nonstandard uses of time in postsecondary education.\nCredits. All postsecondary credits, including clock hours, have been standardized to a semester metric. xx"}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Attainment, Access, and Participation", "text": "Given the increasing proportion of traditional-age students continuing on to postsecondary education after high school, policy discussions and research have come to be dominated more by issues of retention, persistence, completion, and time-to-degree than by basic access."}, {"section_title": "Attendance Patterns", "text": "An examination of attendance patterns reveals increasing complex configurations, but also enables analysts to sort out distinct groups of students to target either for enhanced precollegiate preparation or special guidance in postsecondary institutions.

Taken together, these tables begin to reveal some ways of mapping the content of the delivered curriculum. The companion to this volume, The Empirical Curriculum: Changes in Postsecondary Course-Taking, 1972, offers more detail on the topic.   While other configurations could be constructed for these aggregates, the assignment of the major field codes was driven by volume of majors, reviewed by panels of registrars and institutional research officers in both 1995 and 2001 and judged to be reasonable representations. For tables 5.1 and 5.2, the histories for all three cohorts are truncated at 8.5 years after high school graduation (the postsecondary life span of the Class of 1992) to insure comparability in the distribution of students by gender and race/ethnicity across the 12 aggregate major fields. The following general patterns in table 5.1 under the columns headed \"All\" can be observed: \u2022 the proportion of all students earning bachelor's degrees in business and allied fields rose from the 1970s to the 1980s, then fell back in the 1990s; \u2022 the categories of mathematics and computer science, dominated by computer science and other computer-related fields, followed the same pattern as did business; \u2022 the proportion of all students earning bachelor's degrees in education fell from the 1970s through the 1980s, but rose modestly in the 1990s; and \u2022 a decline in the proportion of students earning degrees in the physical sciences between the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1992. Considering differences in these trends by gender, one can observe: \u2022 a rise in the proportion of women majoring in the social sciences and life sciences between the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1992; and \u2022 a notable increase in the proportion of men earning degrees in health sciences and services between the 1980s and 1990s. Changes in the distribution of majors among bachelor's degree recipients, by race/ethnicity, displayed in table 5.2, include the following notable items: \u2022 Among African-American students, the proportion receiving degrees in Engineering in the Class of 1992 was six times the proportion in the Class of 1972. On the surface, the 12.6 percent figure appears to be higher than those for students from all other race/ethnicity groups, but these differences are not statistically significant. \u2022 Among African-American students, the proportion earning bachelor's degrees in the physical sciences in the Class of 1992 appears to be triple that for the same group in the Class of 1982, and appears greater than the proportions for all other race/ethnicity groups, but none of these differences are statistically significant. Since the sum of a distribution by major field for any group of degree recipients adds to 100.0 percent, significantly greater shares in areas such as engineering and physical sciences mean lesser shares in other fields. For African-American college graduates over the 28 years of the three cohort studies, this phenomenon (declining intra-group share) can be observed in the humanities and education, and, between the 1980s and 1990s, in applied social sciences and computer science/mathematics. Researchers should be encouraged by these data to investigate the ways in which some fields have been successful in recruiting and retaining minority students, and to examine the characteristics and histories of the African-American students in the Class of 1992 who completed degrees in engineering and the physical sciences against students from 1other race/ethnicity groups and (2) earlier cohorts of African-American bachelor's degree recipients. Other trends worth noting in consideration of the change in the distribution of majors by race/ethnicity include: \u2022 the rebound between the 1980s and 1990s in the proportion of bachelor's degree recipients receiving degrees in education was led by White students; and \u2022 between the 1980s and 1990s, a drop in the proportion of Asian-American students earning bachelor's degrees in engineering. Table 5.3 digs below the surface of the 12 aggregate major categories, and, confining its analysis to the Class of 1992, asks for the 20 majors (out of 129 discrete major codes) that accounted for the highest proportion of bachelor's degree recipients in that cohort. The basic distribution is set forth in table 5.3, where the analytic rubrics are gender and selectivity of the institution awarding the degree. The distribution by gender reveals that (1) the most \"popular\" major field, psychology, is dominated by women, (2) among the various business fields, men and women come closest to parity in accounting and marketing, and (3) historically gender-segmented fields (for example, engineering, elementary education, nursing) remain gender-segmented . The distributions by selectivity of the institution awarding the bachelor's degree are more dramatic: \u2022 Engineering majors account for nearly one out of four degrees awarded by highly selective institutions, a far higher percentage (and statistically significant) than for institutions of lesser selectivity. \u2022 Evidently, very few highly selective institutions offer degrees in elementary education, accounting, business administration, marketing, criminal justice, nursing, and health/physical education/recreation.  1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 Business    1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 Business   Cohort, NCES 2000-194;NELS:88/2000Postsecondary Transcript Files, NCES 2003. The bachelor's degree is not the only undergraduate degree awarded in U.S. higher education. Over one-half million associate's degrees have been awarded every year since 1991 (Snyder 2002, table 252, p. 298). If the data for the Class of 1992 are an accurate reflection, 79 percent of these associate's degrees were awarded by community colleges (not in tables). For the Class of 1982, the proportion of associate's degrees awarded by community colleges was roughly the same at 83 percent. Table 5.4 isolates only those associate's degrees awarded by community colleges to students in the three longitudinal studies, allows the studies to run their course (as opposed to truncating them at a common point, as was the case in the presentation of bachelor's degree majors) in order to account for those who earn associate's degrees after the bachelor's, and uses nine aggregates of major fields to plot change in the content of the community college associate's degree over time. Given the fact that the ratio of associate's degrees awarded by community colleges to total bachelor's degrees awarded is less than .5 (Snyder 2002, tables 265 and 268), gender is the only demographic independent variable that is likely to produce statistically defensible analyses. In table 5.4, the story of business and allied majors that was told in the case of bachelor's degrees is repeated at the associate's level: between the 1970s and 1980s, the proportion of all degrees awarded rose, then dropped in the 1990s-and this trend held for both men and women. Second, continued gender-segmentation across all three cohorts is observable in business support occupations, engineering/technical occupations programs, and health sciences & services. But the most significant change-and it occurs between the 1980s and 1990s-is an increase of over 40 percent in the proportion of community college awarded associate's degrees in General Studies. This degree is the classic A.A. transfer degree, and the proportion of these degrees in the comparatively short (8.5 year) history of the NELS:88/2000 indicates the potential for a long-term transfer rate higher than the 26 percent reported in table 4.4. And in one of the few stories of its type in these histories, both men and women show similar increases in this key momentum indicator. The category of \"Other\" in table 5.4 accounts for one out of five associate's degrees awarded to men in the Class of 1992. Associate's degrees in Criminal Justice constituted nearly half of the degrees in this category (followed, in percentages, by paralegal and culinary arts programs). At the associate's degree level, Criminal Justice is a police academy degree, perhaps explaining some of the gender distribution.  1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 Business "}, {"section_title": "5.1", "text": "Distribution of majors of 12th graders in the high school classes of 1972, 1982, and 1992 who earned the bachelor's degree within 8.5 years of the modal cohort high school graduation date, by gender. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"section_title": "5.2", "text": "Distribution of majors of 12th graders in the high school classes of 1972, 1982, and 1992 who earned the bachelor's degree within 8.5 years of the modal cohort high school graduation date, by race/ethnicity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"section_title": "5.3", "text": "Percentage of 1992 12th graders who received bachelor's degrees in the 20 fields with the highest proportion of majors, by gender and selectivity of institution awarding the bachelor's degree. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"section_title": "5.4", "text": "Distribution of associate's degree majors of 12th graders in 1972 (through 1984), 1982 (through 1993), and 1992 (through 2000) who earned associate's degrees from community colleges. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"section_title": "5.5", "text": "Credits earned in selected postsecondary curriculum clusters by 1982 and 1992 12th graders who earned at least 30 undergraduate credits. . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"section_title": "5.6", "text": "Distribution of postsecondary credits in calculus and advanced mathematics earned by bachelor's degree recipients among 1982 and 1992 12th graders, by highest level of mathematics studied in high school. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"section_title": "5.7", "text": "Credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients among 1992 12th graders, in selected curriculum clusters outside the student's major. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xv  (Ws) and no-credit repeats (NCRs) to highest degree earned for 1992 12th graders, 1992-2000. . . . 6.2b Relationship of number of no-penalty course withdrawals (Ws) and no-credit repeats (NCRs) to time-to-degree for 1992 12th graders who earned bachelor 's degrees. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.3 Distribution of undergraduate grades by institutional selectivity: All institutions attended by 12th graders in the Class of 1982Class of (1982Class of -1993 and 12 th graders in the Class of 1992Class of (1992Class of -2000 Undergraduate grade point averages (GPAs) of 1972(GPAs) of , 1982(GPAs) of , and 1992 12th graders who earned bachelor's degrees, by selectivity of the institution awarding the bachelor's degree. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.5 Letter grade distribution in selected high-enrollment-volume undergraduate courses taken by 1992 12th graders, 1992-2000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.6 The 20 undergraduate courses with the highest proportions of Withdrawal (W) and No Credit Repeat (NCR) grades taken by 1992 12th graders: 1992-2000. ."}, {"section_title": "6.7", "text": "The 20 undergraduate courses with the highest proportions of failure/penalty grades taken by 1992 12th graders: 1992-2000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.8 The 20 undergraduate courses with the highest proportions of \"A\" grades taken by 1992 12th graders:  "}, {"section_title": "The Nature of This Document", "text": "Principal Indicators is a presentation of data informing important questions that have been asked by state legislatures, the Congress, the media, and the general public concerning postsecondary student access, attainment, attendance patterns, curriculum participation, and academic performance over the past quarter century.

With the recent release of the NELS:88/2000 postsecondary transcript files, more contemporary data are available, and analysts can begin to construct comparative trends covering the histories of students as they made their way into and through postsecondary education from their high school years through their late twenties. What Principal Indicators does is simply to arrange and set forth the data, introduce the topics, provide pointers for reading the tables along with selected observations on statistical significance and potential connections to policy issues, and raise questions and hypotheses for further research and investigation. There are 46 tables in Principal Indicators. Twelve of these tables compare performance across all three longitudinal studies cohorts; 9 are confined to comparisons between the HS&B/ Sophomore cohort and the NELS:88/2000; and 25 are derived wholly from NELS:88/2000. The nature of transcript-based data sets is such that for estimates involving an event with a unique date, for example, the award of a bachelor's degree, the records for all three longitudinal studies can be truncated at a specific moment in time. The time period chosen in those cases is that of the shortest of the longitudinal studies, NELS:88/2000, which extended for 8.5 years beyond the modal high school graduation date of June 1992. For other estimates involving processes that have no clearly identifiable dates, the entire cohort history is used. For example, in presenting the phenomenon of transfer from a community college to a 4-year college, it is impossible to determine precisely when the transfer took place if the student is engaged in xviii alternating enrollment between the two types of institutions. The transcripts do not tell us when the 4-year college formally recognized the transfer. The estimate is thus of the status of the student at the end of the cohort history. This elasticity of the outermost date is used even though 97.6 percent of the undergraduate course-taking activity in the NLS:72 (a 12-year history) and 96.3 percent of the undergraduate course-taking activity for the HS&B/Sophomore cohort (an 11-year history) took place within the first 8.5 years following the modal high school graduation dates for those cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Organization of The Report", "text": "The order of presentation within Principal Indicators is based primarily on the prominence and frequency of the questions in contemporary policy discussions of postsecondary education (exclusive of financial aid). After an introduction that focuses on the mobility of contemporary traditional-age undergraduates, the presentation turns first to the bottom line of degree completion, then follows the story line from access through types of participation, alternative ways of looking at student histories, attendance patterns, majors and curriculum participation, and grades. The presentation concludes with a section on remediation. Remediation is last, not because it is less important, rather because it is a different type of topic that deserves special treatment. Principal Indicators does not cover all potential topics or configurations of the data that can be drawn from the three longitudinal studies. Its companion volume-The Empirical Curriculum: Changes in Postsecondary Course-Taking, 1972-provides much greater detail on the content of postsecondary education, at least in terms of the curriculum as experienced by students (as opposed to the curriculum set forth in college catalogs)."}, {"section_title": "Reading Guide and Technical Keys to Judgment in Principal Indicators", "text": "The data are presented with Taylor-series standard errors produced by AM, a software program developed by Jon Cohen and colleagues at the American Institutes for Research.

The terms, as defined below, are used throughout this document. The most important of these are # True first institution of attendance. The \"true\" first institution of attendance excludes (1) colleges and community colleges in which the student was enrolled prior to high school graduation; (2) institutions in which the student was enrolled during the summer immediately following high school graduation and prior to fall term postsecondary entry (unless the institution was the same in both periods); and (3) \"false starts,\" that is, cases in which the student enrolled, but then withdrew during the first term of attendance, only to enroll and complete course work in a different institution at a later point in time (in these cases, the second institution is the \"true first institution\").

True first institution/date and first institution/date are used interchangeably throughout this document. # Likely postsecondary participants. The universe of likely postsecondary participants in the NELS:88/2000 transcript-based files consists of (1) all students for whom at least one in-scope transcript was received (weighted N=1.95m) plus (2) students for whom transcripts were requested but not received (weighted N=115k), yet who met one of the following criteria (in order of selection): (1) loan disbursement records were found in the National Student Direct Loan System (NSDLS) files; (2) in 1994, the student provided an account of the methods used to finance postsecondary education in combination with identifying institutions attended; (3) the student's high school record was equal to or higher than the mean for known 4-year college attendees in class rank/grade point average, academic curriculum intensity, number of Advanced Placement courses, and combined SAT/ACT test scores; (4) the student's account of his/her postsecondary history in 2000 included multi-institutional attendance, simultaneous enrollment, enrollment in 2000, and credential earned; (5) the student's 2000 account of his/her postsecondary history included change of major, full-time/part-time status, and stop-out periods; and, (6) in 2000, the student provided academic, financial, family, or job-related reasons for leaving postsecondary education without earning a credential."}, {"section_title": "[THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK] Part 1: Background", "text": "Principal Indicators is primarily a reference work. Like its companion, The Empirical Curriculum: Changes in Postsecondary Course-Taking, 1972, it is designed for use by \u2022 higher education administrators, faculty, and institutional research officers; \u2022 state higher education offices; \u2022 national organizations concerned with education and training after high school; \u2022 researchers who focus on postsecondary education issues; and \u2022 human resource development personnel concerned with the quality of the workforce. These two documents, and the Web-posted taxonomy of postsecondary courses that accompanies them, are successors to The New College Course Map and Transcript Files (U.S. Department of Education, 1995;2nd edition, 1999), known as the CCM. The data for Principal Indicators are derived mostly from the postsecondary transcript files of three overlapping grade-cohort longitudinal studies designed and conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. The three studies are called \"grade cohort\" studies because each of them began with a nationally representative sample of students in a specific school grade, and followed the same students through high school and into early adulthood. The three studies are: \u2022 National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72), which began with a sample of 22,500 12th graders, and followed subpanels of this cohort for 14 years until 1986, when they were 32 or 33 years old. Hereafter, this cohort will be referred to as the \"Class of 1972\" or \"1972 12th graders.\" \u2022 High School & Beyond/Sophomore Cohort (HS&B/So), which began with a sample of over 30,000 10th graders in 1980, and followed subpanels of this cohort for 12 years until 1992, when they were 28 or 29 years old. Hereafter, this cohort will be referred to as the \"Class of 1982\" or \"1982 12th graders,\" the year they were scheduled to graduate from high school. \u2022 National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988(NELS:88/2000, which began with a sample of 25,000 8th graders in 1988, and followed subpanels of this cohort for 12 years until 2000, when they were 26 or 27 years old. Hereafter, this cohort will be referred to as the \"Class of 1992,\" or \"1992 12th graders,\" the year they were scheduled to graduate from high school. The characteristics of each of these longitudinal studies are described in appendix A. Most important to this document is the fact that all three studies included the collection, coding, and analysis of the postsecondary transcripts of students who reported that they had attended colleges, community colleges, and postsecondary trade schools, as follows: \u2022 For the Class of 1972, the transcripts were collected in 1984, when the students were 30 or 31 years old. \u2022 For the Class of 1982, the transcripts were collected in 1993, when the students were 29 or 30 years old. \u2022 For the Class of 1992, the transcripts were collected in 2000, when the students were 26 or 27 years old. Given these different transcript collection dates, and the ages of the students at the time of collection, it appears that the longer the history, the greater the opportunity for students to enter, participate, and complete credentials in postsecondary education. Some of the tables presented in Part 2 of this report compare the data from all three cohorts without adjustments. Other tables require a common censoring point for accurate comparison-for example, on the time it took to earn degrees. When a common time frame is required, the shortest of the postsecondary periods in the longitudinal studies, that of the Class of 1992 (8.5 years after the modal high school graduation date) is used. In addition, all three data sets include high school records (for the Classes of 1982 and 1992, these records are in the form of high school transcript files) and test scores (SAT, ACT, AP, and a special general learned abilities test that was administered to each cohort). In sum, in addition to survey data, each of these data sets includes a considerable amount of \"unobtrusive evidence\" (Webb et al. 1966) that enables the analyst to construct complex educational histories."}, {"section_title": "Primary Focus of This Presentation: The High School Class of 1992 (NELS:88/2000)", "text": "While all three age-cohort longitudinal studies are used in the presentation of data in Principal Indicators, the principal focus of the tables and storylines that follow is on the High School Class of 1992. It is the most recent of the data sets, and its information hence comes closest to shedding light on key topics of current concern in higher education. These topics include timeto-degree, multi-institutional attendance, the extent of participation in postsecondary education by different populations, and potential measures of institutional and system accountability. While the postsecondary transcript files in all three longitudinal studies were edited by the same individual and reviewed by external faculty and administrative panels following the same procedures and rules, and while the variable definitions and coding systems were held constant, the Class of 1992 data files were constructed in a way that yielded a wider range of information than that found in its two predecessors. The Class of 1972 (NLS:72) and Class of 1982 (HS&B/Sophomore Cohort) postsecondary transcript files were first built by contractors who then presented electronic files for editing and recoding. For the Class of 1992 (NELS:88/2000), the contractor (Research Triangle Institute) was responsible for the complex process of gathering the transcripts from institutional registrars (see , but the process of data entry was combined with editorial review and monitored at a secure site by U.S. Department of Education staff. The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers in Washington, DC, was the host organization for the data entry phase. This was a significant change for two reasons: First, with paper records in hand, and the host organization representing America's registrars, problems of interpretation could be referred instantly to those local officials responsible for the preparation and maintenance of student records. Ambiguities concerning degree awards and transfer data, for example, were resolved quickly and authoritatively. Second, the paper records include information on such items as the location of the student's high school, high school graduation date and diploma type, and, sometimes, precollege test scores-such as those of the SAT and ACT-that can be compared with the extant electronic record. In the case of the Class of 1992 (NELS:88/2000), the electronic records concerning secondary school education were created in 1992. The postsecondary transcripts collected in 2000 enabled the data entry process to fill in cases of missing information such as high school locations, graduation dates, SAT and ACT scores, and cases in which SAT Verbal and Math scores had been inverted or ACT sub-test scores had been entered in the wrong order in the previous NELS:88/2000 electronic files. In sum, the presence of the paper copies of transcripts in a combined data entry/editorial process for the Class of 1992 allowed for a more accurate and detailed account of postsecondary (and secondary school) histories than those of its two predecessors. A technical account of decision rules and other key features of the preparation of the transcript files is presented in appendix B."}, {"section_title": "Representativeness, Geographical Distribution, and Demography of the NELS Postsecondary Cohort", "text": "There are three sources of large-scale national cohorts for the study of postsecondary education experience. Two of these present event cohorts, with the event defined as entering postsecondary education for the first time: (1) the Cooperative Institutional Research Project's (CIRP) annual (since 1966) survey of entering freshmen, and the occasional longitudinal study that is spun from that survey (see, e.g., Astin, Tsui, and Avalos 1996); and (2) the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) studies, a subset of the congressionally mandated National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which has seen two longitudinal iterations: a 5-year study (1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994) and a 6-year study (1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001). The universe for the CIRP surveys is determined by the voluntary participation of institutions, subsequently weighted to yield national norms (see, e.g., Sax, Astin, Korn, and Mahoney 1995). The universe for the BPS longitudinal studies is determined by the representative national sampling framework of postsecondary students, undergraduate and graduate, enrolled in institutions participating in Title IV federal financial aid programs (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). While not invoked in this document, the CIRP and BPS are cited so that the reader sees the difference between \"event cohort\" histories and the \"grade cohort\" histories used here. While CIRP and BPS have many virtues, neither one can provide data on access to postsecondary education or linkages between postsecondary performance and detailed, documented precollege student background, and neither one is grounded in transcript data. The third source for the analysis of postsecondary experience lies in the grade-cohort longitudinal studies such as the NELS:88/2000. These studies are not designed to yield representative samples of first-time college freshmen or undergraduates in general. The 1 Unlike its predecessors, the NELS:88/2000 longitudinal study sample was \"refreshed\" in 1990 (10th grade) and 1992 (12th grade) so as to be representative of the in-school population in those years. These refreshings resulted in complex panel weights. In addition to matching the Class of 1972 and 1982 frames, panel weights based on the 1992 sampling frame were chosen for Principal Indicators because 1992 was also the year in which high school transcripts were gathered, and a number of the tables link data based on high school transcripts to postsecondary access, attendance patterns, and attainment. 2 Some of the students classified as \"early graduates,\" transfers, and dropouts actually received on-time (1982) diplomas."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "NELS:88/2000 sample used in Principal Indicators consists of a cohort originally formed in the 8 th grade in 1988 and refreshed in 1992 so as to be representative of 12th graders in 1992. The weights used in Principal Indicators combine that sampling frame with postsecondary status 1 But just how representative is the cohort when set against national data on first-time freshmen? Table 1.1 sets forth some basic data from which to judge this issue.  Snyder. T., Digest of Education Statistics, 2001, table 182 (p. 217). For the NELS:88/2000, the universe consists of 12th graders in 1992 for whom transcripts were received. Given these data, one can say only that, while accounting for nearly four out of five entering postsecondary students in their modal year of high school graduation and college entry, the 12th graders of the NELS:88/2000 are not a proxy group for entering postsecondary students. Nor were the 12th graders of the NLS-72 and High School & Beyond/Sophomores in their time. So what populations are represented in the presentation of the evidence in Principal Indicators? The answer to the question was determined by the oldest of these cohorts, the NLS-72, where a nationally representative sample of students was selected in the 12th grade. Most of them graduated from high school on time in the spring of 1972, but some did not. For the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, which was first sampled in the 10th grade, the 12th grade (1982) panel, limited to those who were in school in 1982 and those who received high school diplomas in 1982, 2 was selected to match the NLS-72. Again, most of these students graduated on time in 1982, but some did not. For the NELS:88/2000, the same procedure was followed, with the universe set to everyone who was in the 12th grade in1992 along with those who received regular high school diplomas in the spring of 1992. 3 So, in all three cases, the population represented consists of nationally representative samples of those who were scheduled to be 12th graders in the year they were surveyed (see appendix C for a technical account of the weights and flags used to ensure that the data reflect these populations). The first illustration of the precollegiate sampling frame in relation to matriculation behavior lies in the changing demographics and geography of postsecondary education. Table 1.2 presents the distribution of postsecondary participants in two of the longitudinal studies, the Class of 1982Class of (1982Class of -1993 and the Class of 1992Class of (1992Class of -2000, according to the Census Division 4 location of the students' high schools, by race/ethnicity and second language background. 5 In looking across the changes in the composition of these cohorts by Census Division, the reader will note \u2022 when one combines the 5 Census Divisions of the West and South, an increasing share of students (from 48 percent to 55 percent), 6 parallel to general population trends (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1984; U.S. Bureau of the Census 1993); \u2022 statistically significant increases in the proportion of students from second language backgrounds in New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, the West South Central states, and the Pacific states; \u2022 statistically significant increases in overall minority participation from high schools in New England and the Pacific states; \u2022 the higher proportion of African-Americans among postsecondary participants who graduated from high schools in the South Atlantic and East South Central states compared to the proportion of African-Americans among postsecondary 7 While not included in this definition (or in the tables), it is worth noting that, of all students who earned more than 10 postsecondary credits, 11 percent of Asian students (s.e.=2.54) and 15 percent of Latino students (s.e.=2.07) earned credits for \"heritage\" language study in higher education. Among those who earned bachelor's degrees, 18 percent of Asian students (s.e.=4.02) and 23 percent of Latino students (s.e.=3.18) earned postsecondary credits for \"heritage\" language study. The difference between Asian and Latino students at the bachelor's level is not statistically significant. "}, {"section_title": "Second Language Populations in the Postsecondary System", "text": "The reader of table 1.2 may be struck by the statistically significant increases in the participation of students from second language backgrounds in four of the nine Census Divisions (New England, Mid-Atlantic, West South Central, and Pacific). Some of those increases are rather substantial. This observation calls for a closer look at overall change in the demography of language over the histories of the two cohorts, as displayed in tables 1.3 and 1.4. In table 1.3, one notes the increase in the proportion of Latino postsecondary participants who met the criteria for second language dominance used for analyses of the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992 (student identified a language other than English as the first language they learned, and the dominant language of their households, indicated that they conversed with their mothers frequently in a language other than English, or presented high school and/or college transcripts with ESL coursework or coursework labeled \"X [a language other than English] for Native Speakers\"). Also notable is that there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of Asian and Latino students from second language backgrounds in the Class of 1992, and that roughly one out of six American Indian postsecondary students came from a second language background in both the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992. The other distinctive feature of table 1.3 is the comparative concentration of students from second language backgrounds within the lowest SES quintile. 8 Table 1.4 is included simply to demonstrate that, among students from second language backgrounds, there is no difference in the percent for whom the \"true\" first postsecondary institution of attendance is a 4-year college versus a community college, whereas for native speakers of English, there has been a consistent and statistically significant spread between the percent starting in a 4-year college and the percent first entering a community college. Reminder: The \"true\" first institution of attendance excludes (1) colleges and community colleges in which the student was enrolled prior to high school graduation; (2) institutions in which the student was enrolled during the summer immediately following high school graduation and before fall term postsecondary entry (unless the institution was the same in both periods); and (3) \"false starts,\" that is, cases in which the student enrolled but then withdrew during the first term of attendance, only to enroll and complete coursework in a different institution at a later point in time (in these cases, the second institution is the true first institution). This definition of true first institution of attendance is used throughout this document. "}, {"section_title": "Geographic Mobility of the High School Class of 1992", "text": "Unlike its predecessors, the history of the Class of 1992 allows the analyst to track the geographic mobility of the student population, principally with reference to the state locations of schools attended, and at four points in time: (1) high school; (2) true first postsecondary institution attended; (3) postsecondary institution awarding the student's highest undergraduate degree; and (4) the student's final interview in 2000. This feature of the data set is helpful in determining the permeability of state borders, and provides a background national tapestry against which those responsible for state postsecondary planning can assess the likelihood of students moving across state lines after initial entry in higher education, as well as estimating the likelihood that students will remain within state after earning credentials.  Table 1.5 presents the distribution of student mobility using three reference points: the state of the student's high school, the state of the student's true first institution of attendance, and the state in which the student was living at the time of his or her computer-assisted telephone interview in 2000. The reader will note that \u2022 roughly two out of three students resided in the same state at all three reference points; \u2022 the more selective the true first institution of attendance, the more likely students were to cross state lines at some moment in their education and residence history to age 26 or 27; \u2022 Latinos were the least likely of the major race/ethnicity groups to cross state lines in their education and residence history to age 26 or 27; \u2022 those who earn bachelor's degrees or higher were more likely to cross state lines at some moment in their education and residence history to age 26 or 27; and \u2022 roughly 1 out of 10 students initially went out-of-state for postsecondary education but returned to the state of his or her high school by age 26 or 27. Tables 1.6 and 1.7 focus on the inter-state and inter-institutional mobility of bachelor's degree recipients of the Class of 1992. These have become increasingly important dimensions of student behavior that shed light on institutional accountability policies. Students may leave institution A and cross state lines to enroll in institution B for reasons ranging from the search for the right academic program to health considerations; however, institution A is held accountable for the fact that the student left, and, it is assumed, is a college dropout. Institutions and states currently do not have the capacity to track students across state lines and discover, for example, that the students completed degrees at institution B. But the transcript files of the national grade-cohort longitudinal studies can do just that, and thus encourage the development of tracking systems for accountability purposes. Table 1.6 asks where the student began postsecondary education and where the bachelor's degree was awarded and how many institutions were involved between those two markers. The most basic conclusions of table 1.6 are: \u2022 Of all bachelor's degree recipients (including those who began their postsecondary careers in community colleges) or only those who first entered a bachelor's degree-granting institution, roughly 1 out of 10 earned their degree from an institution located in a state other than the state in which they started out in postsecondary education. \u2022 For those who began in 4-year colleges and earned bachelor's degrees, one out of five earned the degree from an institution other than their first institution. As a guide to reading table 1.6, two examples might help: (1) of all bachelor's degree recipients who attended two institutions (37 percent of all bachelor's degree recipients), nearly half (46 percent) earned their degree from an institution other than the one in which they started out, and 12 percent crossed state lines in the process; and (2) of all bachelor's degree recipients who started in 4-year colleges and attended three of more schools (19 percent), 28 percent earned the degree in a state other than the state in which they began their postsecondary studies. How much of a change does the history of the Class of 1992 against its predecessors in these matters suggest? While the geography is difficult to extract from the earlier data sets, the data on numbers of institutions and differences between first and last institution of attendance are easier to elicit. So, for example, of bachelor's degree recipients in the Class of 1972 who attended two institutions (38.2 percent of all bachelor's degree recipients in that cohort), 33.1 percent (s.e.=1.51) earned their degree from an institution other than the one in which they started out (data not in table). When compared with the 46.4 percent rate (s.e.=2.04) of the Class of 1992 two decades later, it appears that there has been a measurable increase in this type of mobility. When questions are asked about institutional graduation rates, these data might be kept in mind. Not applicable. NOTES: (1) 12th graders in 1992 who earned bachelor's degrees and for whom the true first institution of attendance could be determined (Weighted N = 923); 1992 12th graders who earned bachelor's degrees and whose first institution of attendance was a 4-year college (Weighted N = 768k). (2) The \"Percent of Total\" columns for each universe may not sum to 100.0 percent because of rounding.  Table 1.7 responds to a question asked by those interested in state investments in postsecondary education in relation to state economic development: What proportion of those who earn their bachelor's degree in a state stay on in that state after graduation? In the Class of 1992, 62 percent of bachelor's degree recipients remained in state, but there are a few significant departures from this marker that are worth noting:"}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "Majors in Education are more likely than majors in other fields to stay in the state in which they earned their bachelor's degree, most likely because their major program resulted in certification in that state. \u2022 Students receiving their bachelor's degrees from comprehensive colleges (Carnegie Classes 21 and 22) are more likely to remain in the state in which they earned their bachelor's degree than students receiving their degrees from other classes of 4-year institutions. \u2022 The more selective the institution from which the bachelor's degree was earned the less likely the student was to stay in the state in which that institution was located. \u2022 Students who attended school in more than one state as undergraduates are more likely to move to another state after receiving the bachelor's degree. For those who ask what proportion of students leave their home states for college but return after their postsecondary experience (whether or not they earned degrees), table 1.5 shows that 10 percent of the Class of 1992 did just that (the state of residence was the same for high school and the NELS:88/2000 interview in 2000, but not the same for the first institution attended). In this section, the reader will find transcript-based national time-series data on educational attainment after high school for traditional-age students, reflecting the current status of NCES databases, and covering three longitudinal studies cohorts from 1972 to 2000. We start with degree completion and time-to-degree because these have become increasingly important accountability policy issues nationally and in state legislatures, then turn to access and different degrees of participation. In recent years, the two most often asked questions about U.S. higher education have become: \u2022 What percentage of people who go to college earn a bachelor's degree? and \u2022 How long does it take them to earn it? The virtue of national transcript-based longitudinal studies is that they can answer these questions with powerful empirical evidence. Students change schools (McCormick 1997;Adelman 1999b;Horn and Kojaku 2001) and students often cross state lines when they change schools (as documented in table 1.5). Students move in and out of higher education over a long period of time (Horn 1998). What we now call \"noncontinuous enrollment\" appears to be commonplace (Hearn 1992). By following the student in space and time, the national transcript studies enable us to provide systemwide completion rates in response to the two questions-that is, the transcript studies allow us to describe what happened to students anywhere, and not just at the first postsecondary institution they attended. The three cohort samples are different in some important respects, which may account for some of the changes indicated in the tables in this section. The most basic difference is that the sampling of the high school class of 1972 took place in the spring semester of its senior year, whereas those for the high school classes of 1982 and 1992 took place at earlier points (10th grade and 8th grade, respectively). Even though the analyses in Principal Indicators are limited to 12th graders in the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, some of those students did not finish high school (though they may have earned equivalency diplomas) yet years later took courses at trade schools or community colleges. While this document does not analyze these relationships, one can hypothesize that the majority of those who do not complete high school do not possess the same academic resources or attitudes toward persistence as those who do. Taken as whole groups, one would expect students of the high school Classes of 1972 and 1982 who entered postsecondary education to be more successful in terms of degree completion and academic performance than their counterparts from the Class of 1992 because the concluding date of the longitudinal study gave them more time to complete. However, as tables 2.1 and 2.2 demonstrate, these expectations are not necessarily accurate. For purposes of this document, the universes of comparison are confined to those who earned more than 10 semester credits in postsecondary education over the period of their respective histories. This strategy enables one to exclude incidental students (those who earned 10 or fewer credits) from the analysis, and has been followed elsewhere in the literature (e.g., McCormick 1999) and in state systems analyses (e.g., Steppanen 2000). In all three transcript samples, there are hundreds of students (representing tens of thousands) whose records consist either of nothing but withdrawals, incompletes, and failures or who take two or three courses and then disappear from education-at least through the censoring dates of the study (see table 3.2 for a portrait of incidental students in the Class of 1992). Given the threshold criterion of earning more than 10 credits, here is what we see in response to the two basic questions most often asked about higher education: The 8.5-year bachelor's degree attainment rate for the Class of 1992 is not significantly different from that for the 12-year rate for the Class of 1972, no matter which universe is used, leading to the hypothesis that the system is doing better in degree completion than was the case a quarter century ago. These data also offer a general conclusion about national graduation rates: roughly 2 out of 3 traditional-age students who earned more than10 credits and attended a bachelor's degree-granting institution also earned a bachelor's degree by their mid-to-late twenties. Capping the history of all three cohorts at the Class of 1992 time span of 8.5 years from the modal high school graduation date, time-to-degree for traditional-age students has risen slightly over the period covered by the cohort histories. In terms of more common metrics for understanding time-to-degree, a calendar year is the equivalent of a 9-month academic year (September through May) plus 3 months or 0.25 of a year, hence 4.5 calendar years (the average time-to-degree for the high school classes of 1982 and 1992) is the equivalent of 4.75 academic years. Among the highlights of tables 2.1 through 2.3 that invite further investigation in light of the data to be presented in Parts 3 and 4 of this document are the following: \u2022 The rate and direction of change in attainment of at least a bachelor's degree for African-Americans. The rate declined notably between the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1982, then rebounded considerably in the Class of 1992 (tables 2.1 and 2.2). \u2022 Among students who earned any credits from 4-year colleges, the relative decline in the rate of men's attainment of at least a bachelor's degree versus that for women between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992 (table 2.2).\nThe increase in the proportion of students engaging in post-baccalaureate work in the Class of 1992 cohort, particularly as they had less time to enter graduate school than did students in the other two cohorts. 9 Other data sources, particularly the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) surveys, strongly suggest that the increase in post-baccalaureate enrollments is weighted toward a population over the age of 30 (Korb, Schantz, and Zimbler 1989;Choy and Moskovitz 1998). \u2022 The rise in mean credits earned by bachelor's degree recipients as parallel to the increase in time-to-degree (see California Postsecondary Education Planning Commission 1988). The match is not exact. For example, between the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1992 cohorts there was a 6.4 percent increase in mean credits earned and a 5 percent increase in time-to-degree (with an effect size of 1.12, indicating a modestly positive relationship). However, this is an imperfect measure, and analysts are encouraged to engage in multivariate analyses of the factors associated with time-to-degree (table 2.3). The last observation draws attention to the reason that table 2.3 includes Standard Deviations rather than standard errors (see appendix D for the standard errors for table 2.3). The Standard Deviation allows one to estimate whether students are behaving more alike (the Standard Deviation will contract over time) or less alike (the Standard Deviation will expand over time), though the judgment requires a test of effect size. So, for example, as the average number of credits earned by engineering graduates increased from 137.1 for the Class of 1972 to 150.6 for the Class of 1992, the Standard Deviation declined from 23.2 to18.4. The t-test using the standard errors tells us that this change in the average number of credits earned is significant. At the same time, the test for the change in Standard Deviation tells us that engineering graduates in the Class of 1992 are more alike in terms of the number of credits they earned than those students who graduated 20 years earlier (the effect size is 1.21, a positive relationship). This observation can lead to hypotheses about the effect of changes in accreditation requirements for engineering programs promulgated by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in 1991 (ABET 1992).     1Universe consists of all 12th graders who earned bachelor's degrees within 8.5 years of high school graduation, and for whom time-to-degree could be computed. Weighted Ns: Class of 1972 = 672k, Class of 1982 = 758k, Class of 1992 = 923k. (2) Time-to-degree in elapsed calendar years. (3) SD = standard deviation, means that 68 percent of the cases will fall + the amount indicated from the mean. 3 \nThe proportion of those who never entered postsecondary education drops from 27.6 percent to 17.2 percent, and with an even steeper decline for Latinos (from 36.8 percent to 19.4 percent).\nThe most notable increase in completion is at the level of bachelor's and higher. While not directly in the tables, these figures are 28.6 percent for all 1992 survey participants (s.e.= 0.88) and 35.2 percent for all 1992 survey participants who earned a standard high school diploma by July of 1993 (s.e.= 0.96). Table 2.8 serves to unmask divergences in both postsecondary participation and degree completion by socioeconomic status quintile that are greater (between the highest and lowest quintiles) than the greatest differences by race/ethnicity (with the exception of participation rates for Asian-Americans versus American Indians) observable in table 2.7. Table 2.8 suggests that in multivariate analyses of postsecondary attainment, socioeconomic status is likely to play a significant role as an independent variable. 11 The academic intensity and quality of students' high school curriculum was developed from the NELS:88/2000 high school transcript records using the same cascading approach originally developed for the High School & Beyond/So cohort, and found in Answers in the Tool Box: Academic Intensity, Attendance Patterns, and Bachelor's Degree Completion (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1999). The cascade yielded 32 levels of intensity/quality, and the distribution of students across those levels was then set in quintiles. The variables on each level include: highest level of mathematics completed in high school, total Carnegie units in mathematics, core laboratory science (biology, chemistry, physics), foreign languages, English, social sciences (including history), computer science, number of Advanced Placement courses, and number of remedial courses in English and mathematics. At the highest of the 32 levels, the student has more than 1 Advanced Placement course, math at trigonometry, precalculus or calculus, more than 3.75 Carnegie units each of English and mathematics, more than 2 Carnegie units of core laboratory science, foreign language, and social sciences, any units of computer science, and no remedial courses (reading, English, or mathematics). Table 2.9 introduces high school background variables that, at first glance, may also play significant roles in multivariate analyses of postsecondary attendance and attainment (Cabrera and La Nasa 2001;Adelman 1999b;Alexander, Holupka, and Pallas 1987). Students in the top two quintiles of academic high school curriculum intensity 11 have much higher rates of postsecondary participation and degree completion than students in the other quintiles, a phenomenon that is mirrored in the distribution of students by quintile of high school class rank/GPA. 12 Yet the internal variations in the two distributions suggest that their relative power in multivariate analyses may prove to be slightly different. For example, students in the lowest two quintiles of academic curriculum intensity were less likely to enter postsecondary education at all than were those students in the lowest two quintiles of the class rank/GPA measure. Only a multivariate analysis can sort out the effects of such cross currents and help researchers determine the comparative strength of precollegiate factors in explaining educational attainment.    1The universe consists of all 1992 survey participants who were in the 2000 follow-up of the NELS:88/2000 cohort who earned a standard high school diploma within 1 year (and 1 month, to account for delayed awards) following the modal date of cohort high school graduation. Weighted N = 2.547M. 2 13 The \"educational anticipations\" variable was constructed from student responses to questions asked in 1990 and 1992 about the highest level of education they expected to attain and their planned timing of entry into postsecondary education, and a question asked in1992 about the type of institution the student intended to enter first. A student with a consistent anticipation of earning a bachelor's degree or higher answered the basic pair of questions in 1990 and 1992 by citing expectations of bachelor's or higher and immediate entry to higher education after high school. The 1992 question about type of first institution was used to adjust missing or contradictory responses. An algorithm involving other combinations of responses to the two basic questions produced the remaining values of the variable (see the Glossary for complete description).\nThe 60+ population presents a weaker academic performance record starting with the academic intensity of its high school curriculum, 14 and continuing with a significant percentage (42) of its members earning 20 or fewer credits during their first calendar year of attendance (versus 15 percent of those who earned degrees).\nThe gap between noncompleters and completers in the proportion who were continuously enrolled is also notable, as is the proportion of noncompleters who withdrew from more than 12 credits of academic work (38 percent vs. 11 percent of completers). Low credit production in the first year of enrollment, noncontinuous enrollment, and a notable use of nonpenalty course withdrawals, one hypothesizes, slow progress toward any degree. But, as table 3.3 reveals, over one-third of the long-term noncompleters were persisting in the final year (2000) of the Class of 1992 history. Notably, 26 percent of the 60+ group was enrolled in candidacy for the bachelor's degree, and 4.3 percent (about a fifth of this group) were judged likely to earn the bachelor's within the following year. To meet the threshold criteria for the variable \"BALIKELY\" (likely bachelor's degree by December 2001) students were enrolled in 2000 with more than 90 earned credits, carried a GPA of 2.75 or higher, and had a major indicated on their current transcript. Telephone calls to registrars in the course of data file construction confirmed that some of these students had, in fact, earned degrees in 2001, but they could not be credited with the degree in the Class of 1992 files because the date of award fell after the closing date of the study. In addition, 6 percent of the 60+ group had already met the criteria for an associate's degree: (1) earned more than 65 credits from a community college, (2) earned credits in English composition, (3) earned credits in at least college-level mathematics and each of the major disciplinary areas (humanities/arts, social sciences, and sciences) or presented an occupationally oriented program with more than 20 credits in an occupational field such as allied health sciences/services, and (4) held a GPA of 2.50 or higher. This phenomenon of the associate's degree eligible (but no degree) student was developed and refined in light of presentations by and discussions with community college administrators (Garber 2002). Their explanations of how this phenomenon arises (some students are not aware that they qualified for the degree or had not filed the appropriate paper work; others have qualified academically but have not met local physical education requirements or have unfulfilled financial obligations to the school; and still others are more interested in transferring than earning the associate's credential) cannot be tested with the NELS:88/2000 data.  One of the most significant contrasts between the 60+ group and those who earned associate's or bachelor's degrees lies in noncontinuous enrollment, commonly termed \"stop-out.\" Not every departure from higher education is permanent (Horn 1998), but continuous enrollment -even for minimal amounts of earned credit -is strongly associated with degree completion (Adelman 1999b). Longitudinal studies that continue as long as that of the Class of 1992 (8.5 years from the modal year of postsecondary entry, 1992), the Class of 1982 (11 years), and the Class of 1972 (12 years), require greater latitude in the definition of stop-out than do shorter term studies (e.g., the 5-year Beginning Postsecondary Students study of 1989-1994 (BPS:90/94). For all three grade-cohort longitudinal studies, the threshold of noncontinuous enrollment was more than one semester (or two quarters), excluding summer terms. And if a student stopped out for one semester (or two quarters) more than once, the student's enrollment was considered noncontinuous. In examining the Class of 1992 transcripts, a different type of noncontinuous enrollment pattern was noted: from the term of first attendance, the student was continuously enrolled for at least three full academic years before the first stop-out period occurred. One out of eight of the 60+ students evidence this timing of stop-out, and, as event-history analyses of the longitudinal studies point out, timing may override other factors in explaining degree completion (DesJardins, McCall, Ahlburg, and Moye 2002).\nan increase in the proportion of these students who attended a 4-year college (from 29 to 37 percent); \u2022 an increase in the proportion of these students who transferred to a 4-year college (from 21 to 27 percent); and \u2022 no significant change in the combined associate's degree/bachelor's degree attainment rate (32 percent). For the second universe of analysis, the first step in the classic transfer process is required: starting in a community college and earning more than 10 credits from the community college. For this group, there was \u2022 an increase between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992 in the proportion of students who attended a 4-year college (from 35 to 44 percent; and from 32 to 44 percent from the Class of 1972 to the Class of 1992); \u2022 no significant change in the combined associate's degree/bachelor's degree attainment rate (41-43 percent); and \u2022 a transfer rate increasing from 28 percent (Class of 1972) and 27 percent (Class of 1982) to 36 percent for the Class of 1992. This figure is somewhat higher than other national estimates, but those other estimates include all students who start in community colleges, not just traditional-age 12th graders (see Cohen 1993). It is the derivative of the second analysis, though, that is critical to the authority of the transfer indicator. That derivative is the bachelor's degree completion rate of traditional-age \"classic transfer\" students. For the classes of 1972 and 1982, both 11-12 year studies, the rate was 72 percent. For the Class of 1992, with an 8.5 year time frame, the rate was 62 percent. These rates compare favorably with those of the overall nonincidental postsecondary populations in all three cohorts (see table 2.1) and the population of students who earned any credits from 4-year colleges in the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1982 (see table 2.2). For the Class of 1992, there was no significant difference between the bachelor's degree attainment rate of community college transfer students and that of all students who earned any credits from 4-year colleges (see table 2.2). \nAfrican-American students who began their college careers at an HBCU were more likely than other African-American college students to start higher education in a state other than the one in which they attended high school, a fact that testifies to the national stature of the HBCUs among African-Americans and their concentration in the South Atlantic, Southeast Central, and Southwest Central states. Table 4.6 takes the full universe of Latino students and divides them by attendance pattern with reference to enrollment in HSIs (48 percent of Latino students in the Class of 1992 attended an HSI at some time, 64 percent of this group attended a 2-year HSI). Table 4.6 shows \u2022 A 44 percent bachelor's degree completion rate among Latino students of the Class of 1992 who started at a 4-year HSI versus 58 percent completion rate for those who began their postsecondary careers at a non-HSI 4-year institution. This difference is not statistically significant. \u2022 A combined certificate/associate's degree attainment rate of 19 percent for those who started out in a 2-year HSI and 14 percent for those who first entered other non-HSI 2-year colleges. Given the role of 2-year institutions in Latino postsecondary histories (these two groups account for half the Latino postsecondary students in the Class of 1992), the combined certificate/associate's degree attainment rate is an important indicator for this population. \u2022 In terms of timing of postsecondary entry, Latino students who started out in 4year colleges, whether HSIs or other, were more likely to do so directly following high school graduation than those who attended 2-year and other sub-baccalaureate institutions of any kind. The attendance pattern described as \"other type but earned credits from an HSI\" is difficult to analyze in this context because it includes students who embarked on their postsecondary education in all types of institutions-4-year, 2-year, and other sub-baccalaureate. \nWhile there is no difference between highly selective and selective institutions in the number of credits earned outside the customary channels, there are measurable differences in the proportion of students earning acceleration credits between these two ranks of selectivity and all others. Since Advanced Placement coursework and test scores play a role in admission to highly selective and (most) selective institutions, the results are not surprising. \u2022 A higher proportion of students who ultimately earned graduate degrees also earned acceleration credits than students who earned less than a graduate degree. One out of four students who ultimately earned a graduate degree notched 9 or more credits by examination or dual-enrollment, 10 times the proportion of students who earned no degree. \u2022 For those who earned at least a bachelor's degree, the more credits earned by examination and in dual-enrollment status, the shorter the time-to-degree. For those with no acceleration credits, time-to-degree averaged 4.65 years elapsed calendar years; for those who earned 9 or more acceleration credits, time-to-degree averaged 4.25 years. Taken together, these observations suggest that a multivariate analysis of the determinants of time-to-degree, such as that carried out on the state level by the Florida Postsecondary Education Planning Commission (Goodman, Latham, Copa, and Wright 2001) would be a profitable research inquiry (also see California Postsecondary Education Commission 1988; Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board 1996). They also encourage research that would split out the dualenrollment portion of acceleration credits and determine whether the student was receiving both high school and college credit simultaneously or accumulating college credits outside the high school curriculum (Johnstone and del Genio 2001;Boswell 2001), and whether dual-enrollment prepares students for postsecondary coursework (Windham and Perkins 2001).  15 Change of major in the course of undergraduate education is another matter. For those in the Class of 1992 who earned bachelor's degrees, 40.5 percent (s.e.=1.20) changed major, and another 9.5 percent (s.e.=0.71) were either community college transfer students who earned an associate's degree in general studies and a bachelor's degree in a specific field or students who earned no degree with no identifiable major at a school they attended prior to the institution that awarded the bachelor's degree in a discrete field. These data are not in the tables, and are derived from both student responses to questions asked in the 2000 survey and transcript records. 16 For the Class of 1972, 355 6-digit codes drawn from the 1985 version of the Classification of Instructional Programs (Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics) were used to code majors. Given the raw size of the cohort, many of the codes used yielded fewer than five cases, well below acceptable levels for the reliable computation of standard errors of estimates. For the Class of 1982, a 3-digit coding scheme was adopted with 111 codes. This scheme was carried over to the Class of 1992, where 18 new codes were added on the basis of volume of degree majors listed on received transcripts.\nWithdrawals and repeats (table 6.6) are concentrated in remedial courses, mathematics, major lower-division distribution courses such as U.S. history surveys and general chemistry, and introductory-level courses in business and accounting. The same observations concerning remedial and mathematics courses held for the Class of 1982 (see Adelman 1999a, table 6.3, p. 202), despite a different methodology for generating the list (a different threshold of weighted cases was used).\nFailures and other penalty grades (table 6.7) are also concentrated in remedial courses, mathematics, introductory-level courses in business and accounting, and major lower-division distribution courses such as general psychology and introduction to fine arts. The parallel list for the Class of 1982(see Adelman 1999a) was more eclectic. \u2022 The list of courses with the highest proportion of grades that were \"A\" (table 6.8), like its predecessor for the Class of 1982 (see Adelman 1999a, table 6.5, p. 204), is dominated by teacher education and performing arts.  Only those courses with 150,000 or more weighted enrollments over the period, 1992-2000, were considered. Physical education and personal development courses are excluded on the grounds that they do not contribute to the assessment of academic performance.  \nIn both cohorts, over 60 percent of those whose first institution of attendance was a community college took at least one remedial course. For students first enrolling in 4-year colleges, there was a considerable decline in the proportion enrolling in remedial courses (from 44 to 25 percent).  Table 7.2 highlights some of the demographic and secondary school background characteristics of students across the remediation spectrum, and invites analysts to look more deeply at these and other associations through multivariate analyses. Among the observations attendant on table 7.2:\nFor both the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, students from urban high schools were more likely to be taking remedial courses in college than were students from suburban and rural high schools. \u2022 In both cohorts, students from the lowest SES quintile were more likely to be assigned to remedial work than students from the other quintiles, though this phenomenon is more pronounced for the Class of 1992 (in the 1992-2000 period) than for the Class of 1982 a decade earlier. \u2022 While there was a notable improvement for African-American students' remediation participation between the two cohorts (the proportion of those requiring no remedial work rose from 28 to 38 percent), both African-American and Latino students still lagged the other major race/ethnicity groups. \u2022 In a separate multivariate analysis invoking the three major measures of secondary school performance-academic curriculum intensity, class rank/GPA, and senior year test score-the senior year test score proved to have the strongest association with the need for remediation. This association is borne out in the Class of 1992 in the distribution of students across the remediation categories: for example, 4 out of 5 students in the lowest test score quintile took at least one remedial course, compared with less than 1 out of 10 from the highest test score quintile. For each of the remediation categories, table 7.3 provides a distribution of the students by highest degree earned, comparing the Class of 1982 to the Class of 1992. The reader will note that bachelor's degree completion rates for the Class of 1992 are lower than they are for the Class of 1982 at all levels of remediation except that of \"no remedial courses.\" But the surface data are somewhat deceiving, since the Class of 1982 cohort postsecondary transcript history is 11 years versus 8.5 years for the Class of 1992. There is no way to truncate the HS&B/So student-level data base to match the NELS:88/2000 in this regard because, at the student-level, there are no dates for terms in which individual courses were taken. Unlike other tables in Principal Indicators, all the remediation tables are based on the complete universes of known postsecondary participants, including incidental students. Among incidental students in the Class of 1992, 74 percent took at least one remedial course (Adelman, Daniel, and Berkovits 2003, table 16), well above the 42 percent for the entire cohort.  -80 th percentile 10.8 (1.45) 10.1 (1.10) 12.6 (1. "}, {"section_title": "Trends in Basic Access", "text": "The third most frequently asked question about postsecondary education in the United States concerns \"access,\" which, in its broadest interpretation, means the rate at which a given segment of the population enrolls in any accredited institution offering instruction to adults (other than those devoted solely to Adult Basic Education) and/or to high school graduates. The segment of the population to which access analyses have traditionally been applied consists of recent (within the previous year), traditional-age (within the Census Bureau's 16-24 year-old bracket) high school graduates, including GED recipients. These data have been provided annually by the American College Testing Service (ACT) since 1960. Table 2.4 looks across the three NCES longitudinal studies cohorts in terms of access rates, and compares those rates with the average of the rate reported by ACT during the life of each cohort. The ACT calculation is a snapshot of a single year, and includes people in the denominator (using the Census Bureau's 16-24 bracket) who did not complete all of their precollegiate education in the United States. The longitudinal studies, on the other hand, allow for members of a grade cohort to enroll in postsecondary education over a longer period of time-from 8.5 years for the Class of 1992 to 12 years for the Class of 1972, and confine the universe to U.S. high school students. Thus, the NCES cohort access rates will inevitably be higher than what ACT reports. In table 2.4, one can see an increasing access rate for the general traditional-age population, and with a particularly notable leap between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992. This increase was consistent for women across all three cohorts, but for men it was significant only between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992. By race/ethnicity, the increases for Whites were significant across all three cohorts. For African-Americans and Latinos, the increases were significant-and substantial-only between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992. In fact, considering access rates within the Class of 1992, there is no difference between Whites and African-Americans. There is also no difference between the access rates of Latinos and American Indians. Differences between all other combinations of race/ethnicity groups are significant. In contrast to the portrait of access of 12 th graders by race/ethnicity, table 2.4 reveals a consistent spread of 40 or more percentage points in access rates between students from the highest and lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles in all three cohorts. Within SES quintiles, all increases in access across the cohorts are significant except that from the Class of 1972 to the Class of 1982 for the highest quintile. "}, {"section_title": "What the Class of 1992 Tells Us About Participation", "text": "Beneath the surface data on access and degree attainment lies a mass of information from the transcript studies that can help us understand better not only who participates in postsecondary education but how and what it might mean when people respond to surveys and indicate that they \"went to college.\" This is an important issue, for example, in interpreting the Census data used by ACT in reporting college access rates (see table 2.4). Table 2.5 presents a \"Macro History\" of all 12 th graders in the Class of 1992 cohort who reported attending a postsecondary institution by the time of their final interview in the Spring of 2000, and sets out a scheme that divides the quality of evidence in support of the students' claim in two bins: \"weak\" evidence of true participation and \"adequate evidence\" of true participation. For nearly 1 out of 12 students who claimed to have entered postsecondary education, the evidence in support of the claim was not adequate. Transcripts were requested for all students who claimed to have attended postsecondary institutions, and were received for roughly 90 percent of them. But some of the received transcripts said simply that the student enrolled in a school yet never registered for courses; other transcripts indicated that the students attended one school and took one course or were enrolled only in continuing education courses such as parenting or Emergency Medical Training. Still others assembled records that consisted of nothing but GED-level and remedial work that did not carry credit toward a credential. Finally, there is a group that earned no credits of any kind in their postsecondary histories. One can argue that these students had \"access,\" but did they truly participate in postsecondary education? If participation means earning at least some credits (or credit-equivalents) that count toward credentials, none of the cases cited yields evidence of participation. What about students for whom transcripts were requested but not received (usually because the institution said they had no record of the student or could not find the document)? In some cases, the student's claim to attendance was supported by other unobtrusive information (e.g., entries of loan disbursements in the National Student Loan Data System files) or sets of test scores (e.g., Advanced Placement or College Board Achievement Tests) that matched the typical range of scores reported for the school they claimed to have attended. In other cases, the student's claim was supported by the consistency of responses to questions asked in surveys 6 years apart (1994 and 2000), and for features of postsecondary history-such as parents' borrowing for education, change of major, simultaneous attendance at two institutions, and program of study that matched their occupation in 1999-that offered a credible storyline. But for other students for whom transcripts were requested but not received, there was no such evidence, unobtrusive or credible story-line. Readers of table 2.5 who focus on the summary lines (\"Weak Evidence,\" \"Adequate Evidence\") and perform standard t-tests will notice statistically significant differences by both gender and race/ethnicity that warrant further exploration. What table 2.5 raises is a potentially important issue for the way national participation in postsecondary education might be assessed.  "}, {"section_title": "Participation and Completion: Results of Changing the Denominator", "text": "Any statement about the proportion of a group of students who enrolls in postsecondary education of any kind (access), earns credits (or credit-equivalents) toward a credential (participation), or successfully finishes a given course of study and earns the award associated with that course of study (completion) is conditioned by the boundaries of the universe of students described-the denominator of the equation. Each narrowing of the universe and corresponding shrinkage in the denominator produces an increasingly fortuitous result. The differences in degree completion rates observed in tables 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate this principle. In both tables, the weighted number of 1992 12th graders who earned bachelors degrees (the numerator) is 924k. In table 2.1, the denominator consists of all those who earned more than 10 postsecondary credits: 1.898M. In table 2.2, the denominator consists of all those who not only earned more than 10 postsecondary credits but also any credits from a bachelor's degreegranting institution: 1.389M. The bachelor's degree completion rate thus rises from 48.7 percent (table 2.1) to 66.5 percent (table 2.2). But the universes in these tables were already confined to known postsecondary participants. Tables 2.6 through 2.9 use the Class of 1992 cohort to demonstrate a different approach, namely, including those students who never claimed postsecondary attendance (that is, all participants in the 1992 panel and not just those flagged as 12th graders), hence including \"access\" in the equation. These tables also enable the researcher to begin investigation of secondary school background variables associated with postsecondary entry and completion. Tables 2.6 and 2.7 should be compared to see what happens when moving from the broadest universe of the Class of 1992 cohort, that is, the maximum denominator, to a universe confined by the population of those who earned a standard high school diploma within a year of the modal high school graduation season of the Spring of 1992 (that is, by the end of June 1993 10 ). With the more constricted universe:"}, {"section_title": "Part 3:", "text": "The \"Credit-Attainment\" Account of Postsecondary Accomplishment Up to this point, Principal Indicators has presented attainment in terms of credentials awarded, including the category of \"no degree.\" A closer examination of the data, however, yields a richer description of what is meant by \"no degree,\" and this description leads us to consider a variety of post-matriculation behaviors, including attendance patterns, that may assist in the targeting of populations for enhanced retention efforts. Table 3.1 presents the attainment portrait for all postsecondary participants in the Class of 1992 cohort in an \"if-then-else\" logic that begins with students who earned at least a bachelor's degree, and then works down the credential chain through associate's degrees and certificates to \"no degree,\" which it then divides by the number of credits earned by the student. Four credit ranges are set forth: 0-10, 11-29, 30-59, and 60 or more. For convenience of labeling, this is called a \"credit-attainment account.\" Two of the no degree credit-range groups are of particular interest and present distinctive profiles: incidental students (0-10 credits) and long-term noncompleters (60 or more credits). In terms of general demographic background characteristics (table 3.1), higher proportions of African-American and Latino students than White students and those from the lowest two SES quintiles versus the highest two SES quintiles are found in the incidental student category, but neither of these features is the case in the long-term noncompleter category. As tables 3.2 and 3.3 suggest, though, demographic background may prove to be less important than other features of secondary school history and postsecondary attendance in explaining why, at age 26 or 27, the two groups are situated where they are in the credit-attainment chain. The portrait of those who became incidental students in table 3.2 shows not only an academically weaker group than their peers (for example, more than half never got beyond Algebra 1 in high school mathematics) but also a group whose precollegiate expectations for educational attainment 13 were considerably lower than those whose momentum in postsecondary education carried them beyond the \"incidental\" classification. Policy discussions and research tend to treat all noncompleters as equivalent, whether they earned 1 credit or 71 credits. The more notable exceptions do not involve credit accounting, but reflect the fact that the student is still enrolled at the end of a longitudinal study (e.g., Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002). The importance of tables 3.1 through 3.3 is that they demonstrate the difference between still being enrolled and momentum toward a degree. In terms of postsecondary attendance \u2022 only 57 percent of those who became incidental students (versus 86 percent of their peers) entered directly following high school graduation; \u2022 66 percent of incidental students (versus 5 percent of nonincidental students) were enrolled for less than 1 year; and \u2022 in the last year (2000) of the Class of 1992 history, only 8 percent of incidental students were still enrolled versus 22 percent of nonincidental students. As an open door institution, the community college was the initial host to three-quarters of those who became incidental students. Researchers and administrators interested in the ways in which community colleges can identify those students in the \"incidental student profile\" who have the best chance of succeeding are encouraged to use the NELS:88/2000 files to help determine (1) which features of student history seem to be the most significant barriers, and 2which of those features can be addressed by practical local initiatives. State-system studies, such as that in Washington state (Steppanen 2000), have shown that a measurable proportion of entering students plans to stay for fewer than 10 credits and that half of that group fulfills its plansfactors of cohort history that cannot be pursued with the NELS:88/2000 but are worthy of consideration.   The case of the long-term noncompleters, those who earned 60 or more credits but no degree, may be important to institutions seeking to improve their degree completion rates. Students who have reached this level of \"credit retention,\" one can hypothesize, have the momentum to complete degrees. Table 3.3 lays out some of the factors that analysts might consider in testing this hypothesis. More accurately, the table suggests some of the variables that could be used in a quasi-experimental design, based on the Class of 1992 data, that could help identify the factors associated with completion starting at the level of 60 credits. Table 3.3 compares the 60+ group with those students who earned associate's or bachelor's degrees. The following are some highlights of the comparison: \u2022 The 60+ population is more likely to start its postsecondary career in a community college than those who completed degrees (40 percent vs. 24 percent), and to attend more than one institution (74 percent vs. 59 percent). Indeed, a third of the long-term noncompleters attended more than two institutions."}, {"section_title": "First-to-Second Year Retention", "text": "The vocabulary of studies of postsecondary student histories is not always consistent in labeling the phenomenon of year-to-year continuous enrollment. Whether the phenomenon is termed \"persistence\" or \"retention,\" it has been a persistent concern of researchers and policymakers for three decades (Astin 1975;Dey and Astin 1989;Tinto 1987;Smith 1998), and usually with a focus on institutional retention of an entering class to the second year. The question regarding retention is customarily phrased: What proportion of students who started out at an institution in the fall term of year X is enrolled at the same institution in the fall term of year X+1? Table 3.4, based on the Class of 1992 history, is designed to cast light on this question from a different perspective, one that recognizes that not all beginning students start out in the fall term or return in the fall term, and that some students are in programs of less than 1 year duration. The table is focused on the student, not the institution, and hence answers the question within the panorama of all institutions in which the student enrolls. As one of the reviewers of this document added, \"since most institutions count transfers [out] as 'noncompleters' in their retention statistics, this view of transfers from a cohort perspective can be [a] useful [corrective].\" The algorithm that produces table 3.4 uses an academic calendar year (defined as July 1 through June 30) as a frame. It flags the academic year in which the student's first term date of attendance at his/her true first institution falls. It then asks whether the student was enrolled at any time during the following academic year. If that condition was met, the student exhibited a threshold degree of systemwide retention. Among the students who did not meet the threshold criterion, however, are a small group who earned certificates in less-than-1-year programs during their first year of attendance. This group is separated from the larger populations who were retained or not retained. Defined in this manner, the reader will note that the systemwide retention rate is higher for those who began in doctoral degree-granting institutions than it was for those who began in other 4year colleges, and that these rates are higher than for those who began in community colleges, which, in turn, are higher than for those who first attended other sub-baccalaureate institutions. The case of other sub-baccalaureate institutions, though, must be judged in light of the fact that 15 percent of students who start out in those institutions earn 1-year certificates within the first year of attendance. Perhaps more important than the fact of first to second year retention is the quality of retention. While there may be many measures of quality of first year academic performance, the proxy chosen for table 3.4 is total credits earned during that period. Among those who were retained, 35 percent earned 20 or fewer credits, an amount that has been demonstrated to have a distinctly negative relationship to degree completion (Adelman 1999b). Not surprisingly, among those who were not retained, 90 percent earned 20 or fewer credits in the first calendar year of attendance. A second dimension of retention quality, particularly given the definition of systemwide retention used in table 3.4, is continuous enrollment. That is, it is possible for a student to have been enrolled in the fall semester of 1992, not enrolled again until the spring semester of 1994 and still be considered \"retained\" under the definition used here. As has been noted above, in the transcript-based postsecondary histories of NCES grade-cohort longitudinal studies, noncontinuous enrollment is defined as any stop-out period exceeding one semester (or its equivalent), exclusive of summer terms (see Glossary); and continuity of enrollment has been demonstrated to have a very positive relationship with degree completion (Carroll 1989, Horn 1998, Adelman 1999b). In the example used, the stop-out period was two semesters. While not in table 3.4, some 25.1 percent (s.e.= 0.96) of those who were retained exhibited noncontinuous enrollment at some time in their undergraduate careers. If a student's year-1 to year-2 retention includes noncontinuous enrollment, momentum toward degree completion may be weakened. Table 3.4 invites researchers to explore these and other dimensions of the quality of retention, not only from the first to second year, but beyond. Indeed, table 3.4 extends beyond first-tosecond year retention to provide some indication of the degree to which students who did not enroll in the second year following postsecondary entry return to school at a later point in time. For example, 24 percent of the students who were not retained from year one to year two reappeared in the postsecondary system in the third or later year. Even among the small group of those who earned a certificate in their first year of postsecondary education and who did not enroll at any time during the second year, 25 percent came back to school in a subsequent year."}, {"section_title": "Part 4: Attendance Patterns: Portraits of Mobility", "text": "It has been noted that the traditional-age students in the three grade-cohort longitudinal studies increasingly attend more than one institution in the course of their undergraduate careers. But, as table 4.1 illustrates, the degree of change in this gross measure of multi-institutional behavior has been modest, and located principally in the general nonincidental student population, not in the sub-population of bachelor's degree completers. Roughly 60 percent of bachelor's degree recipients have attended more than one school as undergraduates since the 1970s. The more important question may be how students attend more than one institution, and what combination of institutional types they attend. The Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992 files offer the opportunity for some basic observations about the changes beneath the surface of multiinstitutional behavior. The comparative data are presented in table 4.2.  1 The category of \"4-year plus incidental 2-year\" is new to the NELS:88/2000 accounting, and principally describes 4-year college students who occasionally attend community colleges during summer terms. In coding the transcripts of the High School Class of 1982, students who may have exhibited this pattern of attendance were included in the category \"4-year only.\" NOTES: (1) The universe of all students consists of 12th graders who became likely postsecondary participants. Class of 1982 Weighted N = 2.14M; Class of 1992 Weighted N = 2.09M. (2) The universe for students earning more than 10 credits in both cohorts consists of 12th graders for whom postsecondary transcripts were received. The major inter-cohort changes among nonincidental students (those earning more than 10 credits) evident in table 4.2 involve increases in the percentages of students either moving from 2-year to 4-year institutions or alternating attendance between 2-year and 4-year institutions. The category of \"2-year\" institutions is dominated by community colleges but also includes 2year branch campuses of 4-year schools and associate's degree-granting for-profit and not-forprofit schools. Part of the decline in 4-year only attendance is an artifice of the creation of a new category of institutional combination for the Class of 1992, hence the decline is not significant. This category describes students who are based in 4-year colleges but who use 2-year colleges (principally community colleges) for incidental purposes (84 percent of this group earned 10 or fewer credits from 2-year schools), and usually during summer terms. In the Class of 1992 cohort, this group totals over 7 percent of nonincidental students. In the Class of 1982 cohort, these students were classified under the category of 4-year only. The other major phenomenon observable in table 4.2 is that when the boundaries of the universe are narrowed from all students to those who earned more than 10 credits, the proportion of students attending \"2-year colleges only\" and \"other sub-baccalaureate colleges only\" falls, while the proportion of those attending \"4-year colleges only\" rises. The narrowing of boundaries eliminates the incidental students, who are less likely to attend more than one institution."}, {"section_title": "Transfer as a Subset of Multi-Institutional Attendance", "text": "Tables 4.3 and 4.4 take up the transfer phenomenon, a subset of multi-institutional attendance. Table 4.3 is exploratory in that it sets forth six attendance configurations involving both 2-year and 4-year institutions. For each configuration, table 4.3 indicates the percentage of students who earn a bachelor's degree and the mean number of credits they earn from three different types of institutions: 4-year, community colleges, and other 2-year (not-for-profit and for-profit associate's degree-granting schools). The data show that students who start in a community college but who earn 10 or fewer credits from the community college before moving on to a 4-year institution have comparatively low (6.4 percent) bachelor's degree completion rates compared to students who start in a community college and who earn more than 10 credits from the community college (a mean of 56.1 credits) before moving on to a 4-year college (and earning more than 10 credits from 4-year colleges). These students enjoyed a much higher bachelor's degree completion rate (62.3 percent). This is the largest of the five transfer populations described. What aspects of sustained community college experience yield a bachelor's degree when the student moves to a 4-year environment? What is it about early transfer from a community college to a 4-year school that diminishes a student's chances of earning a bachelor's degree? When these attendance patterns are combined with students' secondary school records and detailed college coursework, they might offer some intriguing hypotheses for further research (see, for example, Florida Council for Education Policy, Research, and Improvement 2002). As the comments on table 4.3 suggest, the five patterns of 2-year/4-year college attendance do not necessarily constitute \"transfer.\" Since early analyses of the Class of 1972, \"classic transfer\" in the grade cohort transcript-based data sets has been defined as follows: The student who starts in a community college and earns more than 10 credits from the community college, then moves to a 4-year college and earns more than 10 credits from the 4-year college has transferred, even if the student returns to the community college at any time. This is the definition used for the second of the transfer groups in table 4.3. Even if the threshold is changed from 10 to 12 or 15 credits (American Council on Education 1991; Jones 1991; Cohen and Brawer 1996), with this definition, those community college students who merely attended a 4-year college can be distinguished from those who truly transferred. With this definition, one can examine the universe of those students whose true first institution of attendance was a community college, derive a national \"transfer rate,\" and follow changes in that rate and the ultimate degree attainments of students who transfer, over time. Table 4.4 does this across the three longitudinal studies cohorts. The first universe of analysis in table 4.4 consists of all students who started out in community colleges, no matter how long they stayed, in terms of credits earned from community colleges. From the Class of 1972 to the Class of 1982, we note a rise in the proportion of those who become incidental students. Between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, there was"}, {"section_title": "The Role of Special Mission Institutions in the Attendance Patterns of Minority Students", "text": "The gaps in aspects of access, participation, and degree completion between majority and minority populations noted in tables 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6., and 2.7 are frequently cited in the literature. In response, one line of research aimed at ways of improving persistence and completion rates of minority students has focused on the roles of institutions whose special mission is to serve and nurture specific minority populations (see, e.g., Kim 2002;Allen 1992). There are two large groups of institutions with such special missions: \u2022 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), many of which have been serving African-Americans for over a century, were chartered with this mission (Hoffman, Snyder, and Sonnenberg 1992); and \u2022 Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), which are defined not by charter but instead by the proportion of their students who are Latino. These proportions grew in time and the designation of an HSI (requiring a minimum of 25 percent Latino enrollment) is a comparatively recent one (Stearns and Watanabe 2002). In 89 of the 103 HBCUs, the proportion of students who were African-American in 1999 was over 75 percent (Snyder 2002, table 221, pp. 264-5), and the vast majority (89) of HBCUs are 4year institutions or specialized graduate schools. The proportion of students who were Latino in the HSIs ranged from the threshold of 25 percent to 95 percent. Three-quarters of HSIs are community colleges, reflecting the historical attendance preferences of Hispanic populations (Snyder 2002, table 219, pp. 259-262;Adam 1999). The NELS:88/2000 allows for an accounting of the use of these special mission institutions by their target populations. Tables 4.5 and 4.6 present selected aspects of that use and its outcomes. Table 4.5 takes the full universe of African-American 12th graders in 1992 and divides their attendance pattern accounts with reference to enrollment in HBCUs. There are five patterns, two of which involve HBCUs. Slightly more than one out of five African-American students in the Class of 1992 started their postsecondary careers in an HBCU, and about 27 percent of African-American students attended an HBCU at some time. The reader will note that \u2022 The bachelor's degree attainment rate of those African-American students who started in HBCUs was 49 percent, compared with a completion rate of 54 percent for African-Americans who attended 4-year institutions other than HBCUs. The difference is not statistically significant.  in table 4.5, among all African-American postsecondary participants, those who first entered 4-year colleges (HBCUs or others) were more likely to enter the postsecondary system directly from high school (91.2 percent; s.e. = 1.37) than those whose attendance was confined to 2-year colleges and other sub-baccalaureate institutions (56.5 percent; s.e. = 6.95)."}, {"section_title": "\"Acceleration\" and Its Effects", "text": "The last topic in this section on attendance patterns shifts the locus from place to time. It asks whether -and to what extent-students' use of credit-by-examination and postsecondary credits earned by coursework prior to high school graduation accelerated their progress toward degrees and, in fact, shortened time-to-degree. The data set from which the Class of 1992 is drawn (NELS:88/2000) flagged both classes of credits, then combined them. Separately and together, the academic effort represented in these credits is part of the general rubric of attendance patterns. Credits earned by examination include not only credits granted for Advanced Placement test scores but also credits earned through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and institutional exams (the majority-in the Class of 1992 records-are in foreign languages). Table 4.7 sets forth the percentage of students who earned acceleration credits in three ranges, and by three topics selected from precollegiate performance, initial entry, and ultimate attainment by age 26 or 27. The data indicate, first, that students in the highest quintile of high school academic coursework are more likely to earn credits by means other than post-matriculation course enrollment. The data also show that"}, {"section_title": "Moving Into Curriculum", "text": "There are many ways to represent the curricular content of students' postsecondary experiences. The companion document to this presentation (forthcoming), The Empirical Curriculum, provides detail across 1,178 course categories and 109 aggregate groupings, and by gender, race/ethnicity, and features of students' attendance. For Principal Indicators, nine curriculum clusters that are common to both the High School & Beyond/ Sophomore cohort (Class of 1982) and the NELS:88/2000 (Class of 1992) are selected to illustrate how material such as this can be used by local academic administrators to determine whether institutional goals for students' basic exposure and depth of study might be measured using unobtrusive transcript data. In the files for both longitudinal studies (and for the NLS-72, as well), variables were created for many curriculum clusters, but the definitions for a few of them were altered slightly based on the nature of student records and thus are not wholly comparable. For example, all three data sets contain three clusters for foreign languages: FLANCRD1 All credits in introductory and intermediate level foreign language courses FLANCRD2 All credits in advanced foreign language courses, including literature FLANCRD3 All credits in all foreign language courses Only FLANCRD3 is truly comparable across all three cohort studies. For another type of example, the external faculty review panel for the NELS:88/2000 that covered engineering, engineering technologies, and computer science recommended moving all computer applications courses either into the disciplines in which they were offered in applied contexts (for example, agriculture, graphics and design) or into a new \"chapter\" of the taxonomy, with new codes. Many of these courses had previously been coded under computer science. While the course cluster for all \"computer-related\" credits remained the same, that for computer science, narrowly construed, changed significantly, and one cannot compare credit production in these categories with those of previous longitudinal studies. Table 5.5 compares credit production in nine curriculum clusters across two cohorts, the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, and for two groups of students: \u2022 All students who earned at least 1 year's worth of semester-equivalent credits (that is, more than 30), and \u2022 All bachelor's degree recipients. The threshold for the first group was set at more than 30 so that the resulting universe of credits (and the students who earned them) is substantial enough to yield informative analysis. The clusters are not mutually exclusive. For example, some foreign languages are included in the cluster for non-Western cultures and societies as well as in the cluster for all foreign languages. 11.3 (0.57) 16.6 (0.89) 12.9 (0.56) 18.5 (0.84) 5-9 7.4 (0.44) 11.9 (0.75) 6.2 (0.39) 8.9 (0.60) More than 9 7.7 (0.44) 13.0 (0.76) 7.7 (0.53) 11.4 (0.82) 18.9 (0.77) 24.0 (1.05) 20.6 (0.78) 25.3 (1.02) More than 4 5.6 (0.41) 8.5 (0.64) 6.8 (0.40) 9.6 (0.58) 1 \"Level 1\" Core Laboratory Science includes general chemistry (and, if in a sequence, analytic chemistry), general biology (or introductory zoology and introductory botany), general physics, and general physics with calculus. 2 Calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, abstract algebra, topology, matrix theory, etc., and advanced statistics (e.g., stochastic models, path analysis). 3 The cluster includes course codes for Area Studies (African, Asian, East Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern, Pacific, South Asian, Southeast Asian, Carribean), Islamic Studies, Non-Western Philosophy/Religions/Literature-in-Translation/Art/Music, all Non-Western languages, African/Asian/Latin American/Middle Eastern history, Third World Economics, Third World Cultures (Anthropology), Geography of Africa/Asia/Pacific/Latin America/Carribean, and Non-Western Governments and Politics. 4 In addition to statistics taught under mathematics, the cluster includes course category codes for business statistics, economic statistics, biostatistics, education statistics, engineering statistics, and general social science statistics. 5 In addition to all computer science codes, the cluster includes computer applications courses, basic computer operations training, computer engineering, computer engineering technology, computer repair, data processing, and business information system courses. 6 Includes creative writing, technical writing, journalism, and writing for the media.

SOURCES: High School and Beyond/Sophomore Cohort, NCES 2000-194;NELS:88/2000Postsecondary Transcript Files, NCES 2003 Observations on some of the comparisons evident in table 5.5, and the questions they raise \u2022 Foreign Languages. A modest increase in the overall participation rate of all students who earned more than 30 credits (from 31 to 39 percent), and among bachelor's degree recipients (from 44 to 50 percent). Credits earned in foreign languages, though, are not necessarily a proxy for fluency. \u2022 Writing Beyond Freshman Composition. A slight increase in the proportion of students earning more than 30 credits who complete discrete courses in writing that require freshman composition (or a waiver by examination) as a prerequisite. This datum might be investigated as part of a potential indicator of written communication skills. \u2022 Non-Western Cultures and Societies. A modest increase in the overall participation rate of both students who earned more than 30 credits (from 12 to 18 percent) and bachelor's degree recipients (from 19 to 27 percent)in a cluster that can serve as one indicator of the degree to which students are being exposed to global perspectives. \u2022 \"Level 1\" Core Laboratory Science. Negligible change in the distribution of credits earned between the 1980s and 1990s cohorts. \u2022 Calculus and Advanced Math. No meaningful change in the distribution of credits across the two cohorts. The last two observations acquire greater meaning in the context of students' secondary school records. For example, assume that one objective of an institution of higher education is to ensure that as many of its students as possible reach at least the level of precalculus in mathematics. The measurement of that goal would take high school mathematics course-taking into account. If more students reached the goal prior to college entry, then one may be less concerned if there were no change in the credit distribution at the college level. Table 5.6 demonstrates that, in fact, this is the case for the Class of 1992, where the distribution of bachelor's degree recipients' highest level of mathematics in high school shows a notable increase from the previous cohort (Class of 1982) at the levels of precalculus and calculus, and little change in the proportions of students earning credits in calculus at the college level. The message of these apparently discordant indicators warrants further investigation in terms of the potential for increasing the proportion of students who major in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The curricular pathways from secondary school into and through postsecondary education are both complex and conditioned by factors that have not been brought into play here. Researchers are invited to advance more sophisticated analyses than this surface description can provide.  2Rows for each cohort's distribution of calculus credits may not sum to 100.0 percent because of rounding. 3Standard errors are in parentheses. 4Only students for whom highest math in high school can be determined are included; only students with complete postsecondary records are included.

Examples include Biochemistry, Plant Morphology, Histology, Genetics, Ethology, Biotechnology, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Geophysics, Paleontology, Mineralogy, Modern Physics, Electricity & Magnetism (Intermediate Course), and Physiological Psychology. Biology service courses (e.g., Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Biochemistry) and other science service courses are not included. \u2022 Ethics-includes the core ethics course taught in philosophy, plus courses in environmental ethics, religious ethics, and bioethics. All the courses cited above carry distinct codes in the taxonomy used to code the 370,000 cases in the NELS:88/2000. Table 5.7 presents credits earned in these clusters in bands. For an alternative presentation of this issue, using mean credits earned by major, and invoking international studies and foreign languages, see Adelman, Daniel, and Berkovits (2003), table 12. The upper-level science credits distribution in table 5.7 presents some data one might expect: for example, the high percentage of majors in Health Sciences/Services who earned more than four credits in upper-level science. The low percentage of business majors who earned credits in upper-level science courses should also be noted in light of the increasing scientific and technical content of economic life. The debate as to whether ethics can be taught is as old as the ancient Greek philosophers. Table  5.7 indicates that, depending on major (and exclusive of humanities majors, which include philosophy majors), between 15 and 30 percent of bachelor's degree recipients complete some formal education in ethical issues and analysis. Analysts might wish to explore variances in the type of institutions in which course-taking in ethics is most common.  1 All courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and geology for which the introductory course in the field is a prerequisite. Examples include biochemistry, bacteriology, field natural history, ornithology, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, geochemistry, mineralogy, quantum physics. Associate's degrees awarded by community colleges include both the general transfer oriented A.A./A.S. and the occupationally oriented A.A.S. (the NELS:88/2000 files also include such degree titles as Associate in Business, Associate of Applied Business, Associate of Engineering Technology, and others). The connection between specific majors and the particular type of associate's degree awarded is sometimes a matter of local decision. Thus, for example, the NELS:88/2000 transcript files show business administration and paralegal preparation under both the A.S. and A.A.S. degrees. Given this range of practice, table 5.8 takes an empirical approach without concern for the precise label of the degree, asking what proportion of those in the High School Class of 1992 who earned associate's degrees from community colleges accumulated credits in two curricular areas that might be used in assessing the quality of degree content. \u2022 \"Level 1\" Core Laboratory Sciences-the basic introductory sequences in biology (including the zoology/botany sequence, when used), chemistry, and physics. \u2022 Introductory College Level Mathematics-a broad curriculum cluster that includes finite mathematics, statistics, college algebra, precalculus, and technical mathematics that is grounded in these college-level topics. Students who complete credits at this level of mathematics have indicated that they are truly beyond the levels that would be classified as precollegiate/remedial. These areas are selected for illustrative purposes, and analysts are invited to use others, for example, computer-related credits or all foreign language credits in determining the content of associate's degrees for students in different majors. The standard errors for table 5.8 are large, and comparisons of the estimates will yield very few that are statistically significant. But it is worth focusing on the column indicating no credits (\"None\"), and judging the inverse of the estimates in that column. For example, the potential for transfer from the community college to a 4-year college, regardless of whether one earns an A.A./A.S. or A.A.S. degree, is enhanced by a transcript showing credits in college-level mathematics (Adelman 1994). The reader of table 5.8 will note that community college associate's degree majors in business, engineering technology, and general studies fields all evidence a very positive credit distribution for college-level mathematics. In core level 1 laboratory science, one notices the same type of distribution for majors in engineering technology, health occupations, and general studies. These observations may assist researchers and administrators in generating hypotheses as to the most profitable curricular paths to transfer, and to test the curricular paths for those students who earned associate's degrees against those who may have earned more than 30 credits from community colleges but no degree. Judging from newspaper articles and editorials, Americans are fascinated by grades in education, almost as fascinated as by indicators of athletic performance in the sports section or various market averages in the business section. In the daily newspaper, grades are similar to earned run averages (ERAs) of baseball pitchers, or the weighted ratings of quarterbacks and mutual fund managers. These are all, putatively, transparent indicators of performance, though we probably understand grades far better than ERAs. Table 6.1 looks across the transcript-recorded postsecondary grades of the three grade-cohort longitudinal studies using two common metrics, the distribution of letter grades and grade point averages (GPAs) of different populations. The first-and major-point (illustrated in table 6.1) is that, judging by both distribution of letter grades and GPAs, changes have been minor and complex since the high school class of 1972 went to college. In terms of the distribution of letter grades, the proportion of grades that were \"A\" declined slightly between the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1982, then rose between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992. The inverse to this pattern can be observed for the proportions of grades that were \"B\" and \"D.\" In terms of final undergraduate GPAs, those for women and students who earned bachelor's degrees, as well as among some majors (health sciences and services, social sciences, and applied social sciences), dropped from the Class of 1972 to the Class of 1982, then rose for the Class of 1992. The more notable issue in changes of grading practices from the 1970s through the1990s is the growing proportion of withdrawals (Ws) and no-credit repeats (abbreviated as NCRs in this document), both of which are now treated as nonpenalty grades by many institutions. There is an unhappy paradox here, however: what is labeled as \"nonpenalty\" actually involves a more subtle penalty. The time one loses in such situations is time one must recoup at a later point. As table 6.2a (using the Class of 1992) demonstrates, the volume of no-penalty Ws and NCRs has an inverse relationship to highest degree earned, and as table 6.2b indicates, there is a direct relationship between the number of these grades and time-to-degree among those who earned bachelor's degrees. Other features of student postsecondary history interact with the volume of Ws and NCRs, and analysts are invited to consider, for example, the distribution of such grades by institutional selectivity (table 6.3), and the discrete courses with the highest proportion of W and NCR grades (table 6.5). For both the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992, table 6.3 presents the distribution of grades by institutional selectivity. Because students may attend institutions of varying selectivity during their undergraduate careers and may also take a course more than once, this table uses the course-not the student-as the unit of analysis.   NCES 2000-194;NELS:88/2000Postsecondary Transcript Files, NCES 2003 The reader will note the following changes between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992: \u2022 In highly selective institutions (accounting for less than 4 percent of all grades in both cohorts), a notable increase in the proportion of grades that were \"P\"-principally at the expense of grades of \"B.\" \u2022 At selective institutions, an increase in the proportion of grades that were \"A\" and \"P\"-at the expense of grades that were \"B\" and \"C.\" Selective institutions increased their share of all grades from 10.5 to 16.5 percent between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992 as a result of both increases in enrollments in flagship state universities and changes in the selectivity ratings of some state universities from nonselective to selective. \u2022 The proportion of Bs declined in all categories of institutions except those that were \"not rated.\" \u2022 Open-door institutions were by far the leaders in the proportion of grades that were Withdrawals (Ws) and No-Credit Repeats (NCRs). To bring the role of institutional selectivity into the analysis of student-level performance, table 6.4 sets forth bachelor's degree recipients' GPAs over all three grade-cohort longitudinal studies. The reader will note the consistency of the relationship in both the Class of 1972 and the Class of 1982: the more selective the institution granting the bachelor's degree, the higher the student's GPA (no matter how many other institutions-some of differing selectivity-the student had attended). No similar conclusion can be reached for the Class of 1992, however.  NCES 2000-194;NELS:88/2000Postsecondary Transcript Files, NCES 2003 The transcript evidence shows that grade distributions varied considerably from course to course. Table 6.5 takes eight high-enrollment-volume courses from the Class of 1992 files to illustrate this phenomenon.  Nearly two out of every three grades in ethics is an honors grade (A or B), compared with 45 percent in introductory accounting, calculus, and U.S. government-courses in which the withdrawal, repeat, and failure rates were also high. These courses were taken by the NELS:88/2000 postsecondary students in a minimum of 438 institutions (for organic chemistry) to a high of 1,105 institutions (for introductory accounting). 17 Approximately 1 million grades were recorded for introductory and intermediate-level Spanish courses, compared with 231,000 for Microbiology. These are very robust numbers that open up lines of research inquiry for those who wish to add such institutional variables as sector, Carnegie type, and selectivity to the analysis. Table 6.5 picked high-enrollment-volume courses as its subject, and deliberately selected from different sectors of the disciplinary spectrum. Researchers who wish to investigate the enduring effects of grades might start with students' stated intentions of major, identify a set of \"gateway\" courses in that field and/or related fields, and model the relationship between grades in the gateways to subsequent attainment. A last topic of interest in the consideration of grades and grading focuses on the courses with the highest percentage of grades that were (1) Withdrawals and Repeats (table 6.6), (2) Penalty Grades (table 6.7), and \"As\" (table 6.8). All of these are presented for the Class of 1992 only."}, {"section_title": "Part 7: Special Topic: Remediation", "text": "Precollegiate-level coursework undertaken in postsecondary settings is generally labeled \"remedial,\" and is the subject of much contention (Merisotis and Phipps 2000;Breneman and Harlow 1998;Manno 1995). Only percent of undergraduates responding to surveys say they have ever taken a remedial course (Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002), but the transcript data dispute that figure. Based on analysis of the HS&B/sophomore cohort transcript files, an indicator that combined the types and amounts of postsecondary remedial coursework was developed and presented in Wirt, J. at al, The Condition of Education, 2000(Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics 2000indicator 14, p. 52, and supplemental tables 34-1, 34-2, and 34-3, p.152). The indicator was based on an \"if-then-else\" logic with five categories: Any courses in remedial reading 2. Two or fewer remedial courses, mathematics only 3. Two or more remedial courses, but no remedial reading 4. One remedial course, not mathematics or reading 5. No remedial courses The logic was designed to sort out students with the most serious remedial problem (reading) first. Remedial reading was judged to be the most serious remedial problem because two-thirds of the students who required remediation in reading were also enrolled in a minimum of two other remedial courses. The second step sorted out students whose only remedial problem was in mathematics, and who required, at most, two remedial math courses. This is not as intense a remedial configuration as that of the third level of the logic cascade, where 60 percent of the students enrolled in three or more remedial courses other than remedial reading (the logic allowed this combination to include three or more math courses). The fourth step sorted out those students who took only one remedial course other than reading or math. The residual group of students took no remedial courses. The presentation of this variable in Principal Indicators draws on both the HS&B/sophomore cohort and the NELS:88/2000 transcript files and seeks only to establish its basic dimensions and relationships to precollegiate histories. Figure 2 provides the course category titles and codes used in determining the different remedial course configurations, and requires a gloss. There are some slight differences in the way in which remedial courses were defined in the two transcript files, and the NELS:88/2000 added two codes based on catalog descriptions and indications of nonadditive credit on transcripts. In general, the content of a course flagged as remedial is distinctly and unquestionably precollegiate, whether or not the credits attached to the course are additive (that is, count toward a credential). Business English is a case in point. It is a course offered exclusively in subbaccalaureate institutions, and (as catalogue searches confirmed) covers the most basic elements of writing, with an emphasis on punctuation and spelling. This material is precollegiate, but in a trade school certificate program in business support (what was once called \"secretarial\"), the credits count toward the certificate. Table 7.1 offers a basic portrait of postsecondary remedial work distributed by the 5-category variable, with attention to the timing of postsecondary entry and the nature of the first institution attended. The reader will note: \u2022 In the column for \"no remediation,\" an improvement of approximately 9 percent between the Class of 1982 and the Class of 1992. Using the inverse of this figure, roughly 51 percent of students in the Class of 1982 were enrolled in at least one remedial course at some time in their undergraduate careers, compared with 42 percent of students in the Class of 1992. \u2022 There was no significant change in the proportion of students enrolled in remedial reading between the two cohorts: 11 percent. \u2022 Differences in remedial work by delay of entry into postsecondary education are apparent only in the Class of 1992 cohort."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion: Missing Topics, Data Set Limitations, and Major Learning", "text": "Developing national data sets (particularly for longitudinal studies) and learning to use them is somewhat like mastering a piano concerto. First one studies the structure, learns the movements and sub-movements, practices hands separately, practices hands together, finds the difficult passages and plays them backwards. One makes a tape, listens to it, figures out where the passages are rough or where one thinks a different interpretation would enhance the performance. Then, just when one believes oneself to be on the road to Carnegie Hall, one realizes that there is a whole orchestra and orchestral score that surrounds the solo, that sets the stage, and fills in the passages. The college transcript records are analogous to the solo: they cannot be played without the full orchestra and score. All the topics touched upon in this document to illustrate the power and range of the transcript records are incomplete without connection to the lives of the students who \"own\" those records. Longitudinal studies are life histories, and college records are but parts of lives. The longitudinal studies of the National Center for Education Statistics contain a wealth of information. There are surveys of the students that cover aspirations, plans, attitudes, values, family background, family formation, assessments of high school experiences, and labor market experience (jobs, occupations, employers, wages, unemployment, and job satisfaction). There are high school transcripts, test scores, military records, financial aid records, and high school characteristics. For subsamples of the students in the HS&B/sophomore cohort and the NELS:88/2000 there are surveys of parents, teachers, and high school principals. There are thousands of variables, and researchers have found some to be worth more than others. Without a larger orchestral score that draws critical features of life histories into the pool of explanation, analysis will suffer. Take, for example, the students who earned 60 or more credits but who never earned a degree of any kind and who were no longer in school at age 27 (table  3.3). In all three cohorts, this group constituted 1 out of every 12 students who had entered the postsecondary system. The transcript records take us only so far toward figuring out why they did not finish degrees, why they left school, and what it would take to help them finish. Until we see how they differ from other students in terms of high school curricula, family formation, financial aid patterns, geographic mobility, and labor market experience, no one can come up with compelling guidance for college student personnel officers and academic advisors. In his seminal work on college dropouts, Tinto (1987) suggested that institutions develop \"early warning systems\" that can spot and track students who may have difficulty completing programs. Both the life histories in longitudinal studies and the transcript records can be powerful resources for academic advisors and student personnel officers looking for signs of looming trouble. And it is that kind of guidance to which Principal Indicators can be put to use. Whatever one does with the postsecondary records fits into the life stories that can be aggregated from all this other information. Because they are artifacts, transcripts reveal something new every time one works with them. Over the next few years, researchers will discover the possibility of new variables that can be derived from combinations of transcript and survey data and added to the collection of analytical tools. The themes of some of these variables have not been used in this document, and readers may justly ask, \"Why were these themes missing, and what needs to be done to capture them?\""}, {"section_title": "Missing Constructs", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Full-Time/Part-Time", "text": "The analytical construct of full-time/part-time attendance is missing from the analysis files that produced the data used here for all three longitudinal studies cohorts. Enrollment intensity (another phrase for the construct) on transcript records cannot be derived by algorithm. To do so would require (1) the definition of full-time enrollment in different types of terms (regular semester, summer school, special term, trimester intersession) from each institution, and (2) a term-based count of credits (or credit equivalents) attempted for each student. But how does one judge the enrollment intensity of a student who initially enrolls for (attempts) the minimum number of credits for a term that would qualify for \"full-time\" status, and subsequently withdraws-without penalty-from half of them? Is this a full-time student or a part-time student? And if this student was enrolled, over time, at three different institutions with different definitions of \"full-time\" and different credit-accounting systems, how can we characterize the student's long-term enrollment intensity? Based on the unobtrusive, transcript-based evidence, it is very difficult to classify students as fulltime/part-time. The default is this case involves referring to the student response to a survey question, \"At X {name of institution} have you ever attended less than full-time?\" Assume, for a moment, that the threshold for full-time at institution X, on a semester system, is 12 credits. One student attended X for 8 semesters at a minimum of 12 credits, and one semester at 8 credits. Another student attended X for 4 semesters at a minimum of 12 credits, and 7 semesters at 3 credits. A third student enrolled in institution X for 9 credits and institution Y for 3 credits in the same term (simultaneous enrollment). All three of these students answer the survey question in the affirmative, and are classified as \"part-time\" students. Do they belong in the same categorical bin? Or consider: In the NELS:88/2000 survey data, nearly 42 percent of the respondents who claimed to have enrolled in college by 1994 (third follow-up) said that they had attended a postsecondary institution full-time prior to September 1992, 18 in a cohort in which 85 percent of those who graduated from high school received their diplomas in May or June of 1992. In Carroll's (1989) analysis of students on the \"persistence track\" (those who entered college fulltime immediately following high school graduation), shifting to part-time status was one of the key factors accounting for failure to complete credentials. Carroll's sources of data were student responses to survey questions in the High School & Beyond/Senior Cohort. Students who acknowledge changing enrollment intensity status are offering a story line that is more reliable than transcripts in determining full-time or part-time status. Other studies based on survey data have thus adopted three categories of enrollment intensity-full time, mixed (involving change in status), and part-time (Fitzgerald et al 1994;McCormick, Geis, and Vergun 1995), but Principal Indicators declines to do so until researchers have explored the transcript data in more detail. Given the complexities of determining enrollment intensity from transcript data, analysts should follow Carroll's approach or one of the modified versions cited above."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Control", "text": "Principal Indicators also declined to use a second construct that has been a staple of postsecondary analyses: level x institutional control (4-year, 2-year, less-than-2-year by public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit), principally as a consequence of the complexity of multi-institutional attendance. The data sources for all three grade-cohort longitudinal studies include this information, along with a modified Carnegie typology of 34 classes of institutions, 19 a seven-value special mission institution variable, 20 and the five-value selectivity variable used in tables 1.4, 4.7, 5.3, and 6.3, for example. It is possible, then, to establish a set of grids to describe dimensions of institutional characteristics, for example, Control by Carnegie Type or Control by Special Mission by Selectivity. One-third of the NELS:88/2000 postsecondary cohort was involved in inter-sectoral attendance patterns (see table 4.2), hence the mapping of student movement across any of these grids is a challenge-made more complex (but potentially revealing) in the NELS:88/2000 by the inclusion of variables that attach credits to each type of institution attended by the student. Ratios of credits from community colleges to credits from 4-year colleges and credits from selective institutions to all undergraduate credits are possible in the NELS:88/2000 data set, and these, along with the mapping of mobility, may ultimately prove more enlightening than the traditional level-by-control presentation."}, {"section_title": "Financial Aid", "text": "While the financing of postsecondary education may affect a student's academic history, Principal Indicators declined to use any of the financial aid variables in the NELS:88/2000 for the following reasons: First, the extant data files provide bivariate-coded student responses to questions on the modes of financial aid (grants, loans, college work-study, campus job, parental borrowing) only through the third follow-up survey in 1994, that is, given the modal year of postsecondary entry, only for the first 2 years of college. These questions were not asked in the fourth follow-up survey in 2000. Second, while the restricted file for the fourth follow-up includes 11 variables drawn from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), the range of postsecondary beginning and end dates and last status date on the loans identified in the NSLDS go back to 1966-nearly a decade before anyone in the NELS:88/2000 cohort was born. In other words, there are erroneous data in the NSLDS. The information on financing postsecondary education available in the NELS:88/2000 is thus very limited, and not comparable to the information available in the two previous longitudinal studies (for example, the HS&B/sophomore cohort data set includes a separate Pell Grant file, and the NLS-72 includes elaborate though self-reported information on types and amounts of grants/scholarships and loans gathered at five points between 1973 and 1986).

For example, there is a variable focusing on community college attendance patterns that employs an if-then-else logic. At each step, whatever group of students remains from the previous steps is sorted by criteria that include \"more than 10 credits from a community college.\" (See tables 4.3 and 4.4, which draw on this logic).

All months were expressed in fractions of 1/12th of a calendar year, with January set to 0: The reason for adopting this system was to enhance the accuracy of measuring time-to-degree across Y2K. The particular applications of these dates to the different TERMTYPES are included in the following guidance to the data entry staff : STUDY ABROAD If dated, use the date If undated, look for a notation of when the student was on leave: use the front-end date of the leave period 9 GED/ADULT BASIC [the entire record must be comprised of such coursework; every term type will then be = 9; dates are whatever it says] As for credits and grades, most institutions submitted a guidance or \"poop sheet\" along with the transcripts. Data entry staff were asked to read these guidances, and then to observe standardization protocols contained in the following: The descriptive comparisons in Principal Indicators dealing with nonrepetitive student behaviors require invocation of the \"Student's t\" statistic to determine whether the difference between two independent estimates is significant. The formula for computing \"Students' t\" values is: __________ t = (P 1 -P 2 )\u00f7 % (se 1 2 + se 2   2   )where P 1 and P 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are the corresponding standard errors. In this case, if t> 1.96, one has a statistically significant difference at p<.05, a standard marker. The formula becomes more complex, however, for multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable such as race/ethnicity. For multiple comparisons, the critical value for t rises depending on the number of comparisons that can be made in the family of the independent variable. For race/ethnicity presented in 5 categories, there are10 possible comparisons, so the significance level of each test must be p<.05/10 or p<.005. To determine the significance level of t values in any comparison of means or proportions, the result should be matched against standard published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the Student's t formula _____________________ t = (P 1 -P 2 )\u00f7 % (se 1 2 + se 2   2) -2(r)se 1 se 2 where r is the correlation between the two estimates. The determination of correlations requires a statistical software package such as SAS or SPSS and the invocation of proper weights for the comparison. Because none of the three grade cohort longitudinal studies used in Principal Indicators was based on a simple random sample of students, the technique for estimating sampling error involves a more complex approach known as the Taylor series method. To produce Taylor series standard errors, the estimates presented in Principal Indicators used AM, a program developed by Jon Cohen and Associates at the American Institutes for Research under contract to the National Center for Education Statistics. With the exceptions of the standard errors provided in Appendix B, Principal Indicators placed the standard errors in the tables themselves, so that readers familiar with the 'Students' t' and its variations can quickly determine statistical significance of the estimates."}, {"section_title": "Flags and Weights", "text": "Each of the grade cohort studies used in Principal Indicators carries a complex set of flags and weights to mark the populations for which estimates are to be generated. The selection of these flags and weights is extremely important for both the accuracy and meaningfulness of estimates. For purposes of the topics covered in Principal Indicators, the oldest of the data sets, the Class of 1972, is the least complicated. One weight was developed for the postsecondary transcript sample. This weight was based on the 4 th follow-up survey sample (in 1979) when students were asked what postsecondary institutions they had attended up to that point, when they attended, what degrees they had earned, and so forth. After the transcripts were gathered in 1984 and the first postsecondary transcript files developed, a flag was added to limit the population to those for whom transcripts were received. The analyses of Class of 1972 data in Principal Indicators use WT1 and set INPETS=1. A separate flag for 12th grade status in 1972 is not necessary because everyone in the Class of 1972 was in the 12th grade in 1972. For the postsecondary transcript sample of the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, the process was more complex. Using the weights for the first follow-up survey (1982, the scheduled 12th grade year for this cohort), three postsecondary transcript weights were developed. The first weight was based on a ratio of the sum of weights for all students in the 1982 panel who subsequently (in surveys of 1984, 1986 or 1992) claimed to have attended a postsecondary institution to the sum of weights for those for whom a transcript validating the claim was subsequently received. The ratio was then modified by factors derived from the stratification cells in the 1982 survey design to create multipliers that were applied to the raw weights for the students for whom transcripts were received or for whom postsecondary attendance was imputed from survey story-line characteristics. This is a generous formulation for all likely postsecondary participants. The second High School & Beyond/Sophomore weight involved the same procedure as the first but applied a more restrictive ratio to those students for whom a true postsecondary transcript was received. These students are more than \"likely\" participants: they are \"known participants.\" The third weight followed the same procedure as the second, but confined the population to only those students with complete postsecondary records (i.e., no missing transcripts). This weight is used in analyses of credit production and grades, since complete records are necessary for the analysis of both these features of student academic history. These weights are labeled PSEWT1, PSEWT2, and PSEWT3. To accompany these weights for the comparisons in Principal Indicators that hold the population to students who were in the 12th grade in 1982, a special flag, SENRFLAG, was constructed from variables in the High School and Beyond/Sophomore Cohort that described student status in1982. Using the conventional flag for participation in the 1982 cohort sample would be insufficient and not wholly accurate, as that would include students who graduated early from high school in 1981, for example. By the opposite side of the same token, we found a number of students who were labeled \"early graduates\" and thus candidates for exclusion from a 12th grade flag whose high school graduation date was listed as 1982. These students were thus included in the population with SENRFLAG=1. For all calculations of High School and Beyond/Sophomore Cohort data in Principal Indicators, SENRFLAG=1, and the appropriate PSE weight invoked. The weights and flags for the NELS:88/2000 are more complex, still, because the cohort, established in the 8 th grade, was \"refreshed\" twice: first, to be representative of the census of 10 th graders in 1990, and second, to be representative of the census of 12th graders in 1992. The weights deriving from the 1992 12th grade refreshing are at the core of weights subsequently developed for the postsecondary transcript sample. The same three postsecondary weight types developed for the High School & Beyond/Sophomores were employed here, but in combination with the 12th grade (2 nd Follow-Up survey, or F2) weight and the student's presence in the final (2000) survey panel, F4. In addition, a set of weights based on the NELS high school transcripts in combination with the three postsecondary weight types was also developed to be invoked when questions of the relationship between secondary school variables derived from high school transcripts and postsecondary variables derived from postsecondary transcripts are at issue. The NELS:88/2000 weights used in Principal Indicators are: F4F2P1WT For all likely postsecondary participants who were 12th graders in 1992 *F4F2P2WT For all known postsecondary participants who were 12th graders in 1992 F4F2P3WT For all postsecondary participants with complete records who were 12th graders in 1992 F4F2H2PW For all known postsecondary participants who were 12th graders in 1992 for whom high school transcript records are available (for example, in all cases where academic curriculum intensity quintile is used as an independent variable in tables 3.2 -3.4) F4F2H3PW For all postsecondary participants with complete records who were 12th graders in 1992 for whom high school transcript records are available (for example, in table 5.6) F4F2PNWT For all students in the 1992, 1994, and 2000 panels, whether or not they were 12th graders in 1992 (this weight is used only when questions of postsecondary access for the entire cohort are at issue in tables 2.6-2.9) * Most frequently used weight. As in the case of the High School & Beyond/Sophomore cohort, a special flag was developed for 12th graders in 1992. The existing flag on the NELS:88/2000 files excluded over 300 students who, in fact, were awarded high school diplomas in the spring of 1992. These students are included in the flag, GRADE12A, used in Principal Indicators. The weighted Ns for all samples used in a table are provided in the notes to the table. Even if the same weight and flag is used on two tables, the weighted Ns may differ slightly because missing values in a particular variable are excluded from the calculations. .  NCES 2000-194), and NELS:88/2000(NCES 2003). 22 Excludes institutions attended prior to high school graduation, institutions attended in the summer between high school graduation and fall college entry (unless the student attended the same institution in both periods), and \"false starts.\" A false start is a case where the student enrolls in a school but withdraws from/drops all courses during the first term of attendance only to turn up in another school at a later point in time with a credit accumulating record. The second school in this example is the \"true\" first institution of attendance. 23 A student who, in the 10 th grade, identified a language other than English spoken at home as his/her native language, or in the 12th grade identified a language other than English spoken at home as the language with which he/she communicated with the mother in the household all or most of the time, was flagged as non-English dominant."}, {"section_title": "133", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GLOSSARY Variables Used in Principal Indicators, in Order of First Appearance in the Tables", "text": "Most of the variables listed below are described in detail in the text accompanying the tables, and the reader is referred to the table indicated.
