[{"section_title": "4.6", "text": "Comparisons between overall PMFs from survey data and model statistics for building attributes (a) year built,  superior roof deck attachment (8d@6/6), (3) strapped roof-wall connection, (4) shutter, (5) wet flood-proofing, Hurricane induced property damages and losses have increased rapidly in the past few decades due to economy and population growth in the coastal regions (Crossett et al. 2013). Approximately 50% of the U.S. gross domestic product is located within or near the coastal areas (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2012), and the nation's population who lives in the coastal regions has increased by almost 40% in the past four decades (1970, U.S. Census Bureau 2012. All these changes have led to more high-value properties being exposed to extreme winds and floods. As a result, the majority of the top ten costliest hurricanes in the U.S. history (after inflation adjustment), which include Hurricane Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Hurricane Ike (2008), Hurricane Wilma (2005), Hurricane Irene (2011), and Hurricane Rita (2005), occurred in the past 10 years . The damages and losses due to hurricanes come from both wind and flood hazards. The wind damage is most frequently occurred on the building envelope, such as roof, windows, doors, or other openings; and the flood damage is usually initiated at the lowest elevations of a building (e.g. foundation or first story) and progresses upwards as the depth of flood increases. Because the wind and coastal flood hazards are most likely to occur simultaneously, their joint occurrence probability should be considered. In 2 current design codes, the Saffir-Simpson scale , which is a commonly used hurricane classifier, is provided to estimate the surge height of a hurricane given wind speed, or vice versa. However, a  (FEMA 2012a,b). HAZUS-MH can be used to estimate the combined losses due to hurricane wind and flood by analyzing the \"wind-only\" (caused by wind pressure, tree blowdown, etc.) and \"flood-only\" (caused by storm surge and wave) losses, respectively (FEMA 2012a,b). While the hurricane model (for \"wind-only\" loss) in HAZUS-MH allows loss estimation to be performed using a probabilistic wind hazard map, the flood model (for \"flood-only\" loss) only allows one to perform single-event-based loss estimation (FEMA 2012a,b). Therefore, in HAZUS-MH, the combined wind and flood losses can only be analyzed using event-based hurricane hazards (i.e. full-track hurricanes). That is to say, the estimations of the combined losses for specific return 3 periods cannot be easily achieved using the current HAZUS-MH program. Among others, the total loss caused by a hurricane depends on its path, central pressure, and wind profile. In order to use the HAZUS-MH program to estimate the combined wind and flood losses for particular return periods, one must select ensembles of hazard-consistent (having similar return periods) hurricane scenarios (i.e. with different paths, wind profiles, etc.) which account for the joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood. To mitigate hurricane losses in coastal areas, retrofit measures for strengthening the existing building stock can be implemented. Compared with earthquake-induced damage, which is mainly due to ground shaking, hurricane-induced damage is more complex. These damages include not only those caused by strong wind, but also others related to storm surge, windborne debris, rainwater intrusion, etc. Therefore, the concept of regional retrofit, which has been commonly used in earthquake engineering (e.g. Dodo et al. 2005(e.g. Dodo et al. , 2007Xu et al. 2007;Vaziri et al. 2010), has only been applied to hurricane hazard mitigation in recent years (e.g. Legg et al. 2013). Moreover, summarized by Ge et al. (2011), coastal jurisdictions always encourage their communities to adopt hazard mitigation measures to reduce property damages and casualties during hurricanes. However, even in hazard-prone regions, homeowners are often reluctant to implement retrofits because of lack of financial incentive. Therefore, incentive programs have been introduced by many state (e.g. Louisiana) and local governments (e.g. Miami-Dade County) to promote hurricane retrofits. In this study, a new agent-based framework was developed for the purpose of evaluating different incentives. This framework accounts for not only new constructions, but also demolitions of buildings. Most importantly, it is able to consider stakeholders' decision making on the adoptions of hurricane mitigation measures under different incentives, and evaluate the effectiveness of the incentive programs at the global level (i.e. total benefit to the entire region). The background and motivations discussed above resulted in the following objectives for Chapters Two, Three, and Four, which are standalone journal articles: (1) Improve the existing method for the quantifications of the combined hurricane wind and surge hazards considering the joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and surge.

The surface wind speeds and surge heights from individual hurricanes were computed using the Georgiou's wind field model and the SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model, respectively. To validate the accuracy of the SLOSH model, the simulated surge levels were compared to the surge levels calculated by another state-of-the-art storm surge model, ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation), and the actual observed water elevations from historical hurricane events. Good agreements were found between the simulated and observed water elevations. The model surface wind speeds were also compared with the design wind speeds in ASCE 7-10 and were found to agree well with the design values. Using the peak wind speeds and maximum surge heights, the joint hazard surfaces and the joint hazard maps for Charleston, SC were developed. As part of this study, an interactive computer program, which can be used to obtain the joint wind speed and surge height distributions for any location in terms of latitude and longitude in Charleston area, was created. These joint hazard surfaces and hazard maps can be used in a multi-hazard design or risk assessment framework to consider the combined effects of hurricane wind and surge. total property damages, respectively, which made them among the top ten costliest U.S. Atlantic hurricanes . On average, the annual hurricane loss from 1900 to 2005 in the continental U.S. was estimated to be $10 billion (2005 USD) per year (Pielke et al. 2008). The U.S. coastal population has increased by 39% from 1970 to 2010 (Crossett et al. 2013). Currently, more than 123 million people or 39% of the U.S. population resides in the coastal counties, which account for less than 10% of the total U.S. continental land area. Population growth in the coastal regions along with more high value properties being exposed to hurricane risks may result in future hurricane losses that greatly exceed the current levels of annual losses. Although the U.S. design codes and standards (e.g. ASCE 7-10) consider the combined effects of wind and flood loadings, the joint occurrence probabilities of hurricane wind speeds and surge heights are not properly addressed in any of the current design code or standard . For example, the design wind speed maps for Load Resistance and Factor Design (LRFD) in ASCE 7-10 for Risk Categories I, II, and III & IV correspond to return periods of 300, 700 and 1,700 years, respectively, while the flood elevation maps, also known as the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), are typically developed for 100-or 500-year return periods (FEMA 2008). Using wind speeds and flood elevations from different return periods for engineering design may result in inconsistent and incorrect quantification of the load effects. In ASCE 7-10, the Saffir-Simpson hurricane classification scale  is utilized to provide mapping between the maximum wind speeds, the damage potential of hurricanes, and the corresponding estimated surge heights (see Table C26.5-1 in ASCE 7-10). Although the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale is useful for rapid prediction of the potential storm surge heights, it has been observed in many past storm events that the actual storm surge elevations could differ significantly from that of the Saffir-Simpson scale. This is because the surge elevations are highly dependent on the local bathymetry and topography along with the hurricane wind fields. These factors are not considered in the Saffir-Simpson scale. Thus, the surge height estimates based on the Saffir-Simpson scale may not be reliable. For instance, the 2005 Hurricane Katrina made its second landfall in Louisiana as a Category 3 hurricane with a sustained wind speed of 205 km/h (125 mph) and was expected to produce between 1.9 to 2.7 m of storm surges per the Saffir-Simpson scale (Table C26.5-1 in ASCE 7-10). However, the actual peak surge height of Katrina was measured at 8.5m , which greatly exceeded the expected surge elevations of the Saffir-Simpson scale. Several studies were performed in recent years to consider the combined effects of hurricane wind and surge hazards. to analyze the correlation between wind and flood losses.  introduced a method, which was later modified by Apivatanagul et al. (2011), to estimate the longterm hurricane wind and surge hazards using a reduced set of hurricanes based upon an optimization-based probabilistic scenario. A genetic algorithm was utilized to minimize the weighted summation of errors between the \"true\" hazard curves (i.e. annual probability of exceeding certain wind speed or surge height) and the curves created using the reduced set of hurricanes.  proposed a methodology for creating site-specific joint distributions of combined hurricane wind and surge for Tampa, Florida (FL). In their study, the full-track hurricanes used in the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM)  were utilized to compute the wind speeds and the surge heights were determined using the SLOSH model . This paper presents a methodology adopted and modified from the procedure presented by  to generate the joint hurricane wind and surge hazard maps based upon the peak wind speeds and surge heights produced by individual hurricane events. The methodology was employed to produce joint hurricane wind and surge hazard maps for Charleston, South Carolina. In this study, 50,000 years of simulated hurricanes were generated. The peak wind speeds at Charleston were computed using the Georgiou's wind field model  and the peak surge heights were determined using the SLOSH program. Note that, in this paper, two definitions are used to describe surge elevations: surge height is referred herein as the inundation height (i.e. water elevation with respect to the ground level), while surge level is referred as the water elevation measured from the mean sea level (model output). The use of the term hurricane in this paper also refers to both tropical storm and hurricane-grade storm, which is classified as Categories 1 to 5 per the Saffir-Simpson scale."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane simulation procedure", "text": "Many state-of-the-art hurricane simulation models have been introduced since 1990s for hazard mapping, risk assessment and loss estimation (e.g. Emanuel et al. 2006;Huang et al. 2001).

Each SLOSH basin has a set of predefined structured grids (polar, elliptical or hyperbolic grids) which can be used for storm surge calculations. The SLOSH model allows construction of refined cells close to the shorelines and coarser grids in the offshore. The SLOSH basin used in this study for SC consists of 252 arcs and 314 radials with a resolution of approximately 400m around the City of Charleston area (Fig. 2.3). The accuracy of the SLOSH model was validated using (1) the water level measurements of historical hurricane events at selected CO-OPS (Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services) stations, and (2) the simulated storm surge levels using another state-of-the-art storm surge model, ADCIRC (Luettich et al. 1992). The maximum surge heights recorded from the historical hurricanes since 1975 were computed using the SLOSH model and compared with the measurements from four water level observation stations along the coast of SC (Fig. 2.4). The hurricane events before 1975 were excluded for this analysis due to incomplete central pressure data in the hurricane database (HURDAT). For each water station, all historical hurricanes approached within a distance (measured from the storm center to the water station) of 3 max R were identified and selected for surge calculations. A comparison of the measured and simulated maximum surge heights are shown in Fig. 2.4. As can be clearly seen in this figure, the simulated data generally agree well with the measured data. The RMS (root-mean-square) error between them is about 0.24m. Note that in this study, the joint wind and surge hazard maps were developed only for the Charleston region. While the SLOSH simulation results for four water stations in SC were analyzed for the selected historical hurricane events, only one water station (Station 8665530), which has the least errors, is located in Charleston area. The results of the SLOSH model were also compared to the ADCIRC simulations using 5,000 years of synthetic hurricanes generated using the previously discussed stochastic hurricane simulation approach Liu and Pang 2013 (Pei et al. 2012). This mesh consists of 33,325 nodes and 65,364 elements. Fig. 2.5 shows the simulated maximum surge levels (Fig. 2.5a) and the peak wind speeds (Fig. 2.5b) at Charleston Harbor (latitude: 32.7833\u00b0, longitude: -79.9228\u00b0) using both the SLOSH and the ADCIRC models. A threshold surge level of 0.5m was applied to the simulated data to filter out low surge events with significant noises. It can be seen from the figure that the results of the SLOSH model and the ADCIRC model are highly correlated. However, it appears that the ADCIRC model has a tendency of producing slightly lower surge predictions than the SLOSH model, particularly for higher surge events (Fig. 2.5a). This is attributed to the lower input wind speeds of the ADCIRC, computed using the Georgiou's wind field model (see Fig. 2 Lin et al. (2012) indicated that the SLOSH model predicted lower surge levels than the ADCIRC model. The difference in the findings of our study and that of the Lin et al. (2012) is attributed to the different wind fields used in the ADCIRC storm surge simulations. Half of the storm translational wind speed was added to the analytical wind profile by Emanuel and Rotunno (2011) to form the wind field used in the study by Lin et al. (2012). Based on the validations and comparisons shown in previous sections, the Georgiou's wind field model with duration and elevation conversions is deemed as a better wind field model for wind speed calculation due to its accuracy validated using the ASCE 7-10 design wind speeds (Fig. 2.2) and the over-prediction of the SLOSH wind field model (Fig. 2.5b). The wind speeds calculated using the Georgiou's wind field model are combined with the SLOSH surge outputs to develop the joint hazard maps (described in the next section). Even though the SLOSH wind field tends to over-predict wind speeds, the accuracy of the SLOSH model has been shown to be close to the observations (Houston et al. 1999) and it has been validated in this study using historical data (Fig. 2.4). In SLOSH program, the wind speeds are converted into surface stresses using a drag coefficient. The drag coefficient used in the SLOSH program was calibrated to ensure that the final surge results match the observations at water stations but not the observed wind speeds. Therefore, although the SLOSH surge heights match the observations well, the wind speeds may or may not match the observed wind speeds. For this reason, the wind speeds used to develop the joint hazard maps in this study were computed using the Georgiou's wind field in lieu of the SLOSH wind field. In this study, first a stochastic hurricane simulation program was used to simulate 50,000 years of synthetic hurricanes; then the Georgiou's wind field model was utilized to compute the wind speeds and the SLOSH storm surge model was utilized to compute the surge levels for Charleston, SC. Due to the limitations of the SLOSH model, the tide and wave effects were not considered in the storm surge simulations.

Comparison between the peak surge heights produced by the SLOSH program and ADCIRC+Georgiou's wind field model reveals that the results are highly correlated; hence, it is believed that the impact of wind field on the joint probability is minimal. The selected MRI values (i.e. 100, 300, 700 and 1,700 years) correspond to the typical wind and surge design return periods given in ASCE 7-10, ASCE 24-05 (Flood Resistant Design and Construction, ASCE 2006) and other relevant studies (McInnes et al. 2003, Mercado 1994).

In developing the joint hazard maps for different return periods, three points on each of the MRI curves (hollow shapes in Fig. 2.14) were selected to provide different sets of design data pairs of wind speeds and surge heights. These three points represent (1) a hurricane scenario which yields the maximum surge height but a low wind speed (low wind -high surge), (2) a hurricane scenario which yields the maximum wind speed but zero surge height (high wind -zero surge), and 3 Fig. 2.16 (high wind -zero surge) is not presented because the surge is zero for this scenario. This high wind and zero surge scenario may happen when the wind direction is from land to sea, the storm is moving fast or the size of the storm is relatively small (Irish et al. 2008). The three hazard map pairs (one for wind and one for surge) within each figure represent one point on the particular MRI curve (in this example a 300-yr MRI) given in Fig. 2.14. Using these hazard maps, any site-specific joint hazard design values for combined hurricane wind and surge within Charleston, SC can be obtained."}, {"section_title": "Potential applications", "text": "The joint hazard surfaces and hazard maps developed in this study may have various applications. Two specific applications that may utilize these distributions and maps are related to: (i) new criteria development for design purposes , and (ii) risk assessment and fragility analysis to account for combined hurricane wind and surge effects on structures.  suggested that ordinary structures be designed for combined effects of wind speed and surge level for a 500-year MRI if the LRFD method is used or a 50-year MRI if the Allowable Stress Design (ASD) method is used, and the design requirements for special structures (e.g. nuclear power plants) be determined by the authority having jurisdiction. The HAZUS-MH program developed by FEMA is a risk assessment program designed for estimating potential losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes and floods. The HAZUS-MH program allows users to supply hurricane track information to estimate the combined losses due to both wind and flood (FEMA 2012a; 2012b). The outcomes of this study can be further used to select ensembles of hurricane scenarios with complete tracks for different hazard levels (return periods) and use them to perform loss estimation considering both the losses due to hurricane wind and coastal inundation. For a specific group of structures, the fragility curve describes the probability of failure due to the severity of load conditions applied on the structures. In this case, a fragility surface can be developed as the probability of failure subject to combined wind speeds and surge heights [ ]. Therefore, the following equation can be used to compute the probability of failure due to combined hurricane wind and surge for a particular structure type or system: where, f P is the probability of failure; and is the joint hazard surface which describes the probability of exceedance for combined wind speeds and surge heights (see         developed to display the outcomes at user-specified locations. For design purpose, the joint hazard maps were generated with respect to mean recurrence intervals (MRIs) for joint wind and surge hazards for Charleston, SC. In this study, the effects of tides and waves were not considered. Therefore, the actual water levels might be slightly under-or over-predicted. However, by neglecting the minor coupling effects between the astronomical tide and the surge, the tidal effects can be taken into account by simply adding the tidal water surface elevation changes to the hurricane surge heights synchronously. The wave components, which are important in storm surge simulations, can be considered by running the coupled SLOSH+SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) model (Booij et al. 1999). Even though this study was only performed for Charleston, SC, the procedure presented can be applied to elsewhere. The outcomes of this study can be used in a performance-based design framework for coastal structure design, risk assessment and loss estimation for the combined effects of hurricane wind and surge hazards. Smith and Katz 2013). While none of these hurricanes was a Category 5 event upon landfall , Blake et al. 2013, Berg 2009 per the Saffir-Simpson scale , they are the costliest hurricanes to date because, in part, significant portions of the total losses were due to coastal inundations from wind induced storm surges. To quantify the loss potential of a hurricane, it is important to consider the relationship between wind and flood as well as their joint occurrence probability . However, few studies (e.g. , Apivatanagul et al. 2011 considered the combined effects of wind and flood for hurricane loss assessment. Besides, the computational overhead of regional hurricane loss estimation is very high. It is often not feasible to perform loss assessment using a large number of full-track hurricane events. Thus, there is a need to develop a procedure to select reduced sets of hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios for loss estimation. The hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios are defined herein as the hurricane scenarios having approximately the same mean recurrence intervals (MRIs). A framework was developed by  and later improved by Apivatanagul et al. 2011to select a reduced set of hurricane events to represent the true hurricane wind and flood hazards for a specified region. An optimization algorithm was used in their studies to minimize the weighted summation of errors between the \"true\" annual-exceedance-probability curves for both wind and flood, and the same curves generated using the reduced set of hurricanes. Using the hurricane simulation procedure developed by Vickery et al. (2000b)  . In HAZUS-MH, the wind and flood losses are analyzed separately as \"windonly\" and \"flood-only\" losses using a set of pre-developed fast-running loss functions. The HAZUS \"wind-only\" loss estimation approach is based on a methodology called \"hazard-load-resistance-damage-loss\" methodology (FEMA 2012a). The HAZUS coastal flood model utilizes the hurricane wind field model to drive the storm surge model, and the computed water depth (inundation height) is utilized to estimate the \"flood-only\" loss (FEMA 2012b). The estimated \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" losses are then combined to produce the total loss through a combined loss estimation methodology. This methodology allocates the \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" losses to building subassemblies and then combines them (FEMA 2012b). However, although the hurricane model in HAZUS-MH allows loss estimation to be performed using probabilistic wind hazard maps, the HAZUS-MH coastal flood model only allows one to perform scenariobased loss estimation. Therefore, in order to estimate the combined wind and flood losses for a given hazard level or MRI, one must carefully select hurricane scenarios based on the joint occurrence of hurricane wind and flood. In this paper, a new methodology for the selection of hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios considering the joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood is presented. The proposed methodology can be used to select full-track hurricane ensembles for any given MRI or occurrence probability for regional hurricane loss 67 estimation. The paper is organized such that the detailed hurricane selection procedure is first discussed (Section 3.3) and followed by two case studies (Section 3.4). The HAZUS-MH program was utilized in the case studies to perform regional combined hurricane wind and flood loss estimations. Note that in this study, the term hurricane refers to all levels of tropical cyclones, which include major hurricane (Category 3 or above), hurricane (Category 1 and 2), tropical storm and tropical depression.

This step is used to rapidly identify the candidate hurricanes that will produce significant wind and surge hazards, so that the computational time in Step 3 can be reduced. (3) Wind speed and flood elevation calculation (Section 3.3.4 & 3.3.5): Use a wind field model and a boundary layer model to compute the surface peak wind speeds and a storm surge model to calculate the peak flood elevations for the selected candidate hurricanes from Step 2.

Since the loss estimation domain (either Charleston Peninsula, SC or Miami Beach, FL) is rather small compared to the hurricane simulation domain (i.e. North Atlantic Ocean), a reduced set of candidate hurricanes was identified for each of the loss estimation domains by removing the hurricanes with their tracks relatively far away from the respective domain in order to reduce the computational time of wind speeds and flood elevations. In this study, any simulated hurricane at time step j that came within a distance Dj between the hurricane eye and the loss estimation domain of less than 2Rmax,j was considered as a candidate hurricane and was selected for subsequent wind speed and flood elevation calculations. A sensitivity study was conducted and it showed that the Dj threshold of 2Rmax,j was adequate for the purpose of candidate hurricane selection. Details of this selection procedure and the sensitivity study can be found in ."}, {"section_title": "Wind speed calculation", "text": "The surface wind speeds were calculated using a gradient wind field model and a boundary layer model for each of the selected candidate hurricanes. The gradient wind field at the top of boundary layer was characterized using the Georgiou's wind field model : where, is the gradient wind speed, is the translational/forward speed, \uf062 is the angle measured clockwise from the hurricane translational direction to where the wind speed is being considered, r is the radial distance from hurricane eye to the point of interest, a P is the ambient air pressure, and a \uf072 is the air density. The computed gradient wind speed corresponds to a 10-min sustained wind . The wind duration conversion factors proposed by  and the boundary layer model developed by  were used to convert the calculated 10-min gradient wind speeds to 3-s gusts at the surface level with a 10-m elevation. In , the hurricane boundary layer is modeled as: is the wind speed u at height z ; * u is the friction velocity; k is the von Karman coefficient, taken as 0.4; 0 z is the surface roughness; m and n are the two constants with values of 0.4 and 2.0, respectively; and * H is the boundary layer height parameter computed as: where, K is the turbulent diffusivity of momentum, I is the inertial stability, and the surface drag coefficient. The values of * u , K , and I can be calculated using the following equations: (3.12) where, \uf028 \uf029 10 u is the surface wind speed at 10 m elevation. By substituting Eqns. (3.9) to (3.12) into Eqn. (3.8), an iteration procedure can be used to compute the surface wind speed. A comparison between the computed surface gust wind speeds and the wind speeds calculated by the HAZUS-MH program is provided in Fig. 3.3. In HAZUS-MH, the wind field model (Vickery et al. 2000a) developed by the Applied Research Associates (FEMA 2012a) is utilized to determine the wind speeds. This wind field model has been successfully used to develop the design wind speed maps in the ASCE-7 . As can be clearly seen in Fig. 3.3, wind speeds calculated from the two models (i.e. Vickery et al. 2000a) agree well. Data points presented in Fig. 3.3 came from the peak gust wind speeds calculated using 20 selected hurricane scenarios considering joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood and 40 hurricane scenarios selected based on solely wind speeds and solely flood elevations at centroids of two selected census blocks [(32.7739,-79.944) and (25.8614, -80.12)]. Details of these selected hurricane scenarios and census blocks will be discussed later in Section 3.4. Note that in Fig. 3.3, there are a few hurricane scenarios with wind speeds noticeably higher than the others. This is expected because some of the hurricane scenarios shown in Fig. 3.3 were selected based on only the flood elevations. Without considering the joint occurrence of hurricane wind and flood, the selected hurricane scenarios may not be able to reflect the actual regional hazards.

The SLOSH model is a two-dimensional finite difference hydrodynamic model. It was developed by the National Weather Service for real time forecasting of hurricane storm surges. It also serves as the built-in storm surge model in the HAZUS-MH program (FEMA 2012b). The SLOSH model uses a set of predefined grids which allow refined cells constructed close to the shoreline and coarser ones far away towards the ocean. The SLOSH grids used in this study for the two loss estimation domains are shown in Fig. 3.4.

These hurricane scenarios account for not only the regional effect of the loss estimation domain, but also the event-to-event uncertainty associated with the combined hurricane wind and flood hazards. Since the MRI contours shown in Fig. 3.7 were developed for a specific location (point), a procedure is required to determine the MRI of a hurricane for the entire region (area) so that regional hurricane loss estimation for a specific hazard level can be performed. The event-to-event uncertainty is defined herein as the inherent variability associated with the hurricane events (e.g. storm forward speed and heading direction with respect to the loss estimation domain) and their resultant impacts, such as wind and flood. In other words, hurricanes may produce different losses due to different combinations of peak wind speeds and peak flood elevations even though they have the same MRI (see events/points close to any MRI contour in Fig. 3.7). For example, events having higher wind speeds and lower flood elevations would produce higher \"wind-only\" but lower \"flood-only\" losses comparing with events having lower wind speeds and higher flood elevations. In this study, the regional (area) effect was considered for every candidate hurricane by weighting their site-specific MRI values using population in each of the census blocks, and the event-to-event uncertainty was accounted for by using an ensemble of hurricane scenarios that cover a wide range of wind speed and flood elevation combinations for each hazard level (or MRI). In the case studies, ten hurricanes were selected for each ensemble. The weighted MRI (WMRI) for each of the candidate hurricanes was computed using the site-specific MRI values determined from Eqn. (3.16) and the population of every census block: This regional weighted MRI concept can be thought of as the average mean recurrence interval observed by the population in the loss estimation domain. While population was used as the weighting factor in this study, one may use any other weighting factor that is reasonable, such as total building replacement value, number of essential facilities, etc. The computed WMRIs were then used to identify and select individual hurricane events to be included in the ensemble of hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios for the loss estimation domain at a target WMRI level. The hurricane selection procedure is proposed as follows (Steps 1 to 6) and illustrated in Fig. 3.8 and Table 3.1: (1) For the centroid of a census block, select and plot all candidate hurricane events, in terms of peak wind speeds and peak flood elevations, with their WMRIs falling in a target WMRI range (e.g. 100yr \u00b1 10yr) (see Fig. 3.8a); (2) Normalize the wind speed and flood elevation values of the selected hurricane events from Step (1) by their maximum and minimum wind speeds and flood elevations, respectively (see Fig. 3.8b); (3) Compute the arctangent angle \u03b8 from each of the normalized data points (events) to the origin of the plot (see Fig. 3.8c); (4) Use the cumulative distribution of the arctangent angles to group the data points into a number of equal probability bins (e.g. ten bins) and number these bins (i.e. #1, #2, \u2026) (see Fig. 3.8d); (5) Repeat Steps (1) to (4) for each of the census blocks; "}, {"section_title": "85", "text": "(6) For each bin (e.g. #1), select the most common/frequent hurricane event amongst all census blocks (see Table 3.1) as the hurricane scenario to represent that particular bin (e.g. #1) .

These centroids were later used to develop the site-specific joint MRI contours for the selection of hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios. Six census blocks were selected and numbered from 1 to 6 ( Fig. 3.9a,b), which were next used to show the developed joint MRI contour plots (Fig. 3.10) and the selected hurricane scenarios (Fig.   3.11). Information regarding the loss estimation domains is obtained from the HAZUS-MH program based upon the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau survey data (FEMA 2012a,b). For Charleston Peninsula, SC, approximately 86% of the buildings are residential houses, which account for about 59% of the total building replacement value; while for Miami Beach, FL, roughly 78% of the buildings are residential houses, which account for about 72% of the total building replacement value. model to determine the flood elevations (Section 3.3.5).

The centroid locations of these census blocks are plotted in Fig. 3.9a,c. For simplicity, the selected census blocks are numbered from 1 to 6 (see Fig. 3.9a,c and Fig.   3.10). However, the 15-digit 2000 U.S. Census Bureau census block number is still given in Fig. 3.10, along with the latitude and longitude information, for each of the selected census blocks (see the subtitle of every sub-figure). As can be clearly seen in Fig. 3.10, all selected census blocks in either Charleston Peninsula, SC or Miami Beach, FL have similar maximum wind speeds due to the relatively small sizes of the loss estimation domains. For any given MRI level, wind speeds in census blocks from Charleston Peninsula, SC are generally smaller than those in census blocks from Miami Beach, FL. This is because Miami Beach, FL has a higher chance of experiencing strong winds than Charleston Peninsula, SC due to their geographical locations. However, the flood elevations do not follow these rules. For Charleston Peninsula, SC, Block #1 has the highest flood elevations, while Block #3 has the lowest. It is because Block #1 has the closest proximity to the ocean, while Block #3 is the farthest from the coast among all these census blocks (Fig. 3.9a). For Miami Beach, FL, Block #4 has the lowest flood elevations, while the flood elevations for Blocks #5 and #6 are similar. Since all three census blocks in Miami Beach, FL are close to the coast (Fig. 3.9c), local topography (i.e. Block #4 has the highest altitude) is the main reason that results in the flood elevation differences. These joint MRI contours were next used to select hurricane scenarios for regional combined hurricane wind and flood loss estimation, which is discussed in a later sub-section. "}, {"section_title": "Hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios", "text": "Following the procedure proposed in Section 3.3.7, an ensemble of 10 hazardconsistent hurricane scenarios with a target WMRI level of 100 years were selected for each of the two loss estimation domains. The selected hurricane scenarios along with the normalized wind speeds and normalized flood elevations used in the selection process are plotted in Fig. 3.11 for each of the six selected census blocks (see Fig. 3.9a,c and Fig.   3.10). In Fig. 3.11, the hurricane scenarios are numbered such that each of them corresponds to the same bin number that was used to select the hurricane scenario. It should be noted that, in the last step (Step 6) of the selection process, the most common event was selected for each bin from the events with the same bin numbers in all census blocks. Due to the regional effect, the bins with the same numbers do not necessarily contain the same events. Therefore, the selected hurricane scenarios plotted in Fig. 3.11 (stars) do not necessarily fall in the same bins. However, they generally scatter well along the 100-year WMRI contour line and provide a good coverage of all possible combinations of wind speeds and flood elevations. The tracks of the 20 selected hurricane scenarios (10 for Charleston Peninsula, SC and 10 for Miami Beach, FL) are presented in Fig. 3.12. It can be seen from Fig. 3.11 and Fig. 3.12 that, in general, the hurricane events (#1 to #5 for Charleston Peninsula, SC and #1 to #6 for Miami Beach, FL) that pass by the left side (western or southern side) of the loss estimation domain tend to produce higher flood elevations than those (#6 to #10 for Charleston Peninsula, SC and #7 to #10 for Miami Beach, FL) that pass through the right side (eastern and northern side) of the domain. This is because the wind velocities of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere follow a counter-clockwise rotation. Therefore, for those hurricanes that pass through the left side of the loss estimation domain, the hurricane wind driven floods move towards the land resulting in higher flood elevations. The selected hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios were next used to characterize the 100-year combined hurricane wind and flood losses for the two loss estimation domains.  For either Charleston Peninsula, SC or Miami Beach, FL, the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the combined hurricane wind and flood losses along with the corresponding \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" loss estimates for the 10 respective hurricane scenarios are plotted in Fig. 3.13. The lines with solid triangle, square and circle markers represent the \"wind-only\", \"flood-only\" and combined losses, respectively. The numbers labeled next to the markers are the hurricane scenario numbers, same as those shown in Fig. 3.11. The detailed loss statistics are summarized in Table 3.3. It can be concluded from Fig. 3.13 and Table 3.3 that: (1) Scenarios #8 and #1 for Charleston Peninsula, SC and #5 and #1 for Miami Beach, FL have the highest and lowest \"wind-only\" losses, separately; Scenarios #4 and #7 for Charleston Peninsula, SC and #6 and #10 for Miami Beach, FL have the highest and lowest \"flood-only\" losses, respectively; while the scenarios having the highest and lowest combined losses belong to #4 and #7 for Charleston Peninsula, SC and #6 and #7 for Miami Beach, FL. Therefore, using hurricane scenarios selected based on either only wind speeds or only flood elevations may not reflect the actual regional losses. The joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood should be considered when performing scenario-based loss assessment. This conclusion was later proved by comparing the combined hurricane losses with those estimated using scenarios selected based on only wind speeds and only flood elevations. (2) As anticipated, Scenarios #1 to #6 produce higher \"flood-only\" losses than Scenarios #7 to #10 for either Charleston Peninsula, SC or Miami Beach, FL due to the aforementioned reason that Scenarios #1 to #6 that pass by the left side of the study region can generate higher flood elevations than Scenarios #7 to #10 (see Section 3.4.3). However, the \"wind-only\" losses do not follow this rule. The \"wind-only\" losses are governed by a number of hurricane parameters including central pressure, radius to maximum winds, translational/forward speed, etc. Also as expected, in Charleston Peninsula, SC, the percentage \"wind-only\" losses are smaller but the percentage \"floodonly\" losses are greater than the \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" losses in Miami Beach, FL for the same 100-year MRI level (see Table 3.3). This is because Miami Beach, FL is more likely to experience higher wind speeds but lower flood elevations due to its higher hurricane proneness as well as altitudes than Charleston Peninsula, SC (see discussions in Section 3.4.2). (3) The \"flood-only\" losses are usually higher than the \"wind-only\" losses and the combined losses tend to be controlled by the \"flood-only\" losses for the 100-year hazard level in Charleston Peninsula, SC. Different results are observed in Miami Beach, FL, in which the \"wind-only\" losses are similar with the \"flood-only\" losses and the combined losses are governed by both the \"wind-only\" and the \"flood-only\" losses. It should be noted that these two case studies were performed in two different regions. As discussed above, the overall ground elevation of Charleston in SC is lower than Miami Beach, FL; therefore, Charleston is more vulnerable to flood inundations from hurricanes than Miami Beach. (4) The CoV values of the \"wind-only\" losses are smaller than those of the \"flood-only\" losses, while the combined losses have the least CoV values. This finding suggests that there are more uncertainties in \"flood-only\" losses than \"wind-only\" losses, but the combined losses are more certain. The CoVs of the estimated losses for Charleston Peninsular, SC are larger than the CoVs for Miami Beach, FL. In other words, the hurricane scenarios selected for Charleston Peninsula, SC have a larger event-to-event uncertainty than those selected for Miami Beach, FL. These inherent event-to-event uncertainties have been properly addressed using the proposed methodology for selecting hazard-consistent hurricane ensembles.   Fig. 3.6, 10 hurricane scenarios each were selected for Charleston Peninsula, SC and Miami Beach, FL for the 100-year hazard level based on solely wind speeds (10 scenarios) and solely flood elevations (10 scenarios), i.e. without considering the joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood. The marginal distributions of wind speeds and flood elevations were used in this selection procedure. The marginal distributions at centroids of two selected census blocks (one from Charleston Peninsula, SC and one from Miami Beach, FL) are given in Fig. 3.14. Note that the marginal distributions can be obtained using the method discussed in However, these scenarios could produce completely different combined hurricane wind and flood losses, which are discussed next in this section, with those estimated using scenarios selected considering joint probabilities of hurricane wind and flood. These hurricane scenarios were analyzed using the HAZUS-MH program as well. In Fig. 3.16, the CDFs of the combined hurricane wind and flood losses for the two scenario-based analyses were compared with the combined losses from Fig. 3.13 to recover from a 100-year return period storm with a 10% non-exceedance probability. From Fig. 3.16a, the Charleston city mayor would need roughly $848 million based on the joint wind and flood method. On the other hand, the estimated losses were $1140 million and $1631 million for marginal wind and marginal flood methods, respectively, which significantly overestimated the losses. In Fig. 3.16b, the extremely high losses in the upper percentile are the combined hurricane losses produced by hurricane scenarios selected based on only flood elevations. Since the selection did not consider the joint wind effect, it has a potential chance of selecting hurricane scenarios that have very high wind speeds (also see discussion in Section 3.3.4). That means the hurricane selection procedure presented in this study considering the joint occurrence of hurricane wind and flood is crucial for obtaining accurate regional hurricane loss estimations. 104 Although in this study the loss estimations were only performed using the HAZUS-MH program, the combined hurricane wind and flood losses can also be analyzed by any other loss assessment package which utilizes the selected hzardconsistent hurricane scenarios. By using the hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios, one may also develop the joint loss contour plot which represents the combined hurricane losses in terms of wind speeds and flood elevations for different consistent hazard levels. Additionally, even though the case studies were only conducted for two loss estimaion domians, the proposed hurricane selection methodology can be applied to any other coastal areas for regional loss estimation considering the joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood. The outcomes of this study can be used to help insurance companies to determine their insurance premiums based on the actual wind and flood damage risk. The results can also assist coastal jurisdictions to conduct regional retrofit planning and hurricane hazard mitigation."}, {"section_title": "References", "text": "American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Agent-based model (ABM) has been identified as one of the most promising analytical techniques for studying the global behavior of complex systems. The ABM, which has seen significant acceptance in the research community in the past two decades, is a relatively new computational method (Gilbert 2008). Agent-based simulation is a bottom-up method. While ABM is able to model complex systems, it does not define the global behavior of the system, but instead it defines the behavior of each individual, which leads to the emergence of the global behavior (Borshchev and Filippov 2004). These individuals are called \"agents\". In ABM, a system is composed of agents and the environment where the agents interact with each other (Gilbert 2008). Agents' behaviors are defined using certain rules. Their interactions with each other as well as the environment can affect these rules and in turn influence agents' behaviors (Macal and North 2010). By modeling agents' behaviors and interactions one by one, the behavior of the entire system can be revealed. Owing to the flexibility of the ABM, it has been applied successfully to a wide variety of fields and disciplines (Axelrod andTesfatsion 2006, Macal andNorth 2010), for example, economics (e.g. Tesfatsion 2002, Tesfatsion and Judd 2006, Chen 2012, biological science (e.g. Preziosi 2003, Troisi et al. 2005, Folcik et al. 2007, public health (e.g. Bagni et al. 2002, Carley et al. 2006, Epstein et al. 2007, warfare (e.g. Epstein 2002, Cederman 2003, Hill et al. 2006, etc. The ABM has seen increasing applications in hurricane research and wind engineering community, in particular, to model evacuation pattern and behavior. Chen et al. (2006) developed an agent-based hurricane evacuation model for the Florida Keys using survey data. This model was able to estimate not only the minimum clearance time of the evacuation but also the accommodations required if the evacuation was interrupted by a landfall hurricane. Zhang et al. (2009) presented another agent-based model, which accounted for the interactions among agents, for hurricane evacuations at household level. Both normal and greedy agents were modeled. The greedy agent, unlike the normal agent, who always took the shortest route, made decisions between the shortest and least congested routes. The efficiency of the evacuation was found to be reduced by the presence of the greedy agents. Coalition formation mechanism during disasters was investigated by Boloni et al. (2007)  This paper is organized such that an overview of the agent-based hurricane mitigation framework is presented in Section 4.3, followed by Sections 4.4 to 4.9, describing the details of the mitigation framework.

This framework, which consists of six essential modules, specifically accounts for the agents' responses to incentives and hurricane hazards through modeling of the agents' behaviors. The six modules are Buildings, Agents, Retrofits, Hazards, Constructions & Demolitions, and Incentives (see Fig. 4.1). The six modules were modeled as individual entities with interactions between one and another. The relationships among the six modules are marked as arrows, which indicate the influences of one module or entity on the other (Fig. 4.1). For instance, the hurricane wind and flood hazards can damage the buildings and cause financial losses, and the same hazards can also influence the agents' psychological attributes (e.g. risk perception and hurricane experience). The implementation of Retrofits, marked as a circle, depends on the agents' decision-making processes, which are affected by both the Hazards and the Incentives modules. Summaries of the six modules are given below: (2) Agents -People living in buildings were modeled as agents in the mitigation hurricane knowledge, hazard intrusiveness, hurricane experience, etc.), which are indispensable in the modeling of agents' behaviors, were also considered. constructions each year was based on historical housing construction data. An algorithm was developed to locate these new constructions. Buildings were demolished due to either destructive damages after hurricanes or aging when the buildings were too old (an older building has a higher probability of being demolished). (6) Incentives -Agents in the mitigation framework could respond to different incentives, such as property tax reduction, lower insurance premiums, lower-interest loans, etc., and make decisions on the selections of retrofit measures. The cost-benefit of an incentive was evaluated by analyzing the cost of implementing the incentive which includes the retrofit costs and the loss reduction due to the incentive for the combined hurricane wind and flood hazards. The modeling process of the proposed ABM hurricane mitigation framework consists of two phases, namely, domain creation and time history simulation. In domain creation phase, the initial locations and attributes of individual buildings as well as those of individual agents were determined using historical survey data. At the beginning of the time history simulation phase, an incentive was applied to the study domain. The incentive program evaluated in this study contained various levels of property tax reduction provided by the county. For example, 50% of the annual property tax could be used towards hurricane retrofits. For a given incentive level, simulations were performed at a fixed time step (one month was used in this study) to evaluate the state of condition of the entire system (i.e. interactions among the six modules). At every time step, the building and the agent attributes were updated no matter there was a hurricane or not. Agents were simulated to respond to incentives and natural hazards, and decide if they wanted to retrofit their buildings. New constructions and demolitions were simulated at every time step as well. Once there was a hurricane, the combined wind and flood loss estimation was performed using the HAZUS-MH damage and loss functions. The updates of building attributes and inventory (including demolitions), as well as agent attributes were also carried out after each hurricane event. The following Sections are organized to describe this process in detail."}, {"section_title": "Building locations and attributes", "text": "As stated previously, the ABM is a bottom-up method. The key feature of the agent-based modeling is to model individual agent's behavior from the bottom and reveal the global behavior of the complex system. This requires explicit modeling of the agents' (householders') behaviors and buildings that exist in the hazard mitigation domain. In this study, only residential buildings were taken into account. Commercial structures such as sport stadiums and shopping malls, and infrastructures such as highway bridges were not included. Each residential building was modeled as a point entity, which contains location information (latitude and longitude) and other attributes such as building type and square footage, but was considered to be dimensionless (i.e. no area footprint) on a map (see Fig. 4.2). The buildings were grouped based on the HAZUS-MH methodology, which has five general building types (GBTs) and eight specific occupancy types (SOTs).  -80.362 -80.361 -80.36 -80.359 -80.358 -80.357 -80.356 -80.355 25 census data (U.S. Census Bureau 2011). As mentioned above, however, the unit number may not be the same as the building number. Therefore, the ACS data were used to convert the housing unit counts into building counts for each individual census block. The data available in ACS were housing unit counts for each SOT at census block group level. The census block group is a group of census blocks. Since there were no such data available in ACS at census block level, we used the data at census block group level to perform the conversions. The steps for determining the number of buildings in a census block are as follows: (1) For each census block, use the unit counts to determine the maximum possible building counts by assuming that buildings are always built along the roadways and have setback distances to the roads. The road network and census block geographic information is available on the U.S. Census Bureau website (U.S. Census Bureau 2012a). Once the layout of the roadways was known for the census block, thresholds for two types of building setback distances were applied to determine the maximum possible building numbers allowed in a particular census block. The two setback distances are the distances from buildings to roads (DTRs) and the distances between buildings (DBBs). The DTR and DBB were defined as the average minimum distances obtained through surveys of sample building layouts in the case study region -Miami-Dade County, FL (see Section 4.10 for details) via Google Map. For Miami-Dade County, the DTR and DBB setback distances were determined to be 18 m and 12 m, respectively. (2) For every census block group, the possible building counts for each SOT was computed based on the unit counts of that SOT obtained from the ACS data. Given the lower and upper limits of the unit numbers of a SOT [e.g. a RES3c (5-9 units) has housing units no less than 5 but no more than 9] and the total unit counts in the census block group, a list of possible building counts could be constructed. For example, in a census block group, there were 14 housing units for the SOT -RES3c. The possible combinations of building counts for this example could be one RES3c with 5 units and one with 9 units, one RES3c with 6 units and one with 8 units, or two RES3c with 7 units each. (3) For each SOT in the census block group, randomly select building counts obtained from Step (2) and assign the corresponding unit counts to the census blocks in that census block group. Once the unit counts were assigned to a census block, they were subtracted from the unit counts of that census block. The process started from the SOT with the highest upper limit of the unit numbers (e.g. RES3f with 50+ units), and the unit counts were ranked in a descending order and assigned randomly to the census blocks. Iterations were performed, if necessary, when the unit counts being assigned were larger than the unit counts left in any census block within the census block group, or the final assigned building counts in a census block were larger than the maximum building counts [obtained from Step 1] allowed in that census block. If the maximum iteration number (i.e. 500 in this study) was reached before finding a solution, the previous assignment with the largest DBB was accepted. An example is provided in Appendix A to better illustrate this process. Once the process introduced above was completed, the number of buildings for each census block was determined. The next step was to assign the geographic locations (latitudes and longitudes) of these buildings within the census blocks. A similar procedure as the one used to determine the maximum building counts allowed in a census block [see Step (1) above] was used to locate these buildings. The buildings were located along the roadways with setback distances to the roads. Three groups of DTR and DBB setback distances for different SOT combinations were considered (see Appendix B for details). These values were defined as the average (not minimum) distances measured from a survey of the building layouts in Miami-Dade County performed using Google Map. If the DBB in a census block allowed more buildings to be located than the number of buildings determined from the aforementioned process, empty cells (lots) were left in that census block for potential future constructions (see Section 4.8.2). If the average DBB was too large to accommodate all the buildings in a census block, the minimum DBB [see Step (1) above] was applied. If the minimum DBB still could not accommodate all the buildings, the building number was reduced to match the maximum building number allowed in that census block. This adjustment only affected less than 3% of the census blocks in Miami-Dade County, FL. A comparison between the building locations generated using the algorithm or procedure discussed above and their actual locations on a Google map is presented in Fig. 4.2. It can be clearly seen that the modeled locations (solid circles) agree well with their actual locations.  Census, 2011ACS, 2003. Among these databases, the ACS database (U.S. Census Bureau 2012e), which provided data at census block group level, was the primary data source utilized in this study for assigning the building attributes (e.g. year built, household income, etc.). While many of the attributes can be modeled using continuous distributions, many others are defined using discrete values, referred herein as categories. For instance, there are 9 categories (i.e. 2005-2010, 2000-2004, 1990-1999, \u2026, 1940-1949, 1910-1939) for the attributeyear built. The probability mass functions (PMFs) obtained from the survey data (e.g. ACS data) and the correlations between attributes (e.g. correlation between household income and square footage) were used to assign attributes to buildings. The PMF is site or census-block-group specific. It represents the discrete probability of every category in an attribute. For each building in the census block group, the attribute values or category numbers were assigned based on the empirical PMFs. One example PMF for the year built attribute for an example census block group in Miami-Dade County is provided in  2005-2010 2000-2004 1990-1999 1980-1989 1970-1979 1960-1969 1950-1959 1940-1949 1910-1939 PMF ( (2) Household income -16 income ranges numbered from 1 to 16 were considered. These ranges are $0-$9,999, $10,000-$14,999, \u2026, $45,000-$49,999, $50,000 -59,999, $60,000-$74,999, $75,000-$99,999, $100,000-$124,999, $125,000-$149,999, $150,000-$199,999, and 200,000+. The income range numbers were randomly assigned to each building following the corresponding PMF. The exact amount of the income was then taken as the middle value of the income range assigned. For example, if the income range assigned to a building was $10,000-$14,999, the exact amount of income assigned was assumed to be $12,500. For a multi-family apartment building (e.g. RES1; 1 story for RES2; and 1-2 stories, 3-4 stories, and 5+ stories for RES3), and five garage types (i.e. 1-car, 2-car, 3-car, carport, and none) were taken into account. These characteristics were assigned by first calculating the income ratio, which is the fraction of the household income and the median income of the census block group where the building is located. The construction class, number of stories and garage type attributes were assigned following the PMFs, which are function of the income ratio, obtained from the HAZUS-MH program. The building square footage, construction class, number of stories, and garage type are crucial attributes for the determination of the building replacement value, which is discussed later in this Sub-section. (5) Building types -For the purpose of implementing the HAZUS-MH combined wind and flood loss estimation methodology, the building types were assigned to each individual building. The SOTs were assigned when locating buildings to each census block (see discussion in Section 4.4.1). The SBT was converted from SOT using a mapping scheme in HAZUS-MH (see Appendix B). 39 different SBTs were considered. Among others, these SBTs include wood single-family one-story building (WSF1), masonry multi-unit two-story building (MMUH2), low-rise (1-2 stories) steel engineered residential building (SERBL), and manufactured home (MHPHUD). Buildings can have different configurations even though they belong to the same SBT. For instance, WSF1 can have gable or hip roof shape, and it also allows toe-nailed or strapped roof-to-wall connection. Each configuration is named a WBT for a given SBT. There are thousands of WBTs and all of them were modeled in this hurricane mitigation framework. The PMFs for WBTs from the HAZUS-MH program were used to perform the assignments. Since the HAZUS-MH data were updated in the year 2003, adjustments were made to account for the changes of PMFs due to the changes in building codes in the past years (see County, FL is presented in Fig. 4.4. (7) FIRM type -Two different FIRM types were considered, namely, pre-FIRM and post-FIRM. A pre-(post-) FIRM building is a building that was built before (after) the effective date of the first FIRM for a community. The pre-FRIM building is typically under-designed because it was built before the community first adopted the detailed flood hazard data. The FIRM type was used to assign foundation types and heights to buildings. The effective date of the first FIRM can be found on the FEMA website (FEMA 2013b) for all coastal communities. The buildings built before and after the effective dates are classified as pre-and post-FIRM, respectively. The assignment of FIRM type was based on the year built attribute. the post-FIRM coastal V zone buildings. The maximum foundation heights were also modeled differently for pre-and post-FIRM buildings. In pre-FIRM constructions, buildings were only required to be built with their foundation heights less than the maximum heights allowed; while in post-FIRM constructions, foundation heights must be greater than or equal to the BFEs at those locations but also capped by the maximum allowed foundation heights. The foundation heights were later used in loss assessment to compute the flood elevations above the building first floors.  "}, {"section_title": "Agent attributes", "text": "Agent is the most critical part in this agent-based hurricane mitigation framework. Agents interact with other entities (e.g. buildings) in the loss estimation domain to make decisions and they connect all other portions in the system as a whole. Like the buildings, agents were modeled from bottom up as well. This includes the modeling of their locations and attributes. In current version of the ABM, only householders were modeled as agents and the movements of agents were not considered. Therefore, the agents were assumed to be co-located with the buildings. The attributes, which include both demographic and psychological attributes, of each individual agent were assigned using the same probabilistic method discussed previously for Buildings. These attributes are income, age, gender, race, education, years in residence, with child under 12 in home, hurricane knowledge, hazard intrusiveness, hurricane experience, and damage experience. The last four are psychological attributes and the rests are demographic attributes. The ACS and the HLMBS data were used to develop the PMFs for the assignments of the demographic and the psychological attributes, respectively. The PMFs and other correlations utilized for the assignments of agents' (householders') attributes in Miami-Dade County, FL are documented in Appendix C. These attributes were selected for the purpose of modeling agents' behaviors via their responses to incentives and hurricane hazards. Details are given below: (1) Income and age -The agent income is the same as the household income assigned previously in Section 4.4.2 (2). The procedure used in the assignment of agent's age was also similar to the one used in the assignment of the building year built attribute [see Section 4.4.2 1]. We assumed that there was only one agent (i.e. property owner) associated with each multi-family (RES3) building. The age of an agent (householder) could not be less than 15 years old according to the ACS data. (2) Gender, race, and education -Per the ACS data, the PMF for gender was model as a function of age. Following the survey data by Peacock (2003b), we considered two different race groups, black/non-black and Hispanic/non-Hispanic. The correlation between these two groups was considered (see Appendix C). For example, an agent within a black race group has a lower chance to be Hispanic than an agent with a nonblack attribute. The education attribute was modeled as the highest year that an agent completed in school. It was a function of age and gender per the ACS data. (3) Years in residence and with child under 12 in home -Years in residence was modeled using the PMF fitted to ACS data as a function of the agent's age and the year built of the structure (see Appendix C). It is obvious that the age of the building cannot be smaller than the years in residence of the agent who lives in the building, and the years in residence cannot be larger than the agent's age minus 15, which is the earliest time he/she could become an agent (homeowner) [see discussion in (1)]. The attribute \"with child under 12 in home\" was modeled by first checking if there was a child under 18 in home, then the exact age was assigned to the child using the PMF developed from the ACS data. (4) Hurricane knowledge, hazard intrusiveness, hurricane experience, and damage experience -These psychological attributes were assigned to each agent using the PMFs obtained from the HLMBS data. In HLMBS, agents' answers to multiple questions were analyzed. The survey results indicated their psychological attributes of different kinds (e.g. hurricane knowledge, hazard intrusiveness, etc.). These psychological attributes were scaled into discrete values so as to model agents' behaviors using statistical models (Peacock et al. 2005, Ge et al. 2011. The hurricane knowledge was scaled from 1 to 4 as not very knowledgeable, slightly knowledgeable, somewhat knowledgeable, and highly knowledgeable, respectively; the hazard intrusiveness was scaled from 1 to 5 as never, rarely, occasionally, somewhat often, and very often, separately; and the hurricane and damage experiences were scaled as 1 or 0, indicating whether or not experienced hurricane and damage before, respectively. If an agent did not experience a hurricane, there would be no chance for him/her to experience hurricane damage. These scaled psychological attributes were used to quantify the agents' risk perceptions and their behaviors or decision-makings for hurricane retrofits. The creation of the initial simulation domain is completed when the assignments for locations and attributes for the agents and buildings are completed. The locations of the householders along with the assigned age attribute are plotted in Fig. 4.7. The comparisons between the overall PMFs from the survey data and the assigned statistics for selected agent attributes are given in Fig. 4.8. Good agreements between the empirical PMFs and the histograms of the simulated attributes are observed.

We considered different wind and flood retrofit measures for different building types. Some common ones include installing secondary water resistance, improving roof deck attachment (e.g. from 6d@6/12 to 8d@6/6), improving roof-wall connection (toenail to strap), installing shutter, adding wet flood-proofing, adding dry flood-proofing, constructing levees or floodwalls, etc. The complete list of retrofit measures considered in this study is given in Table 4.2.

Using the HAZUS-MH loss and damage functions, the combined losses due to wind and flood were estimated by first computing the \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" losses, separately, and then combining them (FEMA 2012a,b). The HAZUS-MH \"wind-only\" loss estimation approach is based on a methodology called \"hazard-load-resistance-damageloss\" methodology (FEMA 2012a), which is illustrated in Fig. 4.9. Both \"wind-only\" damages and losses can be obtained from this methodology. The \"wind-only\" losses account for not only the losses due to pure wind speeds but also those caused by tree blow-downs (FEMA 2012a). The HAZUS-MH coastal flood model uses the HAZUS-MH hurricane wind field model to drive both the storm surge and the wave models. The wave height is used to determine the flood hazard zone (A-zone or V-zone), and the water depth (i.e. inundation height) is utilized to estimate the \"flood-only\" damage and loss (FEMA 2012b). Note that, this flood hazard zone, which was only used to implement the HAZUS-MH loss estimation methodology, is different with the flood zones assigned in Section 4.4.2 (6). Since no wave model was used in this mitigation framework, the wave height was estimated through an equation [i.e. Eqn. (15) in Section 3.3.5]. These damage and loss functions were assigned to each building in Section 4.4.2 (11). As illustrative examples, the damage and loss functions for a typical one-story single family wood building without basement in coastal V-zone for both wind and flood damage and loss estimations are given in Fig. 4.10. Note that, building damage and loss are only functions of peak wind speeds or maximum flood elevations. The wind damage function reports the probability of reaching or exceeding a given damage state (Ds or ds) (i.e. minor, moderate, severe, and destructive) and the wind loss function defines the wind loss in terms of percentage building replacement value. Since there was only one flood damage function (this damage function has the same functionality as the wind loss function) for both flood damage and loss estimations, the flood damage was defined as a fraction of the building replacement value (Legg et al. 2013). Fig. 4.9: HAZUS-MH wind-only loss estimation approach. Once the wind speed and flood elevation on a specific building were determined, the \"wind-only\" and the \"flood-only\" damage and loss were then computed. To calculate the monetary loss of a building, its replacement value is required. The determined damage state was next used to decide if a building needs to be demolished or not (see Section 4.8.3). The estimated \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" losses were utilized to compute the combined wind and flood losses using the following approach: (1) Allocate the \"wind-only\" (W) and \"flood-only\" (F) losses expressed as fractions of the building replacement value to seven building sub-assemblies, which include foundation, structure frame, exterior wall, roof cover, etc., as a function of SOT and building loss. (2) Calculate the combined loss for each sub-assembly with the \"wind-only\" (Ws) and \"flood-only\" (Fs) losses expressed as fractions of their respective replacement values (i.e. replacement values of sub-assemblies): where, Cs is the combined wind and flood loss of each sub-assembly. (3) Multiple the combined loss of each sub-assembly (Cs) calculated from the previous Step by its replacement value expressed as a percentage of the building replacement value. (4) Compute the combined loss (C) by summing up the outcomes from Step 3and apply the following constraint so that the combined loss does not exceed the building replacement value: Note that, Eqn. (4.1) is based on the assumption that \"wind-only\" and \"flood-only\" losses are statically independent. The methodology summarized above was also applied to estimate the content losses. The content loss was estimated using a different set of loss functions and the value of content was assumed to be 50% of the building replacement value (FEMA 2012a,b). The total loss of a building includes both building and content losses. developed from the building permits data, were \"copied and pasted\" to the future. In other words, the future new construction rates were assumed to follow the exact same trends as the past (see Fig. 4.11a). The other scenario utilized the so-called \"headship rate\" method. The headship rate is the percentage of householders in a pre-defined population group (e.g. grouped by age, gender, race, or others) (Myers et al. 2002, Davidson andRivera 2003). Since the householder number is the same as the housing unit number (there is only one householder associated with a housing unit), the housing unit number can be estimated once the headship rate and the corresponding population are known. In this scenario, we used the 2010 U.S. Census data to calculate the headship rate and we assumed it would not change over the simulation time period. The population projections for Miami-Dade County were attained from the Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse (University of Florida 2013). Using these headship rate and population data, the number of future housing units constructed could be obtained. These housing unit numbers were then converted into building numbers for each SOT using the mean value of the unit boundaries of that SOT [e.g. for a RES3c (5-9 units), building number = unit number / 7]. The numbers of new constructed RES1 over time in Miami-Dade County, FL for the two scenarios used in the hurricane mitigation framework are plotted in Fig. 4.11. Solid lines indicate survey data and dash lines represent future projections. The linear interpolations of the projected populations, which were reported every five years, resulted in the horizontal lines in Fig. 4.11b. The cumulative numbers of new constructions for the two scenarios are plotted in Fig. 4.11c. As can be clearly seen, the resultant new constructions from these two scenarios are close. But for the first 25 years, new constructions from Scenario I are slightly lower than those from Scenario II. 149 "}, {"section_title": "Locations of new constructions", "text": "The new constructed buildings were located in the hurricane mitigation domain using the following methodology. The new constructions could locate either in predefined empty cells or lots (see Section 4.4.1) or in an empty census block which was not occupied by buildings before. Road networks were generated artificially in empty census  blocks for the purpose of locating new constructions using the methodology discussed in Section 4.4.1 (i.e. using building setback distances from roadways). To mimic the growth of the cities, we assumed that the empty census blocks closer to the census blocks with previously constructed new buildings had higher probabilities to be selected for new constructions than those that were further away with only older constructions. For Miami-Dade County, these probabilities were modeled as the inverses of the distances to census blocks with new constructions. Besides, the new constructions with a specific SOT tended to be built in or close to a census block having buildings with the same type of SOT (e.g. single family dwellings and apartments usually do not collocate in the same sub-division). For each new construction, the building and agent attributes (see Section 4.4 and 4.5) were assigned using the aforementioned data and methods accordingly. However, psychosocial attributes of the new agents (i.e. agents associated with new buildings), which were possibly moved in from the outside of the hurricane mitigation domain, were assumed to be weaker (e.g. less knowledgeable about hurricane) than the existing agents (see Appendix C for details)."}, {"section_title": "Demolitions of buildings", "text": "As mentioned above, demolition of a building occurred either when the building was too old to be used or when it was destructively damaged after a hurricane.

Since the wind damage function only provides the probability to a damage state, a random number (0 and 1) was generated to decide if the building reached a particular damage state. If the building reached the destructive damage state, the building was demolished. The destructive damage state for flood hazard was defined as the damage state that accounts for no less than 40% of the building replacement value (Legg et al. 2013). The buildings might also be demolished due to aging. The building demolition rate (Table 4.3) as a function of age was obtained from the 2012 U.S. Census Housing Unit Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau 2012c). A building was deemed demolished if the generated random number (between 0 and 1) was less than the demolition rate shown in Table 4.3 for the age group of the building. In this study, since the movements of agents were not considered, the primary focus of the developed ABM framework was to investigate the influences of incentives and hurricane hazards on the agents' decision-making processes. The way how agents' psychological attributes change due to encountered hazards is discussed in the next Subsection, followed by the implementation of the statistical models developed for the modeling of agents' responses to incentives."}, {"section_title": "Agents' responses to hazards", "text": "Agents' responses to natural hazards were modeled in such a way that their psychological attributes, including hurricane knowledge, hazard intrusiveness, hurricane experience, and damage experience, might increase once they encountered hurricane hazard or decrease if they did not encounter hurricane hazard for a prolong period. The hurricane hazards were classified into 7 categories using associated peak wind speeds. As illustrated in Table 4.4, these 7 categories correspond to the 7 tropical cyclone classifications per the Saffir-Simpson scale . If the agent encountered a hazard at Category 1 or above, we assumed he/she experienced a hurricane (i.e. affected agent's hurricane experience). If the loss of a building was greater than zero, we assumed the agent associated with the building experienced a damage (i.e. damage experience would increase). We assumed that the level of hurricane knowledge [see Section 4.5 (4)] could increase only if the agent encountered a hazard at Category 6 or above. We also assumed that the increase of the hazard intrusiveness was affected by the category of the hazard. The higher the hurricane/storm category was, the more likely the hazard intrusiveness increased and more likely it increased by more than one level. The hazard intrusiveness had a probability to decrease as well if the agent did not experience any hazard for a long time. The change of hazard intrusiveness of an agent due to the change of wind speed from the simulated hurricane hazards are plotted in Fig. 4.12a. As can be clearly seen, the model captures the dynamic change of the hazard intrusiveness due to the variation of the simulated hurricane hazards. This mimics the reality that, the perceived hurricane risk (hazard intrusiveness) is higher to the agent right after a hurricane. However, their intrusiveness fades when the time elapses without a new hurricane event. This modeling procedure was inspired by the Google Trends presented in Fig. 4.12b, which shows that people's search interests of the term \"hurricane\" decays over time.  The modeling of the agents' responses to incentives started from the understanding of the logistic function, which can be expressed as follow: If substituting z with a linear equation in terms of independent variables the logistic function can be rewritten as where, i \uf062 ( 0 to in \uf03d ) are the coefficients. Note that, the range of the logistic function is constrained between 0 and 1. It is, therefore, commonly used to represent the probability (P) of the dependent variable which equals a \"YES\" rather than a \"NO\". In statistics, we define logit as follow: Thus, by substituting Eqn. (4.4) into (4.5), logit can be re-expressed as (4.6) In this hurricane mitigation framework, agents' responses to incentives were modeled using Eqn. (4.6). The scaled demographic and psychological attributes (see Section 4.5) were modeled as independent variables, and the \u03b2 coefficients were adopted from Ge et al. (2011) which were computed through logistic regressions of survey data on shutter retrofits given various incentives. Once the logit was calculated, the respective probability of having a \"YES\" could be obtained. A random number (1 or 0) was then generated to check the decision of the agent on the acceptance of the incentive. \"1\" means acceptance, while \"0\" means rejection. Note that even for the same incentive, there are different levels (e.g. 25% or 50% PTR) and agents' responses to these levels are different (Peacock 2003b). However, this effect was not considered in Ge et al. (2011). Therefore, we modified their method to account for agent's motivations under different incentive levels before modeling agent's decision making using Eqn. (4.6). In our modified method, a two-step procedure was employed to determine whether agents would retrofit their buildings. In the first Step, the \"motivation\" of an agent to consider retrofitting his/her building was determined. If the agent was deemed \"motivated\", Step Two was then utilized to compute the probability that the agent would actually follow through and implement the retrofits using the logit function [Eqn. (4.6)]. The agent's motivation was modeled as a function of the incentive level using the HLMBS data. For PTR, the chances or percentages of an agent who gets motivated under different incentive levels are tabulated in Table 4.5. The higher the incentive level is or the more benefit the agent can get from the incentive, the more likely he/she is motivated. Once the agent decided to accept the incentive, one or more measures could be adopted to retrofit the building. The probability of an agent to select specific retrofit measures depends on two rules: (1) An agent will optimize the provided incentive by selecting retrofit measures that have the closest total retrofit cost to the incentive value; and (2) An agent with a higher risk perception tends to spend more money on retrofits. Agent's risk perception was modeled using a similar method as the one proposed in Peacock et al. (2005). Fig. 4.13 shows the probability-cost relationships developed using the above-mentioned rules for the selection of the retrofit measures. These relationships are modeled as beta distributions for a specific building in this mitigation framework. In 158 the development of the probability-cost functions, the retrofit cost ratios were defined as the retrofit costs normalized by the total cost of implementing all possible retrofit measures for the given building. When these functions were used, for different risk perception levels, a retrofit cost ratio was first determined by generating a random number following the corresponding beta distribution. The group of retrofit measures that had the closest retrofit cost ratio to the generated one was then selected as the adopted group of retrofit measures. It should be noted that, these beta distributions are buildingspecific, because possible retrofit measures are different for different buildings. So far, a complete agent-based hurricane mitigation framework has been introduced. Using the aforementioned methodology, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the ABM framework. Details of the case study are given next in Section 4.10."}, {"section_title": "Miami-Dade County case study", "text": "A case study was performed for Miami-Dade County, FL using the proposed agent-based hurricane mitigation framework. Per the 2010 U.S. Census and the 2011 ACS data, the total population in this area was around 2.5 million with a five-year averaged housing unit counts of nearly 987 thousand and a median household income of $43,957 (2011 USD). The total number of census blocks in this area was around 38 thousand. In this hurricane mitigation framework, the locations as well as attributes of buildings and the attributes of agents were first initialized using historical survey data (see discussions in Section 4.4 and 4.5). Example PMFs along with the functions/ correlations utilized in the case study are documented in Appendices B and C. Simulations were then performed with a fixed time interval of one month. Hurricane hazards (see Section 4.7), building retrofits (see Section 4.6), new constructions and demolitions (see Section 4.8) occurred at every time step. Agents' behaviors and their responses (defined using heuristic rules) on adopting retrofits given incentives and hurricane hazards are discussed in Section 4.9. The main objective of this case study was to investigate the impact of the PTR on the final direct societal costs related to hurricane 160 mitigations. These costs include repair costs (i.e. hurricane losses), retrofit costs, and demolition costs."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane selection", "text": "While ABM has been identified as one of the most promising methods for evaluating the global responses of complex systems, the ABM method is very computationally intensive. Instead of using the full time history of the 50,000 years of simulated hurricanes, three 25-year time history windows were selected for evaluating the effectiveness of various levels of the PTR incentive. The three time history windows were carefully selected from the entire 50,000-year simulation timeline to include a characteristic hurricane scenario in the middle of each time window. The characteristic events selected were hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios that produced joint wind and flood hazards with a mean recurrence interval (MRI) of 300 years. The methodology used for the selection of the hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios came from a previous study of the authors (Pei et al. 2015). The tracks of the selected characteristic hurricane scenarios are plotted in Fig. 4.14. These scenarios come from different directions towards the loss estimation domain (i.e. Miami-Dade County, FL) (see Fig. 4.14). These hurricane scenarios have similar MRIs; however, they produce spatially and temporally different wind speeds and flood elevations. Event #1 passing through the left (south and west) side of the hurricane mitigation domain produces higher flood elevations than Events #2 and #3 that pass through the right (north and east) side of the hurricane mitigation domain. This is because the counter-clockwise rotation of the hurricane wind field in North Hemisphere pushes water towards the land on the right side of the hurricane track and the rotation pushes water away on the left side (Pei et al. 2015). Once a hazard-consistent hurricane scenario (with a 300-year MRI) was selected from the complete 50,000 years of hurricane simulations, a 25-year window centered by the selected hurricane scenario was picked as the timeline for one simulation (see Fig.   4.15). To ensure that the characteristic hurricane event could be used to represent the overall hurricane hazard of the selected timeline, the 25-year time frames were selected such that all other hurricane events occurred within the timeline had their MRIs significantly lower than the target MRI (i.e. 300 years in this case). The three selected 25year time windows and the associated groups of hurricane events in terms of their MRI    In every simulation time step (i.e. one month), new constructions were assumed to occur first, followed by the updates of agents' demographic and psychological attributes. Agents' demographic attributes (e.g. age, years in residence, etc.) were updated in the very first month of every year. Agents' psychological attributes were updated right after a hurricane or six months after a hurricane if there was no hurricane occurred during that period of time. The PTR incentive program was assumed to last only for five years starting from the beginning of the simulation time period (i.e. 25 years) and agents were allowed to take the benefit of incentive only once during the first five years. After the first five years, agents were still able to retrofit their buildings but with no incentive. To avoid over-decision, we assumed that agents' retrofit decisions were made only once when there was an incentive or when their buildings were severely damaged after a hurricane. Hurricane hazards occurred over time identical with the patterns of those pre-selected synthetic hurricane events. If a building was destructively damaged after a hurricane, we demolished that building. Buildings also had chances to be demolished due to aging. The building inventory, hurricane losses, retrofit costs, and demolition costs obtained at every modeling time step were recorded for further analyses."}, {"section_title": "Simulation results", "text": "After the 19 simulations were conducted, their results are presented in this Subsection. Because of the new constructions and demolitions, building stock/inventory changed over time. The geospatial distributions of the building stock along with their year built attributes for every 5-year time interval are plotted in Fig. 4.16. This figure was generated using results from the Simulation #3 (see Table 4. 167 (0% PTR). The secondary water resistance retrofit, which has the highest percentage increase due to its low price, was the favorite, as opposed to the flood retrofit measures (i.e. wet flood-proofing, dry flood-proofing, and levees & floodwalls) that were less likely to be selected because of the high implementation costs (see Sub-section 4.9.2 and Appendix D for details). The small increase of the strapped roof-wall connection was expected because its adoption rate was already very high (more than 80%) at the beginning of the simulations. Other than the building inventory, the estimated hurricane losses along with the incentive and retrofit costs were combined to evaluate the effectiveness of different In Fig. 4.18, the regional cumulative \"wind-only\", \"flood-only\" and combined hurricane losses are plotted for all three hurricane timelines under 0% PTR incentive level. It can be seen from Fig. 4.18, Timeline 1 hurricanes produce the lowest combined losses (cumulative) and Timeline 2 produces the highest. The increases of the losses are mainly contributed to the selected hurricane scenarios that have a 300-year MRI, because the MRIs for other events are relatively small (see Fig. 4.15). The 300-year-MRI event in Timeline 1 has the lowest \"wind-only\" but the highest \"flood-only\" losses, while that 170 event in Timeline 2 has the highest \"wind-only\" but the lowest \"flood-only\" losses. These were expected because of the wind speeds, flood elevations and approaching paths of the selected hurricane scenarios as discussed in Section 4.10.1 (also see Fig. 4.14). The \"wind-only\" losses are generally smaller than the \"flood-only\" losses for all events except for the ones with 300-year MRI. The reason of \"flood-only\" losses higher than the \"wind-only\" losses could contribute to the broad acceptance and implementation of the wind retrofit measures but a lack of adoptions of the flood retrofit measures due to their high prices (see Fig. 4.17).  Fig. 4.20 are generated. Fig. 4.19 shows a comparison of the cumulative demolition costs due to destructive damages for Timeline 3 hurricanes under 0%, 25% and 75% PTR levels (i.e. Simulations #13, #15 and #18); and Fig. 4.20 presents the cumulative HRCs using two new construction scenarios for Timeline 3 hurricanes under 25% PTR level (i.e. Simulations #15 and #19). In Fig. 4.19, the cases with 0% and 75% PTRs are shown to have the highest and lowest cumulative demolition costs, respectively. This is because, agents tended to retrofit their buildings more under higher incentive levels (see Fig. 4.17), and the number of hurricane induced demolitions decreased with the increase of retrofitting. Fig. 4.19 also shows that the selected hurricane events other than the one with 300-year MRI were not major contributors to destructive damages of buildings. Besides, the demolition costs are significantly lower than the hurricane losses (see Fig. 4.18) and will not play an important role in HRCs. In Fig. 4.20, the cumulative HRCs are presented to have higher values using Scenario II for new constructions than Scenario I. This can be explained using Fig.   4.11. In Fig. 4.11c, the cumulative numbers of new constructions from Scenario II are higher than those from Scenario I in the first 25 years, which correspond to the 25-year simulation period.  However, the differences among them decrease when time passes by. Eventually, among the three PTR levels given in Fig. 4.21, the case with the highest PTR level (i.e. 75%) results in the lowest cumulative HRCs. This is a reasonable finding because at the early stage of the simulations, the contributions of the HRCs were mainly from the building retrofit costs with minor or no hurricane losses; when time elapsed, the cumulative hurricane losses started to increase (see Fig. 4.18). The cases with lower incentive levels experienced fewer adoptions of the retrofit measures, and thus produced greater hurricane losses comparing with the cases with higher incentive levels. The reduced hurricane losses finally surpassed the increased early-stage retrofit costs for the cases with higher incentive levels (e.g. 75% PTR) and led to reduced HRCs. The reductions of the HRCs under different incentive levels are plotted in Fig. 4.22a,b. In this figure, the HRC reductions are defined as the absolute differences between the cumulative HRCs with incentives (e.g. 15% PTR) and those without incentives (i.e. 0% PTR) at the end of the 25-year simulation period. As can be clearly seen from Fig. 4.22, the incentive cost is only a small portion (< 20%) of the HRC reduction and the HRC reduction increases with the increase of the incentive level. However, its increasing rate significantly decreases as the incentive level reaches 50%. Therefore, a PTR between 50% and 75% may be an optimal incentive level to implement for reducing the regional hurricane losses at Miami-Dade County."}, {"section_title": "Summary and conclusions", "text": "A new agent-based simulation framework was developed for evaluating the effectiveness of incentive programs in mitigating regional hurricane hazards. This new ABM framework specifically considers the stakeholders' points of view on the selections of retrofit measures. The proposed framework models each individual building and householder in detail. It is able to consider new constructions and demolitions of buildings, and evaluate the effectiveness of different incentive levels in reducing hurricane losses. We found that the framework captured the locations of buildings or agents, as well as the probability distributions of building and agent attributes very well. It also simulated the growth of the cites while taking building demolitions due to both aging and hurricane damages into account. The hurricane losses were found to be the dominant component of the hurricane related costs (HRCs), which include retrofit costs and demolition costs due to destructive damages as well. The rates of adopting retrofit measures, which include both wind and flood retrofits, increased with the increase of the incentive level. The higher incentive level, although noticed to produce higher HRCs at early stage of simulations (i.e. high upfront cost), was found to result in less HRCs at the end of the simulation period. This is because the simulation case with a higher incentive level was able to reduce the cumulative hurricane losses over time. By varying the property tax reduction (PTR) percentages, PRT reduction between 50% and 75% was found to be the optimal level for mitigating regional hurricane hazards at Miami-Dade County, FL. The proposed ABM framework can be used by local or state government to investigate the effectiveness of certain incentive programs in mitigating hurricane losses. Insurance companies may also use this simulation tool to evaluate the viability of certain incentive-based insurance premiums for a portfolio of insured properties. Even though the case study was only carried out for an example location (Miami-Dade County in Florida), and the simulations were only performed for selected hurricane events within a certain timeframe, the proposed framework is flexible and it can be applied to anywhere for any hazard level with any simulation time period. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the occurrence time of the characteristic hurricane scenarios, which in this case have a 300-year mean recurrence interval, within the given timeframe is important. The case study only considered those scenarios occurred at the middle of the simulation period, which was after the first five years when the incentives were valid. This means that the characteristic scenarios occurred after most retrofit measures were implemented. We would anticipate higher hurricane losses if the characteristic scenarios occurred within the first five years; however, the occurrence timing of the major hurricane events was not investigated in this study."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER FIVE", "text": "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, the combined hurricane wind and flood hazards were quantified using the methodology proposed in Chapter Two considering the joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood. The joint mean recurrence interval (MRI) contour plots and the hazard maps for Charleston Peninsula, SC were developed. The hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios (with similar joint MRIs) were selected based on the methodology proposed in Chapter Three along with the joint MRI contour plots generated from Chapter Two. The selected hurricane scenarios were imported into the HAZUS-MH program to perform combined hurricane wind and flood loss estimations. An agent-based hurricane mitigation framework was developed and utilized to evaluate the cost-benefit of various levels of property tax reduction as incentives for retrofitting residential dwellings for hurricane hazards. This mitigation framework considers building inventory change and householders' decision making on the adoptions of retrofit measures. The hurricane losses were estimated using hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios (Chapter Three) by implementing the HAZUS-MH combined wind and flood loss estimation methodology. The hurricane events utilized in this study came from a long-term hurricane simulation program. The hurricane wind speeds were calculated using a wind filed model along with a boundary layer model, and the flood elevations were computed using a storm surge model. The specific conclusions from Chapter Two that quantified the joint hurricane wind and surge hazards are given below: (1) Hurricane events that yield different combinations of wind speeds and surge heights, for example, high wind speed but low surge height, low wind speed but high surge height, and intermediate wind speed and surge height, can have the same joint MRI or return period. This finding suggests the necessity of quantifying joint hurricane wind and surge hazards. (2) Even though the joint hazards (e.g. joint histograms, joint hazard surfaces, joint hazard maps, etc.) were only quantified for Charleston Peninsula, SC, the proposed methodology is flexible and can be applied to elsewhere. The outcomes of the study can be used for the selections of the hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios (Chapter Three); or in a performance-based framework for coastal structure design, risk assessment, and loss estimation considering the combined effects of hurricane wind and surge. The specific conclusions from Chapter Three which proposed a methodology for selecting hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios are presented as follows: (1) In general, the hurricane events that pass by the western or southern side of the loss estimation domain tend to produce higher flood elevations than those that pass through the eastern or northern side. This is because the hurricane wind velocities in the Northern Hemisphere follow a counter-clockwise rotation. For those hurricanes that pass through the western or southern side of the loss estimation domain, the hurricane wind driven floods move towards the land resulting in higher flood elevations. (2) Hurricane scenarios selected based on only wind speeds or only flood elevations may overestimate the combined hurricane wind and flood losses. The joint occurrence probability of hurricane wind and flood should be considered when performing scenario-based loss assessment. From Chapter Four that developed the agent-based framework for regional hurricane mitigation, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Homeowners modeled as \"agents\" were simulated to adopt retrofit measures under different incentive levels. The percentage of the adopted measures, which include both wind and flood retrofit measures, increased with the increase of the incentive level. (2) The higher incentive level, although noticed to produce higher hurricane related costs (HRCs = hurricane repair costs + building retrofit costs + building demolition costs due to destructive damages) at early stage of simulations, was found to result in less HRCs at the end of the simulation period. (3) The property tax reduction between 50% and 75% was found to be the optimal level for mitigating regional hurricane hazards at Miami-Dade County, FL in terms of reducing the HRCs over a 25-year timeframe with a 300-year MRI hurricane occurred within the timeframe. (4) The proposed agent-based framework can be used by coastal jurisdictions who make decisions on hazard mitigation or city planning, and insurance companies that 190 are interested in setting up incentive-based insurance premiums, which account for the stakeholders' decision making."}, {"section_title": "Future work", "text": "To improve the current study, the following items are recommended for future work: (1) In quantifying the joint hurricane wind and surge hazards, the effects of tide and wave were not considered. The tidal effects can be taken into account by adding the tidal elevations to the surge heights, neglecting the minor coupling effect between tide and surge. The wave components, which are important in storm surge simulations, can be considered by running a coupled surge-wave model. (2) In the selection of the hazard-consistent hurricane scenarios, the regional effect was considered by weighting MRI values using population in each of the census blocks. However, the MRI values can also be weighted using other parameters (e.g. building exposure value), or other methodologies can be applied to account for the regional effect. (3) When evaluating the performance of the agent-based hurricane mitigation framework, only scenarios occurred at the middle of the simulation period were considered. Nevertheless, the occurrence time of the scenario is important. We would anticipate higher hurricane losses if the scenarios occurred were within the first five years, when agents were still motivated by incentives in retrofitting their buildings."}, {"section_title": "191", "text": "(4) In current version of the agent-based framework, interactions between agents are not simulated. Agents should be able to influence each other and respond to the changes induced by others.
