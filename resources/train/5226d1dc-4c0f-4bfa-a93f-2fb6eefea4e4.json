It is one of the most frequent fetal brain anomaly, with a prevalence of 1 per 1000 live births by Bromley 1 and Goldstein 2 or even 22 per 1000 live births according to Alagappan. 3 Evaluation of the fetal lateral ventricles is recommended as part of the second semester anomaly scan. It consists in the enlargement of the cerebral lateral ventricles over 10 mm, measured at the level of the atrium-the confluence of the temporal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. Ventriculomegaly is often associated with a false shrinkage of the choroid"}, {"section_title": "10.5005/jp-journals-10009-1392", "text": "plexus (inability of the choroid plexus to fill the entire cavity of the atrium) and sometimes the choroid plexus may have a 'floating aspect' in severe ventriculomegaly. The normal dimension of the atrium was established by Cardoza et al 4 who found a mean measurement of the lateral ventricles on the second trimester scan of 7.6 \u00b1 0.6 mm and also introduced a cut-off value of abnormality of 10 mm. The atrial diameter is constant from 14 to 38 weeks of gestation.\nWhile an atrial width of less than 10 mm can be considered normal, a value between 10 and 15 mm represents mild ventriculomegaly, and a measurement over 15 mm consti tutes severe ventriculomegaly. In some studies, an atrial width of 10 to 12 mm is considered mild ventriculo megaly and a measurement of 13 to 15 mm constitutes moderate ventriculomegaly.\nThe ultrasound measurement of the atrium of the lateral ventricles should be done in an axial plane of the fetal head, with the calipers positioned at the level of the choroid plexus, inside the echoes generated by the ventricular walls, on an axis perpendicular to the long axis of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 1) .\nAccording to Vergani and Pilu, 5, 6 ventriculo megaly can be considered isolated if there is no ultrasound evi dence of any fetal malformation or markers of aneu ploidy at the moment of diagnosis. Isolated fetal ventri culomegaly can be a benign finding but can also be associated with neural tube defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebral hemorrhage, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infection (more frequently CMV and Toxoplasmosis) and neurodevelopmental impairment of the newborn.

The diagnosis of isolated ventriculomegaly must be made only after a com plete ultrasound evaluation for associated intra cerebral or extracerebral anomalies had been performed. Because fetal ventriculomegaly is most frequently disco vered in a routine second trimester pregnancy scan, ultrasonography remains the most easy to access tool in the examination of the fetal brain, so it is recomended to be used in measuring the ventricular atrium every 4 weeks. It is very important to repeat the ultrasono graphic examinations because the malformations can also be detected later during pregnancy. The clinical course of ventricular enlargement is also very important for the neurodevelopmental outcome of the newborn, so it is of utmost importance to be able to evaluate repeatedly the dimensions of the atrium (Fig. 2) .\nIn various studies, associated abnormalities in fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly, have been reported in 10 to 75% of cases."}, {"section_title": "7-10", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Fetal MRI-Improving the Evaluation of the Associated Anomalies", "text": "Fetal MRI adds important information on that obtained by ultrasound, and represents an important way to deter mine the presence of associated anomalies. Unforunately, it is an expensive investigation and very few medical centers can afford it. Many studies aimed to evaluate the role of fetal MRI in the discovery of associated anomalies in fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly.\nIn one of the most important studies, Griffiths et al 11 showed additional brain abnormalities by performing fetal MRI in 17% of the fetuses thought to have iso lated ventriculomegaly. 147 fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly diagnosed by ultrasound were included in the study and after performing fetal MRI in all the cases, 25 fetuses had associated anomalies. The most common fetal associated anomaly was agenesis of corpus callosum -11 cases. The ventricular atrium was also measured by MRI in all the cases, and the values were compared to the data obtained by ultrasound at the moment of diagnosis.\nThere was complete agreement between the ultrasound and magnetic resonance atrial diameter in 90% of all the cases. In 2 cases with mild ventriculomegaly determined by ultrasound, the MRI examination found normal ventricles; in 9 cases with mild ventriculomegaly, the MRI showed moderate ventriculomegaly; in one case of moderate ventriculomegaly, the MRI diag nosed severe ventriculomegaly. The study showed that there is a rela tionship between the dimension of the ventriculomegaly and the risk of other brain abnor malities. Fetuses with severe ventriculomegaly had a probability ten times higher than fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly of having other abnormalities, and the chance of other brain abnormalities in fetuses with mild ventriculo megaly is 6%.

In United States, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort evaluated the develop ment of healthy children aged 9 to 24 months and the res ults showed that the developmental delay was 13%. 18 Melchiorre et al 15 found that the prevalence of neurode velopmental delay in fetuses with isolated ventriculo megaly is 10.34% (Table 2) . Two important studies evaluated children with confirmed isolated ventriculomegaly at birth using Bayley Scale of Infant Development -II and showed that isolated ventriculomegaly is a significant risk factor for developmental delay.\n19, 20 Bloom et al, 19 evaluated the enlarged atrium of the distal ventricle and found a developmental delay in 8 of 22 cases with prebirth isolated ventriculomegaly, vs one of 22 cases in the control group. Sadan et al 20 evaluated mild unilateral ventriculomegaly in 20 cases and found neurodevelopmental delay in four cases vs one of 20 cases in the control group. However, further research must be performed, as both studies evaluated only a small number of cases on a short period of time."}, {"section_title": "Factors that influence the Prognosis", "text": "Ouahba et al 12 found three prenatal factors associated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. 24.2% of children with atrial width greater or equal to 12 mm at the moment of diagnosis have a neurological disease vs 5.9% in the group with ventriculomegaly lesser than 12 mm. Pilu et al 6 obtained results in the same range: 13.9%\nof the cases with ventriculomegaly greater than 12 mm had neurodevelopmental delay vs 3.8% in cases with atrial width smaller than 12 mm. Bilateral asymmetrical ventriculomegaly is associated with neurological disease in 50% of the cases, vs 10% in the cases with symmetrical ventriculomegaly, and 7.5% of the cases with unilateral enlargement.\nIn isolated mild ventriculomegaly, the postnatal neurodevelopmental outcome depends on the evolution of ventriculomegaly. Nonprogressive isolated mild ven triculomegaly has a good postnatal prognosis especially if the ventriculomegaly resolves antenatally. In his study, Ouahba et al 12 found 65 fetuses with unilateral asymetri cal nonprogressive isolated mild ventriculomegaly. Of these, 6.2% had neuro developmental delay after birth, and 93.8% had a normal development.\nA very important prognostic factor in isolated ventri culomegaly is the absence of any associated anomalies at the moment of diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Postnatal Management and Follow-up", "text": "After birth, children diagnosed in utero with isolated ventriculomegaly, must be evaluated by the neonatologist and the pediatrician in order to identify any anomalies that may have remained undetected prenatally. 6 Postnatal follow-up should also include an MRI during the first year of life in order to exclude lesions of the white matter that are not detectable in utero. The neurodevelopmental evaluation and follow-up must be performed by some authors at least 6 years of age, using standard scales for evaluation of neorological performance-Bayley scales of infant development (mental and motor), 24 Griffiths scales of mental development (locomotor, personal social, hearing and speech, eye-hand coordination and performance, practical reasoning), 25 Schedule of Grow ing Skills (passive postural, active postural, locomotor, manipulative, visual, hearing and language, interactive, social and selfcare)."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Isolated fetal ventriculomegaly is the most common cerebral anomaly encountered in utero during a routine pregnancy scan. A measurement of the ventricular atrium of less than 10 mm is considered to be normal, while an atrial width of 10 to 15 mm represents mild ventri culomegaly. Careful evaluation of the fetal anatomy should be performed by serial ultrasound evaluation and by fetal MRI as ventriculomegaly is more frequently associated with structural anomalies and delayed neurodevelopment. Fetal MRI must be included in the evalua tion protocol as additional brain anomalies are found in 17% of the fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly.
