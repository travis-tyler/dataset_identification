[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019, [1, 2] and has generated a global pandemic [3] . As of the 18th of April 2020, over 2 million confirmed cases and more than 148,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [4] . Metagenomic RNA sequencing revealed that COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [2] , coronaviruses which have both been responsible for large outbreaks of respiratory illness within the last two decades [5, 6] . The release of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence on the 10th of January spurred the development of RT-PCR assays [7] [8] [9] and thereby enabled reliable laboratory diagnosis of infections. In addition, protocols were also developed to allow for rapid sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [10] , sharing of the resultant data [11] and phylogenetic analysis [12] .\nLaboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is a cornerstone of the strategy to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [13] as it facilitates the identification and isolation of infected individuals, while negative tests can allow essential personnel to continue work. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, with its high transmissibility [14] , false negatives could have particularly adverse effects on efforts to control its spread. As RT-PCR oligos rely on binding to small ~20bp sequences, mutations in these regions have the potential to generate false negative results through impaired amplification or probe binding. In contrast to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have a moderate mutation rate due their ability to carry out RNA proofreading [15] . Nevertheless, given the large number of ongoing transmission chains, it is prudent to monitor the integrity of RT-PCR assays.\nHere we report the identification of a SNP in the E-gene of SARS-CoV-2 that is associated with failure of the E-gene assay used in the cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 test (Roche). This observation highlights the necessity of targeting two regions in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays and shows the role sequencing can play in resolving and anticipating problems with the RT-PCR assays in use."}, {"section_title": "RNA extraction and Real Time PCR", "text": "The study was approved by the Comit\u00e9 d'Ethique Hospitalo-Facultaire Universitaire de Li\u00e8ge (Reference number: CE 2020/137). The COVID-19 detection was routinely performed using the cobas\u00ae 6800 platform (Roche). For this, 400 \u00b5L of nasopharyngeal swabs in preservative medium (AMIES or UTM) were first incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with 400 \u00b5L of cobas\u00ae PCR Media kit (Roche) for viral inactivation. Samples were then loaded on the cobas\u00ae 6800 platform using the cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay for the detection of ORF1ab and E genes.\nFor RT-PCR control and sequencing analysis, RNA was extracted from clinical samples (300\u00b5L) on a Maxwell 48 device using the Maxwell RSC Viral RNA kit (Promega) following a viral inactivation step using Proteinase K according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA elution occurred in 50\u00b5L RNAse free water and 5 \u00b5L were used for the RT-PCR. Reverse transcription and RT-PCR were performed on a LC480 thermocycler (Roche) based on Corman et al.

This was incubated at 25 o C for 10 min, 50 o C for 10 min and 85 o C for 5 min. PCR reactions used the primers and conditions recommended in the nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol [16] . Samples were multiplexed using the Oxford Nanopore Native Barcoding Expansion kits 1-12 and 13-24, in conjunction with Ligation Sequencing Kit. Sequencing was carried out on a Minion using R9.4.1 flow cells. Data analysis followed the nCoV-2019 novel coronavirus bioinformatics protocol of the Artic network [16] .

The four samples were retested using the Corman et al. [9] SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets the RdRP and E genes. In this instance both assays were positive (Table 1) . All four samples came from Belgian health care workers in the same team, suggesting a common source of infection.\nWe next carried out whole genome sequencing of the viruses from the four patients using the Artic Network protocol [16] . The consensus genomes generated showed all four to be infected with a genetically identical virus. The virus differed from the MN908947.3 reference isolated in Wuhan at only three positions (Figure1). The first two SNPs were towards the 5' end of the virus at positions 1440 and 2891 respectively. The third SNP, a C-to-T transition at position 26340 is within the E gene of the virus and was validated by Sanger sequencing in the four samples (Supplementary Figure 1) . This SNP overlaps with the E gene probe used in the Corman et al. [9] RT-PCR assay, however, as was mentioned above, it does not appear to affect the performance of this assay in our hands. Unfortunately, the position of primers and probes utilised in the cobas\u00ae E-gene assay (Roche) are not publicly available, nevertheless it is parsimonious to assume that this SNP is the cause of the failure of the E-gene assay implemented in the cobas\u00ae system.\nOut of the 186 SARS-CoV-2 genomes we have sequenced, only these four samples carry a SNP at position 26340. We then checked the sequences deposited in GISAID via the .

We found that a SNP had arisen at this position in two additional viral genomes, one isolated in England and the second in Australia ( Figure 2 ). As the English, Australian and Belgian viruses do not cluster together in the tree generated by Nextstain, it appears that this SNP has arisen independently on three different occasions (Figure 2 ).\nFinally we also checked the regions encompassed by the primers and probes reported by Corman et al. [9] , the Chinese CDC [7] and US CDC [8] in the 186 SARS-CoV-2 genomes we have sequenced to date at the GIGA Institute (Supplementary Table 1 ). We found mutations in binding sites for three of the oligos from the US CDC tests and two oligos from Corman et al. [9] . All were present in a small number of the viruses sequenced by us, as well as in a small number of viruses deposited in GISAID. In contrast, in the Nucleoprotein-protein assay from the Chinese CDC, we saw that 50 of our samples contain a cluster of three SNP which change GGG-to-AAC at the 3' end of the binding site of the 2019-nCoV-NFP oligo. This 3 base change is present in >600 viruses on Nextstrain and all cluster together (Figure 2 ). Vogels et al [17] also identified this 3 base change as well as other SNPs in primer/probe binding sites from a number of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 3, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083337 doi: medRxiv preprint However, our ability to show that each individual carries a genetically identical virus demonstrates the potential whole genome sequencing has for tracking chains of transmission.\nThis work shows the danger of relying on an assay that only targets a single position in the viral genome. It also highlights the utility of combining testing with rapid sequencing of a subset of the positive samples, especially in cases where one of the assays fails. Finally, it is an example of the need for sharing assay's specifics between manufacturers and users, in order to enable correct data analysis and interpretation.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 3, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083337 doi: medRxiv preprint\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 3, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083337 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 2 A: Phylogenetic tree generated by Nextstrain [12] with the viruses carrying the T allele at 26340 highlighted in yellow (The four Belgian viruses overlap).

However, given the available data, causality appears likely. The cobas\u00ae E-gene assay may use an alternate primer probe combination that is more sensitive to the presence of the SNP, alternatively it may target the same positions as the Corman et al. [9] E-gene assay, but differences in reagents used and cycling conditions may prevent binding of the probe in the presence of the SNP.\nIt should be stressed out that despite the failure of the cobas\u00ae E-gene assay in these four patients the cobas\u00ae ORF1ab assay was positive. This highlights the prudence of targeting more than one position in the viral genome in a RT-PCR assay. The Corman et al. [9] protocol recommends the use of its E-gene assay as a first-line screening tool, with confirmatory testing using the RdRp gene assay [9] . This SNP does not affect the Corman et al E-gene in our hands, however our results highlight how mutations in the virus can generate false negative results. In most cases such mutations will be rare, however as the viral sequencing being carried out across the world and shared on GISAID [11] has shown, such mutations have the potential to arise independently in separate transmission chains.\nAs regards the other mutations identified affecting primer or probe binding sites in widely used assays, we have no evidence that they affect the respective assays and in the case of the single base pair changes they are unlikely to have a major impact. However, the three base pair changes observed in a large number of viruses for the annealing site of the 2019-nCoV-NFP oligo from the Chinese CDC is likely to have a more dramatic effect on the performance of the assay and warrants further investigation.\nThe fact that all four individuals we identified with the SNP at position 26340 were health care professionals and worked in the same team, highlights the risks these individuals face. Unfortunately, we could not identify the index patient responsible for the contamination.\n.
