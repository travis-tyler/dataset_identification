The State of South Carolina believes that mitigation is most successful in a collaborative environment where goals and resources are shared, local initiatives are prioritized, and benefits are felt statewide. Each state agency has shown their dedication to mitigation through their participation in the ICC or the State Hazard Mitigation Team. Like other states throughout the country, South Carolina has been severely affected by a dismal economy, triggering the ICC to become more fiscally practical in prioritizing its mitigation goals. These goals reflect feasible and realistic strategies that our State and Local partners can achieve to protect the lives and property of its citizens. The ability for the State to redevelop and change mitigation priorities in congruence with the economy indicates a flexible mitigation strategy. This plan is designed to guide the State in fulfilling a state hazard mitigation mission and is structured to serve as a basis for post-disaster hazard mitigation efforts. As required by the DMA 2000, this plan will be updated and submitted to FEMA for review and approval in 2016."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Natural hazards, including floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and severe winter storms, are a part of the world around us. Their occurrence is natural and inevitable, and there is little we can do to control their force and intensity. The threat of the occurrence of manmade disaster is an area of concern for Emergency Management professionals. The State of South Carolina faces a variety of these hazards, each of which is discussed in Section 4 Hazard Assessment. Hazard mitigation involves the use of specific measures to reduce the impact of hazards on people and the built environment. Measures may include both structural and non-structural techniques, such as protecting buildings and infrastructure from the forces of nature or wise floodplain management practices. Actions may be taken to protect both existing and/or future development. It is widely accepted that the most effective mitigation measures are implemented before an event at the local government level, where decisions on the regulation and control of development are ultimately made."}, {"section_title": "A.

PURPOSE", "text": "The purpose of this Plan is to set forth a consistent and unified statewide vision for mitigation to protect the citizens and property of South Carolina. This plan is designed to be both strategicguiding the day-to-day decisions of state officials-as well as comprehensive in nature-providing a long-term vision of how the state will address hazards over time. In addition to the identification October 2013 and prioritization of possible projects, emphasis has been placed on the use of broad policy goals to assist South Carolina to become less vulnerable to the damaging forces of nature, while improving the economic, social, and environmental health of the state. The concept of multi-objective planning is emphasized throughout this document, identifying ways to link hazard mitigation policies and programs with complimentary state goals related to housing, economic development, recreational opportunities, transportation improvements, environmental quality, and public health and safety. The following ideas describe the South Carolina mission for mitigation: 1. Protect life, safety and property by reducing the potential for future damages and economic losses that result from hazards; 2. Meet the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, and therefore qualify for the following programs: Fire Management Assistance Grants, Public Assistance Program, Hazard Mitigation Grant Program,3. Speed recovery and redevelopment following future disaster events; 4. Enhance the capability of all counties and municipalities to address identified hazards by providing technical support and training; 5. Establish an effective forum for state agencies and statewide organizations to discuss and coordinate existing and future plans, programs, data, rules and regulations and expertise addressing hazard-related issues; 6. Increase the effectiveness and efficiency of hazard mitigation programs and projects sponsored, financed, or managed by state agencies or statewide organizations; and 7. Demonstrate a firm commitment to state and local hazard mitigation planning."}, {"section_title": "C. OVERVIEW OF GOALS", "text": "Following the passage of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, states and local governments are now required to develop and adopt a hazard mitigation plan in order to remain eligible for FEMA mitigation grant funding. Communities with an adopted plan will become \"pre-positioned\" and potentially more apt to receive available mitigation funds. Since mitigation dollars flow from FEMA and through the state to local governments, it is incumbent on states to develop a State Hazard Mitigation Plan in order to be eligible to receive FEMA pre or post-disaster mitigation funding. This plan is designed to meet the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) and the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. This plan is also designed to seek out other federal and state funding beyond those available through FEMA to accomplish desired objectives. Additionally, the State will continue to comply with all other applicable Federal statutes and regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives grant funding, in compliance with \u00a713.11(c). The SCEMD Mitigation Section will review and update the plan annually, or if hazard mitigation regulations or guidelines change, the review will be completed as needed. Additionally, the plan update will be submitted to FEMA Region IV following a Presidential disaster declaration to include new disaster information and modifications to the State's priorities. The final State of South Carolina Hazard Mitigation Plan will be submitted to the ICC and the State Emergency Management Division Director, as the authorized representative of the Governor, for final approval every three years. Once the ICC and Director concur with the updates, the plan will be sent to FEMA Region IV for review. Upon FEMA approval of the plan, a letter with the Director's signature will declare the document as officially adopted by the State. The document will then be forwarded to FEMA Region IV to finalize plan approval."}, {"section_title": "F. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ACCREDITATION PROGRAM (EMAP)", "text": "The Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) is the voluntary assessment and accreditation process for state and local government programs responsible for coordinating prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery activities for natural and humancaused disasters. Accreditation is based on compliance with national standards, the EMAP Standard. As of October 2008 SCEMD has become EMAP accredited. SCEMD is currently undergoing its 2013 reaccreditation process. All elements of the State Emergency Management program have been developed, or updated, to meet these standards. This includes the State Hazard Mitigation Plan. Therefore, this plan was designed to meet the following EMAP standards that apply to hazard mitigation plans (EMAP Standard 4.3: Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Consequence Analysis; and 4.4: Hazard Mitigation). Notations are made throughout this plan to indicate where EMAP standards have been addressed. The State of South Carolina utilized the process required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop this plan. The hazard mitigation planning process included the following steps, listed in the order in which they were updated: The plan update began immediately after the 2010 plan was adopted by South Carolina and approved by FEMA on October 19, 2010. The ICC met each quarter starting in January 2011 to discuss the schedule of updates, revisions to the old plan, new mitigation initiatives for inclusion in the update, modifications to mitigation goals and strategies, and innovative risk assessment methodologies to be utilized in the update. All members of the ICC participated in the quarterly conference calls and meetings and provided agency specific input for each updated section. The highlight of the plan update process was the annual meeting of the State Hazard Mitigation Team. The meeting, or more accurately titled the State Government Mitigation Actions Workshop, is a time for all state agencies to gather to comment on the mitigation planning process and provide mitigation actions for inclusion in the final plan. The Workshop sign-in sheet and all ICC meeting agendas and minutes can be found in Appendix A. While all sections of the plan were updated to reflect current mitigation information and planning priorities, special attention was focused on improving the risk assessment, updating state agency mitigation actions, and realigning the State Mitigation Goals to reflect current state priorities. To document all changes, a subsection has been included in each section of the plan that summarizes the information changed in this updated plan. Another major adjustment in this plan is the use of the 2010 Census data. The state saw significant growth, especially along the coast.

The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), and mitigation planning are all the direct responsibility of SCEMD. In order for these programs to achieve their full potential, multiple state activities should compliment appropriate mitigation goals and strategies. The best way to accomplish that task is to ensure that mitigation goals and initiatives are integrated to the maximum extent into all possible planning activities for Federal, State and local governments. Over the years, the works of these various entities have been incorporated into the State Hazard Mitigation Plan and the planning of other state agencies. The SHMP is not a stand-alone plan. The ICC incorporated the ideas and principles of a multitude of statewide and regional plans into the development of this plan. For example, this mitigation plan supports the goals established by the South Carolina Department of Insurance SC Safe Home Program, which promotes the strengthening of homes against damaging effects of high winds from hurricanes and severe storms. This plan also builds on the analysis and recommendations made in DHEC's South Carolina Comprehensive Beach Management Plan. The flood mitigation and mapping practices found in SCDNR's Flood Mitigation Program are integrated throughout. Natural hazard data and analysis from existing SCEMD state plans (i.e. SC Hurricane Plan, SC Earthquake Plan, etc) were incorporated into this update as well. In addition, it is important to note that the SHMP risk analysis and mitigation strategy is used in other state and local plans, reinforcing the goals of the SHMP by promoting comprehensive and effective mitigation strategy."}, {"section_title": "E.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "South Carolina is comprised of 46 counties. Counties were established in the colonial period primarily for locating land grants, with most other governmental activities being centralized in Charleston. The growth of the backcountry led to the establishment of judicial districts throughout the colony, but low-country areas continued to be identified primarily by their Anglican parish names. Following the Revolution, both district and county courts were established. In 1800, most of the counties became districts. Finally, in 1868 all of the existing districts were renamed counties. New counties continued to be formed until the early part of the 20th century, with the most recent being Allendale in 1919.\nThis section provides the State of South Carolina with the basis for action. Based on the findings of the Risk Assessment and the state-level Capability Assessment, the mission statement, goals, and actions that follow are intended to guide both the day-to-day operations and the long-term approach taken by the State of South Carolina to reduce the impacts of hazards. In order to achieve these aims, this section has been separated into the following components: The plan is designed to be both comprehensive and strategic in nature. That is, the plan provides a comprehensive review of hazards and identify far-reaching policies and projects intended to not only reduce the future impacts of hazards, but also assist the State, counties and municipalities achieve compatible economic, environmental and social goals. In addition, the plan is strategic, in that all policies and projects are linked to departments or individuals responsible for their implementation. Funding sources are identified that can be used to implement identified actions. The crucial basis for action in this plan can be found in the Mitigation Action Plan (MAP), which lists specific actions, those responsible for their implementation, potential funding sources that may be used, and an estimated target date for completion. Each action will be listed with this accompanying information. This approach provides those in charge of the plan's implementation with an important monitoring tool. The collection of actions also serves as an easily understood menu of policies and projects for decision makers."}, {"section_title": "B.

The maximum distance, from east to west, is 439 kilometers (273 miles) and its maximum extent north to south is 352 kilometers (219 miles). The state's mean elevation is 110 meters (350 feet) 1 . Three geographic land areas define South Carolina; the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge. Two thirds of South Carolina is covered by the Atlantic Coastal Plain, from the Atlantic Ocean extending to the west. The land rises gradually from the southeast to the northwest. An area of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, defined as extending from the coast about 70 miles inland, is referred to as the Outer Coastal Plain. This area is quite flat. Many rivers can be found in the Outer Coastal Plain, with swamps near the coast that extend inland. An area called the Inner Coastal Plain consists of rolling hills. This is where South Carolina's most fertile soils are found. South Carolinians refer to the Inner Coastal Plain as the South Carolina Low Country and the Piedmont and the Blue Ridge region as Up Country. To the northwest of the Atlantic Coastal Plain is the Piedmont. The Piedmont is marked by higher elevations, from 400 to 1,200 feet above sea level and reaching 1,400 above sea level on its western edge. The landscape consists of rolling hills, gentler in the east and hillier to the west and northwest. The border between the Piedmont region and the Atlantic Coastal Plain is called the Fall Line to mark the line where the upland rivers \"fall\" to the lower Atlantic Coastal Plain. According to 2010 Census, a housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other person in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. Data collected from the 2010 Census, estimated 2.1 million housing units in South Carolina. 6 Of those, 1.7 million were occupied housing units and 545,360 were occupied rental units. A housing unit is owner-occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. The average household size of owner-occupied was 2.51 people and average size of renter-occupied was 2.45 people. 7 Families made up 67.4 percent of the households in South Carolina, which includes both married-couple families (48.3 percent) and other families (19.1 percent). Non-family households made up 32.6 percent of all households in South Carolina. Most of the non-family households were people living alone, but some were comprised of people living in households in which no one was related to the householder. 8 Of the total housing units, single-unit structures dominate the housing stock at 82.6 percent. Multiunit structures make up 17.4 percent. The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $137,000 per 2010 Census. 9 Per USFN, a mortgage banking resource, South Carolina has one of the highest numbers of manufactured home sales in the country. According to industry estimates, manufactured homes account for roughly 60 percent of all new single-family housing in the state. 10 In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau stated that South Carolina was ranked first nationally for total number of mobile home housing units. Of the total housing units, 18.1% were mobile homes. 11 Data from the 2010 Census showed 64.6 percent of the people living in South Carolina have lived in the same residence at least 5 years; 8.1 percent had moved during the past year from another residence in the same county, 3 percent from another county in the same state, 3.2 percent from another state, and .4 percent from abroad. Only 4.5 percent of the people living in South Carolina in Table 3.1 provides a breakdown of population, housing units, land and water area, and density by county. This information was derived from 2010 Census. Greenville County has the largest population and number of housing units in the state. The coastal counties including Beaufort, Charleston, and Horry have higher population than state average.   Natural hazard events strike communities equally and without boundaries. Conversely, the ability for society to prepare for and recover from an event may not be equal. Individuals and groups of people can be affected differently based on their diverging capacities and abilities to handle the impact of the hazard event. The term \"social vulnerability\" describes the underlying, pre-event social and demographic characteristics of a population that cause differential affects of hazards. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, age, gender, population, race, income, and the number of mobile homes found in each county. For example, people under age 19 or over age 64 are more vulnerable than the general population due to the need for special assistance should an evacuation be required in an emergency."}, {"section_title": "D.

LAND USE", "text": "The National Resource Inventory report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicates that between 1992 and 1997, 15.8 million acres were converted from farms and woodlands to a developed land status nationally. Among individual states, South Carolina was in the top 10, with 539,700 rural acres converted for development between 1992 and 1997. The report indicated that South Carolina had the 9th highest rate of land conversion among the 50 states. 21 Table 3.5 shows where South Carolina stands in comparison to other states. Land conversion rates have been over 20 percent per decade for some time. During the five-year periods of 1982-87 and 1987-92, conversion rates amounted to 13.0 and 14.1 percent, respectively. Over the five-year period between 1992 and 1997, the rate of increase more than doubled to 30.2 percent. While updated figures are not available, and assuming these rates of conversion are not anomalies, long-term community planning will become ever more valuable. Such planning helps cities and towns manage land development, ensuring their community benefits from growth. The South Carolina General Assembly grants local governments the authority to plan and control land use and development through the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive plan. In 1994, the General Assembly passed the \"South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act.\" This act required all South Carolina local planning programs to make their plans and ordinances conform to the provisions in the 1994 act by May 3, 1999. Each comprehensive plan developed by a county or municipality is required to directly address, at a minimum, seven elements, including a natural resource element. The natural resource element must address flooding and flood-related issues. The purpose of these plans is to allow local governments to devise a strategy to accomplish the following five objectives: 1. Identify local problems and needs 2. Collect appropriate data to study local problems and needs 3. Arrive at a consensus on local objectives 4. Develop plans and programs to fulfill such objectives 5. Utilize available resources to execute plans and programs effectively Jurisdictional planning boards, state and local economic development leaders, and state natural resource managers are working to incorporate a variety of land-use management initiatives into these comprehensive plans.

"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "South Carolina is diverse in its geography, population, and the types of hazards to which the state is exposed. Hazard exposure, risk, and social vulnerability for South Carolina vary across the state; therefore, the impacts of hazard events may affect some portions of the state and its residents more than others. It is important to understand and account for this variability for successful hazard response and mitigation planning purposes. The purpose of this risk assessment is to analyze the major hazards that affect South Carolina. Some hazards impact the state more so than others (e.g. hurricanes versus landslides). A complete analysis has been performed for those hazards that are more likely to cause adverse impacts to people and property of South Carolina. For those hazards that pose a minimal risk, a brief description is provided, but no further analysis is presented. These hazard types include sink holes, landslides, public health emergencies, nuclear power plants, tsunamis, and terrorism. For the majority of the analyses, and where it was available, data was collected through 2011. Sections that discuss 'recent' events use the time frame of 2009 through 2011, as a continuation from the previous South Carolina Hazard Mitigation Plan in which 2007-2009 data was used. Data for the risk assessment derive primarily from the Spatial Hazard Events and Loss Database for the United States (SHELDUS) and the Storm Events Database from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), as well as from a variety of other sources from state and local agencies. From these data sources, the historical hazard frequency of occurrence (risk) and losses are examined. Additionally, HAZUS-MH, FEMA's loss estimation software was used to model and provide estimates of potential impact. The Hazus-MH risk assessment method is parametric, in that distinct hazard and inventory parameters (for example, wind speed and building types) were modeled using the Hazus-MH software to determine the impact (damages and losses) on the built environment. Hazus-MH was used to estimate losses from hurricane winds and earthquake hazards. The baseline data in Hazus continually undergoes updates, such as the statewide essential facility data update in 2009. State-owned facilities were analyzed across wind, flood and earthquake hazards using HAZUS-MH. The assessment of state-owned facilities will only address those structures 3,000 square feet and larger. There are two reasons for limiting the vulnerability assessment to buildings 3,000 square feet and larger. First, the state's Insurance Reserve Fund Program only insures buildings 3,000 square feet and larger because they determined that buildings of this size accounted for the majority of exposure. In addition, the Insurance Reserve Fund Program provided SCEMD with structural information for buildings 3,000 square feet and larger. Future updates will include an assessment of infrastructure such as roads and bridges as detailed information becomes available. Federal properties were not assessed due to the lack of available data and the authority to implement appropriate mitigation measures. Properties owned by local governments are addressed in local hazard mitigation plans, and therefore, are not included in this plan. Each hazard type is given a section of its own and follows the general outline of first identifying the hazard with a brief overview, followed by subsections on the hazard type's formation, classification (if applicable), location (in a broad geographic sense of where the hazard type occurs in the state), historical events, recent activity, and lastly, a section on vulnerability that examines historical frequency, risk, and losses.

The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI), first implemented at the county level for the entire United States, provides a peer reviewed methodology for creating a standardized comparative metric aimed at understanding differences in socio-economic and demographic information between places 23 . SoVI includes those population characteristics known to influence the ability of social groups and communities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters 24 . Key social indicators that consistently appear in the literature as influencing pre-impact preparedness and post-event response and recovery include attributes such as socioeconomic status (wealth, education, occupation), age (elderly populations and young children are more vulnerable); gender; race and ethnicity; employment and employment sector; and special needs populations. However, it is not just the proportion of residents in these broad categories that is important, but instead how race, socioeconomic status, and gender interact to produce socially vulnerable populations. Selecting one variable (race, gender, socioeconomic status) does not adequately capture communities that are described as African American female-headed households below the poverty level, because not all African Americans are in poverty; not all female-headed households are African American; and not all people in poverty are females or female-headed households. SoVI synthesizes these socioeconomic variables into multiple dimensions and sums the values to produce the overall score for the particular spatial unit (e.g. county, census tract) of interest. This report implements the SoVI metric at the county level for the entire state so that planners and emergency managers can 1) quickly identify broad differences across the state, and 2) begin to understand, at sub-county levels, the characteristics of their populations and how these are increasing or decreasing vulnerability to better identify where resources and attention should be directed for planning and mitigation.  Table 4.A1.1 provides a breakdown by county of population, land and water area, and population and housing densities, derived from Census 2010. South Carolina has a total population of 4,854,100 people, as counted in Census 2010. Greenville County has the highest population overall and the highest population density. Table 4.A1.2 provides a summary on state-owned facilities and their values by county. Based on the SoVI methodology, Union County has the lowest score, meaning it is the least vulnerable (colored blue), while Saluda County has the highest social vulnerability score, meaning it is most vulnerable (colored red). The scores are mapped (Figure 4.A1.2) using a three-class standard deviation model where greater than 0.5 standard deviation means elevated; 0.5 to -0.5 means moderate; and less than -0.5 means limited.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS", "text": "Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones, are names for powerful tropical storms in which winds rotate around a closed circulation of low-pressure. In North America and the eastern Pacific they are known as hurricanes, in Asia they are known as typhoons, and in Australia they are called cyclones. In the Northern Hemisphere, hurricane winds rotate in a counter-clockwise direction (clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) 25 ."}, {"section_title": "Formation", "text": "The key energy source for a hurricane is the release of latent heat energy from condensation. This energy is found where there is a deep layer of warm water to fuel the system. Conditions for hurricane formation include warm waters, rotational force from the earth's spin (Coriolis effect), and the absence of vertical wind shear (stability in the lower atmosphere). Tropical disturbances that affect North America typically originate off the west coast of Africa. If the tropical disturbance lowers in pressure and starts to rotate around a low pressure center, it may turn into a tropical depression. Barometric pressure (measured in millibars or inches) continues to fall in the center as these storm systems develop in intensity. When sustained wind speeds reach 39 miles per hour, the system becomes a tropical storm and is given a name by the National Hurricane Center. When sustained wind speeds reach 74 mph, it becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes are much larger and powerful storms with an average diameter of 350 miles. On average, approximately ten tropical storms are named and six become hurricane strength in the southeast region of United States. The start of the official Atlantic hurricane season is June 1 st and ends November 30 th . Peak hurricane season is August and September in the Northern Hemisphere, when water temperatures and evaporation rates are greatest. Associated with these storms are damaging winds, heavy precipitation, and tornadoes. Coastal areas are also vulnerable to storm surge, wind-driven waves, and tidal flooding, which can cause more destruction than cyclone winds.\nThunderstorm and severe storm formation requires high moisture content, rising warm and unstable air (or strong temperature lapse rate), a lifting mechanism, and wind shear (a change in wind speed and direction with height). Conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm formation generally occur over a large area, and storms typically appear in clusters or a line of multiple storm cells (squall line) (3). Thunderstorm formation is generally classified into three stages: The developing or cumulus stage is when unstable air rises, and clouds undergo vertical growth. There is little rain at this stage and because of the lifting mechanism, either by localized convection or some other trigger, clouds can grow vertically of 5 to 20 meters per second. Within the cloud the temperature decreases with height and ice crystals start to form. Lightning may occur during this relatively short-lived stage. The mature stage occurs when precipitation begins to fall. Downdrafts (columns of downward-pushed air) form in the most intense precipitation areas, with updrafts in the center that continue to feed the storm water vapor. Precipitation, lightning, and thunder are most intense during the mature stage. The dissipating stage occurs when precipitation becomes heavy enough and occupies the entire cloud base, the updraft is overcome by the downdraft and the additional moist air is cut off from feeding the storm. Precipitation decreases in intensity at this stage. Lightning first requires a regional separation of positive and negative charges within a cloud. The surrounding air acts as an insulator between these charges. Cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground lighting occurs when the differences (voltage gradient) between the charges overpowers the insulating properties of the air.\nTornadoes are most often generated by thunderstorm activity or any situation of severe weather, (sometimes spawned from hurricanes and other coastal storms) when cool, dry air intersects and overrides a layer of warm, moist air forcing the warm air to rise rapidly. The presence of vertical wind shear (large change in wind speed and/or direction over a short distance) at the surface and higher up at 5,000 feet in the same location 44 causes a horizontal rotation of the air. Rising and rotating air from the cloud lifts this horizontal \"tube\" of rotating air so that it becomes vertical. This narrow column of air stretches downwards, rotates, and is fed by the warm, moist air. Once this column extends to the ground, it becomes a tornado. Swirling dust and debris from the surface makes the tornado visible.\nFloods are a potential threat for all parts of the country at any time of the year. Floods are generally the result of excessive precipitation over a span of days, intense rain in a short period of time, river overflow from an ice or debris jam, failure of water structures (dams, levees), or when excessive snow melt and rain occur in combination. The National Weather Service monitors conditions that may lead to floods. A tool used by forecast centers called the National Weather Service River Forecast System (NWSRFS) assists in forecasting flash floods by assessing soil moisture condition (soil type and moisture content) to develop flash flood guidance. When precipitation amounts exceed flash flood guidance, flooding can be expected 46 .\nAny material that can burn is fire fuel. In forests, these include dead leaves, grasses, branches and logs, and pine needles. Over 80 percent of forest fires are started by negligent human behavior (campfires, smoking, debris burning, arson, fireworks). The second most common cause of wildfires is lightning, but only 2% of wildfires in South Carolina are attributed to lightning. Weather is an important factor in dealing with wildfire. Wind and relative humidity affects fire spread and flammability. The most dangerous part of the fire is the head. Firefighters typically attack this part of the fire first since this is the most damaging.\nInitially, water droplets are propelled by updrafts from thunderstorms into the atmosphere, where they freeze. As the droplets collide and combine with other (supercooled 63 ) droplets in the atmosphere, it falls and gets propelled up again to the freezing level, and another layer of ice can form around the original. Eventually, when the hailstone develops sufficient weight to overcome the updraft, it falls towards the ground. The size of hail is a function of the intensity of the updraft and hence, the severity of the storm. Strong vertical motion can keep lifting hailstones so that they continue to accumulate in size 64 . The speed when hail reaches the ground, or its terminal velocity, is a function of its size and weight. However, very rarely does hail reach its maximum terminal velocity due to friction and drag, collision with other droplets, and the hailstones irregular shape.\nThere are three components for winter storm formation: cold air, moisture, and lift. Cold temperatures below freezing at ground level allow for snow and ice formation; moisture from bodies of water allows for the precipitation that eventually freezes to snow and ice; lift allows moisture to rise for cloud and precipitation formation.\nEarthquakes are caused by the sudden movement of rock beneath the earth surface. Stress built up in the Earth's crust causes rocks near the surface to break and slip, and when this occurs, an earthquake results. This region along which the slip occurs at the Earth's surface is called a fault 75 . Earthquakes occur along faults, tectonic plate boundaries, and mid-oceanic ridges (underwater mountain range) 76 . There are three types of faults (Figure 4.K.1): strike-slip (rock blocks move horizontally), normal (rock moves down relative to the other side), and thrust (rock moves up relative to the other side) 77 . The majority of earthquakes occur along tectonic plate boundaries, known as interplate earthquakes.\nSinkholes form on karst terrain, which is a region of bedrock that can be dissolved by water 83 . Water that is slightly acidic dissolves bedrock to form channels in the rock called conduits. When rain moves through the soil, it erodes and dissolves the karst bedrock. This action creates cracks that are part of the conduit system and moves soil particles through it. When soil is carried off, the soil surface above the conduit may form a small depression that acts as a funnel to gather more water, and repeats the soil movement cycle in the crevices and conduits. Clay soils can act to plug up the conduit and form ponds. While sinkholes can occur suddenly and expectantly, there are signs that can signal a potential development. Additionally, sinkhole formation may be aggravated by development and urbanization from increased water usage, altered drainage pathways and land surfaces. The signs of potential sinkhole formation include: 1. Slumping or falling fence posts, trees, or foundations; 2. Sudden formation of small ponds; 3. Wilting vegetation; 4. Discolored well water; and/or 5. Structural cracks in walls, floors.\nSlope movement occurs naturally due to gravity, when the strength of the earth materials exceed the angle of repose, the angle at which earth materials can rest on a slope without downward movement. Landslides have multiple causes, but many are triggered by rain, or some change in moisture level. Earthquakes, volcanic, and human activity may also trigger landslides. Landslides that occur underwater from earthquakes are called submarine landslides and can cause tsunamis."}, {"section_title": "Classification", "text": "Hurricane intensity is classified by the Saffir-Simpson Scale (Table 4.B.1), which categorizes hurricane intensity based upon maximum sustained wind speeds on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most intense. Typically, higher category hurricanes have lower pressure and greater storm surge. Categories 3, 4, and 5 are classified as \"major\" hurricanes, and while hurricanes within this range comprise only 20 percent of total landfalls, they account for over 70 percent of the damage in the United States. Hurricane Hugo, one of the strongest hurricanes to hit South Carolina, made landfall as a Category 4 at the Isle of Palms around midnight on September 21, 1989. Hugo had sustained winds of 140 mph and wind gusts of over 1 0 mph. Hugo is the costliest storm in South Carolina's history, causing $7 billion in damages overall and resulting in 20 fatalities in the state. Based on this event, a Category 4 hurricane is the maximum intensity the South Carolina Emergency Management Division (SCEMD) anticipates for planning purposes. \nA thunderstorm is classified as severe when at least one of the following occurs: wind speeds exceed 58 miles per hour, tornadoes spawn, or when hail exceeds 0.75 inches in diameter 40 . In the United States, about 10% of yearly thunderstorm events are classified as severe. Severe thunderstorms can also occur from supercells. A supercell is unique from other storms because it contains a single persistent rotating updraft zone, or a single cell rather than multiple cells in a system. A supercell storm can last up to several hours 41 , is immensely powerful, and typically have the conditions to spawn violent tornadoes. Mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) are circular and typically occur, and are most intense at night. MCCs generally consist of several isolated thunderstorms. The primary threats from these complexes are heavy rain and flooding 42 . A Squall line is the term used to identify a line of active thunderstorms. Lightning can cause injury and death. If thunder can be heard, lightning is present, and the best way to protect against lightning is to avoid it. The National Weather Service advises people to find an enclosed building to shelter in, while staying away from electronics, showers, sinks, and bathtubs. Fully enclosed automobiles are relatively safe because if it is struck, the electricity will flow around the outside of the car.\nDamage from tornadoes is from extreme winds and flying debris. It is rare to be able to measure pressure changes and wind speeds of a passing tornado, but it is possible to classify its damage. Typically, tornadoes cause the greatest damages to structures of light construction such as residential homes (particularly mobile homes), and their impacts tend to remain localized. The Enhanced Fujita Scale for Tornadoes was developed to measure tornado strength and associated damages (Table 4.E.1). The most severe tornado expected in South Carolina is an EF4, although as rare as an EF5 is, it is not impossible. \nThe terms used to classify floods are diverse, as are the number of subtypes. Floods may be broadly classified into two categories, as either general floods or flash floods (Table 4.F.1).\nThere are three classes of wild fires: surface fire, ground fire, and crown fire. A surface fire is the most common of these three classes moving slowly burns along a forest floor. A ground fire (muck fire) is usually started by lightning or human carelessness and burns on or below the forest floor. Crown fires spread rapidly by wind and move quickly by jumping along the tops of trees.\nDrought has a natural and human component; therefore it is defined in both conceptual and operational terms. Droughts are generally classified as meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, or socioeconomic 56 . Meteorological drought is based on the degree of dryness for a given period. Agricultural drought is based on the impact to agricultural activity from a deficit in precipitation, soil moisture, ground water supply, or reservoir levels. Hydrological drought is from a precipitation deficit that affects the surface and subsurface water supply (stream flow, lake levels, ground water). Socioeconomic drought reflects the adverse supply and demand relationship between economic goods that are dependent on precipitation and water supply. In the United States, the US Drought Monitor is a weekly map product produced through the partnership of the National Drought Mitigation Center, US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Drought Monitor maps measure present drought levels and future outlooks through a synthesis of multiple drought indices 57 . Meteorologists predict and monitor droughts using drought indices, as well as monitoring variables that reflect precipitation patters, stream flow, and soil moisture 58 .\nEstimating hail size is generally done through a descriptive comparison to a known object (Table  4.I.1). \nMost deaths associated with winter weather and storms are indirectly related, such as fatalities from traffic accidents due to icy conditions, or hypothermia from prolonged exposure. There is no generally accepted classification of winter storms or destruction, but winter storm types include: blizzard, lake effect, ice storm, and nor'easter 69 . Due to South Carolina's geography and southern location, lake effect snow is not considered.\nEnergy is released when an earthquake occurs, (P and S waves) which result in the shaking people feel and that which is detectable by seismic instruments 78 . The point below the surface, within the Earth's crust where an earthquake begins is called the hypocenter or focus, and the point directly above this depth on the Earth's surface is the epicenter. Earthquakes can affect hundreds of thousands of square miles, cause billions of dollars of property damage (primarily due to failure and collapse of structures from ground shaking), result in the loss of life and injury to thousands of people, and disrupt the social and economic functioning of the affected area. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes which may occur after the initial main shock and can also cause considerable damage 79 . The level of damage depends upon the amplitude and duration of the shaking, which are directly related to the earthquake size, distance from the fault, time of occurrence (greater fatalities tend to occur during weekday work hours when more people are in large office buildings or schools), site and soil type. Strength of shock waves diminish from the focus, thus greater distance from the earthquake origin will decrease likelihood or extent of damage. Other damaging earthquake effects include landslides, and liquefaction, in which ground soil loses the ability to resist shear and flows, much like quick sand. In the case of liquefaction, anything relying on the substrata for support can shift, tilt, rupture, or collapse. In urban areas, damage to electric and gas lines may lead to the common occurrence of local fires. Earthquakes that trigger movement of the seafloor may also generate tsunamis. Earthquakes are measured in terms of their magnitude and intensity. Magnitude is measured using the Richter Scale, an open-ended logarithmic scale that describes the energy release of an earthquake through a measure of shock wave amplitude (Table 4.K.1). Each unit increase in magnitude on the Richter Scale corresponds to a ten-fold increase in wave amplitude, or a 32-fold increase in energy. Intensity is most commonly measured using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale based on direct and indirect measurements of seismic effects. The scale levels are typically described using roman numerals, with a I corresponding to imperceptible (instrumental) events, IV corresponding to moderate (felt by people awake), to XII for catastrophic (total destruction). A detailed description of the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of earthquake intensity and its correspondence to the Richter Scale is provided in   \nThere are three types of sinkholes: subsidence, dissolution, and collapse. Subsidence sinkholes develop gradually where the cover layer is permeable, and mostly made of sand. Dissolution sinkholes have a thin overburden of limestone or dolomite. Exposed carbonate bedrock allows for intensive dissolution because of the thin overburden. Collapse sinkholes are the quickest to develop and may cause the greatest damages. This is where the cover layer contains a lot of clay sediment, and over time the sinkhole develops a shallow bowl-shaped depression (ga.water.usgs.gov). Additionally, sinkholes have been related to human activities, primarily from groundwater extraction and development. Sinkholes can develop where the natural water-drainage system and land surface is changed and runoff-storage ponds are formed. Weight of new material can trigger a collapse of the soil surface, causing a sinkhole.   \nLandslides occur abruptly and rapidly, carrying large masses of rock and soil. This speed distinguishes landslides from other slower mass-wastings, which can be slower and more gradual. Measuring the speed of landslides is difficult, but reports have been given at speeds of up to 100 miles an hour. A more common form of mass wasting is called flow, occurs when a section of the slop becomes unstable and flows downhill. The movement can be quick, or it may be gradual. Flows are relatively small, and are a shallow phenomenon that includes the movement of soil and loose rocks. The most common form of mass wasting is an earthflow, which involves a portion of a water-saturated slope that moves a limited distance, generally after a rainfall. There the flow originates is a scare in the surface of the slow. This mass wasting often results in the forced closures of roads and rails."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge", "text": "Storm Surge is elevated water level that is pushed towards the shore by the force of strong winds that result in the piling up of water. The advancing surge combines with the normal tides, which in extreme cases can increase the normal water height over 20 feet. The storm surge arrives ahead of the storm's actual landfall and the more intense the hurricane is, the sooner the surge arrives. Water rise can be very rapid and can move far inland, posing a serious threat to those who have not yet evacuated flood-prone areas. Debris carried by the waves can also contribute to the devastation. As the storm approaches shore, the greatest storm surge will be to the north of the hurricane eye, in the right-front quadrant of the direction in which the hurricane is moving. Such a surge of high water topped by waves driven by hurricane force winds can be devastating to coastal regions, causing severe beach erosion and property damage along the immediate coast. Storm surge heights, and associated waves, are dependent upon the shape of the continental shelf (narrow or wide) and the depth of the ocean bottom (bathymetry). A narrow shelf, or one that drops steeply from the shoreline and subsequently produces deep water close to the shoreline, tends to produce a lower surge but higher and more powerful storm waves. While disassociated with the Saffir-Simpson Scale, storm surge remains the leading killer of residents along immediate coastal areas. In order to analyze the potential impact of storm surge on coastal counties, the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model was used to estimate storm surge heights from historical, hypothetical, and predicted hurricanes 26 (Figure 4.B.1). GIS analysis was conducted using census block population data (aggregated to the county level) from Hazus-MH, in conjunction with SLOSH data, to model population exposure to storm surge zones (Table 4.B.2). GIS analysis was also conducted to analyze state-owned facility exposure to storm surge with the SLOSH data (Table 4.B.3).

Rainfall rates are related to the size and strength of the hurricane; slower moving and large storms tend to generate more rain 28 . Hurricane Isaac in 2012, being both large and slow-moving, caused rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour in some locations, which created dangerous flood conditions even after the storm was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm 29 ."}, {"section_title": "Tornadoes", "text": "Hurricanes and tropical storms may spawn tornadoes that are typically further out from the center of the system; generally embedded in the rain bands. Hurricane-spawned tornadoes also generally have a shorter lifespan but can still cause great damage 30 ."}, {"section_title": "Location", "text": "Although hurricanes make landfall in the coastal areas, all counties in South Carolina have experienced damage from hurricanes. Some of the most destructive hurricanes and tropical storms have originated in the Gulf of Mexico or traveled around the tip of Florida, impacting in the upstate region. For example, Hurricane Frances hit the upstate in 2004 with enough damage to warrant a Presidential Disaster Declaration.\nEight of the 46 counties in South Carolina are located along the Atlantic coast, making the especially vulnerable to hurricanes, sea level rise, erosion, salt water intrusion, and other coastal events. Coastal events can also have inland-reaching impacts; in particular, the inland counties of Williamsburg, Orangeburg, and Florence have historically been affected by hurricanes and coastal storms.\nThunderstorms can occur in all regions of the United States but are most common in the central and southern states. It cannot be predicted where thunderstorms may occur, therefore it is assumed in this plan that all buildings and facilities are considered to be equally exposed to these to hazards and could be impacted. April 9, 2011: Severe thunderstorms produced lightning, which struck the Centenary Baptist Church. Property damage was estimated at $300,000.\nAlthough flooding can happen anywhere in South Carolina, given the atmospheric conditions and/or lack of proper maintenance to flood control and drainage systems, flooding typically occurs in floodplains. Floodplains are flat areas adjacent to streams and rivers that are prone to flooding. This area absorbs any overflow of water from the stream or river banks. Floodplains are designated by the frequency of the flood that is large enough to cover the area. For example, the 10-year floodplain will be covered by the 10-year flood and the 100-year floodplain by the 100-year flood. Flood frequencies such as the 100-year flood are determined by plotting a graph of the size of all known floods for an area and determining how often floods of a particular size occur. Another way of expressing the flood frequency is the chance of occurrence in a given year, which is the percentage of the probability of flooding each year. For example, a 10 year flood has a 10 percent probability of occurring in any given year, a 50 year event has a 2% probability, a 100 year event a 1% probability, and a 500 year event a 0.2% probability. While unlikely, it is possible to have two 100 or even 500 year floods within months or years of each other.\nThe majority of wildfires are human-caused or from lightning strikes, therefore they can occur anywhere in the state of South Carolina. For the purpose of this plan, all buildings and facilities are considered to be equally exposed.\nDrought occurs in a broad geographic area and can occur anywhere in the state of South Carolina. For the purpose of this plan, all buildings and facilities are considered to be equally exposed. January through December 1954: Total statewide precipitation for that year was a mere 32.96 inches, which set the current record for driest year ever recorded in the state. An excessively hot summer only exacerbated its impact. According to National Weather Service reports, the crop yield was only 10 percent of its 10-year average production rate. \nAccording to historical data collected by the National Climatic Data Center, since 1955 approximately 2.59 hail events occur annually per county. Hail events cannot be predicted as to where they will occur, so for the purpose of this plan, all buildings and facilities are considered to be equally exposed to this hazard.\nWinter storms typically affect a larger geographic area, encompassing multiple counties. While South Carolina does not regularly encounter winter storms but can occur anywhere in the state. For the purpose of this plan, all buildings and facilities are considered to be equally exposed.\nSouth Carolina is located in the interior of the North American plate, and earthquakes that occur within a plate are called intraplate earthquakes (37-SCEMD). Earthquake activity in South Carolina fall under three main causes: fault activity, reservoir induced seismicity, and Appalachian rise. A map showing the fault system in South Carolina is shown in Figure 4.K.3. Reservoir induced seismicity occurs when man-made lakes and dams cause water-pore pressure to increase, thereby reducing the strength of the underlying rock and allowing the rock to slip. Lastly, geological activity erodes and weathers the Appalachian Mountains, removing weight from the land and causing the mountains to slowly rise. These movements cause the earthquake activity in the upstate. The following paragraphs discuss the earthquake risks shown in   Earthquake Risk -Talwani and Schaeffer (2001) from the University of South Carolina used evidence from previous earthquakes to determine how often earthquakes like the 1886 earthquake have occurred in the Charleston/Coastal area. They determined that earthquakes in the Charleston area appear to occur about every 400-500 years and the possibility that large earthquakes may occur in Georgetown and Bluffton on average 2000 year cycles. Unfortunately, their data set is limited to only the last 6000 years because of changes in groundwater levels, which affect the formation of earthquake features. Therefore, it seems unlikely that a large earthquake will occur anytime soon in the Lowcountry. Statistically, there is a 1/400 chance that a large earthquake will occur each year. Smaller (<5.5-) earthquakes don't tend to leave much evidence behind for scientists to find later, so it is unclear how often these occur in this area. This region has a thick layer of sediment cover with a predominantly swampy characteristic, therefore earthquakes that do occur here will have more shaking than in the other two regions. Midlands -This region includes the counties on the coastal plain with older (> 2 million years) surficial sediments. This region includes the Fall Line as a potential earthquake source. Dams here have also been known to have caused earthquakes. Counties in this region include: Dillon, Marlboro, Chesterfield, Darlington, Lee, Kershaw, Clarendon, Sumter, Richland, Calhoun, Orangeburg, Lexington, Aiken, Barnwell, Bamberg, and Allendale. Earthquake Risk -The Midlands area is not known to have experienced any large earthquakes in the past. The Fall Line in South Carolina represents a change in geology makeup and is the location of a large fault system that stretches across the state. Until recently, this area was thought to be relatively inactive until recent activity indicated that this may be a mildly active fault. Historical earthquakes in the Midlands have been small (magnitude 2-4) and have caused minimal damage. Two earthquakes near Florence in the fall of 2006 caused minor damage to homes that are located on weaker soils and swampy lands. The thin layer of loose sediment in the Midlands, especially around the swampy areas can increase the amplitude of earthquake waves and increase the shaking felt. Piedmont/Blue Ridge -The counties in this region overlay almost entirely igneous/metamorphic basement rock with local river alluvium and weathered bedrock cover. The 1913 Union County earthquake occurred within this region. Counties here include: Oconee, Pickens, Anderson, Greenville, Spartanburg, Cherokee, Union, York, Chester, Laurens, Newberry, Fairfield, Lancaster, Abbeville, Greenwood, McCormick, Saluda, and Edgefield. Earthquake Risk -Generally, the Piedmont/Blue Ridge and Midlands section of South Carolina are considered at a low risk of major (magnitude 6+) earthquakes. However, in 1913 Union County South Carolina experienced an earthquake that by today's standards would probably be measured as a 5.5 on the Richter scale. Not much is known about the cause of the Union County earthquake because of the lack of technology at the time, but at the present, the risk of a major earthquake is considered to be low. The Piedmont/Blue Ridge area is also susceptible to smaller earthquakes (magnitude 2-4) in other locations, especially near dams. The USC seismic stations have recorded numerous small earthquakes associated with dams in the Piedmont/Blue Ridge area and some smaller earthquakes distributed around the area. These small earthquakes not associated with dams may be associated with the uplift of the Appalachian Mountains as is seen in other areas near the mountains. Earthquakes in this region are likely to be felt over large areas because of the relatively unbroken mass of rock they occur in. This allows earthquake waves to travel long distances before they become attenuated and are no longer felt. Because most buildings are built on solid rock, earthquakes will cause less damage than earthquakes in the Lowcountry because solid rock does not increase the amplitude of earthquake waves, whereas loose sediment can increase the shaking by increasing the amplitude of the waves.  The initial shock occurred at 9:51 p.m. and lasted between 35 to 40 seconds. There was a second strong aftershock 8 minutes after the initial shock, and six aftershocks followed within a 24 hour period. Within a 160 kilometer radius, cities of Columbia, South Carolina, Savannah and Augusta, Georgia also experienced damage. The total affected area covered over 5 million square kilometers, and was felt in cities of New York, Boston, Milwaukee. Cuba, Bermuda, and Ontario, Canada also felt the main earthquake 80 . \n\nAll tsunamis pose a threat to coastal communities and can occur anywhere along the U.S. coastline. Although tsunamis are associated with Pacific Rim states (Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska), historical evidence does indicate that tsunamis have affected the Eastern United States. Tsunami events along the East Coast are not the result of traditional sources of tsunami waves (i.e., subduction zones such as the Cascadia Subduction Zone), but rather are typically the result of slumping or landsliding associated with local earthquakes or with wave action associated with strong storms such as hurricanes. Other possible causes of tsunami-like activity along the East Coast could include explosive decompression of underwater methane deposits, the impact of a heavenly body (i.e., an asteroid, comet or oceanic meteor splashdown), or a large underwater explosion. One significant contributing factor to tsunami-related damage is the massive amount of moving debris possible during a tsunami event-including manmade debris such as boats and on-shore debris as the tsunami strikes land. Areas at greater risk are where it is located less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mile of the shoreline. Drowning is the primary cause of death from tsunamis. Tsunamis on the east coast are typically the result of underwater landslides. The most active earthquake faults in South Carolina are on land so they do not create tsunamis, but faults near the Caribbean and southern Spain are prone to thrust faulting, so South Carolinians need to be aware of the risk of tsunamis 99 . Two offshore areas are currently under investigation according to a 2002 National Geophysical Data Center report. One area of interest consists of large cracks northeast of Cape Hatteras that could signal the early stages of an underwater landslide that could result in a tsunami. The other area of interest consists of submarine canyons approximately 150 kilometers from Atlantic City, New Jersey. A significant factor for consideration with regard to these areas is recent discoveries along the East Coast that demonstrate the existence of pressurized hydrates and pressurized water layers in the continental shelf. This has produced speculation among the scientific community on possible triggers that could cause sudden and perhaps violent releases of compressed material that may cause landslides and tsunami waves. The TsuanamiReady Program, developed by the National Weather Service assists with cities, towns, counties, universities, and other sites in coastal areas to reduce the risk of loss from tsunamirelated consequences 100 . In South Carolina, there are seven TsuanmiReady sites, located in three counties, and four communities. Additional information on the program and a map of participating communities is included in Section 6."}, {"section_title": "Historical and Notable Events", "text": "Great Sea Island Storm of 1893 (August 27-28, 1893): One of the deadliest hurricanes to strike the United States, this storm made landfall in Georgia at high tide bringing a tremendous storm surge that created a \"tidal wave\" effect that swept over and submerged whole islands. The storm's north-northeast track through the South Carolina midlands brought wind speeds between 96 mph and 125 mph, with maximum winds of 125 mph in the Beaufort area, and up to 120 mph in Charleston. Major damages were reported as the storm moved north near Columbia and then northeast through the rest of the state, causing between 2,000 and 2,500 deaths, an estimated $10 million in damages, and leaving 20,000 to 30,000 survivors homeless.\n\nApril 30, 1924: \"The Horrell Hill Tornado\" ripped a 135-mile path across the state. The longest tornado path recorded in the state's history, it began in Aiken County and ended in Darlington County. Sixty-seven people lost their lives, with almost half the deaths occurring in Richland County and the community of Horrell Hill. According to damage records and historical reports, current estimations rate this storm an F4 on the Fujita Scale, with wind speeds somewhere between 207 mph and 260 mph. March 28, 1984: An intense low-pressure center moved across the state, spawning 11 tornadoes and numerous severe thunderstorms. The first tornado to appear struck Anderson County, and was quickly followed by a series of 10 tornadoes. The tornadoes traveled across Anderson and Newberry Counties, moving east-northeast through Marlboro County before entering North Carolina. Fifteen people lost their lives, with an additional six deaths indirectly associated with the events. Damages were estimated at over $100 million. October 11, 2002: A strong EF2 tornado touched down in Georgetown County and destroyed five manufactured homes, a car, and two houses before continuing along a northeastern path for a mile through a residential area of Georgetown. Twenty-eight structures were damaged, including homes, businesses, and churches. Eight people were hospitalized for minor injuries and property damage was estimated at over $750,000. September 4, 2004: An EF2 tornado caused three injuries and $1.7 million in property damage in Sumter County. Emergency managers reported major damage to 55 homes, with an additional nine homes that were completely destroyed.\nJune 6, 1903 (Riverine and Flash Flooding): The greatest number of people ever killed by floodwaters in South Carolina occurred on the Pacolet River in Spartanburg County. Floods were reportedly feet above normal stage in some areas. Six textile mills in Pacolet and Clifton were destroyed, 70 homes and businesses were decimated, and reports of 50-80 people lost their lives 48 . September 21-24, 1928 (Riverine and Coastal Flooding): Severe flooding caused by a hurricane was reported statewide, with rainfall totals ranging from 10 to 12 inches. Many bridges were destroyed, and roads and railways were impassable. Property losses reached an estimated $4 to $6 million.\n\nApril 24, 1999: A super cell thunderstorm moved through Saluda County and produced hail, some as large as baseballs, along its entire path. Homes, buildings, farm equipment, vehicles, and crops were damaged. The thunderstorm, including the associated hail, caused damages across a threemile wide swath. Property damages were estimated to be $2 million, crop damages were estimated to be $2 million, and two injuries were reported.\nFebruary 8-11, 1973: A snowstorm of historic proportions impacted the state, leaving behind a record inches of snow in some areas. Snowdrifts of up to eight inches were recorded. Approximately 30,000 motorists were stranded on the state's highways-many rescued by helicopter. Eight exposure-related fatalities were reported. Over 200 buildings, in addition to thousands of awnings and carports, collapsed under the weight of the snow. Property and road damages as well as the cost of snow removal and rescue operations were estimated to total approximately $30 million. March 13, 1993: This winter storm, which possessed an extremely low atmospheric pressure, passed across South Carolina bringing damaging winds, recorded snowfalls of as much as 11.5 feet in portions of the mountains, and snow flurries on the southeast tip of the coast. Preliminary damage assessments at the time were estimated at over $22 million. Two fatalities in South Carolina resulted from this event that is also known as the \"Superstorm of the Century\" 70 . This historic storm impacted 26 states and broke many historical weather records in the affected areas. January 22-29, 2000: Low pressure rapidly deepened near the Carolina coast, wrapping abundant moisture back across the Piedmont of the Carolinas. By the time snow ended, accumulations ranged from 12 to 20 inches. Due to the heavy wet snow, numerous power outages occurred and buildings collapsed. On January 29, a weakening low pressure system in the Ohio River Valley, and a low pressure system along the Gulf Coast, coupled with arctic air across the Carolinas, resulted in an icy mess throughout Upstate South Carolina. Precipitation, which briefly began as a light mixture of sleet and snow, quickly turned to freezing rain, resulting in a glaze 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick on exposed surfaces. Power outages were common across the region, especially in the Lower Piedmont from Abbeville to Greenwood. South Carolina requested $9.2 million in federal disaster aid to remove snow and downed trees. A total of 38 counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration. December 4, 2002: An ice storm causing $100 million in property damages affected a majority of the counties in the state. Abbeville, Anderson, Cherokee, Chester, Greenville, Oconee, Pickens, Greenwood, Laurens, Spartanburg, Union, and York counties suffered most of the losses from this event, which included ice accumulations up to 1\u00bd inch in some areas. Hundreds of thousands of homes were without power, many for as long as two weeks in some areas. \nJanuary 6, 2005 89 : In the early morning of the 6 th , a northbound freight train traveling through Graniteville in Aiken County was improperly diverted and collided with a parked train, causing the derailment of both locomotives and 16 of the 42 freight cars on the northbound train. Of the derailed, 3 of them were tank cars containing chlorine gas, one of which was breached. Nine people died from chlorine inhalation and over 500 were taken to hospitals for respiratory difficulties. About 5,400 people were evacuated within a one-mile radius of the derailment site. This incident caused damages of over $6.9 million dollars.    \nThe tsunami threat for South Carolina is extremely low, and any tsunamis would likely be small and inundate the beaches exclusively. Although the risk is low, the consequences could be high. Armed Attack: This element of terrorism refers primarily to tactical assault or sniping from a remote location.

One fatality and approximately $27 million in damages were reported. Hurricane Hazel is considered one of the most severe storms to hit South Carolina to date. Hurricane Gracie (September 29, 1959): Category 3 hurricane Gracie made landfall at St. Helena Island with winds of 140 mph, moving northwest before weakening to a tropical storm as it passed through Columbia and turned north-northwest on a path into North Carolina. Storm surge reached nearly six feet above normal tides. Several fatalities, as well as property damage, were reported along the southern coastal area. Heavy crop damage occurred, and moderate to heavy flooding was reported due to six to eight inches of rainfall. Hurricane Hugo (September 21, 1989): Hugo, a Category 4 hurricane made landfall at Isle of Palms with sustained winds of 140 mph and wind gusts exceeding 160 mph. Hugo is the costliest storm in South Carolina history, causing over $7 billion in damages to property and crops in the United States and the first major hurricane to strike the state since Gracie in 1959. Total damages, including those that occurred in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, exceeded 10 billion dollars. Hurricane Hugo resulted in 35 storm-related fatalities, 20 of which occurred in South Carolina. Seven of the South Carolina fatalities occurred in mobile home parks northwest of Charleston. The strongest winds passed over the Francis Marion National Forest between Bulls Bay and the Santee River. The Forest Service estimated that timber losses exceeded $100 million. While the most severe winds occurred to the northeast of Charleston, the city was hard hit. The Charleston City Hall and a fire station lost their roofs and over 4,000 historic properties were damaged. Coastal storm surge reached 20 feet in some areas, making it the highest ever recorded in the state. Folly Beach was among the most significantly impacted coastal communities. Approximately 80 percent of the homes were destroyed. Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms were also severely damaged. Numerous homes were knocked off their foundations and boats in the local marina were tossed into a 50 foot tall pile of debris. Severe inland wind damage occurred as winds gusting to 109 mph at Sumter were reported. The hurricane exited the state just north of Rock Hill, causing significant damage in Charlotte, North Carolina. South Carolina received a Presidential Disaster Declaration for this event. 5,1996): Although Hurricane Fran skirted the South Carolina coast before making landfall at the entrance of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina, it triggered the evacuation of 500,000 tourists in the coastal areas of both states. Wind gusts of 60 mph were reported along the Horry County coast. In Georgetown County, 57 mph winds in the City of Georgetown contributed to $150,000 in county government infrastructure damage. Eleven evacuation shelters housed 5,400 people. One death was attributed to the storm. In Horry County, agricultural losses of $19.8 million were reported, with corn, tobacco and sweet potato crops hardest hit. Downed trees caused power outages affecting about 60,000 customers. Horry County reported property losses totaling over $1 million, including $448,000 at North Myrtle Beach, $341,000 at Myrtle Beach, $42,000 at Surfside Beach, $46,000 at Garden City Beach, and $135,000 in unincorporated areas.

Sustained winds of tropical storm force were reported from Savannah, Georgia to Charleston, with wind gusting to hurricane force strength in the Charleston area. The highest recorded sustained wind speed was 58 mph in downtown Charleston, with gusts reaching 85 mph. Rainfall was heavy along coastal counties as 12 inches of rain fell in Georgetown County. A reported 18 inches fell in eastern Horry County, causing major flooding along the Waccamaw River in and around the City of Conway for a month. Waves were reported to be 15 feet at Cherry Grove Pier, where damage was the greatest. Minor to moderate beach erosion occurred along the South Carolina coast. Many businesses and homes suffered major damage, with thousands of homes experiencing at least some minor damage in Charleston County, causing approximately $10.5 million in damage. In Horry County, approximately 400 homes and numerous roads were inundated for over one month following the storm. Beaufort County reported $750,000 damage, and Berkeley and Dorchester counties reporting $500,000 each. Over 1,000 trees were blown down, knocking out power to over 200,000 customers across the southern coast. In Myrtle Beach, tree and sign damage was reported to reach approximately $250,000. In Williamsburg County, total damage estimates due to the high winds and rain reached approximately $650,000. In Florence County, high winds downed trees, caused power outages and resulted in $150,000 in property damages. Total estimated property damages for the affected counties totaled approximately $17 million. While Hurricane Floyd did not make landfall in South Carolina, it resulted in the largest peacetime evacuation in the state's history, surpassing Hurricane Fran. It is estimated that between 500,000 and one million people evacuated the coast. South Carolina received a Presidential Disaster Declaration for this event. Hurricane Gaston (August 29, 2004): Gaston reached Category 1 sustained wind speeds before making landfall as a tropical storm near Awendaw, South Carolina 31 . The next day, Gaston weakened to a tropical depression in the northeastern portion of the state. Charleston and Georgetown Counties had voluntary evacuation issued for barrier islands, low-lying areas, beachfront areas, mobile homes, and other places that are prone to flooding. Localized flooding occurred from storm surge of roughly four feet. Peak wind gusts were recorded at 82 mph in Charleston and Isle of Palms. There were strong winds from this slow storm that knocked down trees, power lines, and caused major structural damage. Roughly 3000 structures were damaged from strong winds in Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester counties. An F1 tornado was reported in Marlboro County 32 .

Using the methods and data described in the previous section, maps of probabilistic 100-year and 500-year hurricane events were modeled for the state of South Carolina from Hazus. The 100-year event means there is a 1% chance of the event happening in any given year. The 500-year event means there is a 0.2% chance of the event happening in any given year.  Figure  4.B.4 are the resulting maps from the modeled probabilistic 100-year and 500-year hurricane events. These maps show potential peak wind gusts and a probable storm track for each event. As expected, the highest peak wind gusts will be felt along the South Carolina coast. In the 500-year model, high wind gusts will be felt further inland than the 100-year event.

Following the descriptions below, Tables 4.B.6a-d provide more detailed numbers to specific subcategories of losses for the 100-year hurricane, and Tables 4.B.7a-d provides detailed estimates for the 500-year hurricane. Total economic loss for the 100-year hurricane event is estimated at $6,858,500,000 ($24,420,400,000) dollars. Buildings: Hazus-MH estimates that there are 1,832,000 buildings in the state with a total replacement value of $248,996,000,000 (2006 $). According to the results of this analysis, 72,360 (231,199) buildings will sustain at least moderate damage. The total number of buildings expected to have damage beyond repair is 4,197 (32,978). The following Table  4.B.6a (Table 4.B.7a) summarizes expected damage based on general building type. Table  4.B.6b (Table 4.B.7b) provides detail on direct building losses and income losses. Direct building losses are the estimated costs to repair or replace the damage and income losses result from the inability to continue business operations because of sustained damages. Table 4.B.6d and Table 4.B.7d gives the estimated total building losses (for all occupancy types) at the county level for the 100 and 500-year events. Hazus-MH provides an estimated loss ratio for building economic losses. Using this loss ratio and the total value of all buildings, an estimated loss total for all buildings by county is provided for the 100-and 500-year hurricane wind events. Essential Facilities: Hazus provides estimated damage to essential facilities (Table 4.B.6c,  Table 4.B.7c), which include hospitals, schools, police and fire stations, and emergency operations facilities (EOC). Before the earthquake, the state had 14,840 hospital beds. The model estimates that 11,793 (6,914) hospital beds remain available in use.

"}, {"section_title": "Erosion", "text": "Erosion is a process that breaks down and wears away land due to physical and chemical processes of water, wind, and general meteorological conditions. An area's potential for erosion is determined by four factors: soil characteristics, vegetative cover, climate or rainfall, and topography. The two major erosion mechanisms are wind and water. Wind that blows across sparsely vegetated or disturbed lands can cause erosion by picking up soil, carrying it through the air, and displacing it in another place. Water erosion occurs over land, and in streams and channels. Major storms can cause coastal erosion from the combination of high winds and heavy surf and storm surge. Human interactions, such as construction and development in coastal and riparian regions, can also exacerbate erosion. DHEC-OCRM revises long-term beach erosion rates, as well as the state's beachfront baseline and 40 year set back line every eight to ten years. This process was recently completed (early 2010), and the updated rates and beachfront jurisdictional line maps can be found at: http://www.scdhec.gov/environment/ocrm/permit_beachfront.htm. Based on this analysis of shoreline changes since the mid-1800s, and other independent researchers, South Carolina's beaches appear to be experiencing net erosion in general, but beach renourishment has been keeping pace with this underlying trend in most cases. Long-term shoreline change rates, (as shown in Figure 4.C.3a, b) varies from marginally accretional along some standard beaches, to highly erosional (as much as 20 feet per year) in some highly dynamic inlet areas.

Urban flooding: occurs because of impervious surfaces (streets, roads, parking lots, residential and business areas that inhibits ground water absorption, causing runoff 2. Riverine flooding: this occurs when an increase in water volume within a river channel causes an overflow onto the surrounding floodplain. This type of flooding is the most common in the United States and is may also be termed 'overbank flooding' 47 . 3. Coastal flooding: water pushed inland as a result of storm surge, wind-driven waves, and heavy rainfall produced by hurricanes, tropical storms, nor'easters, and other coastal storms. 4. Local drainage problems: can occur anywhere in the State where the ground is flat, where the drainage pattern has been disrupted, or where channels or culverts have not been maintained. 5. Dam/levee failure: each dam in the State has the potential to fail and suddenly release its impounded water, flooding the land downstream.

It is difficult to predict the amount of sea level rise along the coast of South Carolina, but there are numerous factors related to this hazard, including land subsidence, groundwater depletion, wave action, hurricanes, and natural climate variation 91 . The EPA suggests that sea level rise may increase the impact of coastal storms 92 . Modeling sea level rise is based on historical evidence 93 . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a climate change and sea level rise report in 2007. For coastal regions in the United States, it is estimated that we will see at least 0.6m of sea level rise, and more likely up to 2.0m rise.

Here LIDAR derived raster elevation data (DEMs) are classified as flooded by first identifying the DEM grid cells that have an elevation at or below a given sea-level rise scenario (0.6 m, 1m and 2m). This selection was further dissected to remove grid cells that met the elevation criteria but are not connected (geospatially) to the water source (in this case the Atlantic Ocean). A standard spatial cost distance algorithm 95 further culled cells based on connectivity where the \"cost\" to travel across a non-flooded grid cell would preclude non-adjacent cells from being counted as flooded. Analysis for each county provides a general understanding of the impacts of potential sea-level rise. Table 4.Q.1 shows the maximum and average inundation levels for each coastal county. Overall, Beaufort County has the most land area to lose in any of the modeled sea-level rise scenarios. However both Colleton and Georgetown Counties stand to lose substantial land area based on current projections. Coastal counties attract tourists because of the natural beauty of the beaches and other recreational activities. The continuation of coastal development, critical infrastructure, services, and physical property are located in potential threat zones. Horry and Charleston, two of the larger tourist destinations, stand to lose significantly less land area than other coastal counties, but these areas are not immune from the effects of sea-level rise. Figures 4.Q.1 -4.Q.3 display the sea level rise analysis results for the coastal area projected impact from 0.6 meter, 1 meter, and 2 meter sea level rise. In future updates to the SHMP, South Carolina will work to improve sea level rise analysis. The IPCC will release their next report and estimates of climate change in late 2013 or early 2014.

Local plans scheduled to be updated may request to meet with the SCEMD planning staff to discuss the update process. It is recommended that they begin this process as soon as their plan is officially approved by FEMA and adopted by the local communities. The SCEMD planning staff is available to provide technical assistance and guidance to the local community throughout the five year update cycle.

Also, the SCDNR is the agency that contains the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) State Coordinating Office and is a Cooperating Technical Partner (CTP) in FEMA's flood hazard mapping program. The NFIP State Coordinating Office provides a vital link between the Federal government and local communities on matters related to floodplain management. Under the CTP agreement the SCDNR collaborates with local communities and FEMA in creating and maintaining up-to-date flood hazard maps and other flood hazard information. The South Carolina Department of Insurance established the mitigation grant program, SC Safe Home following the passage of The Omnibus Coastal Property Insurance Reform Act of 2007. The program was one of several incentives included in the law that were designed to help lower coastal property insurance costs thereby making more attractive risks for insurers, all in an effort to minimize the impact the coastal regions of the state would experience from a hurricane or severe wind event. The grant program provides homeowners in the coastal communities up to $5,000 in one-time grant funds to assist them in mitigating their property and making it stronger against winds and the effects of hurricanes and natural disasters. To date, the program has awarded more than 2,000 grants totaling more than $8.5 million to coastal residents. Additionally, the program provides an economic impact to the coastal counties by working with more than 150 contractors and inspectors that have received specialized training through the program to do the code-plus retrofit work to the homes. The SC Safe Home Program continues to grow and receive national recognition, as it is the only program of its kind. SC Safe Home has been featured on webinars, websites and conferences for organizations including the The National Housing Policy Council, CERES, and The Heinz Foundation. The Department and SC Safe Home continue to receive recognition at state and national meetings hosted by organizations such as Ren Re, Weather Predict, The Travelers Institute, The Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, The Institute for Business and Home Safety and others. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) is the environmental quality control and health regulation agency of the state. It is responsible for the implementation of state and federal regulations related to the protection of the environment and the health of its residents, including the regulation and oversight of licensed health care facilities. By the regulatory nature of this agency, SCDHEC conducts mitigation planning and activities by ensuring that facilities, businesses, and water and air quality businesses and agencies meet the minimum standards as established in regulations. Specifically, the dam infrastructure is monitored by SCDHEC staff and dam safety is an area of mitigation concern. The agency also implements surveillance measures to monitor, advise, and protect the public and healthcare providers in the case of bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. SCDHEC's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) is directed by the SC Coastal Zone Management Act (1977) \"\u2026to provide for the protection and enhancement of the State's coastal resources.\" A component of protecting the State's coastal resources is mitigating disasters. The Department promotes disaster mitigation through: 1) Critical Area permitting, 2) local beach management plans, and 3) renourishment funding assistance. First, OCRM administers a permitting program for the utilization of Critical Areas, which are defined as coastal waters, tidelands, beach/dune systems, and beaches. Construction or reconstruction seaward of the jurisdictional baseline or between the baseline and setback line is regulated, and there are limitations (i.e.: square footage of heated space; sited as far landward as possible) on development of property that falls between these lines. Retreat from the active beachfront is also encouraged, particularly post-disaster. Habitable structures are guided to be constructed or reconstructed as far landward as possible. New beachfront erosion control devices, such as seawalls, are prohibited and beachfront erosion control devices that are damaged beyond repair may not be reconstructed. Second, local comprehensive beach management plans are prepared by local governments with assistance from OCRM. The comprehensive plans include an inventory of erosion rates, structures within the Department's beachfront jurisdiction, public access points and facilities for each beachfront community. Moreover, the plans require the local government to have a post-disaster plan to promote preparedness. Lastly, state generated revenue is sometimes available for beach renourishment needs, but funding is contingent on local governments having updated comprehensive beach management plans, adequate public access and matching local funds. In addition to the ICC and technical experts, SCEMD has the support of the numerous local, state and federal agencies to develop and implement the goals and mitigation actions found in this plan. Furthermore, SCEMD has an organizational structure that served as the foundation for the oversight of the planning process. These partners work closely with SCEMD and FEMA to ensure the plan's maintenance, track progress and update the plan as needed. Improvements continue in the degree to which state agencies coordinate complimentary objectives addressing hazard mitigation activities. In addition, there has been improved coordination building on established relationships, conducting hazard studies across the state, and cultivating positive working relationships. The Mitigation Action Plan, which forms the basis of Section 7 and Section 8, serves as a primary means to achieve an improved level of inter-agency coordination. By establishing clear actions, linked to specific agencies, accountability is increased. Actions are assigned timelines approved by the ICC, further linking policy and project completion with accountability. Therefore actions can be tracked over time to assess the degree to which the plan is achieving desired aims. Finally, the Mitigation Action Plan is easily updated as needed, following a disaster or as required by the Stafford Act, thereby increasing the likelihood that state agencies remain involved."}, {"section_title": "Floodplain Management", "text": "Sound floodplain management involves a series of programs designed to reduce flood-related damages.

In order for a county or municipality to join the NFIP, they must adopt a Local Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. This document provides local governments with a powerful regulatory tool to reduce future flood-related losses. Another key service provided by the NFIP includes the mapping of identified flood hazard areas.

TECHNICAL CAPABILITY", "text": "The state has a moderate level of technical capability to implement the state hazard mitigation strategy. While there exists a wide range of technical resources across state agencies, the development of a systematic protocol for sharing resources to analyze natural hazards and develop meaningful actions to reduce their impact could be improved. Additional factors affecting technical capability include: 1. Information on past disasters and mitigation projects; 2. Experience in disaster management and mitigation planning; and 3. The application of technology to address hazards. Examples include the use of GISdriven risk assessments and information technologies to facilitate the formulation, development, implementation, and monitoring of mitigation actions. Technical capability can be defined as possessing the skills and tools needed to accomplish specific tasks and distribute the results to those associated with the State of South Carolina Hazard Mitigation Program. Technical capability can be measured across three primary elements: 1) geographic information systems (GIS) and database management; 2) grants management; and 3) hazard mitigation planning. Measuring the degree to which each element is found in the state was conducted through interviews with state staff. Geographic information systems (GIS) and database management capabilities can be measured by reviewing existing tools (hardware and software) and the access to individual experts who can effectively gather, analyze and display relevant information. In the case of South Carolina, SCEMD developed the data analyses needed for the hazards. The Hazard Vulnerability Research Institute (HVRI) within the University of South Carolina (USC) conducts field and survey research on group, organizational, and community preparation for, response to, and recovery from natural and technological disasters and other community-wide crises. The HVRI, in conjunction with SCEMD, has compiled hazard and loss data for the entire state and made it available on the Internet in GIS format. This data is used to conduct risk assessments for this plan as well as local hazard mitigation plans. The USC Geology Department has conducted numerous earthquake-related studies in South Carolina, including on-going analysis of earthquake vulnerability in the Charleston-Berkeley-Dorchester county area. The information generated and analyzed has proven valuable to assist in the identification of hazard vulnerability, assess past events and document specific mitigation measures adopted across the state. Hazard mitigation-related grants management capabilities were measured by assessing the State HMGP Administrative Plan, the number of staff assigned to conduct identified duties, and the degree to which state and FEMA mitigation staff should train local governments to implement mitigation grant programs. Adequate staff support and training were reviewed in the context of the overall vulnerability of the state to hazards, which took into account the size of the state and the number and magnitude of past events. In the state, hazard mitigation grants management duties are the responsibility of the SHMO and the State NFIP Coordinator who administer the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Program and the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program, respectively. FEMA Region IV provides technical support as needed. Structured and regular training of local governments to administer grant programs continues to impact the statewide mitigation strategy. This training should allow for a source of expertise and staffing at the county and municipal level.

FISCAL CAPABILITY", "text": "The ability to take action in a state is closely associated with the amount of money available to implement policies and projects. Funding may be obtained from grants or state and locally based revenue. The costs associated with policy and project implementation vary widely. In some cases, policies are tied to staff costs associated with the creation and monitoring of a given program. In other cases, funding is linked to a project, like the acquisition of flood-prone homes that can require a substantial commitment from local, state and federal funding sources. In either case, decisions must be made concerning how the state can reduce vulnerability to an acceptable level considering the availability of existing and future finances. Taking into account both state agency operating budgets tied to mitigation-related activities and external funding sources obtained in recent years, the state has a limited fiscal capability for South Carolina's size and hazard vulnerability. Fiscal capability can be increased over time as a more direct link is made between existing state-level environmental and economic development programs and hazard mitigation objectives identified in this plan. Specific examples include the use of existing state and non-profit environmental land acquisition programs and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to address mitigation-related projects. The identification of eligible Pre-Disaster Mitigation projects, as well as other federal funding sources identified in this plan, should allow communities in the state to compete nationally for available funding and serve to highlight opportunities for state agencies to coordinate funding resources."}, {"section_title": "E. LEGAL CAPABILITY", "text": "In 1975, the General Assembly passed the Local Government Act, commonly called the Home Rule act, which gave counties authority to enact regulations and ordinances and make decisions regarding taxation and spending. It is important to note that while the state may provide the authority of a local government to act, much of the specific mitigation projects implemented in any given state are often done at the municipal level. Yet broader policy objectives and programs often exist at the state and federal levels of government. Furthermore, federal and state funding often drive local project initiatives. Therefore, in order to be effective, this plan should recognize the local; state and federal legal framework surrounding hazard mitigation planning. In general, local governments have the authority to enact the following actions: regulation (including general police power, building codes and building inspections, land use), acquisition of property for public use, taxation and spending. Each of these categories provides tools that local governments can use to implement hazard mitigation measures. Police Power: Local governments have the authority to enact hazard mitigation measures, based on their authority to protect public health, safety and welfare. One means to do this is using local ordinances. In addition, local governments can cite their authority to address \"nuisances,\" which may include, under certain circumstances, those actions that make people or property more vulnerable to hazards. Building Codes: Building codes represent a regulatory tool that can is used to reduce the impacts of hazards. Local governments in the state have the authority to enforce building codes adopted by the state and to adopt local flood damage prevention ordinances. The state has a standard minimum building and related codes for plumbing, mechanical, gas, and electrical installations that local governments are required to enforce. Land Acquisition: Land acquisition can be a useful tool for pursuing mitigation goals. The acquisition of land represents a permanent means to reduce the impacts of geographically defined hazards. Governments may find the most effective method for completely \"hazard-proofing\" a particular piece of property or area is to gain the property (either in fee or an easement), thus removing the property from the private market. Examples include coastal property and wetlands.

Following an analysis of this information it was determined that the state has a moderate level of political will to enact meaningful and proactive mitigation policies. SCEMD and members of the ICC are knowledgeable about the potential hazards the state faces, and have become more familiar with the practices and principles of mitigation, particularly considering recent disasters. The current political climate at the state-level is favorable for supporting and advancing both existing and future hazard mitigation measures. Due to recent disasters there is a greater awareness of hazards, causing government officials to seek ways to reduce the impact of future events. Completed hazard mitigation projects show an understanding of hazard mitigation, including the political will necessary to carry them out.

On July 31, 2012, the ICC/SCEMD conducted a Mitigation Action Workshop for state agencies and non-profit organizations to discuss the updating of Action Items for the SHMP. Following the Workshop, all attendees were asked to report back to their respective agencies and identify additional actions that would be considered by SCEMD and the members of the ICC team. As part of the plan update process conducted in 2011, the Interagency Coordination Council (ICC) reviewed the Mitigation Goals and each action identified in the Mitigation Action Plan. The committee conducted the review to ensure that, despite some slight modification to some of the wording, the goals remain valid and that the Mitigation Action Plan still reflects activities that will be implemented to achieve these goals. The ICC reviewed the risk assessment findings and updated and/or developed new mitigation goals and objectives for the plan. The risk assessment identified the following obstacles/gaps: 1. The state would benefit from incorporating more GIS and other technical information into the hazard mitigation planning process. 2. Many state residents did not realize hazard mitigation planning activities were occurring in the area. 3.

Annually, the ICC will discuss the mitigation goals to determine if the goals are still relevant, if progress has been achieved, and if the mitigation actions need to be changed to reflect this advancement. Progress is defined as development of our mitigation strategy and initiatives to reach the outlined goals. For instance, if SCEMD institutes an enhanced training and outreach program for community resiliency in the state, the ICC would note this achievement in the discussion as meeting Goal #3. In addition, as part of this process, the ICC may determine that a goal has been met and a new goal should be created in its place. All changes, improvements, and progress will be noted in the update of the next State Hazard Mitigation Plan. As part of reaching state mitigation goals, mitigation actions must be developed and completed. Funding will always be an important issue when considering mitigation actions. State and federal mitigation funds are limited. Generally these funds are only available as the result of declared disasters. As such, a process has been developed to evaluate and prioritize proposed mitigation actions. The ICC, with SCEMD as the lead agency, has the primary responsibility for reviewing and evaluating mitigation projects submitted by local jurisdictions. Local jurisdictions are strongly encouraged to incorporate mitigation initiatives, based on established natural hazard risk assessments, into all proposed development projects and as improvements to existing projects. To varying degrees this has been established as a part of project development and approval. The following issues will be reviewed and discussed as part of the process used to evaluate and prioritize mitigation projects: 1. The jurisdiction that submitted the mitigation proposal must have an approval local hazard mitigation plan on file. Jurisdictions with a population of less than 3,000 that do not have an approved hazard mitigation plan on file must have the capability and desire to complete a plan within twelve months of project approval. 2. The project must be in conformance with the jurisdiction's approved hazard mitigation plan. Since situations and priorities change over time, projects that are not in the jurisdictions mitigation plan may still be approved, if they meet all other mitigation project eligibility requirements. 3. The project must solve a problem independently or constitute a functional portion of a solution where there is assurance that the project as a whole will be completed. 4. The project must be cost-effective, environmentally sound, technically sound, and substantially reduce the risk of future damage, repetitive loss by flood, or suffering resulting from a major disaster. 5. The hazard being mitigated will be checked against the current risk assessment as outlined in the jurisdictions approved local hazard mitigation plan. 6. Funding will be open to all eligible entities within South Carolina; however, priority may be given to those projects located within the declared disaster area. 7. A review of mitigation efforts undertaken by the jurisdiction using local funds and initiatives. 8. A review of the disaster history of the jurisdiction including flood prone repetitive loss properties. 9. Availability of matching funds from the state and/or local jurisdiction. 10. Communities that are challenged by intense development pressures. This plan does not differentiate or classify mitigation initiatives as primary or alternates. Mitigation initiatives will be evaluated and prioritized based on the criteria described above. Any mitigation project that is approved for funding is done so on the basis that it will benefit the community at large and therefore the State. State of South Carolina project priorities consider hazards, risk, vulnerability and capabilities. In general prioritization considerations are given to communities that have the highest risk. Flood buyout projects (especially for repetitive loss properties), other flood mitigation and structural projects to permanently protect essential infrastructure are the State's highest priority. Projects to protect individuals from frequent hazards events such as tornadoes and high wind will rank second. This is followed by projects to reduce losses from low probability events, such as earthquakes."}, {"section_title": "H. POST-DISASTER IMPLEMENTATION", "text": "Following a presidential disaster declaration, the State will be responsible for determining how to allocate the HMGP funding to state and local mitigation actions and projects. Approximately one month after a presidential disaster declaration, the ICC will convene to review the State Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Plan may need to be updated to reflect the disaster event and any resulting changes to the previously identified mitigation goals and priorities. SCEMD will oversee the execution of recommended revisions to the SHMP and provide an updated plan to FEMA and the ICC members as soon as possible. In addition to the plan review, the ICC will define how HMGP dollars for the event will be prioritized and allocated. Depending on the disaster type, geographic location, and scope of the disaster, a decision will be made if certain regions or types of mitigation activities will be prioritized over others. For example, if a hurricane devastates the entire coast, South Carolina may choose to open funding to the entire state. If the event is a tornado that affects only a few municipalities, a decision may be made to prioritize projects in the affected areas or specifically tornado mitigation projects. One year after the Declaration, FEMA will provide the State with a funding ceiling or \"lock-in\" value for HMGP funds. FEMA will provide HMGP estimates prior to 12 months; however these estimates will not represent a minimum or floor amount. At that time, the ICC will collaborate again to finalize the prioritization of post-disaster HMGP funds. Once all applications have been received, the ICC will serve as the Review Panel. Each application will be reviewed for eligibility in accordance with the criteria as defined by 44 CFR Section. 206.434, as well as the guidance outlined in the previous subsection. It is the function of the ICC to review, prioritize, and recommend projects to be submitted to FEMA for funding. The SHMO serves as the coordinator of the committee. All projects must be submitted and approved by FEMA within two years of the Declaration.

COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION MEASURES", "text": "A key criterion for mitigation projects to be eligible for funding is that they must be cost-effective. If the project benefits are higher than the project costs, then the project is cost-effective. The purpose of this section is to address the process used by the State to determine the costeffectiveness of mitigation measures and how those mitigation measures are ranked according to the eligibility criteria. In order to ensure a consistent approach in determining the cost-effectiveness of all mitigation projects, the State will use the FEMA Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) module and process. Since this is also the method used by FEMA to determine the cost-effectiveness of a project, it is only reasonable that the State use the same method. The benefit cost analysis (BCA) is an assessment of the mitigation project application data to determine whether the cost of investing federal/state/local funds in a hazard mitigation project is justified by the prevented or reduced damages from future disasters. With limited project data and streamlined benefit-cost methods, a cost-effectiveness determination can usually be made quickly and accurately. It is understood that a positive benefit cost ratio (greater than one) does not necessarily guarantee that a hazard mitigation project will be approved. However, by applying project specific information to the benefit cost analysis module we can get a good initial look at the mitigation potentials associated with that project. The results of this analysis can also help communities evaluate current and future mitigation projects and adjust their overall mitigation strategy accordingly. The following information serves to summarize the three-step process of determining a mitigation project's cost-effectiveness. This process is used for determining the cost-effectiveness of all mitigation project applications regardless of the type of mitigation measure."}, {"section_title": "Screen Project Application Data", "text": "The first part of the process is screening the project application to gather data relating to costeffectiveness. This includes economic, environmental, and engineering data. Often, this data is missing or limited. The amount of data available will determine the type of benefit cost analysis to be used. The screening process involves three separate but related tasks. Each task is conducted simultaneously and is essential to developing an overall profile of the project before conducting the benefit cost analysis. 1. Engineering Review -This review establishes whether the project is feasible from an engineering standpoint and whether it will reduce damages as claimed. The reviewer may suggest changes to make the project more efficient in reducing damage and loss. 2. Environmental Assessment -This part of the screening process alerts reviewers to any potential environmental concerns raised by the project. 3. Project Application Data -This part of the screening process determines whether the application contains sufficient information and data for input into the benefit-cost model. Ideally, the project application would contain all the data needed. However, project applications often have incomplete or limited data. This is one of the main reasons that a streamlined process was developed to determine project cost-effectiveness without all the data. It is also the reason that federal, state, and local mitigation specialists must work closely together to ensure that all proposed mitigation projects are thoroughly reviewed and comply with the mitigation goals and objectives. Rather than require additional information -which may or may not be available and which can cost valuable time and money -FEMA devised shortcuts. With these shortcuts, additional data does not necessarily need to be collected in order to do a benefit cost analysis. Screening the project data will assist in determining which type of analysis to perform. There is basic data that must be obtained from hazard mitigation applications before a benefit cost analysis can be performed. This data is plugged-in to the benefit cost module to assess whether the project is cost-effective or not."}, {"section_title": "Benefit Cost Analysis", "text": "The second part of the process is to determine which benefit cost analysis tool to use. If the project application data are limited or incomplete, then a benefit cost analysis that uses limited data should be employed. If, however, the data in the project application are more or less complete, then a more robust method of analysis can be used. Benefit cost analysis is used for all cost-effectiveness determinations. Although the following sample analysis is an oversimplification, the concepts it illustrates are important. At its most basic level, benefit cost analysis determines whether the cost of investing in a mitigation project today (the \"cost\") will result in sufficiently reduced damages in the future (the \"benefits\") to justify spending money on the project. If the benefit is greater than the cost, then the project is costeffective; if the benefit is less than the cost, then the project is not cost-effective. This analysis provides an example of the kind of comparative benefit and cost data you might see after conducting a benefit cost analysis. It is important to understand that benefit cost analysis is basically the same for each type of hazard mitigation project. The only differences are the types of data that are used in the calculations, depending on whether the project is for floods, hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes etc. 1. Cost-effectiveness is determined by comparing the project cost to the value of damages prevented after the mitigation measure. Given an example where the project cost is $1,000 and the value of damages prevented after the mitigation measure is $2,000. 2. Because the dollar-value of benefits exceeds the cost of funding the project, the project is cost-effective. This relationship is depicted numerically by dividing the benefits by the costs, resulting in a benefit cost ratio (BCR). The BCR is simply a way of stating whether benefits exceed projects costs, and by how much. 3. To derive the BCR, divide the benefits by the cost ($2,000/ $1,000). If the result is 1.0 or greater, then the project is cost-effective. In this instance, the BCR is 2.0, which exceeds the 1.0 level. 4. On the other hand, if the cost of the project is $2,000 and the benefits are only $1,000, the project would have a BCR of 0.50 ($1,000/ $2,000) and would not be cost-effective. While the example mentioned above may be a simple one, the process and the benefit cost analysis calculations associated with it are basically the same for all mitigation projects. For all FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance grants, FEMA's BCA software version 4. must be utilized. This BCA program includes modules for Flood, Hurricane Wind, Tornado Safe Rooms, Earthquake, Wildfire, and Damage-Frequency Assessment. More information and access to the FEMA BCA toolkit can be found at http://www.fema.gov/benefit-cost-analysis. For all other mitigation projects not funded by FEMA, three approaches may be used to determine a project's benefit cost ratio: lower-bound analysis, upper-bound analysis, and best estimate. The lower-bound and upper-bound methods are used in many cases to make final determinations of costeffectiveness even when there is limited data. In these cases, no further benefit cost analysis is needed. In other cases, quick screening analysis with these approaches yields inconclusive results and additional data and screening may be required."}, {"section_title": "Lower-Bound Analysis", "text": "Lower-bound analysis is a powerful tool that can often demonstrate that projects are cost-effective, in many cases regardless of whether the available data is complete or not. This is an important point, because a project's cost-effectiveness can sometimes be determined by using only one or two key pieces of data. The lower-bound analysis was developed with this in mind. The lower-bound analysis considers only some of a project's benefits (those that are the most important or those for which data exist) and ignores other benefits that may be difficult to estimate or for which data may not be available. In other words, this analysis purposely uses only a few pieces of information to determine the project's cost-effectiveness and undercounts, or ignores other benefits that will be gained by funding the project. If this data indicates that a project is costeffective, then no further analysis is needed. No additional data has to be collected. Lower-Bound Analysis at a Glance 1. It should be used when data is incomplete. 2. It can determine that a project is cost-effective. 3. It cannot determine that a project is not cost-effective. 4. It uses data for one or two significant benefits."}, {"section_title": "Upper-Bound Analysis", "text": "If a lower-bound analysis shows that a project is not cost-effective, then the next step is an upperbound analysis. Sometimes an upper-bound analysis is used if, at first glance, the project appears not to be cost-effective. Like lower-bound analysis, upper-bound analysis relies on limited project data. Upper-bound analysis, however, also uses professional judgment to estimate about input data that give the highest reasonable benefits that can be expected from a mitigation project. It is extremely important to note that upper-bound analysis cannot determine that a project is costeffective. Upper-bound analysis can only determine that a project is not cost-effective. Because it relies on the highest, reasonable estimate of benefits (prevention of damage by the project), an upper-bound analysis can only determine that the project BCR is not cost-effective (less than 1.0). The project can only be rejected as not cost-effective with this analysis. In other words, because the highest reasonable estimate of damages is used in the calculation, if the BCR is still less than 1.0, one can only conclude that the project is not cost-effective. Upper-Bound Analysis at a Glance 1. It can only determine that a project is not cost-effective. 2. It is used as the next step if the lower-bound analysis is negative (not cost-effective). 3. It is used if a project appears, at first glance, unlikely to be cost-effective. 4. It uses the highest reasonable estimate of benefits for a project. 5. It analyzes as many data as are possible, assigning the highest reasonable value to each."}, {"section_title": "Best Estimate Analysis", "text": "A best estimate analysis is used when the project application data is complete, or almost complete. This analysis provides a more accurate BCR than either lower-or upper-bound analysis because more data are considered in the analysis. As discussed earlier, however, in many cases lowerbound or upper-bound analysis can provide firm decisions about cost-effectiveness, without requiring as much data as a best estimate analysis. If a best estimate analysis is conducted, then a project is either cost-effective or not cost-effective, because all significant data are considered. Because this method of benefit cost analysis provides the best estimate of cost-effectiveness, it can be used to rank (set priorities among) competing projects. Neither lower-bound nor upper-bound analysis are used to rank or set priorities among projects. They do not consider enough data to determine accurately specific BCRs; they product only \"bounds\" on BCRs (i.e. BCR > 1.0 or BCR < 1.0). Best Estimate Analysis at a Glance 1. It should be used when the project application data is complete, or almost complete. 2. It produces a more accurate analysis than Lower-Bound and Upper-Bound analyses. 3. It determines whether a project is cost-effective or not cost-effective. 4. BCR can be used for ranking or setting priorities among projects."}, {"section_title": "Results of Benefit Cost Analysis", "text": "The final aim of the review process is to determine whether a project is cost-effective, or whether further analysis is required. If the project is cost-effective, the application moves to the next level in the funding process. If it is not cost-effective, the project is rejected. In some cases, additional information may be requested, or the applicant may be shown how the mitigation effort can be redirected. By conducting a benefit cost analysis, you determine one of three things: either the project is costeffective (BCA > 1.0), the project is not cost-effective (BCA < 1.0), or additional data is required. If the project is cost-effective, then no further analysis or additional data collection is required. If a project is determined to be cost-effective, either by a lower bound or best estimate analysis, then the project moves to the next step in the application process. If the project is not cost-effective, then no further analysis or additional data collection is required. If the project is determined not to be cost-effective, either by an upper bound or a best estimate, then the project is not eligible for funding. Some projects require additional information to determine cost-effectiveness because the applications are very incomplete. All reports generated at the closeout site visit are compared with Request for Funds submitted throughout the duration of the program. Any significant findings are reported to the SHMO for final determination and corrective action.

This system, called the Mitigation Action Tracking Database, includes the following: Each time the plan is updated, the State Hazard Mitigation Officer will update the database. The State Hazard Mitigation Officer will also manage and maintain the monitoring system on a continual basis, including updating the timeframe for carrying out future events and closing out completed or deferred actions that are no longer viable activities.

Actions that were completed are in green, actions that were deleted are in red, actions that are new (post 2010) are in yellow, and actions that remain valid are in white. This plan is not a static document. Rather, it is designed to adapt to changes in hazard vulnerability, the capability of state agencies and participating stakeholders, and agreed upon modifications to goals and mitigation actions over time. As a result, the plan maintenance procedures described below are intended to reflect a certain level of flexibility, which enables members of the ICC to adapt, as needed, to changing conditions.

MONITORING, EVALUATING AND UPDATING THE PLAN", "text": "Monitoring of the plan is required to ensure that the goals of the State of South Carolina are kept current, to include monitoring which state mitigation efforts are being carried out and ensuring that the plan complies with state and federal requirements. The SCEMD Mitigation Staff is responsible for monitoring the plan. Generally speaking, the following principles guide the implementation of this plan: 1. The delineation of a uniform approach to hazard identification, vulnerability analysis, risk assessment, and mitigation planning. 2. The ICC will serve as the lead group guiding the state mitigation planning process, including the implementation of state-level programs. 3. The support of mitigation planning is linked to the risk posed to the state's communities, businesses, institutions and environmental resources. 4. The provision of coordinated, uniform, and consistent policies and practices tied to the technical, administrative and regulatory requirements associated with mitigation and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. 5. The sharing of staff expertise, data and other resources, as practical, through interorganizational consultation and cooperation. 6. The optimization of state agency programs that offer opportunities to enhance the disaster resistance of communities, businesses and institutions. 7. The vigorous pursuit of opportunities to gain financial, technical and other support for mitigation and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction activities. As required under the Stafford Act, update reviews will occur at least every three (3) years. For future updates to the 2013 South Carolina State Hazard Mitigation Plan, the SCEMD Mitigation Staff with the coordination of the ICC will continue to review the plan on a quarterly basis and make modifications when deemed necessary. An annual review by the ICC will be conducted to ensure that the plan is being properly implemented and is achieving the objectives set forth in the plan. The ICC will also evaluate the nature and magnitude of hazard events and/or community development that has changed since the plan's implementation. In addition, the ICC will also ask state stakeholders for regular updates on the status of mitigation projects and programs found in the Mitigation Action Plan."}, {"section_title": "B. PROGRESS ASSESSMENT/REVIEW FOR MITIGATION GOALS OBJECTIVES AND MEASURES", "text": "In order for any program to remain effective, the goals and objectives of that program must be reviewed periodically. That review should address, as a minimum, the following issues: 1. Are the established goals and objectives realistic considering available funding, staffing, state/local capabilities, and the overall State Mitigation Strategy? 2. Has the State clearly explained the overall mitigation strategy to local governments? 3. Are proposed mitigation projects evaluated based on how they help the State and/or local government meet their overall mitigation goals and objectives? 4. How have approved mitigation projects complemented existing State and/or local government mitigation goals and objectives? 5. Have completed mitigation projects generated the anticipated cost avoidance or other disaster reduction result? In addition to evaluating the mitigation goals, a thorough and realistic evaluation of the benefits of a mitigation project must occur. This process may be delayed until the area of the project is impacted by a disaster, as it is difficult to fully understand the benefits of a mitigation action until it is tested in a real-world event. The lack of realized benefits from a completed mitigation project may result in the disapproval or modification of similar projects in the future. At the same time, mitigation projects that have proven their worth may be repeated and prioritized in other areas of the State. Based on the results of the assessment mentioned above, the State may need to adjust its goals, objectives, and measures to meet the current and future mitigation needs of the State and local governments. The ICC will be responsible for making any amendments to the State Mitigation Goals. Documentation of these changes will be tracked in ICC meeting minutes and updated in the subsequent plan update. As requested, a formal mitigation status report will be prepared by SCEMD/ICC on an annual basis. With the 2013 update, all mitigation actions were placed in the South Carolina Mitigation Actions Tracking Database. This database places all actions in a format that is easily sorted. Actions can be quickly found based on hazard type, project, goal, etc. At a minimum, the report will address the following items: Before any mitigation project is approved by SCEMD/ICC, it must comply with the following items as a minimum: 1. Complement the overall mitigation strategy of the State and applicable local government; 2. Suitable funding, to include the local match (if needed), must be available; 3. The project must be cost-effective. The updated FEMA benefit cost module is generally used to make this determination; 4. The project must be in compliance with all other federal, State, and local regulations and policies; and 5. The project must provide a benefit to the community at large. It may be difficult to determine the actual cost avoidance and effectiveness of many mitigation projects during the development of the projects. Initially, the potential impact of these mitigation projects and initiatives can only be estimated. However, based on past experience with similar projects, SCEMD/ICC can make an educated determination as to the potential for success of the proposed mitigation project. Following natural and/or man made hazardous events; SCEMD Mitigation Staff will query local officials to document how mitigation measures instituted in the affected areas lessened the amount of damages or loss of life that may have resulted from those events. Over the next three years, SCEMD will continue to develop standard operating procedures to enhance the opportunities to analyze successes."}, {"section_title": "C.

Evaluation of future disasters and their impact on a community is another means of evaluating the success of a mitigation project. In 2007, SCEMD was in the process of implementing GIS and GPS technology to further document the mitigation project progress to further refine the monitoring of the projects of the program to improve the accuracy of future assessments. This technology was implemented for the 2010 and 2013 update and is illustrated by the following graphics in Figure 9.1 and 9.2. "}, {"section_title": "D.

Each year, the SCEMD Mitigation Staff will work with the ICC to assign responsibility for conducting this annual review to specific departments or individuals. Department officials or individuals assigned these duties will ensure the following: 1. Interagency Coordination Council members and other participating agencies will conduct an annual review and/or presentation on the implementation status of the plan. Over the past three years for the 2013 update, this annual review took place by means of the annual Mitigation Planning Committee (MPC) meeting. This review will include, at a minimum, a completed, printed version of the Mitigation Action Plan (MAP). Also during this review, participating agencies will be tasked with the update of agency specific mitigation actions. 2. The review will include an evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the mitigation actions proposed in the plan. There are several means to assess effectiveness. 3. Specific techniques include the use of the MAP to monitor the number and percentage of completed mitigation actions per established timelines and cost-effectiveness determinations of mitigation projects. In future plan updates, the ICC will consider the documentation of losses avoided for completed hazard mitigation projects. 4. The State Hazard Mitigation Plan is linked to existing planning practices and day-to-day activities of State agency officials whenever possible. Specific examples of on-going hazard mitigation programs and practices are described in the capability assessment. 5. The annual report will recommend, as appropriate, any required changes or amendments to the plan. If the ICC determines that the recommendations warrant modification to the plan, the SHMO will initiate a plan amendment as described next."}, {"section_title": "E. EVALUATION AND ENHANCEMENT", "text": "Periodic revisions and updates of the plan are required to ensure that the goals and objectives for the State of South Carolina are kept current. This is particularly important as hazard vulnerability changes, mitigation actions are completed or goals and mitigation actions are modified or added. In addition, revisions may be necessary to ensure that the plan is in full compliance with changing Federal and State regulations. This portion of the plan outlines the procedures for completing such revisions and updates. Following a disaster declaration, the plan may be revised to reflect lessons learned or to address specific circumstances arising from the disaster, including the documentation of losses avoided as a result of completed mitigation projects. The ICC will convene post-disaster to evaluate the current status of the plan and determine if modifications are necessary. Every three to five years (depending on federal requirements) for the State Plan update, the plan will be reviewed and enhanced to incorporate completed local hazard mitigation plans with emphasis placed on the integration of the local risk assessment findings and mitigation strategies. If the ICC determines that the recommendations found in the post-disaster review warrant modification to the plan, the ICC may initiate a plan amendment as described below. The ICC may direct the SHMO to undertake a complete update of the plan if necessary. Plan enhancements will be coordinated with FEMA staff, as appropriate. Plan evaluation and enhancement procedures follow a schedule similar to that noted in Section 2, Planning Process: 1. The state will convene the ICC to review the findings of the local risk assessments and mitigation strategies; 2. The state will convene the ICC to evaluate the State Hazard Mitigation Plan post disaster, every three to five years as required by the Disaster Mitigation Act, and as deemed appropriate by the SCEMD Mitigation Staff; 3. The ICC will assess how local risk and mitigation actions compliment or conflict with the goals and actions of the State Hazard Mitigation Plan; 4. The State Hazard Mitigation Plan will be amended to integrate the findings of the risk assessments and support the recommended actions of local plans once they are completed and as they are updated over time, and as deemed appropriate by the ICC; 5. The ICC will convene following disasters, following local plan update schedules, or as appropriate, to re-evaluate new information made available by local governments regarding changes in risk or the adoption of new mitigation actions. These changes will be reviewed, and potential changes to the State Hazard Mitigation Plan will be considered. The timeframe for the entire review and evaluation of the State Hazard Mitigation Plan will take place every three to five years. This timeframe for completion may vary based on recent disaster declarations or other factors beyond control of the SCEMD. The process is further described below:"}]
