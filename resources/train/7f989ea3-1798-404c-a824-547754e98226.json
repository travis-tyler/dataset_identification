[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Fossil foraminifera are widespread indicators of past tidal environments on low to high latitude coasts. Statistically significant populations in small sediment samples (e.g., from 1 cm thick samples of 1 to 5-cmdiameter cores; Birks, 1995) and high preservation potential enable estuarine and marsh foraminifera to be used for environmental reconstructions that span thousands of years (e.g., . Estuarine and salt-marsh foraminifera generally consist of agglutinated species that are restricted to vegetated marshes and calcareous species of mudflats and sandflats (e.g., Phleger & Walton, 1950;Scott & Medioli, 1978;. Because the species composition of foraminiferal assemblages is sensitive to the duration and frequency of tidal flooding (Scott & Medioli, 1978;, differences in modern intertidal assemblages can be used to develop transfer functions to reconstruct former sea levels based on fossil assemblages (e.g., Guilbault et al., 1995;Horton et al., 1999;Gehrels, 2000;Leorri et al., 2010;Kemp et al., 2013a). For example, along the Oregon coast of the Cascadia subduction zone, former soils of high salt marshes and forests are abruptly overlain by the muddy sediment of tidal flats and low marshes (Nelson et al., 1996). Distinct changes in foraminiferal assemblages across such abrupt contacts record the subsidence of coastal wetlands (causing a sudden relative sea-level rise) during great [moment magnitude (Mw) 8-9] earthquakes on the subduction-zone megathrust fault. Transfer function analysis of fossil faunas provides a means of mapping the amount of subsidence during past earthquakes and estimating earthquake magnitudes (e.g., Guilbault et al., 1995;Nelson et al., 2008;Engelhart et al., 2013a;Wang et al., 2013). Reconstruction of these relative sea-level changes is based on the assumption that fossil (subsurface) and modern (surface) faunal assemblages have responded in the same way to environmental (elevational) gradients across tidal wetlands. That is, modern assemblages are accurate environmental analogs for fossil assemblages. However, a number of studies have shown that live populations in intertidal and subtidal settings are temporally and spatially variable (e.g., Buzas, 1968;Jones & Ross, 1979;Scott & Medioli, 1980;Horton, 1999;Murray & Alve, 2000;Swallow, 2000;Buzas et al., 2002;Cearreta et al., 2002;Debenay et al., 2006;Horton & Murray, 2006Berkeley et al., 2008). This variability suggests that foraminiferal populations are influenced by factors other than tidal inundation and, hence, these factors may influence the accuracy of sea-level reconstructions. Scott & Medioli (1980) concluded that total assemblages (live plus dead tests) are better modern analogs of fossil assemblages-and so are most suitable for paleoenvironmental reconstructions-than live populations alone, which reflect environmental conditions during a single sampling period. In contrast, Murray (1982) and Horton (1999), observed that total foraminiferal assemblages are influenced by both production rate and taphonomic processes and concluded that dead assemblages are more suitable for reconstructions. Taphonomic alteration of foraminiferal tests may also influence the accuracy of sealevel reconstructions. For instance, early diagenetic processes may dissolve calcareous tests in acidic, organic-rich tidal or subtidal environments (Schnitker et al., 1980;Goldstein & Watkins, 1999;Murray & Alve, 1999;Sanders, 2003;Berkeley et al., 2007). Recently, the stable carbon isotopic composition (d 13 C%) and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of bulk sediment in intertidal environments have been tested to discern whether these geochemical indicators could be used in a similar way as foraminiferal assemblages to reconstruct relative sea-level changes (Kemp et al., 2012;Engelhart et al., 2013b;Khan et al., 2015). These and other studies (e.g., Chmura & Aharon, 1995;Lamb et al., 2007;Kemp et al., 2010) have shown that the d 13 C values from marsh sediment correspond well with marsh elevation and hence the degree of tidal inundation (Wilson et al., 2005a, b), a variable that strongly influences the distribution of plants and the botanical composition of intertidal sediment. In estuarine wetlands, a gradual change from a dominance of C 3 to C 4 plants has been observed along salinity gradients (Chmura & Aharon, 1995). However, d 13 C values of sediment may also reflect allochthonous particulate and/or dissolved carbon sources that may not be related to salinity (e.g., Go\u00f1 i & Thomas, 2000;Lamb et al., 2006) and can be influenced by microbial processes that result in depleted d 13 C values of sediment relative to that of plant tissues (e.g., Benner et al., 1987;Ember et al., 1987;Chmura et al., 1987;Lamb et al., 2006). A further limitation when using d 13 C values for relative sea-level reconstruction is the limited elevational range of C 4 plants in certain regions (e.g., Kemp et al., 2010Kemp et al., , 2012. Before the routine use of stable carbon isotopic methods, C/N ratios were commonly used to characterize the source and degree of biological and diagenetic alteration of organic matter (Tyson, 1995). Carbon/Nitrogen ratios distinguish between aquatic and terrestrial organic matter sources because aquatic organic matter has a significantly higher bulk N content than that of terrestrial organic matter (Tyson, 1995). However, recent studies indicate that C/N ratios from intertidal environments are less suitable for relative sea-level reconstructions, because sediment C/N values are significantly altered from source plant material during early diagenesis (e.g., Go\u00f1 i & Thomas, 2000;Kemp et al., 2010). Further, it is unknown to what degree seasonal variations in the growth and decay of different plant species influence stable carbon isotopic composition and C/N ratios of bulk sediments in these environments (Cloern et al., 2002). We investigated the inter-annual and seasonal (dry to wet season) variations in foraminiferal assemblages and interannual variations in stable carbon isotopic composition, total organic carbon (TOC) values and C/N ratios of bulk sediment in an intertidal environment near Bandon, Oregon (Fig. 1) to answer the following questions: (1) Do forami-nifera in the Bandon Marsh, which provides a potential coastal archive for relative sea-level reconstructions, show an inter-annual and/or seasonal variability, and do they cluster in vertical assemblage zones? (2) Do taphonomic processes influence the distribution of modern foraminiferal species in the Bandon Marsh? (3) How do the stable carbon isotopic composition and C/N ratios of bulk sediment in the Bandon Marsh vary with elevation and do these values show interannual variability? A better knowledge of the inter-annual and seasonal variations for both foraminiferal and geochemical data and their relation to elevation will help improve the accuracy of reconstructions of relative sea-level changes used to infer elevation changes during past great earthquakes at the Cascadia subduction zone and along other tectonically active coasts (e.g., Sawai et al., 2004;Cisternas et al., 2005;Dura et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "STUDY AREA", "text": "The Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is situated on the Pacific coast in southern Oregon (Fig. 1A) near the mouth of the Coquille River estuary (Fig. 1B). The wildlife refuge encompasses 3.6 km 2 and is composed of two units: Bandon Marsh and Ni-les'tun Marsh. Bandon Marsh, our study area, is a relatively undisturbed sandy salt marsh that has rapidly aggraded towards the river during the past century ( Fig. 1C; Frenkel et al., 1981). Tides in the lower Coquille River estuary are semidiurnal and mesotidal with a great diurnal range of 2.16 m (Mean High High Water, MHHW (2.132 m NAVD) to Mean Low Low Water, MLLW (0.030 m NAVD) (NOAA tide gauge station Bandon, ID 9432373; http://tidesandcurrents.noaa. gov/datumoptions.html). Mean sediment accumulation rate in Bandon Marsh, based on four surface elevation table estimates (interval August 2009-December 2012), is 8.7 mm/yr with a standard error of 62.5 mm. The climate in the Bandon Marsh area is temperate with warm and dry summers and wet and cool falls and winters (Peel et al., 2007). The mean daily air temperatures, measured at the national weather station in Bandon (ID: GHCND:USC00350471) (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdoweb/datasets/GHCND/stations) for 2011 ranged between 11.9 and 20.3uC in August 2011 (average 16.4uC) and between 4.2 and 16.4uC in October 2011 (average 12.0uC; Fig. 2). Mean daily air temperatures for 2012 ranged between 12.8 and 16.9uC in July 2012 (average 14.5uC) and between 5.8 and 15.6uC in October 2012 (average 10.9uC). Total monthly precipitation was low in 2011, with 1 mm in August 2011 and 92 mm in October 2011, but higher in 2012 with 20 mm in July 2012 and 199 mm in October 2012 (Fig. 2). Bandon Marsh consists of a sparsely vegetated tidal flat (St., Station, 1 and 2) with around 15% Zostera nana and Z. marina vegetation (Nelson & Kashima, 1993;Brophy & van de Wetering, 2012). Tidal-flat sediment is sandy (67-90%), with low percentages of silt and clay (Fig. 3). The low marsh (St. 3 and 4) is characterized by the vascular plants Distichlis spicata, Scirpus sp., Carex sp., and Juncus balticus. Farther south in the Bandon Marsh, Nelson & Kashima (1993) found Scirpus americanus, Scirpus cernuus, and Carex lynbyei as the dominant low marsh plants in the same area. Station 3 is similar to the tidal flat stations, with a high sand content (67-90%), whereas St. 4 sediment contains more silt (40-70%) and clay (, 8%; Fig. 3). The high marsh (St. 5-9) is dominated by Potentilla sp., Carex sp., Lotus spp., and Juncus balticus, with Fescue sp., Agrostis sp., Scirpus sp., and Distichlis spicata. Nelson & Kashima (1993) and Brophy & van der Wetering (2011) also noted Deschampsia caespitosa, Potentilla pacifica, Triglochin maritima, Agrostis alba, and A. stolonifera in the high marsh south of our study area. Sediment in the high marsh is silty (54-81%) with lower percentages of clay (10-34%) and sand (0.5-34%; Fig. 3). The transition zone between the highest marsh and upland in Bandon Marsh (St. 10) has high percentages of Phalaris sp. and low percentages of Carex sp. and Equisetum sp. Sediment at St. 10 is similar in grain-size distribution to the high marsh stations (74% silt, 19% clay, and 7% sand; Fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SAMPLING STRATEGY", "text": "Ten sampling stations were installed on Bandon Marsh (Fig. 1C, Appendix 1) at NWR sampling stations. Surface samples were taken in the dry summer season (16 August 2011 and 24 July 2012) and in the wet fall season (14 October 2011 and 12 October 2012) for foraminiferal analyses. For geochemical analyses, we only analyzed samples from three of the sampling periods (summer and fall 2011, and summer 2012) due to limitation on the number of samples that could be processed. Elevations were determined with a RTK-GPS and total station equipment with vertical precision of , 5 cm. Elevations are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD88). It should be noted that there is an elevational hiatus between the lower and higher elevation stations (St. 4 and 5) of 60 cm, which is ,25% of the tidal range. Each station consists of a 1 m 2 quadrat oriented N-S. Quadrats were placed at sites with uniform elevation and vegetation cover to avoid bias in samples taken from different corners of the quadrat. Two samples were collected at each station from the corners (A to D) of the quadrat in alternating sequential order: one sample of approximately 10 cm 3 volume (10 cm 2 surface sample by 1 cm thick) for foraminiferal analysis; and a second sample of approximately 20 cm 3 volume (20 cm 2 surface sample by 1 cm thick) for geochemical and grain size analyses. The sample thickness and volume for foraminiferal analysis allows comparisons with similar studies (e.g., Scott & Medioli, 1978;Jennings & Nelson, 1992;Horton et al., 1999;Kemp et al., 2009). The geochemical samples were immediately refrigerated (,4uC) in darkness to limit microbial activity and prevent photo-oxidation of the organic components (Khan et al.,5). All inter-annual and seasonal foraminiferal and geochemical data, and grain-size data, can be found in the supplementary material (Appendices 2 and 3)."}, {"section_title": "FORAMINIFERAL ANALYSIS", "text": "The samples for foraminiferal analysis were stained with rose Bengal for identification of specimens living at time of collection (Walton, 1952;Murray & Bowser, 2000), stored in a buffered ethanol solution to avoid dissolution of calcareous tests, and refrigerated at 5uC. Wet sample volumes were measured and samples were sieved through 500 mm and 63 mm sieves and decanted. The greater than 500 mm decanted fraction was examined for larger foraminifera before being discarded. A wet-splitter (Scott & Hermelin, 1993) was used to split the fraction between 63 and 500 mm of each sample into eight equal aliquots as described in . Samples were allowed to settle for 90 minutes. Foraminiferal tests were counted wet to facilitate the detection of stained foraminifera and to prevent drying of the organic residue, which may result in consolidation or ''pancaking'' (de Rijk, 1995). Only tests with the last few chambers stained red were considered living at the time of collection. Foraminifera were counted under a binocular microscope. The foraminiferal species were identified following the taxonomic descriptions in , , and . Juvenile specimens of Trochammina inflata, Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens that were difficult to distinguish from each other were summarized as juvenile trochamminids (Appendix 4). Specimens of the genus Ammobaculites were combined into a single group because these species were often broken, making it difficult to identify them to the species level (Kemp et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "For analysis of stable carbon isotopes, TOC and C/N ratios of the surface sediments, approximately 1 cm 3 of each wet sediment sample was treated with 5% HCl for 18 hours to remove inorganic carbon, rinsed with at least 1500 ml of deionized water and dried in an oven at 40uC overnight.

Data were taken from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (http:// www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations). calibrated through an acetanilide standard (formula CH 3 CONHC 6 H 5 ) because it contains both C and N atoms in proportions broadly similar to that found in vegetation, soils and sediments and is available at high purity at low cost. All C/N and TOC values are expressed on a weight ratio basis. The subsamples for 13 C/ 12 C analyses were then combusted in the Costech Elemental Analyzer. The d 13 C values were calculated relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) scale using a within-run laboratory standard (cellulose, Sigma Chemical prod. no.

Particle size interpretations are based on the Wentworth Phi Scale (Wentworth, 1922) and reported as differential volume (the percentage of total volume that each size class occupies)."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "To determine the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the living foraminifera and the importance of life processes and post-depositional changes for dead foraminifera (Murray, 1991), we applied an ANOSIM (ANalysis Of SIMilarities) approach (Clarke, 1993). This non-parametric test detects the difference between two or more groups of samples based on the distance measure between groups and the conversion of these distances into ranks (Clarke, 1993). The Bray-Curtis similarity (Bray & Curtis, 1957) was used as the distance metric. A two-way ANOSIM (5000 permutations) was selected to determine the inter-annual and seasonal (dry vs. wet season) variations in the live and dead assemblages between the 2011 and 2012 sampling seasons. A one-way ANOSIM (5000 permutations) was chosen to determine the similarity between live and dead assemblages from both sampling seasons and years. To classify the vertical distribution of live and dead foraminiferal assemblages, a prerequisite for reconstructing relative sea-level change (e.g., , a hierarchical clustering method was applied. The unweighted pair group average (UPGMA) algorithm was used to define groups on the basis of the mean distance between objects in each group. The distance metric was selected according to the cophenetic correlation, which is the linear Pearson correlation between the original matrix and the dissimilarity matrix (e.g., Legendre & Birks, 2012). We tested both the Bray-Curtis similarity (Bray & Curtis, 1957) and Chord dissimilarity (Overpeck et al., 1985) distance measures, which are widely applied metrics for quantitative community data (Simpson, 2012). The cophenetic correlations using the Bray-Curtis and Chord dissimilarities are comparable with R 5 0.917 and R 5 0.921 for live populations and R 5 0.943 and R 5 0.942 for the dead assemblages, respectively. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was selected for further analysis because it has been shown to be the more powerful distance metric for ecological data compared to the Chord distance (Faith et al., 1987). A Monte Carlo test (1000 permutations) was performed to calculate the percentages of exact replications of our clusters. For all analyses, we used the percentages of live and dead species of both seasons and years. For the two-way ANOSIM, samples were coded with integer numbers according to their season and year. The ANOSIM and UPGMA were made with the PaST software package, version 2.15 (Hammer et al., 2001). To determine whether the d 13 C values and the C/N and TOC ratios show a relation to elevation, and to what extent the d 13 C values, C/N and TOC ratios are influenced by inter-annual variability, we applied a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to the geochemical data using the IBM SPSS software package (version 20). The GLM is able to combine systematic and random effects of a dependent variable to more than one independent variables (Nelder & Wedderburn, 1972). The gamma distribution (Fu & Moncher, 2004) was assumed in the GLM (link function: identity). Year, numerically coded into two categories for 2011 and 2012, and elevation, numerically coded into four categories (tidal flat, low marsh, high marsh and higher marshupland) were used as independent variables, and an interaction was defined between year and elevation. The maximum likelihood estimate, which is able to find those model parameters that maximize the probability of observed data (Bolker et al., 2009), was used for the model. In addition, we calculated the Pearson correlation between d 13 C, TOC and C/N values and elevation, and between d 13 C values and C/N ratios."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISTRIBUTION OF LIVE FORAMINIFERA", "text": "We found 277 to 777 live individuals [per 10 cm 3 sediment volume, mean 5 491 6 (standard deviation of) 208] in the tidal flat, 213 to 532 individuals (mean 5 396 6 151) in the low marsh, 178 to 544 individuals (mean 5 290 6 170) in the high marsh, and 0 to 93 individuals (mean 5 30 6 43) in the highest marsh to upland transition (Fig. 4). Higher total numbers (all stations) of live foraminifera (8442 individuals) were observed in 2011 than were observed in 2012 (4805 individuals). Ten species were found in the live populations. The populations are dominated by the agglutinated species Miliammina fusca, Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Trochamminita irregularis, Trochammina inflata and Jadam- mina macrescens (Fig. 4), with minor amounts of Reophax moniliformis, Ammobaculites spp., Haplophragmoides wilberti and juvenile trochamminids.

Haynesina sp. is also found within the low marsh with a maximum relative abundance of 48% in fall 2012. In the high marsh (St. 5-9), the abundance of M. fusca decreases (maximum abundance of 50% at St. 9 in fall 2011), to be replaced by J. macrescens, B. pseudomacrescens and T. inflata. Jadammina macrescens has higher relative abundances at St. 8 (74% in summer 2011 and 48% in fall 2011). Balticammina pseudomacrescens dominates at St. 9 in the summer seasons with a relative abundance of 90% (2011) and 60% (2012). Trochammina inflata is more abundant at St. 5-8 and has a maximum percentage of 57% at St. 8 in summer 2012. Trochamminita irregularis is generally the dominant species of the highest marsh to upland transition (St. 10), but its abundance varies between 84% in fall 2012 to 0% in summer 2012.

In addition, the two-way ANOSIM analysis shows no significant seasonal variation between the dry (summer) and wet (fall) seasons (p 5 1.000, R 5 20.087).

The results of the applied Monte Carlo test on the live populations indicate that there are three main clusters (Fig. 6A) with a relative cluster replication of 40% for cluster I, 13% for cluster IIa, and 23% for cluster IIb. Cluster IIb consists of tidal flat and low marsh stations (St. 1-4) with elevations between 1.34 and 1.48 m NAVD88. Miliammina fusca is the dominant species with a relative abundance between 46-100%, with the presence of Haynesina sp. (maximum relative abundance of 48%; Fig. 6A). Cluster IIa includes all high marsh stations (St. 5-9) with elevations between 2.08 and 2.33 m NAVD88. This cluster is characterized by relatively high percentages of J. macrescens (up to 73%) and T. inflata (up to 56%). Cluster I contains stations from the high marsh (St. 7, 9) and highest marsh to upland transition (St. 10) with elevations between 2.29 and 2.42 m NAVD88.

The relative cluster replication is 51% for cluster Ia, 50% for cluster Ib, and 66% for cluster II. The higher percentages of cluster replication suggest that dead assemblage clusters are more stable and reproducible than their living equivalents. Cluster II consists of tidal flat and low marsh samples (St. 1-4) with elevations between 1.34 and 1.48 m NAVD88.

For example TOC values range between 19.3% in fall 2011 and 36.2% in summer 2012 at St. 5. The d 13 C and C/N values (R 5 20.884; p , 0.001) and the d 13 C and TOC (R 5 20.920; p , 0.001) both show significant negative correlations ( Table 1). The tidal flat and low marsh stations (St. 1-4) have the heaviest d 13 C values and low C/N and TOC values. The high marsh and higher marsh to upland stations have lighter d 13 C and higher C/N and TOC values (Fig. 8). To determine inter-annual variability and correlation with elevation, the median d 13 C, C/N and TOC values from We applied a GLM to the d 13 C, C/N and TOC values to determine the individual and combined effect of elevation and inter-annual variability on their distributions. We found a significant correlation with elevation (p , 0.001), but not with sampling year (p 5 0.953 for d 13 C, p 5 0.807 for C/N and p 5 0.930 for TOC, respectively) or between sampling year and elevation (p 5 0.689 for d 13 C, p 5 0.701 for C/N and p 5 0.765 for TOC, respectively; Table 1; Figs. 9B, 9D and 9F). We further measured the Pearson correlation between d 13 C, C/N and TOC values and elevation and found a significant positive correlation of the C/N and TOC values to elevation with p , 0.001 and R 5 0.885 and R 5 0.849, respectively, and a significant negative correlation of the d 13 C values to elevation with p , 0.001 and R 5 20.820 (Table 1; Fig. 10)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INTER-ANNUAL AND SEASONAL FORAMINIFERAL DISTRIBUTION AND THE INFLUENCE OF TAPHONOMIC PROCESSES", "text": "Time series analysis of live foraminiferal populations not only detects inter-annual and/ or seasonal variations, but also elucidates the underlying environmental conditions influencing their distributions (e.g., Cearreta et al., 2002Cearreta et al., , 2007. Our results demonstrate that inter-annual and seasonal variability have an insignificant influence on the distribution of live species in the intertidal environments of Bandon Marsh, a conclusion that contrasts with those of some other studies (e.g., Buzas, 1965;Horton & Murray, 2006. However, the lack of significant seasonal variations in the live populations might be partly explained by our sampling strategy, as we sampled Bandon Marsh in summer and fall in two successive years. A fuller understanding of the seasonal variations could be made through sampling in additional seasons and years. However, a great contrast in monthly precipitation occurs between the two seasons that we sampled (Fig. 2). Based on a 30-yr average (1981-2011), the monthly precipitation is low in the summer months (July and August), with 11 and 14 mm per month, respectively, but high in October with an average of 103 mm per month (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ datasets/GHCND/stations). Precipitation influences the porewater salinity in salt marshes. For example, de Rijk (1995) has shown that foraminiferal distributions of the Great Marshes, Massachusetts, reflect variations in salinity, the result not of tidal exposure but of changes in the balance between seepage, precipitation and flooding. At Cowpen Marsh (UK), Horton & Edwards (2003 and Horton & Murray (2006 suggested that the greatest inter-annual variations in live and dead foraminiferal populations are found in summer and fall when blooms of foraminifera occur. Buzas (1965) observed that the total number of live individuals was greatest in the summer when maximum water temperature and highest abundance of zooplankton and phytoplankton occurred in Long Island Sound, U.S. Atlantic coast. However, in the Humble estuary (UK) and in the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (Delaware, USA), Alve & Murray (1994) and Hippensteel et al. (2002), respectively, found high reproduction rates of foraminifera in late spring. Debenay et al. (2006) found high reproduction rates of foraminifera in late spring and early fall in the Vie estuary (France). The comparison of live populations and dead foraminiferal assemblages reveals the influence of taphonomic alterations (e.g., destruction and transport of foraminiferal tests). For example, Haynesina sp. shows a higher relative abundance in the live (St. 2, 48%) compared to dead   (GLM). For the GLM, the degree of freedom (df) and p values for elevation (tidal flat, low marsh, high marsh and highest marsh to upland transition), year (2011,2012), and interaction between elevation and year are shown. Significant correlations are given in bold.  St. 2,3%;Figs. 4,5). Our observations suggest that the majority of calcareous tests of this species were dissolved after burial: we found a total of 719 specimens (per 10 cm 3 ) in the live populations, but only 54 specimens (per 10 cm 3 ) in the dead assemblages (n 5 5). Furthermore, the remaining dead specimens of Haynesina sp. often have signs of dissolution (e.g., fragile, incomplete and/or white tests). Taphonomic alterations of calcareous foraminifera have been observed elsewhere along the Oregon coast (Jennings & Nelson, 1992;Engelhart et al., 2013b), as well as in other temperate intertidal environments (e.g., Murray & Alve, 1999;Edwards & Horton, 2000;Horton & Murray, 2006;Kemp et al., 2013b). Reaves (1986), Green et al. (1993) and Berkeley et al. (2007) explained a higher rate of dissolution of calcareous tests at the sediment-water interface with lowered porewater pH. Reaves (1986) suggested that a higher amount of metabolizable organic matter causes a higher rate of microbial decay, resulting in anoxic-sulfidic conditions and in the formation of ferro-sulfite minerals in marsh soils. These minerals are oxidized during times of reduced microbial activity, which lowers the pH, resulting in an undersaturation with respect to calcium carbonate and thus higher rates of dissolution. In Bandon Marsh, pH values between 5.2 and 5.6 were measured in 2011 (Brophy & van de Wetering, 2012). Alve & Nagy (1986) concluded that pH values of # ,7 cause the dissolution of calcareous tests. From laboratory experiments on Ammonia beccarii tests, Wang & Chappel (2001) and Le Cadre et al. (2003) observed dissolution when pH values were between or lower than 6 and 7. Despite taphonomic loss of calcareous species, the live populations and dead assemblages have similar species distributions because the assemblages are dominated by agglutinated foraminifera (.90% of the dead assemblages). The agglutinated specimens show little sign of taphonomic alterations, which has been shown elsewhere (e.g., Jonasson & Patterson, 1992;Goldstein & Watkins, 1999;Culver & Horton, 2005). Our results suggest that both live populations and dead assemblages in Bandon Marsh are suitable for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. However, in intertidal environments strongly influenced by early diagenetic dissolution of calcium carbonate, dead foraminiferal assemblages are the best modern analogues for fossil assemblages."}, {"section_title": "LIVE AND DEAD FORAMINIFERAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN BANDON MARSH AND THEIR RELATION TO ELEVATION", "text": "In Bandon Marsh, we observed a strong vertical zonation of live populations and dead foraminifera. The tidal flat and low marsh (Zones IIb and II; Fig. 6) is dominated by M. fusca with contributions from Haynesina sp. in the live populations. Miliammina fusca has been reported as the indicator species of temperate tidal flat and low marsh environments along the Oregon coast (Hunger, 1966;Jennings & Nelson, 1992;Engelhart et al., 2013b) and in other North American Pacific intertidal environments (Williams, 1989(Williams, , 1999Patterson et al., 1999;Kemp et al., 2013b). Jadammina macrescens and T. inflata are the most abundant species in the high marsh in both the live and dead assemblages, with lesser contributions from M. fusca and B. pseudomacrescens (Zone Ib and IIa, Fig. 6). Similar high marsh assemblages are also observed in Oregon (Jennings & Nelson, 1992;Engelhart et al., 2013b), and in other temperate (Williams, 1989;Patterson, 1990;Patterson et al., 1999) intertidal environments. The high marsh and highest marsh to upland transition zone (Zone Ia; Fig. 6) is dominated by T. irregularis and B. pseudomacrescens in both live populations and dead assemblages. Trochamminita irregularis has been recognized as a highest high marsh and upland species elsewhere along the Oregon coast (identified as Trochamminita salsa in Nelson et al., 2008;Engelhart et al., 2013b), and (as T. salsa) from the salt marshes of Chile (Jennings et al., 1995). But T. irregularis is also notably absent from other Oregon intertidal environments near our study site (Jennings & Nelson, 1992;. Balticammina pseudomacrescens is a ubiquitous species in Oregon intertidal environments, encountered from the middle marsh to the upland .

Previous studies implied that sediment d 13 C reflects the C 3 /C 4 botanical component preserved in the sediment, which is controlled by salinity and the degree of tidal inundation (e.g., Chmura & Aharon, 1995;Lamb et al., 2006Lamb et al., , 2007Kemp et al., 2010). For example, in estuarine wetlands on the U.S. Atlantic coast, a gradual change was observed from the dominance of C 4 plants, producing carbon with heavier d 13 C values, relative to C 3 plants with lighter d 13 C values, along a salinity gradient (e.g., Smith & Epstein, 1971;Chmura & Aharon, 1995;Lamb et al., 2006). In Oregon coastal environments, marsh vegetation predominantly consists of C 3 plants, with C 4 plants restricted mostly to the low marsh and tidal flat (Engelhart et al., 2013b). However, organic material derived from freshwater or marine phytoplankton, and allochthonous particulate organic matter (POC) and dissolved organic matter (DOC), can have a strong influence on the d 13 C, C/N and TOC values of sediments in coastal environments that are frequently inundated by tides or rivers, or where autochthonous vegetation contributes little to sediment organic matter (e.g., tidal flat or low marsh environments; Chmura & Aharon, 1995;Lamb et al., 2006). Vegetation cover is sparse in the tidal flat and low marsh of Bandon Marsh, and low TOC values (0.4 to 5.0%) suggest minimal input from in situ vegetation (Figs. 7, 11). The most abundant plants are Zostera nana and Z. marina FIGURE 9. Box plots of median d 13 C, C/N and TOC values of the years 2011 and 2012, with 25 th and 75 th percentile (boxes) and 95% confidence intervals (whiskers), for the tidal flat, low marsh, high marsh and highest marsh to upland stations (A, C, D). Results of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for the d 13 C, C/N and TOC values are also shown (B, D, F; Table 1). (relative abundance of ,15% at St. 1, 2) and D. spicata (35-80% at St. 3, 4), with d 13 C values in the range of C 4 plants (between , 210.0 to 213.5%; Smith & Epstein, 1970;Byrne et al., 2001). The C 3 plants Scirpus spp. and Juncus balticus (St. 3, 4), which have lighter d 13 C values between 226.0 and 230% (Chmura & Aharon, 1995;Byrne et al., 2001), are much less abundant (20-40%) in these environments. The d 13 C and C/N values that we observed in bulk sediments for the tidal flat and low marsh range between 220.7 and 224.3% and 7.7 and 12.6, respectively. These values reflect greater contributions from marine phyto-plankton, which have d 13 C values between 216 and 227% (Go\u00f1 i and Thomas, 2000;Lamb et al., 2006;Park & Shin, 2010;) and C/N ratios less than 10 (Meyers, 1994). The bulk sediment d 13 C and C/N values also indicate the influence of allochthonous marine POC (with d 13 C ratios between 218 and 224% and TOC between 4 and 10%) and DOC (with d 13 C ratios between 222 and 225% and TOC between 7 and 26%; Fig. 11). The generally decreasing d 13 C values from the low marsh to the upland (222.6 to 229.8%) indicate the increasing incorporation of terrestrial C 3 plants, such as Scirpus spp., FIGURE 11. Ranges of d 13 C ratios and C/N values from different sources of organic material found in intertidal environments. This figure was modified from Lamb et al. (2006) and Khan et al. (2015).  Zheng & Shangguan, 2006) and Juncus balticus (228.4%; Byrne et al., 2001), into sediments at the expense of C 4 plants. For example, the heavier mean d 13 C values of St. 5, 6 and 8 (between 223.6 and 225.2%) compared to the lighter mean d 13 C values of high marsh St. 7 and 9 (between 227.1 and 228.1%) can be explained by the higher occurrence of D. spicata at St. 5, 6 and 8. However, the generally decreasing d 13 C values (from 223.6 to 228.9%) and generally increasing C/N ratios (from 12.9 to 22.7) from the high marsh to the upland could also indicate a dominance of C 3 plants, as well as a decrease in the influence of allochthonous particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from marine sources. These trends were evident at St. 5, 6 and 8 compared to St. 7, 9 and 10, which are situated at higher elevations and a greater distance from open water (Fig. 11). Similar observations of increasing C/N ratios with increasing distance from the shore and elevation were found by Wilson et al. (2005a, b) in the Mersey estuary (UK), by Kemp et al. (2010Kemp et al. ( , 2012 in an North Carolina (USA) salt marsh, and by Engelhart et al. (2013b) in an Oregon (USA) salt marsh. Despite significant correlations of d 13 C, C/N and TOC values with elevation in Bandon Marsh, the d 13 C, C/N and TOC ranges from the tidal flat and low marsh (St. 1-3) overlap ( Fig. 10A-C). We further observed a corresponding overlap in d 13 C, C/N and TOC ranges for the low marsh (St. 4) with the high marsh (St. 5-7), and for values from high marsh (St. 8,9) and highest marsh to upland transition (St. 10) stations. Comparable observations of overlapping d 13 C values were made by Engelhart et al. (2013b), who found similar d 13 C ratios between the tidal flat/low marsh and the middle/high marsh zones at Siletz Bay, Oregon. Kemp et al. (2010Kemp et al. ( , 2012 also observed a tendency for C/N ratios to converge to uniform values between 10 and 20 in marsh and upland settings. The observed tendency for overlap among d 13 C, C/N and TOC values indicates that these geochemical proxies provide less accurate indicators of former sea-level changes than do microfossils, but these proxies have great potential to support sea-level reconstructions based on intertidal foraminifera. Within our sampling design, the d 13 C, C/N and TOC values display no significant inter-annual variability. However, Hoffman & Bronk (2006) studied inter-annual and seasonal d 13 C variations of particulate organic matter (POM) in brackish to freshwater river stations in Virginia and found higher inter-annual than seasonal variations in d 13 C of POM. The authors concluded that the spatial and temporal variations in d 13 C of POM are caused by physical mixing of estuarine and riverine POM and by variable amounts of POM in river discharge. Allen et al. (2007) studied the seasonal variation in d 13 C and C/N values in tidal flat and low marsh sediments in southwest England and found changes in d 13 C of ,1%, and of C/N of .3 between samples collected in January, May and August. Allen et al. (2007) explained these differences by a higher accumulation of C 3 plant detritus in winter and higher accumulation of algal material in summer. Also Cloern et al. (2002) found a seasonal variability in d 13 C values of selected plants from intertidal and subtidal freshwater environments in the San Francisco Bay, i.e., a variability of ,1.5% for the C 4 plant D. spicata and a higher variability, between 2.0 and 4.5%, for C 3 plants such as J. balticus, Salicornia virginica, Scirpus spp., and T. maritima. These authors also observed generally lower C/ N ratios during the first emergence of shoots and roots in spring, then a gradual rise in C/N during spring and summer, and a rapid increase in autumn and winter when the biomass was dying."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We investigated inter-annual and seasonal variations of distributions of live populations and dead foraminifera, and inter-annual variations in stable carbon isotopes (d 13 C), TOC values and C/N ratios in bulk sediments from intertidal environments of Bandon Marsh (Oregon, USA) from summer (dry) and fall (wet) seasons for two successive years (2011,2012). Results from ANOSIM (analysis of similarity) of live and dead foraminiferal assemblages suggest that both types of assemblages show no significant inter-annual or seasonal variations. The lack of significant seasonal variations in the live populations might be partly explained by our sampling strategy. Cluster analyses show that live and dead assemblages show a distinct and comparable vertical zonation: the tidal flat and low marsh is dominated by Miliammina fusca; the high marsh is characterized by higher percentages of Jadammina macrescens and Trochammina inflata; and the highest marsh to upland transition zone is dominated by Balticammina pseudomacrescens and Trochamminita irregularis. The only calcareous taxon encountered, Haynesina sp., is more abundant in the living than in the dead assemblages of the tidal flat and low marsh, reflecting rapid postdepositional dissolution of calcareous tests. The d 13 C and TOC values and C/N ratios show a significant linear correlation to elevation across the intertidal zone with no significant inter-annual variations in these geochemical proxies. The elevation-dependence of live populations and dead foraminiferal assemblages, as well as d 13 C and TOC values and C/N ratios, indicates that these variables can be used to reconstruct former relative sea levels, and hence, to infer land-level changes during past great earthquakes along the tectonically active Pacific coast of North America.
