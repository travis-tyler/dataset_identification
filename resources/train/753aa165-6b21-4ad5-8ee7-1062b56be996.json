[{"section_title": "Introduction 78", "text": "Tools to provide an early diagnosis and prediction of progression to Alzheimer Disease (AD) are 79 of critical importance. Early diagnosis allows caregivers to plan for additional needs which will 80 decrease the overall financial burden of the illness [1, 2] . In addition, early diagnosis may help System (MARS-14) column, and digested with trypsin (1:25 protease:protein ratio). The samples were then lyophilized, desalted and analyzed by LC/MRM-MS analysis on a QTRAP 5500 LC-185 MS/MS system at Caprion Proteomics. MRM experiments were performed on triple quadrupole 186 (Q) mass spectrometers. The first (Q1) and third (Q3) mass analyzer were used to isolate a 187 peptide ion and a corresponding fragment ion. The fragment ions were generated in Q2 by 188 collision induced dissociation. All peptide levels are presented as normalized and log2-189 transformed intensities as we and others have done previously [20, 26] , which is identical to the 190 manner in which they were provided in the quality-controlled dataset. [21] and Sequential BATTing [22] . Prior to application of these algorithms on the 320-peptide 197 MRM panel, promising peptide candidates were identified using the same algorithm utilized in 198 [20], using the logistic regression model with Lasso penalty [27] and a bootstrap procedure [28] 199 to improve the stability of the lasso parameter estimate. The predictive performance of the optimal signature from each algorithm for differentiating the 202 AD and NL subjects was then evaluated via 10 iterations of five-fold cross-validation. In this 203 procedure, the original data were divided into five random subsets (folds), each fold was left out 204 one at a time, and the remaining four folds were used to derive a signature, which was then used 205 to predict the disease state of each subject in the left-out fold. This process was carried out for 206 each left-out fold one at a time and the predictions of all the five left-out folds were aggregated. 207 For better stability and robustness, this cross-validation procedure was repeated 10 times and the 208 median of each these performance measures was calculated. All steps of the model building and 209 signature derivation process were fully embedded within this cross-validation to further reduce 210 any possible bias [29] . The optimal signature from the best performing algorithm determined via the above cross-213 validation procedure (i.e., the signature that best differentiated AD and NL subjects) was then tested on a separate independent group of 135 MCI subjects at baseline, to predict their future at baseline) were considered as non-converters. These baseline predictions were then compared 218 to the follow-up clinical data. Performance metrics such as the PPV, NPV and overall accuracy 219 were calculated by comparing the predictions to the known progression status of the MCI 220 subjects to AD over the next 36 months. Comparisons of the performance metrics between 221 different signatures were carried out via exact McNemar's test."}, {"section_title": "223", "text": "The performance of this signature was then evaluated in terms of its ability to differentiate the This analysis procedure was carried out separately for the following subsets of markers, along 230 with APOE genetic status, age, gender and education (4 markers):"}, {"section_title": "231", "text": "-MRI brain HV: 5 total markers (the 4 markers above + HV)"}, {"section_title": "232", "text": "-CSF A\u03b242, tTau, pTau-181, ratios of tTau to A\u03b242 & pTau-181 to A\u03b242 (AT): 9 total 233 markers 234 -AT + HV: 10 total markers, and 235 -AT + HV + 320 peptides from the CSF MRM panel: 330 total markers 236 This evaluation of the AD versus NL peptide signature on the future progression of a separate 237 group of MCI subjects to AD not only served as an independent verification of the utility of the 238 signature, but also put it to a greater test to see whether it is robust enough to address a different 239 and more important question related to the prediction of future progression of the MCI subjects 240 to AD. The analysis procedure described here is summarized in Figure 1 . Table 1B provides a breakdown of the 135 MCI subjects in terms of their future progression. The 251 subjects were balanced across groups in terms of age and education (both p>0.05). There were Ratio with 95% confidence bands. Based on these results, the optimal combination of 293 conventional markers showed a Hazard Ratio of 2.2 suggesting that the MCI subjects meeting 294 the criteria of this signature experience 2.2-fold faster progression to AD. However, the MCI 295 subjects that meet the signature criterion from the scenario that includes the PTPRN peptide Summary: 304 We examined the ability of a simple optimized multivariate signature comprising conventional 305 biomarkers combined with an array of novel CSF peptides from the ADNI database to both classify AD disease state and to predict MCI to AD conversion. We observed that both 307 conventional AD biomarkers (HV and CSF pTau/A\u03b242 ratio) and conventional biomarkers 308 combined with an array of novel CSF peptides performed similarly in terms of classifying 309 disease state (AD vs. NL). However, when these optimized signatures were applied to an presenilin-1 mutation-related dementia [42] . In addition, when incorporated into a three-gene 332 classifier, PTPRN expression levels have been found to discriminate between patients with AD 333 pathology and no symptoms, and those with only AD pathology [43] . Finally, in a preliminary 334 study of genetic interactions with CSF pTau levels for predicting MCI to AD conversion, PTPRN levels showed differences with respect to CSF pTau levels in MCI to AD converters 336 compared to non-converters [44] . 337 "}, {"section_title": "Prediction of MCI to AD progression:", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Implications of the prediction of MCI-AD conversion:", "text": "338 Over the years, several groups have examined the ability of multi-modal combination biomarkers 339 (i.e., combinations of imaging, cognitive, body fluid and other markers) to predict the conversion 340 of MCI to AD. Ideally, utilizing an approach such as the AT(N) framework, a combination 341 biomarker should merge several orthogonal measurements reflecting different underlying 342 biological processes. Larger combinations of biomarkers have the potential to increase the 343 predictive power of the combination biomarker. The multiplicity of biomarkers is limited by 344 clinical reality such that it is often impractical and costly to obtain multiple studies in individual 345 patients. Therefore, a challenge in developing combination biomarkers is to develop 346 combinations that provide high predictive MCI to AD accuracy and are clinically feasible."}, {"section_title": "347", "text": "Here, we have identified a 4-marker signature that combines volumetric MRI and CSF testing, "}]
