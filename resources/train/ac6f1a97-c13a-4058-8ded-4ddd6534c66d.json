We focused on seven regions of the 95 SARS-CoV-2 genome, namely the leader sequence, replicase polyprotein1a (pp1a), RdRp, 96 spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M), and envelope protein (E) 97 to design specific siRNAs to inhibit viral replication. Potential siRNA sequences targeting 98 viral genes were predicted using the programs siDirect (http://sidirect2.rnai.jp/) and 99 VIRsiRNApred (http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/virsirnapred/).

Briefly, subconfluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 10-124 fold serial diluents and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h 30 min in a 5% CO 2 incubator. After with 100 nM of the 61 siRNA sequences, the CPE and plaque assays were performed at 3 198 d.p.i. (Fig. 1a-1c) . At 3 d.p.i., all siRNA candidates reduced CPE in SARS-CoV-2 infected 199 Vero E6 cells, while CPE was observed in the control group (data not shown). Based on the 200 results of the CPE and plaque assays, we selected six siRNA leads, showing a reduction in 201 plaque number. Six siRNA leads were subjected to the NCBI blast to ensure that they did not 202 target any human genes. RdRp, pp1a, and N mRNAs were targeted by 3 siRNAs (Nos. 9, 14, 203 and 36), 2 siRNAs (No. 26 and 29), and 1 siRNA (No. 61), respectively. 204\nThe Nextstrain website was used to monitor the data on SARS-CoV-2 mutation and to 205 confirm whether the regions targeted by our siRNA leads were less mutated (as of June 26, 206 2020). Mutation rates in siRNA-targeted regions were 0-0.002%, indicating that siRNA leads 207 can be used to treat most SARS-CoV-2 strains.
