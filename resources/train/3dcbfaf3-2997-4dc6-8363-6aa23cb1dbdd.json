David* University of Illinois Laurie E. Drinkwater Cornell University Gregory F. McIsaac University of Illinois T he upper Mississippi River basin (MRB) has been identifi ed as the dominant source of riverine nitrate N fl ux contributing to the overall load of N to the Gulf of Mexico, where it is a major contributor to the hypoxic zone that forms each summer (USEPA, 2007) . Summer 2008 had the second-largest hypoxic zone on record, following high spring rainfall across many areas of the upper basin (USGS, 2008) . Th e upper MRB has the most productive soils in the basin with intensive agricultural production, predominately corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] . Land use in many subwatersheds is dominated by intensive corn-soybean production, often accounting for 90 to 95% of the landscape. Furthermore, these areas have undergone extensive hydrological modifi cations including channelization of the headwater streams and intensive tile (subsurface, artifi cial) drainage in fi elds to lower water tables and effi ciently route water to streams (Baker et al., 2008) . However, nitrate N, total and reactive P, and pesticides can readily move to streams during tile fl ow (e.g., Baker and Johnson, 1981; David et al., 1997 David et al., , 2003 Gentry et al., 2007) , and much of the annual loss can occur during a few days to weeks in the winter and spring (Royer et al., 2006) . During these high fl ow periods there is little opportunity for denitrifi cation to reduce the nitrate N load, so that most of the nitrate N that enters streams during winter and spring reaches the Gulf (Royer et al., 2004; Alexander et al., 2008) .\nMany modeling methods have been used to better understand the source areas of nitrate in the MRB (e.g., Donner et al., 2004; Booth and Campbell, 2007; Alexander et al., 2008) . Th ese methods typically focus on inputs of N (fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, manure, and sewage effl uent) and then relate the inputs to riverine loads. One method has used net N inputs (NNI, or sometimes net anthropogenic N inputs [NANI] ) to relate inputs and outputs of N at various scales, typically using state (David and Gentry, 2000; McIsaac et al., 2001 McIsaac et al., , 2002 or regional data (Howarth et al., 1996; Boyer et al., 2002; McIsaac and Hu, 2004) . Net N input is thought to be the N available for fi eld denitrifi cation losses, additions to the soil N pool, and transport to surface and groundwaters (McIsaac et al., 2002) . McIsaac et al. (2002) were able to predict Mississippi River nitrate N load using NNI and river fl ow in a nonlinear model and demonstrated that net inputs needed to be lagged up to 9 yr to predict annual loads. Howarth et al. (1996) found that for large regions of the North Atlantic, about 25% of NNI was exported through rivers. David and Gentry (2000) determined that for Illinois, about 50% of NNI was exported through rivers,; they concluded that tile-drained agriculture was the probable cause of this higher loss. McIsaac and Hu (2004) then examined two regions in Illinois using the NNI approach. Th ey observed in the tile-drained region (central Illinois) that NNI was equal to riverine nitrate N export, whereas in the non-tiled region (southern Illinois) riverine export was between 25 and 37% of NNI. Given these patterns, it is not clear if NNI is useful in evaluating the potential for N losses when tile drainage is present.\nIt is diffi cult to assess net mineralization of N from the large soil organic N pool present in most agricultural soils, as well as nitrifi cation of the mineralized pool (Dahnke and Johnson, 1990; Griffi n, 2008) . Each year, a large amount of N is mineralized, with most replaced (on a multiyear basis) through immobilization processes, either by fertilizer or crop residues. In the NNI approach, this pool is assumed to be at a steady state, as there are no consistently reliable annual measurements available. David et al. (2009) evaluated changes in the soil organic N pool from 1957 to 2002 for Mollisols in Illinois and concluded that there were no changes. However, Gentry et al. (2009) in a mass balance of a small watershed in east-central Illinois determined that there may now be a small net depletion of soil organic N occurring most years. In the USEPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) analysis, the possibility of a net depletion was discussed, given that crop harvests have continued to increase while fertilizer additions have been steady, with concomitant high riverine losses of nitrate N (USEPA, 2007). In addition, denitrifi cation losses are diffi cult to assess and add to the loss of N ). However, we currently have no systematic collection of fi eld data available to estimate either of these fl uxes (i.e., net N mineralization or N 2 O + N 2 ) across the MRB.\nNone of these modeling or NNI approaches have used recent agricultural data at the county scale, combined with perhaps the most critical landscape factor, tile drainage, to examine the source areas of and controls on recent winter and springtime riverine nitrate N fl ux across the MRB. Th erefore, our objectives were (i) to relate agricultural and human inputs and outputs of N across the MRB to annual or winter-spring riverine nitrate export utilizing both state and county scale databases and (ii) to determine the most important drivers and MRB areas leading to riverine nitrate export. We used readily available, multiyear and recent data for the MRB, focusing on the river fl ow period most associated with Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. Th is analysis will help to identify where conservation eff orts, or changes in agricultural production systems, should be targeted in the MRB if the type of riverine reductions (45% reduction in total N and total P riverine loads compared with 1980 to 1996 average loads) called for in the most recent Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan are to be successful (Mississippi River/ Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, 2008). (USDA, 2008) . Fertilizer N sold in each county was estimated by using annual sales at the state level (AAPFCO, 2008) , with county usage broken out proportionately from Census of Agriculture fertilizer, lime, and soil conditioner expenditure data from 1997 (USDA, 2008 , and other years estimated by interpolation. Annual fertilizer sales data are for the period 1 July of the previous year through 30 June of the year indicated, so that they represent the amount applied to the crops for the indicated year. Population data for each county were from the U.S. Census in 2000, when the MRB had a total population of 89.1 million (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2008). Atmospheric deposition of N (defi ned as NO y ) was from National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) estimates (http://nadp.sws. uiuc.edu) and included wet deposition of nitrate N, with dry deposition estimated as 70% of wet (David and Gentry, 2000; McIsaac et al., 2002; USEPA, 2007) . Using ArcGIS v. 9.3 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, 2008) , we calculated county-level deposition data from NADP isopleth maps of nitrate deposition for each year from 1997 to 2006, with estimation of dry as described above giving us NO y ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Nitrogen Estimates", "text": "Crop production estimates were used to determine N harvested for each crop and year. For corn, previous work had assumed a protein concentration of 10%, which corresponded to a grain N concentration of 1.6% (David and Gentry, 2000) . Data from strip plots in many states now suggest that modern corn hybrids have a much lower protein concentration (e.g., Duvick et al., 2004a,b; University of Illinois, 2009 ) and that it probably has been decreasing since about 1985 (F.E. Below, personal communication, 2009). We assumed that corn had a 10% protein concentration in 1985 and that it decreased to 8.5% by 2006 (1.36% N). We used linear interpolation between these two values to estimate the corn protein concentration for our data from 1997 to 2006. For soybean, recent strip plot data (University of Illinois, 2009) indicate no change in the 35% protein concentration that we and others have previously used (e.g., David and Gentry, 2000) ; so we multiplied soybean bushels by 1.52 to obtain N harvested in kg N bushel -1 . Conversion values for wheat and sorghum bushels were 0.499 and 0.363, respectively (Goolsby et al., 1999) . Cotton bales were converted to N harvested by multiplying by 13.6 (Mullins and Burmester, 1990; Brietenbeck and Boquet, 1993; Boquet and Brietenbeck, 2000) , and rice hundred weight by 0.58 (Wilson et al., 1998) . Alfalfa and hay harvest N conversions were 23.6 and 20 kg N ton \u22121 harvested, respectively (McIsaac et al., 2002) .\nIn previous work, David and Gentry (2000) estimated soybean N 2 fi xation as 50% of the aboveground N in the plants, assuming an N harvest index of 80%. However, with increasing fertilizer use effi ciency in corn and likely less residual nitrate N in soils, we believe N 2 fi xation by soybean has been increasing. Gentry et al. (2009) (Goolsby et al., 1999; McIsaac et al., 2002) . To estimate animal manure, we used values derived from Goolsby et al. (1999) for hogs, cattle, broilers, layers, and turkeys of 0.027, 0.16, 0.001, 0.0034, and 0.0044 kg N d \u22121 for each animal, respectively. Per capita values of N consumed by humans was estimated at 4.53 kg N yr \u22121 (David and Gentry, 2000; McIsaac et al., 2002) .\nWe also used a state-level database constructed by McIsaac et al. (2002) that was extended through 2007 using the modifi ed coeffi cients described above for county-level analysis. For fertilizer N inputs, we used state sales data (AAPFCO, 2008) and did not need to use the Census of Agriculture expenditure data."}, {"section_title": "Land Drainage", "text": "Tile drainage is a critical aspect of crop production systems in the agricultural Midwest (Baker et al., 2008) and has been in place since the 1860s in many states, with Illinois having most of the original clay tile systems installed between 1880 and 1895 (Baker et al., 2008) . Tile systems continue to be replaced and expanded each year, with plastic pipe used since the 1950s. However, there are no public records of these recent installations (landowners have good maps of recent installations), as there were when clay tiles were fi rst installed. Th e Census of Agriculture conducted every 5 yr by USDA occasionally included questions about drainage, but these questions were imprecise and asked about drainage diff erently each time; consequently, these data are of limited value. One of the best estimates of tile drainage is thought to be USDA (1987), which used 1978 Census of Drainage data, drainage specialists, and other government data sources, but these data were aggregated at the state level, and there can be large variability in tile drainage intensity across watersheds within a state (McIsaac and Hu, 2004) . Because of the importance of tiles in lowering the water table and conveying nitrate N, there has been a great interest in spatially estimating where tiles are located. On small areas (fi elds to counties), aerial photography has been used to identify tile locations on the basis of diff erences in soil moisture patterns caused by the tiles (David et al., , 2003 . However, this is not feasible on large areas, and therefore soil survey information has been utilized, with drainage class used to estimate tile drained land. In this study, we used the county-level database compiled by Sugg (2007) , where areas of row crops and poorly drained soils were calculated and disaggregated to the county level using geographic information system (GIS), allowing an estimate of percentage of the county area in tile drainage to be made. Sugg (2007) provides an excellent summary of what is known about the spatial pattern of tile drainage and gives details of the methods he used. In reviewing these data, we made changes to a few counties in two states, Illinois and Minnesota, where drainage estimates for a few of the counties were quite low for some unknown reason. Adjustments were made to both states on the basis of surrounding county averages, as the counties with low estimates were obvious when plotted because surrounding counties had much higher drainage estimates. For Illinois, a map of tile drainage in 1913 was used (based on cumulative sales of clay tile in each county, reported in Baker et al., 2008) as a basis, and for Minnesota consultation with a state expert (G.W. Randall, personal communication, 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Balances", "text": "We calculated several N balances using our database, all on a county-level basis. Components included all manure, which was calculated as the sum of cattle, hog, broiler, layer, and turkey manures. Crop N was the sum of corn, soybean, wheat, rice, cotton, and sorghum N harvested. All hay was the sum of alfalfa and other hay N harvested. Crop fi xation was the sum of soybean, alfalfa hay, and other hay fi xation. Net N inputs were calculated as (fertilizer N + NO y deposition + all manure + crop fi xation + people N) -(crop N + all hay N). Nitrogen balance was (fertilizer N + NO y + all manure + people N) -(corn N + wheat N + rice N + cotton N + sorghum N)."}, {"section_title": "Riverine Nitrogen Concentrations, Loads, and Modeling", "text": "For the analysis of the large subbasins of the MRB, we used the state-level nutrient mass balances and USGS annual nitrate N concentrations and river fl ow measurements to construct yields (mass loss per unit area, kg N ha We used 153 unique watersheds with available nitrate N concentration and river fl ow data in the MRB where we could calculate January to June nitrate yield estimates. Data were obtained from USGS, USEPA, and state agency Web sites for 1997 through 2006. Sites were only included that met the following criteria: continuous fl ow monitoring by the USGS and at least three nitrate N concentration measurements each year (January-June) during this time period. Typically, there were about 40 winter-spring nitrate N concentrations for a given location. Th e nitrate N concentrations were averaged for the six-month period, multiplied by average river fl ow during this period, and then divided by the watershed area for a yield estimate. Watershed level estimates of all independent variables were made by aggregating all county data (averaged for 1997 to 2006) in the watershed using ArcGIS. Th e median watershed area in this analysis was 1982 km 2 , with a range from 79 to 50,360 km 2 (Table 1) . We used a correlation analysis to identify variables that were related to the January-to-June nitrate N yield for each watershed. A nonlinear model was then developed using the SAS NLIN procedure, with estimates of the variation explained in the fi nal model by the individual terms using GLM (SAS Institute, 2003) . We compared the distribution of important watershed characteristics for all counties in the basin with the 153 watersheds to be confi dent our model calibration watersheds refl ected the entire basin (Table  1) . To expand the fi nal model to all counties in the MRB, we obtained January-to-June runoff data at the HUC8 level from the USGS for January to June each year from 1997 to 2006 (USGS, 2010a) and then used GIS to obtain runoff for each county, taking an overall 10-yr average. See USGS (2010b) for an explanation of hydrologic unit cords (HUCs)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Large Subbasin Analysis", "text": "For the entire MRB, fertilizer N inputs have increased at 0.13 kg N ha \u22121 yr \u22121 since 1980 (linear regression equation, n = 26, r 2 = 0.46, p < 0.0001) to about 20 kg N ha \u22121 yr \u22121 for the MRB (Fig. 1) . Nitrogen fi xation has also steadily increased as soybean productivity has increased. Atmospheric deposition (NO y ) is a small component (8%) of the recent inputs (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) , as inputs are dominated by fertilizer (52%) and N 2 fi xation (40%). Crop harvest removal dominates outputs (\u223c25 to 30 kg N ha , with no trend. When looking at the same fl uxes for the upper Mississippi River basin (Fig. 2) , all N fl uxes are much greater due to a greater dominance of agriculture across the landscape. Fertilizer inputs have been steady in this subbasin, , respectively. We plotted annual riverine nitrate N yield as a fraction of NNI (averaged for the previous 4 yr) for each of the subbasins versus annual water yield to illustrate the variability among the subbasins (Fig. 3) "}, {"section_title": "County-Level Analysis", "text": "As expected, fertilizer N inputs by county (Fig. 4) and fraction of the county in crops (crop fraction) were highly correlated (r = 0.94, n = 1768, p < 0.0001). Th e fraction of the county that was tile drained was also strongly correlated with fertilizer N (r = 0.61, p < 0.0001) as well as crop fraction (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001). Th e tile drainage pattern on the MRB landscape clearly shows the U.S. Cornbelt, where artifi cially drained Mollisols have the highest productivity and are therefore primarily in corn and soybean rotations (Fig. 5) . Net N inputs were weakly correlated with fertilizer N inputs (r = 0.41, p < 0.0001) and crop fraction (r = 0.23, p < 0.0001) and showed no clear spatial pattern across the MRB (Fig. 6) . In forested or grassland areas, NNI values were generally <10 kg N ha \u22121 and were greatest in areas with high animal numbers that generated manure. Th ese areas were typically outside of the Cornbelt, so that NNI was only weakly correlated with drainage (r = 0.07, p < 0.03). We evaluated a wide range of models to predict watershed riverine nitrate N yield from our various N inputs, balances, and landscape factors for the 153 watersheds in the MRB for which we had riverine fl ux data available. Both linear and nonlinear models were evaluated using characteristics in Table 1 as well as others we thought might explain nitrate N yields. Th e model with the best fi t that was developed used average county values aggregated to a watershed scale for 1997 to 2006 with a nonlinear regression analysis to estimate coeffi cients with the following form: Th e overall R 2 for this model was 0.82, and all model parameters had 95% confi dence limits that did not overlap with zero. As determined by GLM, all terms were signifi cant (p < 0.0001), with river fl ow \u00d7 fertilizer N accounting for 76% of the model explained variation, drainage 17%, and human consumption 7%. Th e distribution of important characteristics for our model compared with all counties in the MRB indicates that our model watersheds were generally representative of the overall MRB (Table 1) . Th e county-based MRB had a greater median crop fraction than did our 153 watersheds, but the distribution was similar. Most other characteristics had similar medians and distribution, although the county maximums were always greater than those for the modeled watersheds. Th e predicted versus estimated January-to-June nitrate N yields show the range in values and fi t of the fi nal model (Fig. 7) . Th e residuals had no trend with nitrate N yield. Th e second-best model had the same form and terms, with the exception of crop fraction in place of fertilizer (R 2 = 0.80), suggesting it is not fertilizer alone leading to nitrate N losses but the combination of the most productive soils (high in organic matter) that are tile drained and heavily cropped leading to nitrate N export.\nWe then applied the model to each county in the MRB to predict an average January-to-June riverine nitrate N yield for 1997 to 2006 (Fig. 8) . Th e results indicated there were 259 counties with predicted nitrate N yields >7.5 kg N ha \u22121 , 375 counties in the 3 to 7.5 kg N ha \u22121 class, and 1135 counties in the <3 kg N ha \u22121 class. As we would expect from the fi nal variables in the model, highest loads were found across the Cornbelt from southern Minnesota into the Des Moines lobe of Iowa, across northern central Illinois, Indiana, and into Ohio. Th is map is consistent with the large measured loads from the upper Mississippi and Ohio basins and shows which counties in these subbasins would have the largest nitrate N yields. Watershed characteristics for the counties with nitrate N yields >7.5 kg N ha \u22121 are given for reference in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our analysis at the large subbasin and county scales shows the overwhelming importance of fertilized crops on a tile-drained landscape leading to the greatest riverine nitrate N yields, with localized eff ects of sewage effl uent. As Baker et al. (2008) pointed out, the most productive soils that are high in organic matter (with high soil N mineralization rates) have modifi ed drainage, are intensively cropped, and therefore have the greatest fertilizer inputs, creating an agricultural system that is leaky with respect to nitrate N. Despite increasing crop harvests, NNI has only remained steady within the MRB due to slightly increasing fertilizer N inputs, decreasing corn protein concentrations, and increased N 2 fi xation by soybean. Th e importance of hydrology on nitrate N yields was also observed, leading to a greater fraction of NNI exported by rivers in watersheds with higher water yields, more intense cropping, and increased tile drainage. For small watersheds such as the Embarras River, riverine nitrate N export was several times NNI, suggesting a carryover of N from one year to the next, or an additional source of nitrate N. Th e additional source is probably a net mineralization of soil organic N, as modern transgenic corn hybrids are perhaps accessing available soil N more effi ciently than older hybrids. Other recent studies also noted that N balances, when including riverine export, may now be negative in tile-drained Mollisols with corn and soybean rotations in the upper Mississippi Basin (Jaynes et al., 2001; Jaynes and Karlen, 2008; Gentry et al., 2009) .\nBecause another source of N is probably important to overall N balances and riverine losses combined with the role of tile drainage in increasing losses, we found that NNI was not a good predictor of riverine nitrate N loss across the MRB. In watersheds such as the Embarras, the diff erence between N inputs and outputs is now close to zero, without including riverine export or denitrifi cation. However, riverine nitrate N losses are still quite large. McIsaac and Hu (2004) fi rst documented this pattern when they assessed NNI in tile-drained versus non-tile-drained regions of Illinois. Vitousek et al. (2009) also noted that although N balances in Illinois were now smaller than they were previously, environmental impacts of intensive agricultural production on tile-drained fi elds were not declining.\nOur modeled nitrate N yield for each county in the MRB illustrates clearly that the combination of fertilized corn on tile-drained watersheds is the dominate source of riverine nitrate N yields in the upper MRB, with another source area in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. Th is result is consistent with the recent fi ndings of Broussard and Turner (2009) , who found that corn production contributes to riverine nitrate export across the United States. Atmospheric deposition of N and animal manure were not found to be signifi cant explanatory variables in our model. Only human consumption, which is an indicator of sewage effl uent inputs, was an additional important term in our model. Th e model we developed was quite similar to that recently published by Booth and Campbell (2007) , using data from 1990 to 2002, where they predicted spring nitrate N fl ux for the MRB. Th eir model was similar in form, with runoff \u00d7 fertilizer accounting for 59% of the modeled load and human consumption 11%, which is similar to our corresponding values of 76 and 7%, respectively. However, they also reported animal manure (13% of modeled load) and atmospheric nitrate deposition (17%) as signifi cant sources of nitrate N yields. Booth and Campbell (2007) did not include a term for tile-drainage, however, which we found explained 17% of our model variation and also aff ected the exponent on runoff \u00d7 N fertilizer term. Booth and Campbell (2007) had an exponent of 3.083 on fertilizer N, whereas our fi nal model had an exponent of 0.7783, and they stressed the nonlinear response of the river fl ow \u00d7 fertilizer N term. However, when we used a nonlinear model without the tile drainage term (and including manure, similar to the Booth and Campbell (2007) model), the river fl ow \u00d7 fertilizer term had an exponent of 2.682, similar to theirs. Th is suggests that the nonlinear nature of the fertilizer term found by Booth and Campbell (2007) may be a result of tile drainage increasing as fertilizer N increases across the MRB, with the increased tile drainage leading to a greater fraction of N loss as we observed in the large subbasin analysis. Our model explicitly shows this eff ect, whereas the larger fertilizer N exponent (>1) by Booth and Campbell (2007) indirectly refl ects the interaction of tile drainage and fertilizer N inputs. Th e model of Booth and Campbell (2007) could lead to the conclusion that high fertilizer inputs alone could lead to large riverine fl uxes, although with little tile drainage this is unlikely as McIsaac and Hu (2004) observed. When the tile drainage term was excluded in our analysis, there was a greater error sums of squares and several of the coeffi cients had 95% confi dence limits that overlapped with zero. Overall, given the similarity of the major terms in both models that explained nitrate N yield, our map (Fig. 8 ) of nitrate N yield is quite similar to the Booth and Campbell (2007) Fig. 5 , which showed the modeled nitrate N fl ux from agricultural sources.\nWe determined that human consumption of N, which is an indirect measure of sewage effl uent N inputs to rivers, was statistically signifi cant, but a relatively unimportant term in our model, explaining only 7% of the variation in nitrate N yield. Th is is similar to Booth and Campbell (2007) , who found that it explained 11% in their model, and to the load data analyzed by the USEPA SAB (USEPA, 2007) , where it was estimated that 14% of spring riverine nitrate N load to the Gulf of Mexico was from point sources, which were dominated by sewage effl uent. Although reductions in point-source N would help reduce nitrate N yields in some streams of the MRB, in the overall scale of nitrate N losses, these reductions would probably have small impacts on winter-spring nitrate N loads delivered to the Gulf of Mexico. Th e SPARROW model was been developed to identify sources and transport processes of both total N and P delivery to the Gulf of Mexico from the MRB (Alexander et al., 2008; Robertson et al., 2009 ). SPARROW incorporates instream removal processes for N and P, includes a tile-drainage factor, and estimates a long-term annual nutrient load using nutrient concentrations and daily fl ow measurements from 1975 to 1995, standardized to the 1992 base year, which was also the only year used for nutrient-source data. Our analysis does not attempt to predict nitrate N delivery to the Gulf of Mexico, but we would suggest that during the higher fl ow periods of winter and spring there is limited in-stream removal of nitrate N, as discussed by Royer et al. (2004 Royer et al. ( , 2006 . SPARROW indicated that 52% of the N delivered to the Gulf was from corn and soybean production, whereas 16% was from atmospheric deposition, 5% from manure on pasture and rangelands, and 9% from urban-human sources (Alexander et al., 2008) . Again, this result is consistent with our model in that land supporting corn and soybean production (and the associated fertilizer N) is the primary driver, with human sources a small but important N input. A major diff erence from our results is the importance of atmospheric deposition, as well as other sources such as forests (5%). Robertson et al. (2009) present maps of all HUC8 watersheds within the MRB for both total N yields and total N delivered to the Gulf of Mexico using SPARROW. Th eir map of total N yields (their Fig. 3A ) includes our high nitrate N yielding counties but incorporates a broader area of watersheds with high total N yields. Th ese diff erences in estimated N sources and watershed yields of total N may be due to several factors: SPARROW includes just 1 yr of nutrient input data (1992), predicts annual N fl uxes, predicts total N rather than nitrate N, and uses N data from 1975 through 1995.\nWe suggest that improved practices are needed to reduce nitrate N losses in the top 259 counties (where the modeled January-June nitrate N yields were >7.5 kg N ha \u22121 ). Our analysis shows that these counties have high crop and drainage fractions, high fertilizer N inputs, and greater N balances compared with the overall MRB (Table 1) . Reducing nitrate N loss from tile-drained fi elds will be diffi cult if they remain in corn and soybeans, given that for the best-yielding (i.e., highest crop production) fi elds the N balance may be negative. Our results and many other recent studies demonstrate that corn and soybean fi elds with tile drainage are quite leaky with respect to nitrate N, even when current best management practices are followed (Baker et al., 2008; Hatfi eld et al., 2009 ). As pointed out by the USEPA SAB (USEPA, 2007) and Hatfi eld et al. (2009) , shifting to more complex crop rotations is needed to have a major eff ect on N losses. Th ese rotations could include winter cover crops to capture nitrate N and legumes to fi x N, which would better couple carbon and N cycles and reduce nitrate N losses (Tonitto et al., 2006; Drinkwater and Snapp, 2007) . Other practices such as shifting from fall to spring N fertilization, side-dressing N, and changes in the type of N fertilizer all may help reduce nitrate losses. However, without increasing cropping system diversity, these changes are not likely to greatly reduce losses (USEPA, 2007; Broussard and Turner, 2009; Gardner and Drinkwater, 2009 ). Water table management has great promise for reducing losses (Skaggs and Youssef, 2008; Cooke et al., 2008) , although there are still many questions about the fate of the retained water and nitrate N. Off -fi eld practices that increase denitrifi cation such as tile bioreactors (Blowes et al., 1994; Greenan et al., 2009; Chun et al., 2009 Chun et al., , 2010 , denitrifi cation wall or trenches (Schipper and Vojvodic-Vukovic, 2001; , wetlands at tile outlets (Kovacic et al., 2000; USEPA, 2007) , or modifi cation of drainage ditches (Powell et al., 2007ab ) also could be adopted. Th ese off -fi eld methods allow current production systems to be used, while removing nitrate N at the edge of fi elds, but may exacerbate nitrous oxide emissions. Given the current agricultural policies in place, however, where commodity payments are dominant, producers have little incentive to install these off -fi eld systems or make other changes to current crop production systems (Booth and Campbell, 2007) ."}]
