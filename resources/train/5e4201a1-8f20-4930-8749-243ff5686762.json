Water quality is a major determinant of the health of estuaries. In Texas, coastal watersheds have experienced significant human population growth over the past several decades. For example, from 1997 to 2012, the population in Texas coastal counties increased by 29% (Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute 2014). Projections suggest that there will be an additional 34% population increase by 2050 (Texas State Data Center, http://txsdc.utsa.edu/Data/TPEPP/Projections/Index.aspx). Urbanization associated with population growth is known to cause water quality degradation in downstream waterbodies, primarily through enhancement of pollutant loadings (e.g., nutrients, organic matter, bacterial pathogens) (Peierls et al. 1991;Vernberg et al. 1992;Hopkinson and Vallino 1995;Handler et al. 2006). Population growth also affects freshwater inflows to, and ultimately salinity levels in estuaries through water usage and withdrawals (reviewed by Montagna et al. 2013). Freshwater inflows and salinity are also affected by natural climate variability as well as longer-term anthropogenic climate change (reviewed by Montagna et al. 2013). Studies in estuaries have noted deleterious effects from long-term declines in freshwater inflows (reviewed by Montagna et al. 2013). To date, there has only been one study, the National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment, to quantify water quality patterns and trends along the entire Texas coast. That study found low or moderate expression of eutrophication symptoms in six bay systems, but did not have enough information to assess three other bays (Bricker et al. 2007). The Texas coast consists of seven major estuaries, each of which has one primary bay and one or more secondary bays. Each system is likely to have a unique water quality signature given the diversity of watershed land usages and relative influence of riverine inputs of pollutants. Given the sharp increases in human populations in Texas' coastal communities, along with climatic changes that are happening regionally and globally, an integrated assessment of water quality conditions in all Texas estuaries is warranted to properly inform management efforts. Here we quantify spatial patterns and long-term trends in the water quality of Texas estuaries. Using results from this analysis, we offer an assessment of drivers of observed water quality changes with a goal of informing future management efforts."}, {"section_title": "Materials & Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sources", "text": "To quantify long-term water quality trends along the Texas coastline, data were obtained from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ's) Surface Water Quality Monitoring (SWQM) program (https://www.tceq.texas.gov/waterquality/monitoring). The SWQM program collects water samples on a quarterly basis from all bay systems on the Texas coast. SWQM sites chosen for spatial analysis had data that was newer than 2011 ( Figure 1), while sites chosen for temporal analysis had active monitoring up to 2016, and also had at least 20 years of data (to 1996 or earlier)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis of long-term trends", "text": "Spatial patterns in water quality were calculated using averages of data collected between 2009 and 2016. A 7-year period was chosen to be consistent with methods employed in TCEQ's semiannual water quality assessments. Spatial analyses were done using the ordinary Kriging method with interpolations generated using an exponential semivariogram model (variable search radius of 6 points), a model popular in hydrological studies (Maidment 1993). Map figures were generated in ArcGIS 10.4. Kendall's \u03c4a regression was used to determine relationships between water quality variables and time (Kendall 1955). Rankings between two censored values were treated as ties, and rankings were treated as a tie between one censored and one uncensored value if no specific ranking could be calculated. The best-fit line for trends were computed using the Akritas-Theil-Sen nonparametric line (Akritas et al. 1995) with the Turnbull estimate for intercept (Turnbull 1976). Significant trends were identified using \u03b1 = 0.05. For analysis of long-term trends in a given season, SWQM data were averaged into respective seasons (Winter = DJF, Spring = MAM, Summer = JJA, Fall = SON).

In many other regions worldwide, this increasing human footprint has led to symptoms of water quality degradation, namely increasing pollutant loads, algal bloom proliferation, and fish kills (Paerl et al. 1998;Cloern 2001;Rabalais et al. 2009). Yet to date, there have been no comprehensive assessments of water quality trends on the Texas coast that could otherwise guide proactive management and/or watershed restoration efforts. In this study, analysis of long-term water quality data indicates regional \"hot spots\" of change in Texas estuaries. Examples of both eutrophication and oligotrophication were found. Increasing salinity was observed in numerous estuaries, while water temperature trends were inconsistent. Decreasing pH (i.e., acidification) was found in numerous estuaries, primarily those where salinity increases were noted. These changes in water quality are occurring in estuaries with a wide range of watershed characteristics, from highly urbanized watersheds with strong river influence (such as Galveston Bay) to sparsely populated watersheds with no major river inputs (such as Baffin Bay). It is rare to have water quality datasets such as those used here that cover multiple decades and the aforementioned range of estuaries and watersheds. Thus, beyond understanding how Texas estuaries are changing from a water quality standpoint, results from this study are informative for understanding the broader watershed and estuary conditions that are susceptible to water quality degradation in estuaries worldwide. Several Texas estuaries with highly urbanized watersheds, specifically Galveston Bay and Oso Bay, currently exhibit symptoms of eutrophication. In Galveston Bay, relatively high nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations were found, and a previous study found that fish kills, primarily from low dissolved oxygen, are pronounced in Galveston Bay compared to other estuaries in Texas (Thronson and Quigg 2008). Galveston Bay has a watershed that is over 62,000 km 2 and includes the major cities of Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. Numerous studies have pointed to urbanization such as this as being a major contributor to the eutrophication of downstream coastal ecosystems (e.g., Peierls et al. 1991;Bowen and Valiela 2001;Rothenberger et al. 2009). One major challenge in the current study was an inability to firmly assess long-term trends in indicators such as chlorophyll in Galveston Bay because of the lack of sampling sites with 20 or more years of data. Efforts should be made to ensure continuity of sampling at strategic sites in the bay to ensure accurate assessment of trends as the watershed continues to urbanize. Another estuary, Oso Bay, also had high nutrients as well as high and increasing chlorophyll. Oso Bay receives wastewater effluent from a number of municipal treatment plants, and previous studies have demonstrated that this effluent is a major driver of eutrophication in the system (Wetz et al. 2016;Wang et al. 2018). It was surprising that the larger Nueces Estuary complex, of which Oso Bay is a tributary, is not displaying similar symptoms of eutrophication given that the city of Corpus Christi (population 325,605 in 2017) lies adjacent to the bay. During the period of 1990 to 2001, the population of Corpus Christi grew from 257,000 to 305,000, resulting in a growing footprint of urbanization on land cover adjacent to the estuary. For example, between 1996 and 2010, the South Corpus Christi Bay watershed experienced a 10% increase in developed lands while the North Corpus Christi Bay watershed experienced a 19% increase in developed land (NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program; https://coast.noaa.gov/ccapatlas/). However, most of the city's municipal wastewater effluent is routed through the Oso complex, which conceivably acts as a filter for the larger bay system. Furthermore, very little riverine input reaches Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays, which would otherwise contribute to nutrient loadings to the bay. In fact, discharge from the Nueces River, the larger river to the system, has decreased dramatically over the past half century due to damming and human water needs (Nueces River and Corpus Christi and Baffin Bays Basin and Bay Expert Science Team 2011). This may explain the decreasing chlorophyll trend observed at one site in lower Nueces Bay and one site in upper Corpus Christi Bay. Effects of this reduction in primary producer biomass on upper trophic levels are unknown, but studies in other systems have documented long-term declines in benthic and/or pelagic consumers as a result of decreasing primary productivity (e.g., Nixon 2003). Along with the symptoms of eutrophication noted in two urbanized Texas estuaries (Galveston Bay, Oso Bay), symptoms were also found in two semi-arid, low inflow estuaries on the South Texas coast. In the Lower Laguna Madre, high nutrients and chlorophyll were observed at one location adjacent to the polluted Arroyo Colorado tributary. The watershed from which the Arroyo Colorado tributary originates has land cover that is dominated by agriculture (48% in 2010; NOAA CCAP, http://coast.noaa.gov/ccapatlas), but also has 25 active permitted wastewater discharge facilities. As a result of the poor water quality conditions in the Arroyo Colorado, a watershed protection plan has been implemented to reduce nutrient inputs to it and the Lower Laguna Madre. Baffin Bay and adjacent Upper Laguna Madre also have high and increasing chlorophyll levels, decreasing BDO levels, and high TKN concentrations, the majority of which is in organic form (Wetz et al. 2017). Episodic hypoxia, dense blooms of the \"brown tide\" harmful alga, Aureoumbra lagunensis, and fish kills have also been noted (reviewed by Wetz et al. 2017). The trend of increasing chlorophyll with decreasing TKN in Baffin Bay seems conflicted, given the importance of nitrogen for phytoplankton growth in the system (e.g., Wetz et al. 2017) and also that any increase in phytoplankton biomass would necessarily show up in the TKN pool. This trend also conflicts with findings from Wetz et al. (2017) and Montagna and Palmer (2012), who found an increasing TKN trend seasonally or annually when using data from additional sources that extended the time-series. Additional monitoring data is needed to assess whether the trend of decreasing TKN remains consistent or is an artifact of this dataset. Regardless, it is clear that Baffin Bay and Upper Laguna Madre are facing water quality challenges related to nutrient pollution, and stakeholder-led efforts are underway to address nutrient sources in the watershed. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few studies reporting on the eutrophication of estuaries like Baffin Bay-Upper Laguna Madre that are found in semi-arid regions and that lack defined river sources. Yet, as our findings show, these systems can still be susceptible to the process of eutrophication and its associated symptoms. Aside from water quality issues related to nutrient pollution, the other major challenge facing Texas coastal ecosystems is a long-term decline in freshwater inflow. This manifests as increasing salinity levels, which was observed in every estuary from the Upper Laguna Madre to Matagorda Bay. When considering changes to freshwater inflow on the Texas coast, it is important to consider that there is strong interannual variability in precipitation that is linked to natural climate variability. Specifically, Tolan (2007) determined that periods of high rainfall on the Texas coast tend to occur during El Ni\u00f1o conditions. For each of the locations where a longterm increase in salinity was observed, we quantified concomitant trends in ENSO index during the same period as when the salinity data was collected to determine if the salinity trend could have been an artifact of natural variability (i.e., more La Ni\u00f1a events leading to less rainfall and higher salinities). The ENSO index only showed a statistically significant trend during the period of record corresponding with the salinity trend for San Antonio Bay (data not shown). However, the ENSO index during that time indicated a trend towards more frequent El Ni\u00f1o conditions, whereas the salinity trend showed increasing salinity, opposite what would be expected based on ENSO-rainfall linkages. Furthermore, in an analysis of monthly precipitation and evaporation data in a similar manner, obtained from the Texas Water Development Board (https://waterdatafortexas.org/lake-evaporation-rainfall ), we found no significant trend in precipitation during the aforementioned timeframes, whereas decreasing evaporation trends were observed during several timeframes (data not shown). Again, the increasing salinity trend is opposite what would be expected with decreasing evaporation rates. Thus, we believe that the increasing salinity trends are likely not due to natural climate variability, but instead are symptomatic of other factors such as growing human water demand in watersheds. Adequate freshwater inflow and salinity levels are vital influences on estuarine ecosystem health (Copeland 1966;Montagna et al. 2013), whereas prolonged increases in salinity above historical conditions can lead to deleterious declines in upper trophic level biomass and changes in diversity (Copeland 1966;Livingston et al. 1997;Palmer and Montagna 2015). In Texas, another artifact of decreasing freshwater inflow levels are changes to the carbonate chemistry system of estuaries. This study found numerous sites along the central Texas coast, often overlapping with sites of increasing salinity, where pH and alkalinity exhibited a long-term decrease. Hu et al. (2015) attributed these declines to reduced export of carbonate minerals from watersheds as a result of reduced freshwater inflow. Although differing in its cause from classic ocean acidification, the consequence for estuarine shell-forming organisms (e.g., oysters) is the same -namely, carbonate-reliant estuarine species may experience increased difficulty with growth and shell formation (reviewed by Gazeau et al. 2013). Unlike coastal systems in other regions of the U.S. and elsewhere, there was no indication of widespread annual water temperature increases in this study. This was based on analysis of a water temperature record that began as early as 1969 in many locations, and in the 1970's at most other sites. On a seasonal basis, trends were inconsistent between and within estuaries, especially from fall-spring. In summer, when a significant trend was found, it was increasing. Overall, water temperature increased at 27% of sampling sites during summer in this study. It is important to note that the data record used in this study, by relying on quarterly data collections, misses other ecologically-relevant aspects of water temperature variability such as trends in nighttime lows, return period of freezes, etc., that can only be captured by higher frequency data. Thus, for more thorough examination of water temperature trends, it is clearly more appropriate to use datasets that have much higher frequency temporal coverage (such as those in the National Climatic Data Center)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Analysis of historical data on key water quality variables has identified localized areas of concern amongst Texas estuaries. For example, multiple indicators suggest that Baffin Bay and adjacent Upper Laguna Madre are undergoing eutrophication. These systems only receive freshwater input via episodic rainfall and flow from ephemeral streams, and thus would not conform to traditional views of eutrophication that tend to focus on river-influenced systems. But because of their long residence time, these systems can be especially susceptible to nutrient pollution and its associated symptoms (Bricker et al. 2008). The urbanized estuaries, Oso Bay and Galveston Bay, also display symptoms of eutrophication. Another major water quality concern is a long-term increase in the salinity of mid-coast estuaries from Upper Laguna Madre to Matagorda Bay. This is largely an artifact of increasing human freshwater demands in the watersheds of these estuaries, and has important implications for estuarine organisms that are sensitive to high salinities. With the findings from this study, targeted studies can now be directed at the estuaries that are experiencing water quality degradation in order to guide future management efforts.
