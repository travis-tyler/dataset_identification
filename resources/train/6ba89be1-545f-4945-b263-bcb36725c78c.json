The June Area Survey (JAS) is an annual survey that provides information on U.S. crops, livestock, grain storage capacity, and type and size of farms. The JAS sample is comprised of designated land areas (segments). A typical segment is about one square mile --equivalent to 640 acres. Field enumerators visit these segments and collect data on all agricultural activity occurring within the segment boundaries. Each segment is outlined on an aerial photo and provided to the field enumerator. A separate questionnaire is completed for each agricultural operation operating any land in the segment."}, {"section_title": "Problem: June Area Survey Deteriorating Response Rates", "text": "Over time, the JAS' response rate has been gradually decreasing by about a half of a percentage point a year. In 2000, the response rate was 86.5 percent. By 2007, the response rate had dropped to 81.7 percent. If this trend continues, the JAS' response rate will eventually fall below 80 percent within three to four years. Once below 80 percent, a nonresponse bias study will be required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This research will provide NASS with greater insight for addressing and thus minimizing nonresponse. The three types of nonresponse discussed in the study include: 1) refusals, 2) inaccessibles, and 3) incompletes. Refusals are operators contacted for data collection, who were not willing to respond or participate in the survey. Inaccessibles occur when field enumerators are unable to contact or reach the operators for data collection. A questionnaire is considered \"incomplete\" if at least one of the questions is not answered. Overall, survey nonresponse negatively impacts data estimates, increases survey costs and data collection time, and significantly complicates the data editing and summarizing processes. Nonresponse also increases the potential for bias which can not be easily assessed or explained/identified."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "Past nonresponse research has focused on other surveys; most notably the 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase III (Gerling, Tran, Earp 2008). However, this is the first formal nonresponse study on the JAS. The study's goal is to gain insight into the most common reasons for nonresponse occurring in the 2007 JAS.

"}, {"section_title": "REASONS FOR REFUSALS", "text": "A refusal occurs when an operator declines to participate in the survey. In this case, the field enumerator records the reason for the refusal, determines which nonresponse reason best matches the situation from the supplemental handout, and finally codes the questionnaire appropriately. The findings are displayed in Table 3. The data (five states combined) revealed that \"Refused but no reason given.\" occurred 27.6 percent of the time on 121 reports. There were 146 reports for which the field enumerators failed to record a nonresponse code in the office use box. These 146 reports were not counted in the analysis. The authors recommend that field offices reemphasize to the field enumerators the importance of collecting nonresponse data, so that NASS can better understand the rationale of the growing refusal population. Of those questionnaires marked as refusal and having valid nonresponse codes, the top three reasons for refusal were: 1.) \"Would not take time/ too busy,\" 2.) \"Contact attempted, but respondent refuses on all surveys, and refused this one,\" and 3.) \"The respondent feels that surveys and reports hurt the farmer more than help.\" Overall, with the exception of Washington, the results did not vary across states. The second highest ranked reason for refusal, \"Would not take time / too busy,\" occurred on only 2 percent of the Washington reports compared with 9 to 29 percent in the other states. Also, the third highest ranked reason for refusal, \"Contact attempted, but respondent refuses on all surveys,\" occurred 26.4 percent of the time in Washington, but only between 5 and 17 percent in the other states. (See Appendix B for individual state specific tables.)       1/ Missing means field enumerator failed to record the reason for the refusal. 2/ Percent total excludes those missing a reason for the nonresponse. Also percent total may be less than or greater than 100% due to rounding. In 1990 and 1991, NASS examined reasons for nonresponse occurring on the Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase III (ARMS III), (O'Connor 1991(O'Connor & 1992. ARMS III aims to understand the financial welfare of the farming industry by asking detailed questions regarding farming expenses and income. Although the JAS and ARMS III surveys differ in several ways (questionnaire, focus, and sampling scheme), a comparison of reasons for refusal across studies was conducted. Table 4 displays the 2007 JAS' top five refusal reasons in rank order, according to the past ARMS III studies. A comparison of nonresponse reasons reported in JAS versus ARMS III shows similar ranking of refusal reasons, thus implying that the primary reasons are consistent with those from the previous studies. However, without further research, including multiple states over several years, such conclusions can not be validated. "}, {"section_title": "REASONS FOR INACCESSIBLES", "text": "A questionnaire is recorded as inaccessible if the field enumerator was unable to contact the operator. For inaccessibles, the field enumerators were instructed to code the nonresponse reason on the questionnaires. The findings are displayed in Table 5. There were 155 reports recorded as inaccessible for which the field enumerator failed to record a reason. These reports were removed from the analysis. An additional 93 reports were cited as \"Inaccessible but no reason provided.\" In the case of refusals, \"no reason\" is valid, but for inaccessibles it is not. This signifies that the field enumerators failed to record the required nonresponse information. Therefore, the authors recommend that field office staff emphasize the importance of collecting and recording reasons for inaccessibility. The top five reasons for questionnaires being coded as \"inaccessible\" are displayed in Table 5. The number one reason for this coding was, \"Tried several times; could not reach anyone for an appointment\". A disturbing discovery is that in 11 instances questionnaires were coded inaccessible because the field enumerator's heavy workload precluded contacting these operators. Unlike other nonresponse reasons, this is an area that NASS can prevent by managing workloads more efficiently and by maintaining better communication with field enumerators. Therefore, the authors recommend expanding the exploration of nonresponse to all states, because the cost is trivial and the benefit of reducing nonresponse is high.

Also percent total may be less than or greater than 100% due to rounding Table 6 compares the 2007 JAS study's top  five reasons for recording a questionnaire as  an inaccessible with those from past ARMS  III studies. Unlike refusals, the rankings varied across studies. In the 1990 ARMS III study, the main reason for inaccessibility was \"The operator is away on extended vacation.\" This was ranked tenth in the JAS study. Differences in reported reasons for nonresponse suggest that there may be something unique to JAS (questionnaire, sampling scheme, time, publicity, etc\u2026) creating these differences between studies. Also, the time differences between when the ARMS studies were conducted in the early 90's and the JAS study was carried out in 2007 may also be a factor. Further research is thus required to determine the reason for the variability in nonresponse across these surveys. Tried several times; could not reach anyone for an appointment.
