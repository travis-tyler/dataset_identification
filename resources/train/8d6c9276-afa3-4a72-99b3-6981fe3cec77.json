[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coastal communities across the nation are faced with the challenge of how to adapt to coastal inundation associated with climate change and sea level rise. As part of the National Sea Grant Coastal Communities Climate Adaptation Initiative (CCCAI), the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium (NJSGC) and its partners, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Office of Coastal Management (NJOCM), Monmouth University Urban Coast Institute (UCI) and Stevens Institute of Technology, conducted community-based, climate adaptation demonstration projects in Cape May Point, Little Silver and Oceanport, New Jersey. The objective of these projects was to provide the participating communities with an assessment of their vulnerabilities to help local decision-makers identify opportunities to improve their resiliency to coastal hazards and sea level rise. In order to accomplish this goal, virtual mapping was used to illustrate the potential scenarios for coastal inundation along with facilitated questionnaires that evaluated the communities' existing planning strategies. The findings from these tools were presented to the communities and are summarized in this report."}, {"section_title": "Background of the Problem", "text": "The scientific community has arrived at a strong consensus that global climate change is occurring and resulting in changes to shoreline dynamics 1 . Climate change threatens to accelerate sea level rise and increase the frequency and intensity of coastal storms. As a result, citizens, development, and ecosystems will become more vulnerable to the impacts of coastal hazards, making it imperative to identify areas where special needs communities, vital public facilities and roads, and sensitive natural resources overlap areas of potential inundation. These issues need to be considered as New Jersey's coastal communities plan to become more resilient. New Jersey is truly a coastal state with 127 miles of Atlantic coastline and 1,792 miles of tidal shoreline, including Delaware Bay. Seventeen of twenty-one counties in New Jersey border tidally-influenced estuarine or oceanic waters. Nearly 9 million people live within these coastal counties, and these numbers increase dramatically during the summer months as people vacation along the shore. New Jersey's economy is highly dependent upon its marine and coastal resources, which annually generate nearly $65.5 billion, with $39 billion generated through ports commerce (Genevieve Boehm-Clifton, NJDOT, personal communication, December 15, 2010), $22 billion through coastal tourism 2 and $4.5 billion through recreational and commercial fisheries and aquaculture. 3 Historically, sea levels have risen approximately 0.4 meters (1.3 feet) in New Jersey since the early 20 th Century 4 . While such an increase appears to be minimal, low-lying areas are becoming more susceptible to shallow coastal flooding and coastal erosion. Coastal communities need to improve efforts to adapt to climate change but face hindrances such as political will, resource scarcity, personnel availability or other institutional variables. To take action, resources, tools and science-based information are needed to adequately plan for and address imminent impacts, to make informed decisions to become resilient, and to collaborate for multi-disciplinary planning. Local decision-makers often have the greatest capacity to influence the resiliency of their community as they already address coastal flooding issues and protect the health, safety and welfare of their constituents."}, {"section_title": "Project Scope", "text": "NJSGC piloted two innovative tools developed by the NJOCM: Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol (CCVAP) and Getting to Resilience to perform the virtual mapping and questionnaire. Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol (CCVAP) is a GIS-based methodology to assist land use planners, hazard mitigation planners, emergency managers, and other local decision-makers in the identification of their community's vulnerability through virtual mapping. By applying the methods defined in CCVAP to the pilot communities, areas were identified where built infrastructure, sensitive natural resources, and special needs populations overlapped areas of potential inundation. This vulnerability mapping supports community efforts to make the connection between the potential consequences of sea level rise and inundation to their vulnerability -ultimately to guide the community for resilience planning. Getting to Resilience is a questionnaire developed as a non-regulatory tool to help coastal communities build capacity for resilience to coastal hazards and sea level rise. The application of the survey was intended to highlight positive actions already underway within the pilot communities and to identify opportunities to improve local resilience through planning, public outreach, mitigation, and response mechanisms.

Improvements in elevation data and the development of tools like VDatum, which allows GIS users to identify tidal elevations, have greatly improved the ability to identify areas of potential inundation under various storm scenarios. It can also be used to identify potential sea level inundation scenarios, which can inform communities about how their vulnerability to flooding may change over the course of the next century. The image above demonstrates how elevation data has improved due to the use of LiDAR technology. Monmouth University Urban Coast Institute and Stevens Institute of Technology have previously worked with two of the pilot communities, Little Silver and Oceanport, to install tide gauges on the Shrewsbury River and to identify impacts related to coastal flooding. The newly developed Shrewsbury Early Flood Warning System is being used to provide flood height information to constituents and emergency managers so that they may respond more quickly to the threat of coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "Community Descriptions", "text": "Although fourth smallest in area, New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country. It is also located within the New York-New Jersey Metropolitan area, one of the most highly urbanized and industrialized regions in the nation. The health and management of New Jersey's coastal waters is coupled tightly to these demographics. However, there is a strong north-south gradient from the urban north to the rural and agricultural south with coastal towns that support the thriving tourism industry. Because the character of coastal communities varies throughout the state, the NJSGC and its partners identified the opportunity to assess the hazard vulnerability and resiliency of coastal communities with differing environmental, social, and infrastructure composition. The boroughs of Cape May Point, Little Silver, and Oceanport were selected to participate in the NJSGC's Coastal Community Climate Adaptation Initiative due to their willingness and history of dealing with similar challenges."}, {"section_title": "Cape May Point", "text": "The Borough of Cape May Point is located at the most southerly end of the Cape May peninsula where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. This small, residential resort community and its surrounding areas have proven to be vulnerable to coastal erosion, storms, and saltwater intrusion. The community has taken multiple strides to reduce the impacts of these hazards through beach replenishment, the placement of offshore breakwaters, and the installation of a stormwater pumping system. The community has also worked to protect habitat and vegetation through a local landscape ordinance that reduces stormwater runoff. Because the community is governed by a three-person commission, all of which lead efforts that influence community resiliency, it proved to be difficult to meet in an informal setting. Municipal representatives from the community's environmental commission, emergency management, and planning board informally participated in the pilot study to learn more about their vulnerability to coastal hazards."}, {"section_title": "Little Silver and Oceanport", "text": "The Boroughs of Little Silver and Oceanport are located along the Shrewsbury River, which is a tidal watercourse in the northern portion of Monmouth County that is fed by the Raritan Bay. Both of these communities are nearly built out and are mainly residential with a smattering of commercial uses. Fort Monmouth is located in the middle of these adjoining communities and is slated for redevelopment after the base closes, presenting an opportunity for planning for hazard resiliency. These communities are most susceptible to coastal storms and riverine flooding, which is most prevalent during nor'easters when water levels can remain elevated for days at a time, preventing water from draining. In order to protect the lives and property of local residents, these municipalities have participated in the coordination efforts to install the Shrewsbury River Flood Warning System (SRFWS). While these communities have taken proactive steps to reduce their vulnerability to flooding, local and county decision-makers were eager to participate in NJSGC's pilot study.

Through this project, the NJSGC piloted two innovative tools developed by the NJOCM to further the state's knowledge of coastal hazard vulnerability. These tools include the Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol (CCVAP) and the Getting to Resilience questionnaire, both of which were developed through the NOAA Coastal Zone Management Section 309 enhancement grant. CCVAP is a GIS-based vulnerability assessment methodology developed to help local governments understand their community's vulnerability under present and future inundation scenarios. While CCVAP provides communities with a visualization of local vulnerabilities to inundation, the Getting to Resilience questionnaire was developed to help local governments validate existing hazard planning efforts and identify opportunities to incorporate adaptation strategies into local planning, public outreach, disaster preparedness, and mitigation efforts. Through the combined application of the mapping visualization and the Getting to Resilience questionnaire, the NJSGC and its partners intended to provide the pilot communities with a strong knowledge base in coastal hazard and climate change vulnerability, building the case for local governments to take proactive steps to improve their disaster and climate resilience. While the NJSGC applied the NJOCM's tools to just a few pilot communities in New Jersey, the experience and knowledge gained through the application of these tools will assist in their refinement prior to their widespread application throughout the state's coastal zone. As these tools continue to be applied, coastal municipalities will obtain the knowledge to move beyond traditional planning and mitigation practices to improve local hazard and climate change resilience."}, {"section_title": "Outreach Phases", "text": "The NJSGC and its partners met with local decision-makers and knowledgeable volunteers in a focus group setting for a series of four meetings throughout the project. Each meeting was intended to broaden participants' understanding of their community's vulnerability to coastal inundation and to initiate a dialogue about disaster avoidance, resilience, and adaptation. The timing of the municipal outreach meetings coincided with the completion of the research phases of the project. Meeting 1: The project team met with municipal representatives to introduce the purpose, goals, and objectives of the Coastal Community Adaptation Initiative, along with the role of the project partners and the participating municipality. Meeting 2: A series of maps developed by the NJOCM to identify high hazard areas under present and future inundation scenarios were presented to the pilot communities. The maps not only represented current inundation threats of spring tides and hurricanes, they revealed how projected sea level rise scenarios may augment the inundation extent of future spring tides and hurricanes. By incorporating the inundation scenarios into a series of coastal vulnerability indexes, along with other natural variables, the NJOCM modeled how high hazard areas may increase and move inland over the next century. These maps were shared with community leaders to help them target future mitigation, public outreach, disaster preparedness, planning, and zoning opportunities. Meeting 3: The project team facilitated Getting to Resilience to a group of local representatives, typically consisting of an emergency manager, planner, and environmental commission member. The application of the Getting to Resilience questionnaire involved a thorough evaluation of existing plans, public engagement, disaster preparedness, and mitigation projects in regards to coastal hazards and sea level rise. By bringing community and county leaders to the table, the participants were able to discuss current limitations and future opportunities to improve hazard resilience. Meeting 4: The final meetings with the pilot communities summarized the project team's findings, which were revealed through the application of the CCVAP methodology and the Getting to Resilience questionnaire. During the final meetings, the project team identified priority actions that the pilot communities may want to consider implementing in order to reduce their vulnerability to coastal storms and to prepare for the onset effects of sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Mapping", "text": "Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol (CCVAP) is a GIS-based methodology to assist land use planners, hazard mitigation planners, emergency managers, and other local decision-makers in the identification of their community's vulnerability to coastal hazards and sea level rise. Based off of a number of existing risk and vulnerability assessment methodologies, 5 CCVAP defines the necessary steps to classify vulnerable land areas under present and future inundation scenarios. The vulnerability mapping was an iterative process that required the development of multiple inundation scenarios. Through the use of 2-3 meter resolution Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) elevation data and NOAA's Vertical Datum Transformation Tool (VDatum), 6 the NJOCM developed geospatial models representing the extent of mean higher high water (MHHW), storm surge, and sea level rise inundation for each pilot community. The inundation scenarios were then fed into a coastal vulnerability index (CVI), which is a composite raster overlay model that defines high hazard areas under present and future conditions using six geospatial inputs, including storm surge inundation scenarios, low slopes, flood prone areas, poorly drained soils, erosion prone areas, and geomorphology.

By applying the methods defined in CCVAP to the boroughs of Cape May Point, Little Silver, and Oceanport, it was possible to identify where built infrastructure, sensitive natural resources, and special needs populations intersect areas of potential storm surge and sea level rise inundation. The NJOCM then mapped the built and natural features in and around areas of potential inundation. To obtain a better understanding of the portions of the community that may need assistance in the event of a coastal storm, the NJOCM developed a social vulnerability index 7 using socio-economic data available through the Census. Community representatives assisted the NJSGC and its partners in the identification of these vulnerabilities by identifying the built and natural environmental features and social characteristics that pertain to their community."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2: Vulnerability Mapping Considerations Checklist", "text": "The pilot communities utilized this checklist to inform the NJOCM of vulnerabilities they were interested in having assessed within their community.

The questionnaire was prepared by compiling the efforts of many academics, international and federal agencies, and planning practitioners in regards to land use plan development and design, hazard mitigation and planning, and coastal resilience. Getting to Resilience incorporates many of the key components of existing local government evaluation tools into a brief and easy to facilitate questionnaire. The questionnaire is divided into five sections: (1) Risk and Vulnerability Assessments, (2) Public Engagement, (3) Planning Integration, (4) Disaster Preparedness and Recovery, and (5) Hazard Mitigation Implementation. It highlights the importance of local plan integration and stresses the need for consistency among municipal building codes, ordinances, and zoning. The questionnaire also identifies the importance of linking localized risk and vulnerability assessments to land use planning, public expenditures, mitigation, and disaster preparedness and response because the responsibilities of limiting hazard exposure and reducing vulnerability to coastal hazards are dispersed among many local departments and offices. The following types of professionals were requested to be involved in the piloting of the tool on the municipal level: In each pilot community, the questionnaire was facilitated in a focus group setting to initiate a dialogue among local decision-makers about coastal hazards, vulnerability, and community resilience. The application of the tool was intended to highlight positive actions already underway within the pilot communities and to identify opportunities to improve local resilience through existing planning, public outreach, mitigation, and response mechanisms. Over the course of approximately two hours, community leaders completed the portions of the questionnaire in which they were most familiar. The application of Getting to Resilience not only acted as a forum for discussing ways to improve resilience, it also gave NJSGC and its partners insight on ways that they could provide technical and educational assistance to coastal communities. The NJOCM intends to use its experience in piloting Getting to Resilience to improve the tool so that it may be applied ubiquitously throughout coastal communities in New Jersey.  Cape May Point's precarious position along the New Jersey shore makes it subject to beach erosion, coastal storms, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater resources. Since the majority of Cape May Point lies within the 100-year floodplain and most residential development sits 10 feet or below in elevation (in relationship to mean sea level), a Category 1 hurricane is a significant threat to the community. Historically, Cape May Point has experienced the impacts of hurricanes, tropical storms, and nor'easters. These episodic storm events, in addition to daily coastal processes, have resulted in extensive shoreline change. Shoreline erosion and the impacts of the 1944 hurricane and 1950 nor'easter washed away the former neighboring community of South Cape May. Periodically, bricks wash up on the beaches of Cape May Point, a reminder of nature's volatility. Cape May County has been identified as the 6 th most difficult county to evacuate in the country. 13 Cape May Point's location, low-lying topography, and soil composition make it highly vulnerable to coastal storms when compared to other portions of the New Jersey shore. Recognizing the threat of coastal erosion, storms, flooding, and even saltwater intrusion, Cape May Point has taken steps to reduce their vulnerability to these hazards. Despite municipal, state, and federal efforts to reduce Cape May Point's vulnerability, climate change and sea level rise threaten to exacerbate the existing threat of coastal hazards.  Cape May Point has experienced approximately 4 mm/year of sea level rise since 1965. If this trend were extrapolated without the consideration of glacial and ice sheet melting, Cape May Point would experience approximately 0.4 meters (16 inches) of sea level rise over the next century. Unfortunately, sea level rise projections incorporating global climate trends indicate the Delaware Estuary will experience approximately 0.5 -1.5 meters (20 -60 inches) or greater of sea level rise by 2100. 14 As climate change alters the natural processes of the New Jersey shore, Cape May Point will likely experience increased rates of erosion and saltwater intrusion, more frequent flooding, and changes in and loss of critical habitat, and changes in the frequency and intensity of coastal storms. In order to obtain a better understanding of the vulnerabilities that presently threaten Cape May Point, the Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol and the Getting to Resilience questionnaire were piloted in the community. By working with municipal leaders and volunteers, the project team was able to assess the existing vulnerabilities within the community and identify how high hazard areas may shift inland over time due to sea level rise. The partners used this information to validate the hazard planning that the community has already begun to implement and to identify opportunities to incorporate mitigation and adaptation strategies into broader community planning to ensure the long-term resilience of Cape May Point."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Assessment", "text": "The New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium piloted NJOCM's Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol in Cape May Point as part of the demonstration project. The application of CCVAP not only validated the risk and vulnerability protocol, it allowed the partners to identify infrastructure, natural resources, and vulnerable populations that may be exposed to storm surge inundation and sea level rise. The application of the protocol also informed the partners of the local government's data and technical needs regarding coastal hazards and sea level rise.  \nThe New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium piloted the NJOCM's Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol in Little Silver as part of the demonstration project. The application of CCVAP not only validated the risk and vulnerability protocol, it allowed the partners to identify infrastructure, natural resources, and vulnerable populations that may be exposed to storm surge inundation and sea level rise. The application of the protocol also informed the partners of the local government's data and technical needs regarding coastal hazards and sea level rise. By applying CCVAP, the New Jersey Office of Coastal Management developed multiple inundation scenarios, including mean higher high water, storm surge, and sea level rise models. Newly available three-meter resolution, digital elevation models (DEMs) 31 derived from LiDAR technology enhanced the identification of inundation prone areas, helping to improve the accuracy of storm surge maps and identify the inundation threat of sea level rise. Storm surge was modeled using the National Hurricane Center's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from  Hurricanes (SLOSH) 32 at mean higher high water to identify potential inundation at a high tide. Because NOAA's Vertical Datum Transformation Tool (VDatum) 33 does not presently extend to the Shrewsbury River, the elevation of mean higher high water was determined by extrapolating tide data from available gauges along the Shrewsbury and Navesink Rivers. 34 While mean higher high water was modeled using the best available information, the tidal heights are likely an underestimation of mean higher high water along the Shrewsbury River, resulting in an underestimation of potential storm surge and sea level rise extents and depths. Lack of tidal data also inhibited the ability to map the potential extent of spring tide inundation under present and future scenarios. As tide data becomes available for the newly installed gauges along the Shrewsbury River, it should be used to improve the accuracy of storm surge and sea level rise models. The tide gauge data may also be used to predict the inundation of future flood events under various rainfall and tidal scenarios, thus providing information that can be used to reduce the threat to human life and property. The mapping indicated that Little Silver is susceptible to storm surge inundation, which varies throughout the community depending upon topography and the direction and strength of an approaching hurricane. A Category 1 storm has the potential to flood nearly 12 percent of the parcels within the community, which all are residential properties.  Figure 8: Elevation Data Improvements storm could impact approximately 17 percent of the community, exacerbating storm damage with greater storm surge heights. Under both a Category 1 and Category 2 storm, flooding will likely follow the natural features of the community, impacting tidal wetlands and overflowing tidal creeks into low-lying areas. Residential properties along the peninsular portions of the community and Parker's Creek are the most vulnerable to storm surge inundation. Hurricanes with different directional paths, strength, and size will have different flood impacts on the community. A Category 1 or 2 hurricane tracking up the Delaware Bay will have the greatest flooding effect on the community when compared to a similar strength storm traveling towards Atlantic City or New York Harbor. A Category 1 and some Category 2 storms could have a similar flood pattern as seen during a major nor'easter. Under some Category 2 scenarios, Monmouth Beach and Seaside Beach will be overwashed, resulting in a much greater surge along the Shrewsbury River. Category 3 and 4 hurricanes are highly likely to result in beach overwash, causing extensive storm surge impacts in Little Silver. Unlike the Category 1 and 2 storms, a Category 3 or 4 hurricane tracking into New York Harbor will cause the greatest surge heights and flood extents within the community. A Category 4 hurricane could flood nearly 50 percent of the municipality's parcels, and storm surges heights could reach 18 feet in the lowest lying areas of the community. Table 4 identifies the greatest storm surge heights for any hurricane approaching the community at high tide. 35 While the storm surge maps were developed using the best available surge and tidal information, the accuracy of the extent and flood depths is limited by the lack of tide elevation data throughout the Shrewsbury River and its tidal creeks limits. Additionally, the National Hurricane Center's SLOSH models do not account for wave action, upland rainfall, or tides that are unable to ebb due to slow moving storms; therefore, Map 10 and Table 4 are likely an underestimation of the worst case flood scenarios in the community.  \nThe New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium piloted the NJOCM's Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol in Oceanport as part of the demonstration project.

Residential properties along tidal creeks and historically filled land areas are the most vulnerable to storm surge inundation. The western portion of Monmouth Boulevard and the northern portion of Port au Peck Avenue, which are located on historically filled lands, are inclined to serve as conduits for floodwaters to encroach further inland. Hurricanes with different directional paths, strength, and size will have different flood impacts on the community. While lower grade storms have less strength, high winds will likely inhibit the typical ebb of tidal waters, forcing a similar flood pattern as seen during a major nor'easter. A Category 1 or 2 hurricane tracking up the Delaware Bay will have the greatest flooding effect on the community when compared to a storm traveling towards Atlantic City or New York Harbor. Some Category 2 storms and all Category 3 and 4 storms will overwash Monmouth Beach and Seaside Beach, resulting in a much greater surge along the Shrewsbury River. A Category 4 hurricane could flood over 80 percent of the parcels within the community, and storm surges heights could reach nearly 20 feet in the lowest lying areas of the community.

Table 7 identifies the greatest storm surge heights for any hurricane approaching the community at high tide. 49 While the storm surge maps were developed using the best available surge and tidal information, the accuracy of the extent and flood depths is limited by the lack of tide elevation data throughout the Shrewsbury River and its tidal creeks limits. Additionally, the National Hurricane Center's SLOSH models do not account for wave action, upland rainfall, or tides that are unable to ebb due to slow moving storms; therefore, Table 7 and Map 17 are likely an underestimation of the worst case flood scenarios in the community.

Many of these structures date back to the late 1800s and early 1900s and were not built to withstand a major flooding event. Luckily, Cape May Point has never been directly hit by a hurricane, even though it has experienced the flooding due to nor'easters and large snowfalls. Unfortunately, the majority of the community is susceptible to storm surge inundation of a Category 1 hurricane, and the entire community will likely be submerged under a Category 2 storm. The destruction resulting from a hurricane or major nor'easter could have an immense impact on the community. Failing to install flood vents, elevate low-lying homes, and install proper window protection could threaten historically significant structures, community character, and public safety. Knowing this, existing and new development should be retrofitted or designed to withstand hurricane wind and flood impacts; otherwise, homeowners should be prepared to rebuild or relocate when a major storm impacts Cape May Point. Unquestionably, residents should always evacuate when a hurricane is approaching the Cape May peninsula.  These collaborative efforts will help reduce the rate at which these resources change or are lost, but will require continuous efforts to maintain the condition of the habitat. Significant storms threaten to disrupt, alter, or destroy existing habitats through erosion, saltwater intrusion, and high winds.

The community consists mainly of married retirees with no children. Residents are well-educated and have a moderate to high income. The most vulnerable populations within the community include elderly and disabled residents. In the event of a coastal storm, all residents will be equally exposed to the impacts of flooding and should evacuate. In order to identify the location of the most susceptible people to coastal storms and to identify the areas of the community to focus evacuation assistance, the New Jersey Office of Coastal Management developed a social vulnerability index for Cape May Point. Many of the socio-economic data inputs were only available at the Census Block Group level, and the community's low year-round residential population qualified it for only one Census Block Group, limiting the ability to discern where the most vulnerable populations in the community reside. Additionally, the Census does not account for seasonal populations, which are perhaps the most vulnerable residents because they are not aware of their geographic vulnerability, nor are they likely aware of the proper measures to evacuate if a storm threatens the New Jersey shore. By applying the social vulnerability index in a small, vacation community, it was determined that the social vulnerability index does not adequately define the location of the most vulnerable residents in relationship to storm hazards at this scale. Municipal leaders and emergency managers have a greater capability to identify the individuals that may need evacuation or recovery assistance in the event of a storm.\nAs of the 2000 Census, approximately 6,200 people resided in Little Silver Borough. Residents are well-educated and have a moderate to high income. The distribution of senior citizens, disabled, and non-English speaking households are lower than national averages. Owneroccupancy exceeds 94 percent of the total housing units, indicating an economically stable community. Compared to the rest of Monmouth County and the State of New Jersey, Little Silver has low social vulnerability to coastal storms. Despite this, local government officials and emergency managers may be interested in utilizing a Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to identify where to focus preparedness, evacuation, and recovery assistance. Through the pilot of the SoVI, the New Jersey Office of Coastal Management identified that the least socio-economically vulnerable populations are located in the most surge prone areas of the community. While this is a positive reflection upon the community's resilience, the application of the methodology revealed that there are limitations in the spatial accuracy of the SoVI. Many of the socio-economic data inputs were only available at the Census Block Group level, of which, Little Silver is only divided into four of these designations. The lack of refined geospatial Census data for this size community limits the ability to adequately discern the location of the most vulnerable populations. The New Jersey Register Ready Program or a local special needs registry may be more effective to identify where to focus preparedness, evacuation, or recovery assistance.\nAs of the 2000 Census, approximately 5,800 people resided in Oceanport. Residents are welleducated and owner-occupancy exceeds 85 percent of the housing stock, indicating an economically stable community. While age distributions reflect national averages, the percentage of non-English speaking households, disabled, and poor are lower than national averages. In all, Oceanport has relatively low social vulnerability when compared to the rest of Monmouth County and the State of New Jersey. Despite this, local government officials and emergency managers may be interested in utilizing a Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to identify where to focus preparedness, evacuation, and recovery assistance. Through the pilot of the SoVI, the New Jersey Office of Coastal Management identified that the most surge prone areas were void of socio-economically vulnerable populations with the exception of an area to the East of the Community Center and another area surrounding Oceanport Gardens and The Jockey Club. While the general lack of social vulnerability is a positive reflection upon the community's resilience, the application of the methodology revealed that Census data for this size community may limit the ability to adequately determine the location of the most vulnerable populations.

While these factors contribute to the vulnerability of coastal lands, other geospatial factors can be incorporated into a coastal vulnerability index. By combining the available data sets, the CVI revealed that the most hazard prone areas in and around Cape May Point include the freshwater wetlands within Cape May Meadows and the beaches surrounding the community. These vulnerable areas correspond with the National Flood Insurance Program's designated V-zones and lands within the Coastal Barrier Resource System, both of which are the most risk prone areas within the NFIP."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise Vulnerability", "text": "Sea level rise is a highly likely threat to Cape May Point over the next century. Historically, Cape May and the surrounding areas have experienced approximately 4 mm/year of sea level rise since 1965. While 4 mm/year appears to be insignificant, if this trend were extrapolated into the future, the peninsula of Cape May will experience 0.4 meters (16 inches) of sea level rise by 2100 19 . Unfortunately, sea level rise in the Delaware Estuary is anticipated to increase 0.5 -1.5 meters (20 -60 inches) or greater by 2100 due to glacial and ice sheet melting 20 . Even under a low scenario, over a third of the properties in Cape May Point will be susceptible to flooding during a spring tide and Sunset Boulevard will be permanently inundated. If sea levels increase by 1.0 meter, the extent of flooding during a spring tide will reflect the extent of inundation during a present day, Category 1 hurricane. And under a 1.5 meter sea level rise scenario, nearly all of the properties in the community will be inundated during a spring tide. The map on the following page reveals the extent of future spring tides, highlighting the threat to Cape May Point over the next century. Residential development and coastal habitats will be the first land areas impacted by sea level rise and the future extent of spring tides. By adding sea level rise into the storm surge scenarios of the coastal vulnerability index, Map 9 indicates how high hazard areas may increase in size and shift inland over time. The beachfront and adjacent freshwater wetlands appear to be very highly vulnerable to coastal hazards, while the majority of Cape May Point becomes highly vulnerable over time. Understanding how the coastal landscape may change due to sea level rise can inform future development and hazard mitigation decisions. \nOver the next century and beyond, sea level rise will threaten natural resources and properties of the Borough of Little Silver. Historically, Sandy Hook and surrounding areas have experienced approximately 4 mm/year of sea level rise since the early 1900s. While 4 mm/year appears to be insignificant, if this trend were extrapolated into the future, Little Silver could expect a minimum vertical inundation of 0.4 meters (16 inches) of sea level rise by 2100. Unfortunately, sea level rise in the Mid-Atlantic is anticipated to exceed this historic trend, increasing 0.5 -1.5 meters (20 -60 inches) or greater by 2100 due to glacial and ice sheet melting. Even under a low scenario, approximately 250 parcels in Little Silver would experience some permanent inundation, let alone the potential inundation of future spring tides. A mid-range sea level rise scenario reflects the inundation of a present day Category 1 hurricane, while a 1.5 meter sea level rise scenario would inundate a portion of approximately 16 percent of the parcels in the community. Map 15 reveals the extent of likely sea level rise inundation in Little Silver over the next century. Coastal habitats and low-lying residential development on the peninsulas will be the first land areas impacted by sea level rise and the future extent of spring tides. Seven Bridges Road and its connection into Oceanport will be threatened by rising waters. Fortunately, properties west of Winding Way will be less likely to experience the impacts of sea level rise, except during a major storm event. Luckily, the majority of Little Silver west of these areas will not be vulnerable to permanent inundation over the next century. Understanding how the coastal landscape may change due to sea level rise can inform future development and hazard mitigation decisions. By incorporating sea level rise into the storm surge scenarios of the coastal vulnerability index, Map 16 indicates how high hazard areas may increase in size and shift inland over time. While areas presently prone to flooding are highlighted as being highly vulnerable, an additional area south of Silverside Avenue and east of Seven Bridges Road will become more susceptible to flooding, storm surge inundation, and sea level rise over the next century. \nOver the next century and beyond, sea level rise will threaten natural resources and properties of the Borough of Oceanport. Historically, Sandy Hook and surrounding areas have experienced approximately 4 mm/year of sea level rise since the early 1900s. While 4 mm/year appears to be insignificant, if this trend were extrapolated into the future, Oceanport could expect a minimum vertical inundation of 0.4 meters (16 inches) of sea level rise by 2100. Unfortunately, sea level rise in the Mid-Atlantic is anticipated to exceed this historic trend, increasing 0.5 -1.5 meters (20 -60 inches) or greater by 2100 due to glacial and ice sheet melting. Without the consideration of future spring tides, 0.5 meters of sea level rise could inundate portions of approximately 370 parcels in Oceanport. A mid-range scenario could flood nearly a quarter of the community's parcels, while a 1.5 meter sea level rise scenario would be reflective of the inundation of a Category 2 hurricane. Map 22 reveals the likely extent of sea level rise inundation in Oceanport over the next century. Riverine and low-lying residential development will experience the impacts of sea level rise first. Gooseneck Point will be entirely lost to sea level rise, and Gooseneck Bridge into Little Silver will be threatened by rising waters. Additionally, the southern portion of Fort Monmouth along Oceanport Creek will likely be permanently inundated. Luckily, the redevelopment of Fort Monmouth provides Oceanport with an opportunity to develop in consideration of the coastal hazards that threaten the resilience of the community. Understanding how the coastal landscape may change due to sea level rise can inform future development and hazard mitigation decisions. By incorporating sea level rise into the storm surge scenarios of the coastal vulnerability index, Map 23 indicates how high hazard areas will increase in size and shift inland over time.

The commissioners and community leaders are dedicated to taking proactive measures to protect the people and properties within the community. Due to staffing constraints, Cape May Point informally participated in the demonstration project. Community leaders from the environmental commission, emergency management, and the planning board provided their knowledge of existing planning documents and local initiatives to complete the Getting to Resilience questionnaire. Through the completion of the questionnaire, the participants identified actions the community has taken to address their vulnerability to coastal hazards and discussed future opportunities to continue to improve their resilience to episodic storm events and gradual changes in the coastal environment.

Through the piloting of the questionnaire, the coordination of local stakeholders involved in building community resilience proved to be difficult. Despite the fact that many community leaders were unable to participate in the completion of the questionnaire due to political and/or time constraints, the discussion among the local representatives proved to be productive and gave participants the opportunity to voice their concerns and ideas. The dialogue spurred in each of the communities disclosed the differing job responsibilities of local planners, emergency managers, and environmental commissions. Not only did the process reveal that the various sectors address hazards in different ways, they all use terminology which is specific to their job. Finding common ground and terminology will improve communication and coordination among local government leaders. Future applications of the questionnaire should be expanded to include invitations to local clerks, engineers, building officials, planning board members, town administrators, and council members. Facilitators should also consider completing the questionnaire over a series of meetings or develop workshops based off of the sections to ensure that community participants can learn about the importance of the various actions identified in each section of the questionnaire. The Getting to Resilience questionnaire exercise can also be repeated as local plans are updated and modified to gauge how well coastal hazard/vulnerability issues are being incorporated in and amongst the various local plans. Through the facilitation of the Getting to Resilience questionnaire multiple cross-cutting educational and training needs of New Jersey coastal communities were identified. The following represent some of those needs: \u2022 Additional Community Rating System training for local floodplain managers, emergency managers, planners, engineers, and other local decision-makers \u2022 Flood and sea level rise education programs for municipal leaders, residents, and business owners \u2022 Partnerships between neighboring communities and county government to identify additional storm and pet shelters or shared facilitates for neighboring communities \u2022 Storm preparedness and evacuation education, resources, and/or workshops with municipal leaders, residents, and business owners \u2022 Local coordination between county and municipal planners, emergency managers, and consultants in regards to coastal hazards and land use planning \u2022 Mitigation education, resources, and/or workshops for residential property owners on mitigation options for pre-NFIP homes, especially historic homes \u2022 Mitigation funding and grant writing education or workshops for coastal communities \u2022 Training of best management practices in coastal construction for building inspectors, developers, and engineers Through these community-based climate adaptation demonstration projects, the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium and its coastal research partners provided three communities and over thirty citizens with information and tools to address local hazard resiliency and reduce vulnerabilities to coastal inundation. The New Jersey Coastal Community Resilience Demonstration Project provided insight on the positive actions that local governments are already taking to adapt to coastal hazards, as well as identify opportunities to strengthen their resilience through local decision-making. The findings from this project also helped to identify the technical training and education needs of coastal communities, and inform the New Jersey Office of Coastal Management of the effectiveness and potential modifications to its vulnerability and resilience evaluation tools.

The Borough has taken the initiative to provide residents with information on storm hazards, the evacuation process, and the suggested contents of emergency and evacuation kits. Additionally, the Borough has developed a local registry of residents that can be used to identify the need for evacuation assistance. While the community utilizes a reverse 911 call system to alert the community of storm threats and evacuation orders, many vacation homes do not have landlines. During the summer months, vacationers are likely the most vulnerable residents within the community because they are not aware of their geographic vulnerability, nor are they aware of the proper measures to evacuate if a storm threatens the shore.

Cape May Point has already integrated many measures into its planning and ordinances. The Borough may want to explore redevelopment planning options and pursue additional actions identified in the NFIP's Community Rating System (CRS). Coinciding with CRS suggested actions and identified needs of residents, community leaders should identify appropriate housing mitigation options that will not only protect homes from flood and wind damage, but also seamlessly fit into the character of the community. Such measures may include the installation of architecturally appropriate storm shutters, flood vents, and the elevation of electric boxes, air conditioning units, and hot water heaters.

The Borough of Cape May Point has taken many actions to decrease shoreline erosion and flooding, engage the public, and ensure planning consistency. Despite these efforts, the community remains vulnerable to coastal hazards. As climate change threatens the coast, Cape May Point will experience the effects of the lowest projected rates of sea level rise. Higher sea levels will likely result in increased rates of erosion and saltwater intrusion, more frequent flooding, and changes in and loss of critical habitat.

The Borough is a participant in the multi-jurisdictional Shrewsbury River Flood Warning System. The Little Silver Master Plan identifies land uses, soils, wetlands and other environmental, social and economic features in maps and descriptions, including the 100 and 500-year floodplains, referencing ordinances to protect sensitive environments and hazard-prone areas. The majority of Little Silver's land area is also at risk to inundation from storm surge from hurricanes, with the majority of land area modeled to be inundated in a Category 1 or 2 storm surge. Approximately 34 hurricane or tropical storm tracks have passed within 75 miles of Monmouth County since 1850, including nine tropical storms that tracked through the County directly. 28 Little Silver has addressed flood hazards and losses through master planning and Borough ordinances. 29 Unfortunately, climate change threatens to exacerbate the impacts of natural hazards through the increase in intensity and frequency of coastal storms and accelerated rates of sea level rise. Sandy Hook, the closest available tide gauge with historic sea level records, indicates that the northeastern portion of coastal New Jersey has experienced approximately 3.9 mm/year of sea level rise since the early 1900s. 30 If this trend were extrapolated without the consideration of glacial and ice sheet melting, this region would experience approximately 0.39 meters (~15 inches) of sea level rise over the next century.

A wetland mitigation bank along Town Neck Creek is working to restore the creek's damaged wetlands. Wetlands serve as a sponge for extreme high tides and tidal surges, reducing the flood impacts of tidal surges. Map 12 represents the potential extent of storm surge in relationship to ecosystems in and around Little Silver. Accelerated rates of sea level rise will challenge the integrity of these natural resources, which may be altered or lost over time due to sea level rise.

Inundation and vulnerability mapping confirmed that portions of Little Silver are highly vulnerable to flooding, as repetitive loss properties already indicate. The low-lying elevations of the community's peninsulas and tidal wetlands make them highly susceptible to storm surge and sea level rise, but these same features also protect upland development from greater storm impacts. Despite the fact that the community has not sustained the direct impacts of a hurricane, it is vulnerable to these destructive storms. Most of the vulnerable development in Little Silver consists of single-family housing, but the community's public works facility and Point Road Elementary School are also susceptible to storm surge inundation. As climate change threatens to increase the frequency and intensity of coastal storms, additional development in Little Silver will be subjected to coastal flooding. To improve community resilience both today and into the future, Little Silver continues research on the flood patterns of the Shrewsbury River and its tributaries, pursues additional wetland restoration projects, provides public education on flood mitigation, and ensures local plans address hazard vulnerability. Fortunately, Little Silver has already taken multiple measures to reduce its vulnerability to episodic storm events. With the assistance of New Jersey's Green Acres Program, Little Silver has vested in the protection and restoration of coastal wetlands and riparian open space. Collaboration with neighboring communities and coastal partners has also led to the installation of tide gauges and an early flood warning system, both of which are intended to inform the community about potential flood threats. The Police Department is working with residents to identify when and where flooding occurs and at what flood depths in order to triangulate flood patterns with the tidal stages of the Shrewsbury River. As flood data is collected and analyzed from the public and the tide gauges, the community will be able to identify the potential extent of inundation during different storm events and tidal cycles. Having more accurate flood data will not only inform emergency responders of potential threats in the community, it will also provide residents with information that will help them prepare for storm impacts, thus, reducing storm damage and financial losses.

Monmouth Park Racetrack is also located within Oceanport and creates special considerations for stormwater management within the Borough. 40 The waterways impacting Oceanport include the Shrewsbury River, Branchport Creek, Oceanport Creek and Blackberry Creek. Flooding from the Shrewsbury River and the Branchport Creek occurs regularly in the Borough with minor to moderate flooding experienced for most loss events. Oceanport is particularly susceptible to flooding in the northern Port-au-Peck section as it is a peninsula into the Shrewsbury River. Significant flood events have occurred in 2010, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 1999, with minor to moderate flooding occurring annually with nor'easters, high tide and heavy rainfall events. There have been over $6,800,000 in losses paid under the National Flood Insurance Program due to flooding in Oceanport, comprising 371 properties. 41 The Borough participated with the County during the development of the county All-Hazard Mitigation Plan. Details on hazard risk and vulnerability are presented in both tabular and mapped formats in that plan, with overlays that include infrastructure, environment, multiple hazards and storm surge impacts. The Borough actively investigates the extent and magnitude of tidal flooding, stormwater issues, and possible mitigation projects.

Because Oceanport is located at the terminus point of the Shrewsbury River, high tides typically contribute to flooding. Many roads in the community experience flooding during significant rainfall events and nor'easters, including, but not limited to, Monmouth Boulevard, Port au Peck Avenue, Comanche Drive, and Pocano Avenue. Such flooding not only poses a threat to drivers and personal vehicles, it can hinder response times for emergency vehicles. In order to improve their knowledge of flood vulnerability in the community, tide gauges were recently installed at Gooseneck and Oceanport bridges. The same hydrologic dynamics that make the low-lying portions of Oceanport susceptible to riverine flooding contribute to storm surge and sea level rise inundation. Inundation and vulnerability mapping confirmed that Oceanport is located in one of the most vulnerable portions of Monmouth County. Much of Oceanport's development is located in surge prone areas, while extensive recreational and open spaces are located in the least vulnerable portions of the community. Gooseneck Point and the northeastern portion of the community are extremely vulnerable to storm surge inundation. Unfortunately, most of the community's public facilities, including the municipal complex and Maple Place Elementary School, lie within flood prone areas. The flood vulnerability of the police department, volunteer firehouses, first aid & rescue facility, and the primary municipal storm shelter threatens public safety. Because Maple Place Elementary School is vulnerable to storm surges, Wolfhill Elementary School has been identified as an evacuation shelter for emergency responders and their families. Oceanport should consider establishing a relationship with neighboring communities to identify shared evacuation shelters for its remaining residents. While the community has begun to address the threat to public safety posed by the flooding of its critical facilities, it has yet to relocate these facilities outside of flood prone areas. As new development and redevelopment occurs within the community, the Borough should proactively address the threat of flood hazards and environmental constraints through land use planning and building design. Doing so will not only protect public investments, it will ensure that the community is capable of bouncing back quickly in the event of a major storm or disaster. Incorporating stormwater management, open space acquisition, hazard mapping, and hazard mitigation into land use planning is necessary to ensure the Borough's resilience. Regular coordination and collaboration amongst the municipal planning board, emergency managers, engineer and county planners and emergency managers could result in creative ways to build resilience through the various sectors and decision-making within the community. The redevelopment of Fort Monmouth serves as an opportunity to develop in concert with nature, protecting natural resources in addition to private and public investments. Unfortunately, the Fort Monmouth Redevelopment and Reuse Plan proposes the location of new development and the municipal offices to a high hazard area that is prone to flooding and susceptible to storm surge. To influence hazard resilience, the community needs to designate a local champion that is responsible for interagency collaboration and coordination of the Monmouth County All-Hazard Mitigation Plan, the Fort Monmouth Redevelopment and Reuse Plan, and municipal planning and investment. In addition to planning, emergency preparedness, education, and mitigation are also critical to ensuring the resilience of a community. Oceanport has taken multiple strides to not only inform residents of its flood vulnerabilities, it has also taken many preparatory actions to reduce the vulnerabilities of its residents and its properties. In recent years, Oceanport has been identified as a Storm Ready community by the National Weather Service. The community has also been granted insurance rate reductions through its participation in the National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System. The municipal website serves as a resource for homeowners to learn about these programs, storm preparedness, and evacuation processes. Because the majority of the community is comprised of owner-occupied, residential development, Oceanport should focus on providing additional education, resources, and workshops on storm preparedness and mitigation options. Residents may need information on effective storm shudders, flood vents, and the elevation of electric boxes, air conditioning units, and hot water heaters. By providing the public with information on appropriate mitigation options, municipal leaders will be able to further the resilience of the community. As climate change threatens the coast, higher sea levels will likely result in more frequent flooding, changes in and loss of critical habitat, and increased flood damages. While the community may be able to rapidly recover from flood events, flood threats and expedient recovery will become more of a challenge over the course of time. Over the next century, sea levels in and around Oceanport are expected to rise approximately 0.5 -1.5 meters (20 -60 inches). Local decision-makers should be aware of the challenges this will pose on the community. Adapting land use management, coordinating local and inter-jurisdictional decisionmaking, continuing public education and outreach, and obtaining a better understanding of flood patterns in the Shrewsbury River will build the Borough's capacity to become disaster resilient."}, {"section_title": "Outreach Findings and Recommendations", "text": "New Jersey's coastline is comprised of varying shoreline types, natural resources, demographics, and levels of development; as a result, its communities have varying degrees of vulnerability to coastal storms and sea level rise. Because of these factors, blanket assumptions cannot be made as to how natural hazards may impact the differing regions of New Jersey's coastal zone. In order to identify the differences, the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium and its partners examined vulnerability and resilience indicators in three coastal communities, including the boroughs of Cape May Point, Little Silver, and Oceanport. By piloting the New Jersey's Office of Coastal Management's Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol and the Getting to Resilience questionnaire, the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium and its partners were able to discover the coastal hazard vulnerability and challenges of small coastal communities in various regions of the state. The mapping process revealed the environmental constraints within the participating boroughs and identified the physical vulnerabilities of each community. In addition, community outreach opened a dialogue among key players in the communities, helping them to voice their concerns about the existing threats to development and public safety. While each of the communities has varying educational and technical needs to address coastal hazards, some universal needs were identified through the mapping process and questionnaire facilitation."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol", "text": "Coastal communities may not be fully aware of all of the potential impacts of coastal hazards and accelerated sea level rise on their vulnerable populations, infrastructure, and natural resources. While a detailed risk and vulnerability analysis can often qualify communities for mitigation funding, it is often overlooked that this analysis can also help them guide the location of future development. Presently, all three communities rely upon their county all-hazard mitigation plans and coastal research to help inform them of the threats and vulnerabilities of their communities. While these resources are extremely helpful, they do not always address structural, natural, cultural, and demographic vulnerabilities, limiting the community's awareness. Unfortunately, small communities typically do not have the staff to develop a thorough coastal hazard vulnerability mapping and assessment. The application of the Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol helped identify vulnerabilities in the three pilot communities with the anticipation that they will incorporate its findings into future decision-making. Storm surge and sea level rise maps identified the varying degrees of inundation vulnerability in each of the pilot communities. Cape May Point's location at the convergence of the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean make it highly susceptible to all types of coastal hazards. While the community is not presently threatened by shallow coastal flooding, sea level rise will likely cause regular flooding. Unlike Cape May Point, Little Silver and Oceanport are affected by shallow coastal flooding multiple times during the year. The frequency and intensity of flooding will increase as climate change threatens this coastal riverine system. In all three communities, storm surge maps revealed that flood insurance is only required in areas subjected to Category 1 and potentially Category 2 hurricanes. Considering that many homes in these communities are historic in nature or no longer carry mortgages, many homes may be uninsured or underinsured for flooding. As sea levels rise, storm surges will be able to inundate further inland, affecting additional properties that are currently outside of the designated flood zones. It is important for community leaders and property owners to be aware that the National Flood Insurance Program does not require insurance in all flood prone areas of a community. They should also be aware that sea level rise is not considered in the development of the flood insurance rate maps. As the coastal environment is constantly in flux and properties change ownership, communities should initiate or continue flood, storm, and sea level rise education and outreach. Utilizing the best available data and geospatial mapping methodologies, the Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment Protocol helped to characterize the general vulnerabilities in each of the three pilot communities. Despite the fact that the maps are static in nature and do not account for episodic flooding from upland rainfall and waves, or projected erosion rates, the storm surge, sea level rise, and coastal vulnerability indexes were very informative for the identification of development constraints and flood risks in the three pilot communities. As more accurate tide, subsidence, storm surge, erosion, and elevation data becomes available; it can be incorporated into these models. Since the mapping provides the pilot communities with visualizations of their inundation vulnerability, they should consider incorporating the mapping and findings from this report into their planning decisions and all-hazard mitigation plan updates. They should also consider sharing the storm surge and sea level rise maps with their constituents. Another finding from the application of CCVAP was that a Census-based social vulnerability assessment is not applicable in small municipalities due to the limited number of Census blocks or Census block groups, which inhibits the ability to spatially identify the location of the most vulnerable populations in relationship to hazardous threats. At this scale, municipal leaders and emergency managers should consider using a local registry to capture the location of special needs populations or utilize the existing New Jersey Register Ready Program to identify the individuals who may need preparedness, evacuation, or recovery assistance. In addition, Census data should not be used to identify the location of future vulnerable populations. It is suggested that local governments use storm surge and sea level rise models to identify hazard prone areas where the future development of affordable and low income housing, municipal facilities, schools, and homeless shelters should be avoided. By doing so, communities can proactively limit their susceptibility to coastal hazards."}]
