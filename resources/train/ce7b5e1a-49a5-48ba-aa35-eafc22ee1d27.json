[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A large number of morphology-based studies have previously reported a variety of regional abnormalities in hemispheric asymmetry in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, neuroimaging studies have revealed changes in the topological organization of the structural network in AD. However, little is known about the alterations in topological asymmetries. In the present study, we used diffusion tensor image tractography to construct the hemispheric brain white matter networks of 25 AD patients, 95 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 48 normal control (NC) subjects. Graph theoretical approaches were then employed to estimate hemispheric topological properties. Rightward asymmetry in both global and local network efficiencies were observed between the two hemispheres only in AD patients. The brain regions/nodes exhibiting increased rightward asymmetry in both AD and MCI patients were primarily located in the parahippocampal gyrus and cuneus. The observed rightward asymmetry was attributed to changes in the topological properties of the left hemisphere in AD patients. Finally, we found that the abnormal hemispheric asymmetries of brain network properties were significantly correlated with memory performance (Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test). Our findings provide new insights into the lateralized nature of hemispheric disconnectivity and highlight the potential for using hemispheric asymmetry of brain network measures as biomarkers for AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, comprising an estimated 60-80% of all dementia cases, and MCI is considered a prodromal state of AD and possibly other dementias in which cognitive decline is greater than expected at a certain age or education level, but with functional impairment that is insufficient for a diagnosis of dementia (Petersen et al., 1985) . Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated aberrant hemispheric asymmetry of both brain structure and function in AD and MCI, including cortical thickness (Kim et al., 2012) , cortical volume (M\u00fcller et al., 2005; Pennanen et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2009; Cherbuin et al., 2010; Derflinger et al., 2011; Dhikav et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) , and cortical surface area covarying across the brain (Thompson et al., 2003 (Thompson et al., , 2007 Long et al., 2013) . There is also aberrant hemispheric asymmetry in WM properties (M\u00fcller et al., 2005; Damoiseaux et al., 2009; Stricker et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011; Wessa et al., 2016) and functional connectivity (Wang et al., 2006 . Intriguingly, some of these studies showed that the left hemisphere was significantly more impaired than the right, indicating a faster left hemisphere degeneration in AD (Thompson et al., 2003 (Thompson et al., , 2007 M\u00fcller et al., 2005; Damoiseaux et al., 2009; Li et al., 2016; Wessa et al., 2016) .\nRecently, the term \"connectome\" was proposed by modeling the human brain as a complex network, and graph theoretical approaches provide powerful tools to uncover human brain connectome in healthy and disease populations (Sporns et al., 2005; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Rubinov and Sporns, 2009; Fornito et al., 2013 Fornito and Bullmore, 2015; Ohno et al., 2016) . Diffusion MRI is the only non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can provide exquisite details of WM fiber bundles in vivo, and have been extensively applied to study AD and MCI (Douaud et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Bosch et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Voineskos et al., 2012; Amlien and Fjell, 2014) . Furthermore, the WM connectome constructed by using diffusion MRI have shown altered topological properties in AD and MCI (Dai and He, 2014; Daianu et al., 2014 Daianu et al., , 2015 Garc\u00e9s et al., 2014; Phillips et al., 2014; Prescott et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Zhan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Palesi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) . Intriguingly, Daianu et al. (2013) found significant differences between the left and right hemispheric in the k-core matrices among NC, AD, and MCI. Specifically, the entire k-core was \"lost\" in the left hemisphere of AD subjects, supporting lateralized deficits in connectome topologies of AD.\nTo date, whether and how the asymmetry of hemispheric network topology differs among AD, MCI and normal aging remain largely unknown. Given the difference in hemispheric asymmetries previously observed among AD, MCI and normal aging, we hypothesized the existence of differences in the topological asymmetry of hemispheric networks. To test this hypothesis, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilized to construct hemispheric brain WM networks for AD patients, MCI patients, and normal control (NC) subjects. Graph theoretical methods were then applied to quantify multiple topological parameters for the hemispheric networks."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "All participants in this study were selected from the second stage of the ADNI-II database, available at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/.

After that, a new list (List B) of 15 new words is read to the participant, who is immediately asked to recall the words. After the List B trial, the examiner asks participant to recall the words from the List A (Trial 6).

First, the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) was binarized to obtain a basic mask. Then, the left and right hemispheres were flipped along the x-axis, and the basic mask and the flipped version were averaged to generate a symmetric mask. The right side of the symmetric mask was parcellated into a 512-ROI set using a random partition procedure (Zalesky et al., 2010) : each ROI represented a node. Second, the resultant 512-ROI set was flipped into the left hemisphere to obtain the final template. This flipping ensured one-toone correspondence of ROIs/nodes between the left and right hemispheric networks, enabling direct comparison between the two hemispheric networks. Finally, the ROI set in the MNI space was transformed into the native diffusion space for each subject as described in a previous study (Gong et al., 2009) . Accordingly, each individual FA image was first coregistered to the T1-weighted structural images in the native diffusion space using a linear transformation. The co-registered structural images were then non-linearly normalized to the symmetric ICBM-152 T1 template in MNI space.

The network construction methods can dramatically affect WM network topological properties (Zalesky et al., 2010; Bassett et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2015) , and the construction methods differed between the previous study (Caeyenberghs and Leemans, 2014 ) and the present study: Caeyenberghs and Leemans (2014) involved 45 nodes (low resolution), whereas we used 512 nodes in the present study (high resolution). In addition, the number of fibers was defined as edge weights by Caeyenberghs, while we used the FA value as weight.\nNotably, the AD patients exhibited significant right-greaterthan-left asymmetry of network efficiency, suggesting that the left hemisphere is intra-connected in a more poorly integrated way with less efficient communication at the hemispheric level in AD. While there are no comparable structural data involving hemispheric network efficiency in patients with AD, FIGURE 6 | Three-dimensional representations of the nodes with significant between-group differences in the AI of nodal efficiency. The node size represents the F-value of GLM when comparing the AI of nodal efficiency among the three groups, and represents the t-value of post hoc analysis (no FDR).\nour findings are consistent with earlier studies showing that the left hemisphere lost GM faster than the right in AD patients (Thompson et al., 2003 (Thompson et al., , 2007 ."}, {"section_title": "Atypical Topological Asymmetry in AD and MCI Patients", "text": "Compared with the NC subjects, the AD patients exhibited significantly increased rightward asymmetry in both local network efficiency and global network efficiency. Considering the symmetrical topological organization in the normal aging brain, this aberrant hemispheric asymmetry in AD is likely related to a mismatch in disease-related changes in structural properties within the two hemispheres. Compatibly, Thompson et al. (Thompson et al., 2007) demonstrated that cortical atrophy occurred earlier and progressed faster in the left hemisphere than in the right in AD, indicating that the left hemisphere was more severely impaired than the right and that there was a faster left hemisphere degeneration in AD. Interestingly, our data reveled a disease-related disruption in local network efficiency in the left hemisphere but a slight change in the right hemisphere. Biochemically, the significant decrease in network efficiency may be related to the \u03b2-amyloid-related protein in AD (Tsai et al., 2009) . At the nodal level, two nodes (the parahippocampal gyrus and CUN) showed abnormal topological asymmetry in both AD and MCI patients compared with NC subjects. This atypical topological asymmetry in the parahippocampal gyrus may be associated with structural asymmetry. For example, Kim et al. (Kim et al., 2012) studied the cortical thickness of MCI patients, mild AD patients and moderate-to-severe AD patients and found a progressive reduction in cortical asymmetry in the parahippocampal gyrus. Liu et al. reported a reduced FA value in right parahippocampal WM in both AD and MCI patients . For CUN, the abnormalities in functional regional homogeneity have been also reported in AD (Wang et al., 2006; He et al., 2007) . Given the important role of the parahippocampal gyrus (Staresina et al., 2011) and CUN (Addis et al., 2004) in episodic memory, it is possible that the observed atypical topological asymmetry in these regions may be related to impaired memory of AD and MCI patients.\nCompared with the NC subjects, several regions were identified to have abnormal asymmetry in nodal efficiency only in AD, including the precuneus, temporal regions, and lingual gyrus. Given the important role of the precuneus in communication (Hagmann et al., 2007; Gong et al., 2009) , which is a hub region in both structure network an restingstate network, our findings provide further support to the notion that these brain hubs may be preferentially affected in AD (Buckner et al., 2009; Jacobs et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2015) . The disruptions of the hub regions may indicate more isolated FIGURE 7 | (A) Box plot of group differences in the AI, based on the mean AI of observed significant nodes.

GM loss in precuneus of the AD brain has also been consistently found by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (Derflinger et al., 2011) . For AFG, abnormalities in this region of AD patients have also been reported in previous studies. He et al (He et al., 2007) have reported that the fusiform gyrus showed increased blood oxygenation level-dependent fluctuations (LFBF) in AD patients. Yao et al (Yao et al., 2010) have found the abnormalities of interregional correlation in the fusiform gyrus in AD patients. For lingual gyrus, Sun et al (Sun et al., 2014) have found abnormal nodal efficiency in the lingual gyrus in AD patients. For inferior temporal gyrus, several studies have confirmed that the temporal gyrus atrophy in AD patients was correlated with changes of white matter (i.e., microstructure, number of synapses) (Scheff et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Delli Pizzi et al., 2015) . In addition, biochemically, Johnson et al evaluated 18 F T807, a PET radiopharmaceutical selective for tau pathology by comparing normal individuals to MCI or mild AD dementia patients. They found that 18 F T807 binding in the MCI/AD patients was especially high in inferior temporal lobe (Johnson et al., 2016) . The results of these studies give us some reasonable explanations for the observed abnormal asymmetry in these regions from different perspectives.\nThe increased degree of rightward asymmetry in nodal efficiency is primarily due to changes in the left hemisphere, which has been well-documented to dominantly process language (Gotts et al., 2013) . Therefore, our results are to some extent consistent with the clinical symptoms of AD, and imply that atypical topological asymmetries may relate to the impairment in verbal memory, language and other cognitive functions in AD. Notably, there were more nodes exhibiting significant asymmetry in AD patients than those in MCI patients, compared with NC subjects, further supporting the transitional role of the MCI between the NC and AD."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between Topological Asymmetry and the Memory Performances", "text": "We examined the correlation between the AI of network metrics and RAVLT scores (i.e., TOTALL, TOT6 and RECOG). We found that subjects with higher level rightward asymmetry in local network efficiency and global network efficiency had lower verbal memory performance. Also, subjects with higher level rightward asymmetry in nodal efficiency of two cortical regions (i.e., AFG and CUN) had lower verbal memory performance. Several previous research results were consistent with the present findings. For example, Reijmer et al. (2013) found that memory performance (including RAVLT scores) was correlated with local efficiency and global efficiency in WM network in AD. At nodal level, He and his colleagues found (He et al., 2007) that MMSE score in the AD patients group were significant positive correlations with ReHo in CUN. In addition, previous morphological studies also have demonstrated the AD-related structural changes within the brain is closely related to RAVLT measures (Est\u00e9vez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003; Balthazar et al., 2010; Stonnington et al., 2010; Moradi et al., 2016) . Notably, Derflinger et al. (2011) found that the performance of language-based neuropsychological tests was correlated with lateralization of GM loss to the left hemisphere in AD. This agreement further validates our finding that the rightward asymmetry was mainly contributed by the changes of the topological properties of AD patients in the left hemisphere. Thus our results of aberrant hemispheric asymmetry likely reflect the breakdown of function connections that influences memory performances of the AD patients. The present findings support a general trend in the literature showing a direct correspondence between clinical symptomatology and the underlying anatomical structures supporting network efficiency and suggest the usefulness of brain network properties as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of the disease as well as understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Works", "text": "Finally, a few limitation should be addressed. First, a tensormodel-based deterministic tractography method was utilized to reconstruct the structural brain networks in this study. It is has been well-known that this fiber tracking method cannot handle the \"fiber crossing\" problem (Mori and van Zijl, 2002) . Topological asymmetry analysis based on other methods such as probabilistic tractography or other imaging models such as diffusion spectrum MRI or high-angularresolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) can be used in further studies. Second, handedness has been shown to impact the network efficiency asymmetries of human brains (Li et al., 2014) . However, the present study did not include handness information; therefore, no assessment of the effect of handedness on network asymmetries was made. Next, the current study did not analyze the relationship between changes in network asymmetry and cortical/subcortical atrophy. Given the WM alteration could be related to cortical/subcortical atrophy (Huang et al., 2012; Delli Pizzi et al., 2015) , we will evaluate changes of asymmetry-cortical/subcortical atrophy relationships in AD the future. It is highly desired to explicitly evaluate changes of asymmetry-cognition relationships in AD the future. At the end, the sample size of the present study is relatively small (48 NC subjects, 95 MCI and 25 AD patients). Give the ADNI2 subjects are continuously being updated, future work is encouraged to assess a larger sample size to verify our current findings."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The present study revealed increased rightward asymmetry in hemispheric brain WM networks from NC to MCI to AD, and the rightward asymmetry is attributed to aberration of topological properties in the left hemisphere in patients. In addition, the degree of the rightward asymmetry of topological properties was also correlated with memory performance. These findings provide another angel to understand the pathological mechanisms in AD and highlight the potential for brain network asymmetry-based biomarkers for AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "CY and SZ designed experiments; CY and LW collected and sorted data; XZ and CY carried out experiments, data analysis and statistical analysis; LJW and LW assistance for statistical analysis; CY, SZ, and XZ wrote the manuscript; SZ, LJW, and SN revised the manuscript."}, {"section_title": "FUNDING", "text": ""}]
