The 'World Alzheimer's report 2015' estimates that there are approximately 46 million AD patients worldwide, with this number expected to rise to over 130 million by the middle of the century (1) . As well as a significant human cost, AD also represents a major financial burden with worldwide costs related to AD expected to reach $1 trillion dollars in 2018 (1) .\nCholinesterase inhibitors make up three of the four approved AD treatments (Donepezil, Rivastigmine and Galantamine) making inhibition of acetylcholinesterase the leading therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD symptoms (2, 3) . There is a significant body of literature that has suggested that the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease are the result of lower levels of acetylcholine in the brain resulting from dysfunction of cholinergic neurons (4) (5) (6) . The role of non-cholinergic neurotransmitter systems in AD pathogenesis has received less attention. While levels of non-cholinergic neurotransmitters in the brain have been associated with Alzheimer's pathology (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) , their role in mediating the onset of symptoms is less well understood. In this study, we analysed data from non-targeted metabolomics to compare differences in neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter-associated metabolite levels in brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We studied three groups of BLSA participants, AD patients, cognitively normal controls and 'asymptomatic AD' (ASYMAD; i.e. individuals with significant AD neuropathology at death but with no evidence of cognitive impairment during life). We studied three distinct brain regions in these individuals that are differentially effected by core pathological features of AD, the inferior temporal gyrus that is especially vulnerable to neurofibrillary tau tangles, the middle frontal gyrus which is susceptible to the accumulation amyloid plaques and the cerebellum which is resistant to classical AD pathology (12) . Our aim was to test associations between AD neuropathology and metabolism in a variety of neurotransmitter systems."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample Information", "text": "The BLSA is a prospective, ongoing cohort study of community-dwelling volunteer participants in Baltimore begun in 1958. As such, it is among the largest and longest-running longitudinal studies of aging in the United States (13, 14) . In general, at the time of entry into the study, participants had no physical or cognitive impairment. Detailed examinations, including neuropsychological assessments and neurological, laboratory, and radiological evaluations, were conducted every 2 years. Since 2003, participants older than 80 years have received yearly assessments. Written informed consent was obtained at each visit, and the study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and the National Institute on Aging. After each visit, cognitive status was considered at consensus diagnosis conferences relying on information from neuropsychological tests as well as clinical data as described previously (15) . Diagnoses of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were based on DSM-III-R (16) and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (17) respectively.\nBrain tissue samples were collected through the autopsy sample of the BLSA. The autopsy program of the BLSA was initiated in 1986. We have previously described the study protocol in detail. Briefly, the mean age at death in the autopsy sample is 88.3 \u00b1 7.3 years (range 69.3-103.2), and the mean interval between last evaluation and death is 8.7\u00b1 6.7 months (18).\nAs reported previously, the autopsy subsample is not significantly different from the BLSA cohort as a whole in terms of the rates of dementia and clinical stroke (19) .

To extract metabolites from brain tissue, samples were homogenized using Precellys\u00ae with ethanol phosphate buffer. Samples were then centrifuged and the supernatant was used for analysis. The fully automated assay was based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; amino acids) using a SCIEX 4000\nQTrap\u00ae mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Darmstadt, Germany) with electrospray ionization.\nBrain tissue concentration was absolute concentration expressed as nmol/mg tissue"}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods and pathway mapping", "text": "To compare the abundance of neurotransmitters and their associated metabolites among 3 groups (CN, ASYMAD and AD), we used Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons.\nTo control for type 1 errors in the p-values calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure performed in 'R' with the results reported in Table 2 .

(Table 2) shows that shifts in dopamine metabolism are greater in the middle frontal gyrus in the ASYMAD group, suggesting that the changes in dopamine metabolism occur before memory loss occurs."}, {"section_title": "Neurotransmission inhibition in the inferior temporal gyrus in AD", "text": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter serotonin and its precursor tryptophan were measured in this study and decreased in the ITG of AD patients (p<0.05); but were not significant at p<0.005 (Table 2 , Supp Figure 1N and 1O). Serotonin is synthesised from the essential amino acid tryptophan by tryptophan monooxygenase (TM) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). As stated above, alpha-synuclein which is increased in the brains of AD patients In this study GABA is increased in abundance but no change is seen in glutamate levels apart from a modest shift observed in the ITG. Whilst increased GABA production could still be coming at least in part from glutamate, the changes observed in other metabolites associated with GABA metabolism mean that the alterations may arise from multiple sources ( Figure 2 ).\nGABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system (42, 43) . It does not cross the blood brain barrier (44) and in the brain is predominantly synthesised from the non-essential amino acid glutamate by the action of glutamate decarboxylase under standard physiological conditions (45) . However, GABA can be synthesised via several pathways from a selection precursors, including aminobutanal by aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (46) , succinate semialdehyde by aminobutyrate aminotransferase (47) and guanidinobutanoate by guanidinobutyrase (Supp Figure 2) . Two alternative GABA synthetic pathways, both of which start from the urea cycle, have intermediates that are significantly 1 1 reduced in abundance (Supp Figure 2) suggesting that they may play a role in the dysregulation of GABA metabolism.\nRegardless of the synthetic source of the increased abundance of GABA, this combined with the reduction in glutamate in the ITG (Table 2) can produce a reduction in the glutamate/GABA ratio, leading to an inhibitory environment and a reduction in the transmission of action potentials. When GABA is released into the synaptic cleft it binds to a range of transmembrane receptors on both the pre and post-synaptic neurons leading to the opening of ion channels allowing the negatively charged chloride ions to enter and positively charged potassium ions to escape the neuron ( Figure 2 ) (48). This shift leads to loss of the transmembrane potential and hyperpolarisation of the cell membrane, inhibiting action potentials produced by excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission is observed in brains with pathology but no memory problems. Combined therapeutic approaches, especially those affecting the GABAergic and serotonergic system might be useful as adjunctive treatments in AD."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work has been supported by grants from the Libyan "}, {"section_title": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST", "text": "The authors report no conflicts of interest.\n1 3 "}, {"section_title": "SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE LEGENDS", "text": "Supplemental"}]
