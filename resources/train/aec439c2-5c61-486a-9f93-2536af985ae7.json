[{"section_title": "", "text": "\uf0b7 Among academic employers who post jobs with the AAA, only about half are anthropology departments. \uf0b7 While tenure-track assistant professorships are the most common early-career academic posting, we also receive many announcements for postdoctoral fellows.

For example, consider the IPEDS and ACE data comparison in Figure 1, the classic line graph used to illustrate the supposed \"overproduction\" of PhDs: for the past eight years, the number of jobs posted on ACE has consistently fallen about 20% short of the number of PhDs granted in anthropology. According to the NSF's 2017 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, however, the unemployment rate of anthropology PhDs is only 2.5%, and over 80% of employed anthropology PhDs work full time (National Science Foundation 2017). Therefore, anthropologists are finding full-time employment in many positions not captured by ACE. While our analysis can point towards some trends, these elements of the academic and non-academic market will remain as areas of focus for future research. Employers recruiting on ACE provide key information about their institution and the advertised position, such as the length of appointment, duties, and the required degrees and experience needed to qualify for the position. To identify early-career academic (ECA) vacancies, we examined each position's minimum education and experience requirements alongside the position title. Using these qualifiers, ECA vacancies were sorted into the seven sub-categories seen in Table 1. Roughly 85% of the postings on ACE were early-career positions in academia. The remainder either required more experience than is attainable for entry-level candidates, were non-academic or miscellaneous advertisements. As illustrated in Table 1, the Other category includes senior faculty and academic leadership positions, business / government / nonprofit (BGN) appointments, and opportunities for candidates who were already employed, such as fellowships and journal editorships.  "}, {"section_title": "Pre-Tenure and Non-Tenure Line Faculty", "text": "In Table 2, the Pre-Tenure / Tenure-Track and Non-Tenure Line Faculty categories from Table 1 are further broken down according to academic rank within each tenure status. Unsurprisingly, 99% of pretenure / tenure-track postings are assistant professorships. In comparison, visiting assistant professorships, the most common rank of non-tenure line faculty, only account for 45% of the total. Note that we received postings for both pre-tenure / tenure-track and non-tenure line positions at the instructor and lecturer ranks. Not shown in Table 2 are an additional 20 assistant professor vacancies that did not specify tenure status. ECA vacancies were also coded for Carnegie type (Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education n.d.) and regional location. As shown in Figure 2, more than half of advertised vacancies came from doctoral universities. Previous AAA research (Ginsberg 2016) has shown a similar distribution among AAA members with academic affiliations, so this seems to reflect a consistent status quo in academic anthropology. The highest concentration of pre-tenure / tenure-track vacancies posted in the first hiring cycle were split between the Far West (n=31) and Mid-East (n=29) regions of the US; however, by the second cycle they were amassed in the Far West (n=43). Non-tenure line positions were consistently located in the Mid-East region in both cycles. Regional distributions are shown in Figure 3.   "}, {"section_title": "Departments", "text": "Tracking academic jobs for anthropologists beyond ACE is difficult due to the number of anthropologists hired outside of anthropology departments; a search for professors of anthropology would leave out the large proportion of anthropologists teaching in other humanities and social science departments, as well as life and health sciences departments and professional schools. To quantify the range of disciplines reflected in our data set, we categorized the employers' department title using a version of the Classification of Institutional Programs used in federal statistical reports (National Center for Education Statistics 2010), which we have modified by separating anthropology from the other social sciences. The codes identified in the outer rings of Figure 6 are organized by the overarching disciplines of the inner rings. Since this process relied on information provided by the employers, institutions that did not provide this information were excluded from this analysis. These departments were typically from international institutions, sought faculty with general social science expertise to teach core curriculum courses, or were postdoctoral appointments in academic centers or with individual faculty members."}, {"section_title": "Hiring Preferences", "text": "The follow-up survey included a module asking employers to rate the criteria considered in their hiring decision. In many cases, the respondent who completed the survey may have been administrative staff or for some other reason not part of the hiring committee, making them unable to complete this section. For this reason, we did not have sufficient data to disaggregate hiring criteria among different classes of ECA positions; instead, we have compiled aggregated numbers for all ECA positions in Table 3 and non-ECA positions in Table 4. the emerging academic population's limited work experience and budding research projects. Through anecdotal interviews with some hiring departments we learned that the criteria to improve racial/ethnic and gender diversity does not influence the selection of a final candidate as much as the other criteria when departments already meet university standards for equal opportunity.
