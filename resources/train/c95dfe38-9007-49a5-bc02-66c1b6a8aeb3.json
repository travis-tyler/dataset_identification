Methods: Using 18 F-AV-1451 ( 18 F-flortaucipir) positron emission tomography, we evaluated tau pathology in 54 cognitively normal participants (mean age: 77.5 years, SD: 8.9) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We assessed associations between positron emission tomography signal and age, sex, race, and amyloid positivity. We investigated relationships between regional signal and retrospective rates of change in regional volumes and cognitive function adjusting for age, sex, and amyloid status. Results: Greater age, male sex, black race, and amyloid positivity were associated with higher 18 F-AV-1451 retention in distinct brain regions. Retention in the entorhinal cortex was associated with lower entorhinal volume (b 5 21.124, SE 5 0.485, P 5 .025) and a steeper decline in memory performance (b 5 20.086, SE 5 0.039, P 5 .029).

Tau promotes assembly and stability of microtubules in the nervous system [1] , but its hyperphosphorylation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which are observed at autopsy in brains of almost all individuals older than 70 years [2] . Neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe in the absence of amyloid deposition and clinical symptomatology have been referred to as primary age-related tauopathy [3] , although it is not clear if primary age-related tauopathy is distinct from the continuum of AD [4] .\nTau pathology is hypothesized to be one of the earliest pathophysiological changes [5] in preclinical AD, spreading from the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus to the neocortex at later disease stages [6] . Positron emission tomography (PET) tau radiotracers have enabled the in vivo characterization of pathological tau. Cross-sectional studies including cognitively normal (CN) participants in addition to those with mild cognitive impairment and AD indicate that lower cognitive performance is associated with higher tau tracer retention in the temporal lobe [7, 8] and the neocortex [9] . Lower hippocampal volume has also been associated with greater tau radiotracer retention in the hippocampus [8, 10] . Longitudinal studies including individuals ranging from CN to demented have further found that higher baseline tau tracer retention is associated with greater rates of brain volume loss [11, 12] and global cognitive decline [13] [14] [15] .\nAlthough pathological tau burden has been shown to be related to cognition and brain volume in individuals across the AD spectrum, the influence of tau in CN individuals who may or may not go on to develop clinical impairment remains unclear. There is a growing body of literature on the characterization of tau pathology using PET in this population. Several studies have observed associations between tau PET and brain volume in CN individuals. Lower gray matter volume intensity has been associated with greater tau PET retention in the medial temporal lobe [16] , and studies utilizing retrospective longitudinal MRI data have further demonstrated that cortical thinning is related to tau PET particularly in medial and lateral temporal areas [17, 18] . However, the relationship between tau PET and cognitive performance is less clear. Results in CN individuals indicate that medial temporal lobe tau PET is associated with lower cross-sectional episodic memory and steeper retrospective decline in episodic memory adjusting for age, sex, and amyloid burden [18, 19] . Other studies have not found associations between regional tau PET and cognition [20] , or have shown that tau PET interacts with amyloid to predict greater episodic memory decline only in amyloid1 individuals [21] .\nThe lack of consensus in studies of CN individuals indicates a further need to analyze tau PET in this population and examine its association with brain volume loss and cognitive decline. The main goal of the present study was to determine whether age-and amyloid-related differences in tau deposition can be detected among CN older adults, and if so, to investigate whether tau deposition is associated with regional brain volume and cognitive performance changes among CN. We first investigated factors associated with tau tracer retention in a sample of 54 CN older adults from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We then examined regional tracer retention in regions where early tau accumulation is known to occur (i.e., the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior temporal gyrus) in relation to retrospective longitudinal brain volume (over the course of about 7 years) and cognitive changes (over the course of about 13 years). We hypothesized that age and amyloid positivity would be associated with tau tracer retention given the relevance of these two factors for pathology spread, and that tau tracer retention would explain retrospective brain volume and cognitive decline in areas known to be affected early in AD. Understanding these relationships in a CN sample will allow us to better evaluate tau as a potential target for study and interventions to address brain aging and disease."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The study sample included CN BLSA participants with a 18 F-AV-1451 ( 18 F-flortaucipir) tau PET, a 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B ( 11 C-PiB) amyloid PET within 2.2 years of tau PET, and a structural MRI. As of January 18, 2018, tau PET scans were acquired on 63 participants. Four had a non-CN status, two did not have an MRI at the time of analysis, one was subsequently discovered to have had an unreported myocardial infarction before enrollment (therefore meeting the exclusion criteria for PET study enrollment), and one was determined to be an outlier because of highly lateralized cortical signal. The final sample, after excluding these cases, consisted of 54 individuals (Table 1 ). For 47 of these participants, MRI and PET scans were 6 months apart. They were 0.6, 2.1, 2.1, 4.1, 4.6, 5.8, and 7.3 years apart for the remaining 7 participants.\nCN status was based on either (1) a Clinical Dementia Rating score [22] of zero and 3 errors on the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test [23] , and therefore the participant did not meet criteria for consensus conference; or (2) the participant met criteria for consensus conference and was determined to be CN based on thorough review of clinical and neuropsychological data.\nResearch protocols were approved by local institutional review boards, and all participants gave written informed consent at each visit.

We evaluated the cross-sectional associations of 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR with age, sex, race, and amyloid status, and further assessed the associations between 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR and rates of volumetric and cognitive change. We found that higher 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the entorhinal cortex was associated with lower volume in this region. We also found that greater 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior temporal gyrus were each associated with steeper decline in verbal memory.\nOur finding of higher 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR in temporal, temporoparietal, and frontal cortical areas among amyloid1 compared with amyloid2 individuals is in agreement with previous studies of cognitively normal older adults [19, 37] . In the amyloid2 group, 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was lower at greater ages in periventricular white matter and CSF, which might be due to age-related differences in radiotracer clearance among amyloid2 individuals. Conversely, 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was higher at older ages among amyloid1 individuals in the putamen, right inferior frontal, and right middle occipital gyri. The association between tracer retention and age modulated by amyloid status did not reach significance in the putamen, but amyloid1 individuals exhibited stronger associations in several cortical regions. These findings suggest that the association in the putamen may be driven by nonspecific binding whereas cortical associations may more likely be due to tau pathology. Similarly, the observed interaction between amyloid status and age might be reflective of cortical areas of faster tau accumulation among amyloid1 individuals. This interpretation is supported by the finding of a previous longitudinal tau PET study showing that amyloid1 individuals had steeper tau tracer retention increases in basal and midtemporal, retrosplenial, posterior cingulate, and entorhinal cortex [38] . Another study of longitudinal tau accumulation showed increases in 18 F-AV-1451 retention over 1-3 years in temporal and medial parietal areas in healthy older adults [39] . These findings were further expanded on by a recent study reporting that individuals with baseline 18 F-AV-1451 SUVRs in the second quartile exhibited tau tracer retention increases in inferior and lateral temporal cortex and in posterior cingulate over 18 months [15] . Men in our sample had higher 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR than women, mainly in frontal and parietal white matter and thalamus. Previous studies utilizing tau PET imaging have not shown widespread or consistent sex differences in tracer retention [37, 40] , and given that women exhibit a greater degree of AD pathology than men in ex vivo measures of tau [41] , it seems likely that the sex differences we observed are largely driven by nonspecific binding. In addition, we found higher 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR among black individuals in confined regions of the cortex. Black individuals exhibit lower levels of CSF-tau than white individuals [42] , but greater incidence of postmortem neurofibrillary tangle in Braak V/VI in black individuals has also been observed [43] . Race-related differences in 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the choroid plexus have been previously reported [44] , but the proximity of most statistically significant clusters to the edge of the brain in our sample suggests that these findings may be in part due to spill-over from nonspecific binding of the tracer to meningeal neuromelanin. Potential sex and race differences in tau deposition will require further study in large and diverse samples.\nAdjusting for age, sex, and amyloid status, we found that higher entorhinal 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with lower brain volume in the entorhinal cortex. These results are in line with previous findings suggesting that tau accumulation may help explain differences in regional brain volumes while individuals are still cognitively normal [16] [17] [18] , although these studies report more extensive associations.\nAdjusting for age, sex, education, and amyloid status, we observed that greater 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior temporal gyrus was associated with steeper decline in verbal memory performance. This finding reinforces the notion that pathological tau in areas of early accumulation may influence changes in cognitive domains known to be affected in AD even in cognitively normal individuals. In a previous analysis using the BLSA amyloid PET data, we had reported an association between amyloid status and steeper memory decline [45] . Interestingly, this association was not statistically significant in our current analyses including regional 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR as an independent variable. This suggests that tau rather than amyloid deposition may be more strongly associated with cognition, consistent with previous findings [7] . ITG tau PET retention was also associated with lower cross-sectional attention, and retention in the hippocampus was associated with steeper declines in fluency. Some studies have reported a relationship between tau burden and performance in cognitive domains other than memory [13, 46] , although these findings may have been driven by the inclusion of clinically impaired individuals, as this relationship is not consistently seen in CN individuals [21] . This study has several limitations. Although the 18 F-AV-1451 tracer has been demonstrated to have good specificity for tau tangles, it is also known to exhibit nonspecific binding in the basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and to MAO-A, neuromelanin, and pigmented or mineralized vascular structures [47] . We did not perform multiple comparison correction given that a consensus method for correcting for dependent tests in longitudinal data sets is not available. We assessed the relationships between tau tracer retention and cognitive and volume declines retrospectively rather than prospectively because of the relatively recent implementation of tau PET in the BLSA. For this same reason, our sample size was limited, particularly for amyloid1 individuals. Future studies in a larger sample will be necessary to more fully investigate associations between amyloid, 18 F-AV-1451 retention, and time.\nOur study also has several strengths. The considerable amount of longitudinal cognitive testing and structural MRI data from the BLSA allowed us to assess the association between tau tracer retention and retrospective longitudinal decline in these measures over longer periods compared with other studies, and thereby yielding greater confidence in our estimates of rates of change. The spatial resolution of our tau PET scans, at approximately 2.5 mm FWHM at the center of the field of view, compares favorably with that of other studies of tau PET imaging among CN individuals. Better spatial resolution translates to less pronounced the partial volume effects, which is an advantage for image quantification, especially in medial temporal regions that are susceptible to spill-over from the choroid plexus.\nOverall, our results point to a relationship between tau pathology and early changes in cognition in older individuals, even for those without a high degree of pathology or cognitive impairment. These findings also suggest the importance of 18 F-AV-1451 PET for characterizing tau pathology in cognitively intact individuals and as a potential tool for predicting cognitive change early in AD progression. Future studies should investigate prospective cognitive and volumetric changes in relation to both timing and spread of tau deposition and their utility in predicting the trajectory of AD pathologies and symptoms. Effects of tau deposition on changes in other measures of brain integrity, such as brain networks underlying cognitive function, may provide additional insights into the relationship between pathology and cognitive decline in cognitively normal individuals. providing MUSE labels and their contributions to MRI analysis.
