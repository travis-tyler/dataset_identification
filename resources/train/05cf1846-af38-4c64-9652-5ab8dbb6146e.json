[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was initially detected in Wuhan, China [10] , due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has now spread globally via travelers and breached the boundaries of 213 countries and territories, leading to more than 12 million infection cases and 553,000 deaths as of July 7, 2020. In the past two decades, there have been three major zoonotic disease outbreaks of betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed in hospital personnel and family clusters in the early stages of the outbreak [3, 7, 20] . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus and belongs to the betacoronavirus genus. Although intensive investigation, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. Unfortunately, there is no specific antivirus drugs nor effective vaccines developed to moderate this outbreak at present. SARS-CoV-2 has undergone more than ten thousand recorded single mutations compared to the reference genome collected on January 5, 2020 [35, 37] . In general, RNA viruses, except for Nidoviruses, are prone to random mutations because of the lack of the exonuclease proofreading activity of the virus-encoded RNA polymerases, RNA viruses. Nidoviruses, including coronaviruses, have an enzyme to excise erroneous mutagenic nucleotides inserted by RNA polymerases and thus maintain a relatively high accuracy in virus replication and transcription [6] . Human immune system intervention introduces viral mutations. Rapid global spread and transmission of COVID-19 provide the virus with substantial opportunities for the natural selection of rare-acted but favorable mutations. Although most viral mutations are benign, many mutations, such as D614G on the spike (S) protein, strengthen viral survival capability [13, 38] . It is of paramount importance to understand SARS-CoV-2 infectivity changes following the existing mutations and predict the future infection tendency.\nIt is well known that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the interaction of spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [8, 17, 33] . In both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is recognized as on the S1 unit to bind directly to the ACE2. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits [37] . However, lessons learned from SARS-CoV are important in formulating hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2, as well as the receptor recognition when studying SARS-CoV-2 host range, cross-species transmission, and pathogenesis. In the studies of SARS-CoV, epidemiologic and biochemical studies show that the infectivity of different SARS-CoV strains in host cells is proportional to the binding free energy between the RBD of each strain and the ACE2 expressed by the host cell [8, 19, 24, 32, 33] . Therefore, the assessment of binding free energy changes following mutations is vital for the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity evolution.\nIt is challenging to rigorously measure the relative viral infectivities of two dangerous viruses by experiments when one of them is evolving. There is a discrepancy in the literature about the relative S protein-ACE2 binding free energies of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Wrapp et al and Shang et al reported that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding free energy than SARS-CoV does [28, 36] , whereas Walls et al argued that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind with similar free energies to ACE2. [33] The first SARS-CoV-2 genome reported on January 5, 2020 [37] has about 80% sequence identity with that of SARS-CoV. However, compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein has 725 mutations over its 1255 residues. Their sequence identity is only 76%. Among 725 mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, 89 were on the RBD, which has a total of 194 residues, suggesting that the RBD is subject to more mutations. Our recent studies using over 15,000 genome samples show that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is among the most non-conservative ones in its genome [35] . Since early January 2020, hundreds of new mutations were found on different residue positions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Many of them are located on the RBD [35] . The existence of so many different S protein mutations indicates that there are many different SARS-CoV-2 subtypes that might have very different infectivities. Obviously, the relatively high mutation rate at the RBD poses a real threat to the occurrence of future SARS-CoV-2 strains that might be more infectious than the current SARS-CoV-2.\nThe computational estimation of mutation-induced protein-protein binding free energy changes is an important approach for understanding the impact of mutations on protein-protein interactions (PPIs). A variety of advanced methods have been developed [18, 22, 23, 25, 27, 39] . There are many standard databases available, including the AB-Bind database of mutation-induced antibody-antigen complex binding free energy changes [31] and SKEMPI for protein-protein binding free energy changes upon mutation (\u2206\u2206G) [11, 21] . These databases have been used as benchmarks for evaluating the predictive power of various computational methods [18, 22, 23, 25, 27, 39] . To simplify the structural complexity of PPI complexes, we have recently introduced element-specific and site-specific persistent homology, a new branch of algebraic topology [2, 5] , to embed molecular mechanisms into topological invariants [34] . This approach was paired with a new deep learning algorithm called NetTree, to combined convolutional neural networks and gradient boosting trees. The resulting method, called TopNetTree, was about 22% better than the previous best result for the AB-Bind dataset and significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art in the literature on the SKEMPI database [34] .\nThe objective of this work is three-fold. First, we apply the TopNetTree to analyze the impacts of existing S protein RBD mutations on the binding free energy of the S protein and the ACE2. Since different SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have different mutation patterns, it is important to understand their mutation impacts accordingly. We carry out our analysis based on existing six mutation clusters [35] , though more specific analysis can be easily done as well. Additionally, it is also extremely important to know whether future SARS-CoV-2 subtypes would pose an imminent danger to public health. To this end, we have conducted a systematic screening of all possible 3,686 future mutations on all 194 residues (residue IDs from 333 to 526 on S protein) on the RBD. We classify these mutations into three categories: the most likely ones which would happen by a single mutation at any one of three constitutive nucleotides; the likely mutations which would occur via two concurrent mutations at three constitutive nucleotides; and the unlikely mutations which would produce through three concurrent mutations at all of three constitutive nucleotides. Finally, we analyze how existing mutations on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with respect to SARS-CoV have changed its infectivity.\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Figure 1 : The scatter plot of six distinct clusters in the world. The light blue, dark blue, green, red, pink, and yellow represent Cluster I, Cluster II, Cluster III, Cluster IV, Cluster V, and Cluster VI, respectively.

"}, {"section_title": "Global analysis", "text": "To investigate the influences of existing S protein RBD mutations on binding free energy (BA) of S protein and ACE2, the 24715 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome samples deposited at GISAID [29] are compared with the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 collected on January 5, 2020 [37] . The resulting 11904 single mutations are found in six distinct clusters as shown in Table 1 We examine the binding free energy (BFE) changes following the existing site-specific mutations. Our studies are based on the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 (PDB 6M0J) [14] (see Fig S1) , whose S protein gene sequence is consistent with that of the reference SARS-CoV-2 [37] . The BFE change following mutation (\u2206\u2206G) is defined as the subtraction of the BFE of the mutant from the BFE of wild type, \u2206\u2206G = \u2206GW \u2212 \u2206GM where \u2206GW is BFE of the wild type and \u2206GM is BFE of mutant type. Therefore, a positive BFE change means that the mutation increases free energy of the binding complex, making the virus more infective.\nWe present the overall BFE changes \u2206\u2206G of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD in Figure 2 . Most mutations have small changes in their binding free energies, while some of them have large changes. There are 54% mutations on the RBD having positive BFE changes (i.e., 48 over 89), including N439L and S477N that have the highest frequencies. This statistic implies that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is mostly driven by selection and COVID-19 evolves toward more infectious. It is noted that many mutations on the RBM, such as N439K, L452R, T478I, and E484D, have significant free energy changes. The mutations on the RBM take 58% (52 over 89) of all mutations on the RBD, which potentially increases the complexity of antiviral drug and vaccine development. This global analysis indicates that mutations on the RBD strengthen the binding of S protein and ACE2, leading to more infectious SARS-CoV-2.\nWe hypothesize that natural selection favors those mutations that enhance the viral transmission and if our predictions are correct, the predicted infectivity strengthening mutations will outpace predicted infectivity weakening mutations over time. Figure 3 illustrates the increase in the frequency of each mutation on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD. The red and blue lines represent the mutations that strengthen and weaken the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In the first two months, only a few infectivity-strengthening mutations were detected on the S protein RBD. Later on, a few infectivityweakening mutations gradually appeared, while more infectivity-strengthening mutations occurred. It is interesting to note that overall, infectivity-strengthening mutations grow faster than infectivity-weakening SARS-CoV-2 subtypes having infectivity-strengthening mutations are able to infect more people. Specifically, frequencies of S477N, N439K, V483A, and V367F are higher than those of other mutations, indicating these mutations have a stronger transmission capacity.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 genotypes are clustered into six clusters or subtypes based on their single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants [35] . Accordingly, a more detailed analysis of mutation impacts on the BFE changes can be carried out on each cluster, which reveals the diversity of COVID-19 infection rates and provides evidence for transmission pathways and spread dynamics across the world.\nIt is worth noting that residue 414 has three mutations, namely Q414P, Q414E, and Q414R, due to mutations at two adjacent nucleotides 22802 and 22803: 22803A>C, Q414P; 22802C>G, Q414E; and 22803A>G, Q414R. At the protein level, some or all of these mutations show up in different clusters. Similarly, each of residues 354 and 521 has two existing mutations. Other two mutations, N439K and P479S, which have slightly higher frequencies, 11 and 12, and large free energy change amplitudes, attained positive and negative binding free energy changes, respectively. Cluster I has a slightly increase in its infectivity. Cluster I is associated with COVID-19 in most countries except for South Korea [35] . Figure 5 illustrates the binding free energy changes following the mutations of Cluster II. As shown in the figure, there are many mutations on the RBD. However, most mutations are associated with small free energy changes. When only considering the absolute value of BFE changes greater than or equal to 0.5 kcal/mol, seven mutations have positive BFE changes, whereas four mutations have negative BFE changes. Mutation D364Y has the highest frequency and the highest positive free energy change, indicating the increase in infectivity. Overall, Cluster II has a minor increase in infectivity. Note that Cluster II COVID-19 is found in every country that has submitted SARS-CoV-2 genome samples."}, {"section_title": "Cluster III analysis", "text": "From Figure 6 , a slightly increasing trend of binding free energy is observed such that the largest change is positive while the second largest change is negative. Notice that mutation S477N is observed increasing of its frequency in Figure 3 . Interestingly, mutation T478I changes from amino acid with polar uncharged side chains, Threonine, to an amino acid with hydrophobic side chain, Isoleucine, which significantly decreases free energy between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor. Another observation is that mutations that happened in the same residues have similar BFE changes such as P384L and P384S, S477R and S477N, or Q414P and Q414R. Cluster III has a minor increase in infectivity. This cluster involves genome samples from all countries except for South Korea. Notably, most Cluster III samples were submitted by the UK. most frequent mutation of negative change, Q414E, has the BFE change \u2206\u2206G is -0.055 kcal/mol, which is negligible compared with others. The overall trend of this cluster is considered as significantly increasing the COVID-19 infectibility. Note that most genome samples in Cluster IV were submitted by the US. Figure 8 presents the binding free energy changes in the fifth cluster. Eight of sixteen mutations have positive free energy changes. Interestingly, the mutation, N439K, which has the second highest frequency among all clusters also has the largest binding free energy change in Cluster V. In Figure 3 , it indicates that this mutation happens rapidly from Apr 3 to Apr 13. Moreover, most samples in this cluster were submitted from the US. It can be considered that Cluster V and N439K plays a vital role in virus spreading in the US. This cluster is considered as significantly increasing in its infectibility."}, {"section_title": "Cluster VI analysis", "text": "The binding free energy changes in the last cluster is shown in Figure 9 . Japan and South Korea. The US has submitted most samples. Cluster VI is a new cluster of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations have relatively low frequencies.\nIn summary, three of six SARS-CoV-2 clusters, Clusters I, II, and III, have slightly increase infectivity while other three clusters, IV, V, and VI, have become significantly more infectious. Please note that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving and its clustering is changing over time. As a result, the mutation pattern in each cluster changes too. However, the general tendency does not change: the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 makes it more infectious by adapting mutations that increase the binding free energy with the ACE2 receptor."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of most likely future RBD mutations", "text": "In this section and the next section, we analyze the impacts of all of 3686 possible mutations on 194 residues of the S protein RBD. On each amino acid, we classify all 19 possible mutations into most likely future mutations, likely future mutations, and unlikely future mutations. Here, most likely, likely, and unlikely future mutations are defined by the protein mutations induced by only one, simultaneous two, and simultaneous three of genetic changes on three underlying nucleotides on a codon. Based on the codon analysis of all 194 amino acid residues on the RBD, we have 1149 most likely, 1912 likely, and 625 unlikely mutations. We note that the above definitions include existing mutations.\nWe compute the \u2206\u2206Gs following most likely future mutations on the RBD. Figure 10 that mutation Y495N on the RBM has the highest free energy change and if it occurs, it will make the virus significantly more infectious. Additionally, mutation Y489H on the RBM would incur another large infectivity strengthening. It is worthy to note that residue 489 is a potentially hot spot, where 5 possible mutations, Y489H, Y489D, Y489F, Y489C, and Y489N, will lead to the strengthened S protein-ACE2 binding. The other potentially hot spot is residue 423 with Y423C, Y423F, and Y423S being infectivity-strengthening mutations. Residue 452 on the RBM has been proven to be a hot spot as it already has had an existing mutation L452R (see Fig. 7 ) and another infectivity strengthening mutation, L452P. In general, the highest free energy changes are due to mutations on the RBM. However, mutations away from the RBM can have a considerable impact on the infectivity as well.\nThe above analysis considers only BFE strengthening mutations. To have a global view of how future mutations would change the COVID-19 infectivity, we analyze the general trend of the free energy changes of most likely mutations according to 400 possible mutation types. The \u2206\u2206G values following mutations on each amino acid are predicted and averaged by their mutation types. Figure 11 shows the average and variance of \u2206\u2206G (kcal/mol) of each mutation type for most likely mutations on the RBD. Here, y-axes stand for wild type residues, and x-axes are mutant type residues. The colors on the axes are the residue types, namely charged, polar uncharged, hydrophobic, and special cases. The colors in the heat maps indicate the binding free energy changes strengths and directions. It is worthy to note that there are more positive binding free energy changes (green cubes) than negative changes (pink cubes) on the heat map, showing a trend of more infectious COVID19 strains due to most likely future mutations. For example, if a wild type mutation takes place from wide type K, T, N, Q, L, F, or Y to any other residue type except for W, it will end up with a more infectious COVID19 strain. However, mutations from R to T, or from A to many other residue types might lead to a less infectious COVID-19. The large values on the variance map indicate where the above average values might not be reliable. It is seen that the variances are general small. Figure 12 shows a similar trend for the most likely mutations away from the RDM."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of likely and unlikely future RBD mutations", "text": "As discussed above, likely and unlikely future mutations require two and three concurrent nucleotide mutations on each codon to happen, respectively. Figure y-axes: wild type residues; x-axes: mutant type residues. Colors on the axes indicate residue types. strengthen the COVID-19 infectivity. The most energetic adversarial mutation is Y505G. Note that residue 505 has a most likely mutation Y505H shown in Fig. 10 . Therefore, residue 505 is a potentially hot spot on the RBM. The next few energetic adversarial mutations are away from the RBM. Among them, N423P and N422G are hot-spot mutations. Figure 10 shows that residue 423 has three most likely energetic mutations while in Fig. 13 , it has the other three likely energetic mutations. Similarly, residue 489 on the RBM has 5 most likely energetic mutations (see Fig. 10 ) and 4 likely energetic mutations as shown in Fig. 13 . It is on our top surveillance list for the next generation of infectious COVID-19 strains. Another potentially hot spot is residue 495. Figure 14 shows the average and variance of \u2206\u2206G (kcal/mol) of all likely mutations on the RBM where values of most likely mutations and unlikely mutations are excluded. About the same amount of mutations have positive and negative binding free energy changes. In Figure 15 , similar results are shown for the RBD, excluding the RBM. Interestingly, mutations on the RBM have larger magnitude changes rather than out of this region for second potential mutations. It again shows that RBM is the most important region to study. Figure 16 and 17 show the predictions of free energy changes due to unlikely mutations. These mutations have a balanced positive and negative binding free energy changes. We do not expect these mutations to occur in the near future."}, {"section_title": "R H K D E S T N Q", "text": "A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P Variance (kcal/Y365V V511Q N501V Y505G F347N F400A Y423V Y423I Y495R Y423P Y423M Y495Q Y423A L492N N422P N422G Y489G Y489K Y489Q Y489P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P\nA V I L M F Y W C G P R H K D E S T N Q A V I L M F Y W C G P Variance (kcal/"}, {"section_title": "Conservation analysis via sequence alignment", "text": "To further understand the evolutionary trend and potential infectivity changes of the COVID-19, we carry out S protein sequence alignment analysis to analyze residue conservativeness.

Our validated computational method can be employed to resolve this discrepancy. Based on the sequence alignment shown in Figure 18 , we conduct binding free energy change calculations for all relevant mutations on the SARS-CoV S protein RBD. Figure 19 illustrates the S protein-ACE2 binding free energy changes following the mutations from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 complex 3D0G [16] is used as the wide type in our predictions. It is interesting to note that overall, there are more infectivity-strengthening mutations than infectivity-weakening mutations on the RBD. This is particularly true for mutations on the RBM. This result indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 sample collected on January 5, 2020, [37] is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV found in 2003 [15] . This is consistent with experimental results that the binding free energies of ACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are 1.2 nM and 5.0 nM, respectively [33] .\nFor a comparison between various SARS-CoV-2 subtypes and SARS-CoV of 2003, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 in all clusters is more infectious than SARS-CoV.\nCompared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has four extra residues, i.e., PRRA from 681 to 684, as shown in Figure 18 .
