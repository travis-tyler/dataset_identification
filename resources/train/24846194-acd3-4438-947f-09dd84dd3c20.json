[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper is to answer the question \"How can inter-and intra-annual variability in the ocean be leveraged by the submarine Force?\" through quantifying inter-and intra-annual variability in (T, S) fields and in turn underwater acoustic characteristics such as transmission loss, signal excess, and range of detection. The Navy's Generalized Digital Environmental Model (GDEM) is the climatological monthly mean data and represents mean annual variability. An optimal spectral decomposition method is used to produce a synoptic monthly gridded (SMG) (T, S) dataset for the world oceans with 1 o \u00d71 o horizontal resolution, 28 vertical levels (surface to 3,000 m depth), monthly time increment from January 1945 to December 2014 now available at the NOAA/NCEI website: http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgibin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:0140938. The sound velocity decreases from 1945 to 1975 and increases afterwards due to global climate change. Effect of the inter-and intra-annual (T, S) variability on acoustic propagation in the Yellow Sea is investigated using a well-developed acoustic model (Bellhop) in frequencies from 3.5 kHz to 5 kHz with sound velocity profile (SVP) calculated from GDEM and SMG datasets, various bottom types (silty clay, fine sand, gravelly mud, sandy mud, and cobble or gravel) from the NAVOCEANO's High Frequency Environmental Algorithms (HFEVA), source and receiver depths. Acoustic propagation ranges are extended drastically due to the inter-annual variability in comparison with the climatological SVP (from GDEM). Submarines' vulnerability of detection as its depth varies and avoidance of short acoustic range due to inter-annual variability are also discussed."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Temporal and spatial variability of the global temperature and salinity fields is important in climate change. In the past decade, several new coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena regarding the temperature, such as the pseudo-El Nino (or sometimes called central Pacific El Nino) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), were discovered and recognized important in climate variability. The pseudo-El Nino is characterized by warmer sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the central equatorial Pacific and cooler SSTA in the eastern and western equatorial Pacific [1] [2] , which is different from the El Nino with anomalous warming in eastern equatorial Pacific. El Nino and pseudo-El Nino have different teleconnection patterns. Taking the Atlantic Ocean as an example, less tropical storms and hurricanes occur during El Ni\u00f1o events; and more tropical storms and hurricanes appear during pseudo-El Nino events [2] . Chu [3] presented heat content tripole in world oceans and found the connection between interannual thermal variability in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean. The variability regarding salinity is also important since freshwater gaining from river run-off, surface freshwater flux [precipitation-evaporation (P-E)], and freshwater advection reduces upper layer salinity, stabilizes the water column, and in turn slows down the meridional overturning circulation (MOC).\nUsing regional data, Phillips and Wijffels [4] identified an average freshening of 0.2 psu extending from 100 o E to Australia, 25 o S to Indonesia and down to 180 m depth, for more than 3 years from 1999 to 2002. The observed freshening can be largely explained as a direct response to changes in the air-sea freshwater exchange. Boyer et al. [5] calculated linear trends of zonally averaged salinity anomalies from 1955-1959 through 1994-1998 from the World Ocean Database 2001 (WOD01) and identified freshening and salinization in ocean basins such as freshening in most of the Pacific with the exception of the subtropical South Pacific, deep freshening in the Atlantic subpolar gyre, shallow salinization in the Atlantic tropics and subtropics, and salinization in the Indian Ocean at all latitudes in the upper 150 meter layer, with a subsurface freshening between 40 o S and the equator in the 250-1000 meter layer.\nUp until now, detailed temporal and spatial variability of global temperature and salinity fields has not been investigated from the observational data. This is because ocean observational (T, S) data are irregularly distributed in time and space. To fill the gap, several synoptic monthly gridded (SMG) (T, S) datasets have been produced at the NPS Department of Oceanography [6] with a sufficient resolution in space (1   o   \u00d71 o in global oceans and 0.25 o \u00d70.25 o in several regional seas) and in time (monthly increment) using the optimal spectral decomposition (OSD) method [7] [8] [9] [10] . These datasets have undergone thorough quality control by NOAA/NCEI scientists. With SMG (T, S) data, impact of intra-and inter-annual (T, S) variability on acoustical transmission can be identified."}, {"section_title": "OPTIMAL SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION", "text": "The optimal spectral decomposition (OSD) method [7] [8] [9] [10] is used to produce the SMG-(T, S) datasets, which are distributed openly at the NOAA/NCEI website.

To assess the impact of the inter-and intra-annual variability on the acoustic propagation, temporally varying (T, S) profile data at selected location ( and then the SSP can be calculated. Fig. 4 shows temporal varying (T, S, SSP) profiles at the 5 locations in the Mediterranean Sea. The temperature profiles at all the locations exhibit strong seasonal variation associated with surface heat fluxes and variations in the vertical structure of water column. However, the seasonality in the Mediterranean Sea (as an example) is strongly modulated by inter-annual and decadal variability ( At location-C the sea surface temperature exhibited a strong decadal variability especially between 2000 and 2014, the surface water gets warmer and this warmer water penetrated to deeper layers. An anomalously deep penetration of warm water down to 300 meters was observed during summer 1992. Interestingly, it was accompanied by colder than usual surface temperature and rather shallow mixed layer at the end of spring. Anomalously warm surface water but no deepening of the warm surface layer was observed during the summer 2012. At location-D (Fig. 4, left panels) , a strong contrast existed in summer surface temperatures before and after 1980. The temperature at the surface started to increase after 1980. Before the 1980, the surface water is about 24 \u00b0C. Then it gets warmer at the surface and reaches 29 \u00b0C. Between 2000 and 2014 years, the warmer water starts to penetrate down to 400 meters. At location-E temperature increased between 1990 and 2014. The water between surface and a depth of 20 meters reached the higher temperature than previous years; however, the warmer water penetrated to deeper layer between 1997 and 1998. Sea surface temperatures between 1960 and 1990 were lower than later decades.\nThe salinity showed evident inter-annual variations at all locations ( "}, {"section_title": "SEDIMENT DATABASES AND GEOACOUSTIC PARAMETERS", "text": "There are four unclassified sediment databases: Enhanced, Standard, Reduced, and High Frequency Environmental Acoustics (HFEVA). The bottom sediment characteristics of the research area of interest can be extracted from any one of these databases, but with varying degrees of resolution available across the globe. \"The Enhanced is the actual database that is maintained by NAVOCEANO. It is suitable for researchers and developers with technical geologic knowledge, or in cases where the most geologic information is desired\" [17] . Due to the redundancy and sometimes ambiguous nature of the large enhanced dataset, it is generally considered too cumbersome for operational application. Operational or tactical use of the data is best retrieved from a subset of the total data such as HFEVA (Table 2 , used in the present research), reduced, or standard. Table 2 . HFEVA sediment categories [17] . The HFEVA sediment categories are provided in Table 2 . HFEVA categories range from 1-23, with two additional; 888 referring to \"no data\" and 999 referring to \"land.\" The enhanced database includes 88 and 999, but the categories range from 0102-6890. The comparison between the HFEVA and the enhanced is that, grouping many similar bottom types under one category heading for simplification. For example, within the enhanced database code 3308 is listed as clay with the additional categorization as hemi-pelagic and terrigenous (HT). This corresponds to code 23 in the HFEVA database, which denotes a bottom type of clay. Depending on the field of study, it may be important to know that \"pelagic and hemi-pelagic sediments are mostly fine-grained deposits, the product of slow deposition in typically low-energy depositional environments\" which make up 50% of the Earth's surface (Garrison 1990) . However, when the bottom type is composed of small particulate matter that responds acoustically similar regardless of the origin (land/sea, organic/inorganic) then less granularity of classification is required. Each sediment dataset for interested areas is plotted in order to determine which dataset is most appropriate for this research. The baseline resolution extracted was 1 o . Individual sediment plots were also mapped at resolutions of 0.5\u00ba and 5.0\u00ba for comparison to the 1\u00ba resolution sediment data to see if there were significant differences necessitating resolutions other than 1\u00ba. The bottom type and bathymetry at selected locations (see Fig. 3 ) are presented in Table 3 for the Yellow Sea, Table 4 for the Philippine/South China Seas, and Table 5 for the Mediterranean Sea. The geoacoustic parameters for the acoustic model vary based on the bottom type as determined from the sediment database. The pertinent geoacoustic parameters to this research are the attenuation coefficient and, the compressional sound speed, and the sediment density. The attenuation coefficient is calculated at each location (sediment type). The compressional sound speed (sound speed ratio) and the density are available in Table 6 . From the sediment types listed in Tables 3-5 , the geoacoustic parameters for the acoustic model can be determined. Table 6 .

Bellhop is designed in order to perform twodimensional acoustic ray tracing for a given sound speed profile c(z) or a given sound speed field c(r, z), in ocean waveguides with at or variable absorbing boundaries.\" The bottom absorbing boundary is of particular interest in the research due the shallow water depths of the Yellow Sea. Modeling acoustic transmission with ray profiles is a common method for studying and understanding how sounds energy propagates within a given sound channel [18] . Dong et al. [19] confirmed strong agreement between BELLHOP and range-dependent acoustic model (RAM) developed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) [20] after comparing model-predicted transmission loss. The sediment type translates into a bottom reflectivity coefficient. \"To specify an arbitrary bottom reflection coefficient to characterize the bottom, then one must provide a bottom reflection coefficient file with angle-reflection pairs defining the reflectivity\" [18] . Along with SSP profiles, they are environmental inputs into BELLHOP in order to produce a ray trace and further calculate transmission loss for ocean acoustics (Fig. 5) . Transmission loss (TL) in decibels, dB, is calculated from the pressure field. While pressure in not a direct input parameter for BELLHOP it is generated from the depths input. The conversion for pressure, p, to dB is 20log10(|p|). Transmission loss can be plotted in three different ways in BELLHOP. The user may select run criteria to plot transmission loss as coherent, incoherent, or semi-coherent depending on the desired detail of the acoustic field. Coherent transmission loss runs provided the most acoustic detail of the interferences patterns, but it also takes the longest to run. When such fine-patterned interference is not required, the user should select incoherent transmission loss, essentially an averaged transmission loss across a band of frequencies. Incoherent should not be used for deterministic forecasts. The third option, semi-coherent is essentially a combination of the previous two; it captures some but not all of the effects from interference.

The Navy predominantly used mid-frequency sonar for prosecuting AIP diesel submarines; the mid-frequency range for this paper is considered to be 0.5 kHz to 5 kHz. The full extent of naval sonar capability extends beyond this mid-range, and the Navy will sometimes use specific systems that are of lower frequency for long-range detection, or higher frequencies as the tactical situation requires. Here, 3.5 kHz sound source is taken as an example for illustration. The sound source is placed at (8 m, 20 m) depths for the Yellow Sea, 40 m for the Mediterranean Sea, South China Sea, and Philippine Sea. For the Yellow Sea (shallow water with maximum water depth of 80 m), the sound frequency did not have a large impact on the TL when the sound source varying from 3.5 kHz to 0.5 kHz [15] . As determined from the SSP profiles, the greatest deviation from the total mean SSP profile occurred in August, and the least variation in January across all locations. TL was modeled for both SMG-WOD and GDEM at each location. The launching angle discretized with increment of 10 o , with varying combinations of source depth (SD) to receiver depth (RD). In order to quantify the propagation ranges to allow for comparison, several TL thresholds were used such as 60 dB, 70 dB, 80 dB, 90 dB, and 100 dB loss in order to analyze the difference in rates of TL across various locations in quantitative manner. The mean and maximum ranges with (SSP from SMG-WOD) and without interannual variability (SSP from GDEM) for all launching angles, and all source to receiver depths are listed for January (Tables 7-8) and August (Tables 9-10) for the Yellow Sea, which show large difference.

These effects vary with the location and time period. The overall average TL ranges between the two datasets same, but because SMG-WOD data contains intra-and inter-annual variability, several extended ranges were found for acoustic transmission that break out well past the GDEM TL ranges, not by a mere one or two km but in some cases twice the average TL range such that 20km detection range may jump to 40 km depending in the environment at the time.\nThis research also reveals the sensitivity of BELLHOP; it is sensitive enough to produce different TL results based on the variations of source and receiver depths when given the same SSP input. BELLHOP is also sensitive to the attenuation values for the bottom sediment, as location E in the Yellow Sea had the hardest, most reflective bottom type and the in both datasets it modeled the longest ranges as opposed to most of the other locations being silty clay or mud and BELHHOP modeled significantly shorter ranges.\nFor a general study, either database (SMG-WOD or GDEM) would be relevant because the average TL ranges are very close, but for tactical naval application, this research shows that in shallow water, the TL range variations between the two datasets can be significant. Just a few km extension of TL range can greatly increase the entire ensonification coverage area, which is crucial for sonar operators on submarines or ships, or of unmanned. This research shows that TL ranges may vary up to 10km or further, depending on the combination of source depth to receiver depth, which is important since submarines are not fixed in a vertical position. As the submarine varies its depth, it can greatly affect its detection vulnerability, or based on the season, it may choose to avoid an entire shallow operating area where ranges are poor.\nThis research is very specific to the Mediterranean Sea, Philippine Sea, and South China, and Yellow Sea Yellow Sea, as it such a shallow body of water, and while it may produce results comparable to other shallow bodies of water such as the Arabian Gulf, it would provide greater insight to actually conduct this same study but in multiple other ocean. For deeper oceans, the resolution differences between the datasets may not impact the results, and the SSPs will have different structures as no correlation was found between the SSP variability and any published indices, a beneficial future area of research would be to pair an oceanographic study of acoustic variability with a meteorological study to develop and test various EAMIs and the search for a correlation to acoustics. It would also be valuable to expand upon this research by comparing in situ TL data ranges to the projection of SMG-WOD and GDEM ranges in order to see how the real world matches up to the models."}]
