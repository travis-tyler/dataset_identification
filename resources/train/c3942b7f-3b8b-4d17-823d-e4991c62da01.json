It has recently been qualified by the European Medicines Agency as an enrichment marker that can be used for subject enrolment in clinical trials on predementia AD [6] . However, a number of different protocols for manual segmentation exist [7, 8] , leading to highly heterogeneous volume estimates [7] and preventing its reliable use. The European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) investigators, supported by the Alzheimer's Association, have undertaken a project aimed to develop a Harmonized Protocol (HarP) for the manual segmentation of the boundaries of the whole hippocampus on MR scans [5, 9] (www.hippocampal-protocol.net), and specifically on T1 weighted volumetric MR scans, the most frequently used sequence for hippocampal volumetry.\nEarlier steps of the project have been described previously [10] [11] [12] . A survey of the available protocols was carried out: the 12 protocols most frequently used in the AD literature were examined, used to carry out segmentation using ADNI scans, and submitted to the authors of the protocols to certify the correct understanding and use of each protocol. Landmarks were extracted (www.hippocampal-protocol.net) [10] , and operationalized into seven segmentation units (SUs): minimum hippocampal body (the common region included by all protocols), alveus/fimbria, subiculumoblique, horizontal, and morphology, tail-crura, and wholetail. Validity metrics of SUs were estimated such as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) test-retest and inter-rater reliability, and contribution to AD-related atrophy [11] .\nThe present report describes how validity metrics of SUs were fed to a panel of international experts with substantial expertise on hippocampal segmentation and how, through a recursive and anonymous Delphi procedure, experts converged to a consensual definition on whole hippocampus boundaries segmentation. This consensual definition of the EADC-ADNI HarP for Manual Hippocampal Segmentation has subsequently been validated versus existing protocols [13] and pathology [14] . Benchmark images of hippocampi segmented according to the HarP have been produced to serve as reference for the qualification of na\u20ac \u0131ve tracers [15] and automated segmentation algorithms [16] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Delphi voting procedure", "text": "We sought a consensual definition of the protocol for hippocampal segmentation through a Delphi panel procedure.

In the subsequent rounds (rounds 2-5), for each item they were asked to quantify their agreement with the choices preferred by the majority in previous round through 9-level Likert scales. For these rounds, the questionnaire was integrated with both answers and related statistics from the previous round, and with a summary of the reasons why each choice was preferred. Reasons expressed for the less popular choices were also reported alongside with statistics.

In this way, panelists could evaluate and integrate their preferences based on personal experience in manual hippocampal segmentation on (usually) the 2D coronal plane with the quantitative data collected and attributed to the segmentation units rendered in 3D.

Issues addressed in the questionnaires were divided into \"Landmarks\" and \"Segmentation procedures\". The \"Landmarks\" section was aimed to provide the definition of the anatomical boundaries of the whole hippocampus for the HarP, choosing among the range observed in the 12 surveyed protocols. The selection of landmarks was handled through the SUs defined in Boccardi et al. [11] . Briefly, all landmark differences extracted from the most popular protocols in the AD literature [10] were operationalized into SUs, i.e., \"pieces\" of hippocampus that can be included or not in the segmentation, depending on the corresponding landmark definition. Some of these SUs were named as hippocampal subfields for their being roughly overlapping with them, but they only represent the variability of landmarks across the surveyed protocols. With this method, quantitative information could be obtained for each of these SUs, and the choice of inclusion or exclusion of SUs by the Delphi panel thus corresponded to landmarks definition. To facilitate communication with panelists, SUs were rendered as 3D objects by modeling the segmentations performed in the previous steps of this project [11] . In this way, panelists could evaluate the quantitative evidence while having a rather concrete idea of which part of the hippocampus was included or excluded with each landmark selection, and what did this mean in terms of size of the included or excluded tissue, of increase or decrease in segmentation reliability, and of informative power of each \"piece\" of hippocampus as to AD pathology. Panelists were accurately informed about how this information was collected. They were experts in hippocampal anatomy and segmentation, and they could thus evaluate each question on landmark definition considering both points of view of their personal experience in segmenting based on specific landmarks on the 2D coronal plane, and evaluate the quantitative evidence corresponding to those landmarks that we collected and rendered through the 3D segmentation units.\nThe \"Segmentation procedures\" section aimed to have panelists converge on a number of disputed or ambiguous technical segmentation issues."}, {"section_title": "Definition of anatomical landmarks", "text": "For their reference, panelists were presented the definition and 3D renderings of a union of ( Fig. 2A ) and individual ( Fig. 2B, 2C ) SUs, together with hyperlinks to the tables reporting the pertinent quantitative information published [11] . Briefly, these tables reported percent values of the SU volume relative to total hippocampal volume, ICC of intra-and inter-rater reliability in the segmentation of each SU, and percent tissue reduction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared with controls as computed from the preliminary phase of this project [11] . Interactive 3D models ( Fig. 2D ) were built dynamically to help panelists evaluate the results of their choices (Fig. 2C) .\nReports describing the previous steps of the project [10, 11] were made available for the exclusive use of panelists in the context of this Delphi exercise.\nBecause the \"minimum hippocampal body\" (red SU in Fig. 2D ) was included by all of the protocols surveyed in Boccardi et al. [10] , this SU was described, but it was included a priori in the protocol, and no decisions were taken with respect to its inclusion or borders. Therefore, the inclusion of the full hippocampal head and the definition of the ventral, lateral, and dorsal borders of the hippocampal gray matter in the head and body were defined based on the preexisting agreement among the most popular protocols in the AD literature [10, 11] . Similarly, structures that were consistently excluded in the surveyed protocols (such as the entorhinal cortex) were not proposed as possible structures to include, but were a priori excluded from the HarP.\nQuestions fed to the Delphi panel covered the following:\n(1) Inclusion of the alveus/fimbria (dichotomous choice, proposed from round 1); (2) Definition of the medial border of the hippocampal body (proposed from round 1). Panelists were invited to choose one out of four options: (1) vertical line from the above CA1 to the parahippocampal white matter (no subiculum, as described in Convit et al. [18] , (2) oblique line following the inclination of the medial parahippocampal white matter (\"subiculum-oblique\"), as described in refs. [19, 20] , and used to collapse different arbitrary oblique lines [11] ), (3) horizontal line, obtained through a line drawn horizontally from the uppermost point of the medial parahippocampal white matter to the cistern cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as described in Haller et al. [21] and Bartzokis et al. [22] , (4) morphologic shape, consisting of following the boundary that can be identified from the morphology of the parahippocampal cortex, as in refs. [23] [24] [25] [26] ; (3) Definition of the most caudal slice (proposed from round 1). The choice was proposed among three options: (1) \"no tail\", terminating segmentation at the level where both the superior and inferior collicula are visible, as described in Bartzokis et al. [22] , (2) \"crus-crura\", terminating segmentation at the level where the crura of the fornices could first be seen in full profile [24, 26] , (3) \"all tail\", segmenting until the last ovoid shape of hippocampal gray matter could be detected; (4) Inclusion of vestigial tissue (proposed from round 1). The issue was initially proposed to explore whether, in the opinion of panelists, the 3D tools currently used enable to segment reliably the Andrea Retzius and the fasciolar gyri. From round 2, when a first preference emerged from panelists for including the whole tail, the opportunity to include the vestigial tissue was proposed as a dichotomous item.\n( Table 1) An example of questions proposed to the panelists can be found in Fig. 2C .

Panelists agreed on separating the fimbria from the fornices, in the caudal coronal view, at the level where the white matter tract changes inclination, diverging from hippocampal gray matter in its longitudinal extension ( Table 2 ). Panelists also agreed on alerting tracers to attempt to see structures that are not visible on MR, but that may be expected based on a priori anatomical knowledge, such as the subiculum in very atrophic subjects. Methods which can be used to identify such structures include changing image contrast and 3D navigation. Panelists agreed not to segment such structures if, after these visualization attempts, they remain nondetectable ( Table 2; Appendix II) .\nWith respect to MR orientation, most panelists (62.5% versus 6.2%, P 5 .012) initially agreed on orienting MRs Abbreviations: Mdn, median value at Likert scale. ; n.s., not significant; AC-PC, anterior commissure-posterior commissure; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.

See Results and Discussion. based on the long axis of the hippocampus, while 31.3% expressed neither agreement nor disagreement for image orientation, stating that both orientations would lead to good segmentation results. However, the issue was reproposed due to a methodological problem: all of the data made available to panelists were collected on AC-PC oriented images. These data, including segmentation reliability, influenced the panelists choices, but there was no guarantee that segmentation on a different orientation would be characterized by the same reliability and informative power features, based on which panelists took their decisions. To fully understand this problem, new quantitative data were collected [12] , aimed to compare inter-rater reliability on images oriented along the hippocampal axis and along AC-PC. This additional information, that was not previously available in the literature, indicated nonsignificantly higher ICC values for AC-PC than hippocampal oriented images, but significantly greater overlapping reliability for segmentations in AC-PC oriented images [12] . As it can be appreciated in Fig. 2 in ref. [12] , the CSF inlet between the hippocampal head and the amygdala is more clearly visible in AC-PC images than in images oriented along the hippocampal axes. This provides a better visual separation of the two structures and of their boundaries, in a region that is typically a major source of segmentation mistakes and disagreement. Examples of performance and spatial overlapping between three tracers on AC-PC and on hippocampal axes oriented images can be visualized at the following links:\nWorst overlapping among three tracers on images oriented along the hippocampal axis: http://www.centroalzheimer.it/ public/MB/SOPs/PaperCheck4Axes/Subject_09_worseAxis_ Right.mov Worst overlapping among three tracers on AC-PC oriented images: http://www.centroalzheimer.it/public/MB/ SOPs/PaperCheck4Axes/Subject_09_worseACPC_Left.mov Best overlapping among three tracers on images oriented along the hippocampal axis: http://www.centroalzheimer.it/ public/MB/SOPs/PaperCheck4Axes/Subject_04_bestAxis_ Left.mov\nBest overlapping among three tracers on AC-PC oriented images: http://www.centroalzheimer.it/public/MB/SOPs/ PaperCheck4Axes/Subject_03_bestACPC_Right.mov These data were thus supplied to the Delphi panel, together with the description of the methodological problem, and panelists converged on deciding that the AC-PC orientation was most suitable for segmentation ( Table 2) .\nA detailed description of all landmarks and segmentation procedures is reported in Appendix II: \"User Manual\"."}, {"section_title": "Statistics", "text": "A 9-level Likert scale was used to express level of agreement, 1 corresponding to minimum, 9 to maximum agreement.

P values from Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate inhomogeneity of answers across levels of agreement.

The Horizontal Line criterion for segmenting the subiculum at the level of the hippocampal body was significantly agreed on as a second choice criterion, for those slices where no morphologic details allow to clearly identify a medial boundary on the MR (Figs. 2 and 3) . The inclusion of the vestigial tissue in the hippocampal tail was agreed on by most panelists, although this is the only item for which agreement did not reach statistical significance on the binomial test (63% of agreement for inclusion, P (Fisher's) 5 .022, (binomial) 5 .454).\nThe previously given set of landmarks (besides the horizontal line and the vestigial tissue definitions) was chosen by most panelists from the first round, and, as a whole, it was significantly agreed on in round 2 (88%, P 5 .001). However, the voting rounds had been carried out until statistically significant convergence was achieved for each individual item (except vestigial tissue).\nBased on the quantitative investigation previously performed [11] , we computed that the hippocampus as defined previously covers 100% of hippocampal tissue, captures 100% of AD-related hippocampal atrophy, and, measured across three experts from independent centers (Brescia, Mayo Clinic, LONI), has good intra-rater (Tracer 1: 0.99 (confidence interval or CI 95%: 0.96-1 Tracer 2: 0.98 (0.94-1), and Tracer 3: 0.95 (0.83-0.99) for the left, and 0.99 (0.97-1), 0.99 (0.96-1), and 0.97 (0.88-0.99) for the right hippocampus) and inter-rater (left: 0.94 (0.79-0.98); right: 0.94 (0.81-0.99) reliability [12] ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we achieved a consensus on landmarks and procedures to define a HarP for the manual segmentation of the boundaries of the whole hippocampus from high resolution T1 weighted MR scans. Panelists converged on the most inclusive definition of the hippocampus, including alveus and fimbria, the whole hippocampal tail including the vestigial gray matter, and the subiculum segmented following morphologic details. Until now, different laboratories have produced very heterogeneous measures mainly due to the use of different segmentation protocols [7, 8] . This EADC-ADNI HarP provides standard procedures for manual hippocampal segmentation expected to obtain homogeneous measurements, facilitating direct comparisons across studies. Preliminary data showed very high interrater reliability across different laboratories [12] . Detailed validity metrics of the HarP have been specifically evaluated in the subsequent proper validation phases, comparing its reliability with that of currently used local protocols, and estimating variance due to different sources (tracer, side, time point, scanner, magnet field strength) [13] .\nThe consensual definition was achieved through five Delphi rounds. The Delphi procedure was modified to accommodate empirical evidence. First, in a preliminary phase quantitative information was collected to allow panelists to make decisions with the aid of empirical evidence [10, 11] . Secondly, panelists were asked to justify their choices, so that in the subsequent round provision of reasons for preferred choices, in addition to statistics was made. This enabled panelist to re-evaluate their positions and move toward a consensus based on a richer base of information. Finally, agreement was achieved when a statistically significant majority-rather than a simple majority-was obtained, with only one exception, where one out of two tests was not significant. Understandably, a few disagreements still remained to the last rounds, but this was confined to a maximum of 2 out of 16 panelists.\nQuantitative information was supplied, to help panelists base decisions on evidence. Indeed, some criteria widely used in currently available segmentation protocols, such as the use of arbitrary lines, were based on pragmatic definitions that had never been quantitatively investigated in this way. For example, the segmentation of the medial border of the hippocampal body based on the visible morphology, or of the tail, was often mistrusted as possibly less reliable than segmentation based on arbitrary lines, with consequent exclusion of even wide portions of hippocampus, for the right sake of reliability. The data that we collected in the preliminary phase [11] gave reassuring information regarding the segmentation of visible shape from MR, and panelists could base their choice on empirical measurement of variables specifically pertinent to the definition of a segmentation protocol for AD, instead of basing their choices on legitimate but untested worries.\nPanelists's justifications for their answers denoted that they made wide use of the empirical information contained in the questionnaires ( Table 2 ). It should be stressed however that answers were not uniquely guided by evidence; panelists' mandate was in fact to use evidence to implement their personal experience. Moreover, panelists were asked to factor in their choices the possibility of reliably transferring information and segmentation instructions between different raters and laboratories.\nFor one item (image orientation) the questionnaire was re-submitted to panelists after consensus had been reached. This was due to the fact that the chosen orientation along the long hippocampal axis was not consistent with the whole set of data that panelists examined while formulating their choices, which were collected on AC-PC oriented images. Before raising this issue to the panel, new data were collected evaluating the reliability of segmentation on the long hippocampal axis and AC-PC line [12] , something so far unexplored. This investigation showed that segmentations on AC-PC images lead to higher inter-rater reliability. When reproposed to the Delphi panel, the AC-PC line orientation was chosen based both on methodological consistency within the project and evidence of higher overlap of segmented labels across tracers.\nOn the whole, this \"evidence-based Delphi panel\", to our knowledge the first of its kind, seems to have efficiently guided panelists toward convergence. The very initial prediction that the HP could have been defined as a sort of average between the protocols defined or preferred by those participating to the Delphi panel was actually contradicted by results, indicating that the product of this work is an entirely new definition, not uniquely based on possible personal bias of participants, but emerged as the result of a complex procedure that could keep into account a large set of pertinent variables."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The heterogeneities among hippocampal volume estimates across different laboratories using different protocols might arise from sources of variability that were not addressed in the present study. A theoretically relevant source of variability is represented by the different software and settings used for manual segmentation, visualization and volume computation. To date, it is agreed that the available 3D visualization tools greatly improve hippocampal segmentation, and the check of landmarks and morphology in all of the three planes is required for proper segmentation [10] . However, this is allowed through different tools and in different modalities across the available tools. Some software interpolates MR information to provide a clearer rendering of the brain, thus appearing more similar to the real brain than to the voxelized MR. However, there is no evidence on how such interpolation may interfere with appropriate segmentation, nor has any quantitative information ever been collected about reliability of segmentation carried out in these different visualization conditions. In the same way, the visualization of the segmented region is rendered differently by different tools, with some tools showing only the position of the cursor in the 3D planes, and outlining the trace only in the coronal plane, and others filling all of the voxels included in the segmentation with bold color in all three planes, thus making very clearly apparent not only the landmarks, but also the segmented tissue, in all planes. As well, some tools allow not just visualization, but also the editing of segmentation in the 3 planes. The different contribution of these heterogeneous tools to proper hippocampal segmentation should be investigated, and a standard procedure making use of the most helpful tool should be defined on the basis of such evidence that, to our knowledge, has not yet been collected for the specific field of hippocampal volumetry.\nIn this study, and in the whole project, we have kept all variables constant. In this way, we ruled out discrepancies due to different segmentation tools, but have not been able to estimate any different contribution that they may provide, a task that needs being carried out to set proper standard operating procedures for all steps involved in hippocampal volumetry. More precisely, we chose a freely available software allowing subvoxel segmentation and subvoxel volume computation (i.e., http://www.loni.ucla.edu/Software/ MultiTracer). The free distribution of MultiTracer and the accuracy of segmentation allowed by the subvoxel brush are highly desirable features that may facilitate widespread use of this tool for standard hippocampal volumetry. However, this software has other disadvantages, particularly the very limited visualization of the segmented tissue on the sagittal and axial planes (when segmentation is carried out in coronal). Based on all of the above considerations, we must thus underline that hippocampal volumetry as defined by the HarP landmarks and procedures (/centroalzheimer.it/ public/SOPs/online/HarmonizedProtocol_ACPC_UserMa-nual_Biblio.Pdf) is not necessarily bound to the methods used in this project. Many features of the different segmentation tools must be carefully evaluated before any final decision is taken about which one should be adopted in the complete standard procedure. In this study we only aimed to provide a standard definition of landmarks and on how to handle specific issues in hippocampal segmentation from MR. This provides a protocol that would prove reliable in AD clinic and research, independently on any other confounding variable, that will need to be addressed in subsequent steps.\nAnalogous problems arise regarding the computation of total intracranial volume, used to correct hippocampal volumes. We never corrected hippocampal volumes in the different steps of this project, so we did not introduce this sort of variability. This value, however, will be required when using the HarP for both clinical and research aims, and proper investigation aimed to identify the optimal estimate needs to be carried out before defining a standard procedure.\nMoreover, individual variability of course affects landmarks, and may affect segmentation variability based on different landmarks. We were not able to exactly quantify this effect, however, the reliability estimates of segmentation units used to help panelists in their decisions were computed on a sample of 77 subjects [11] , therefore our estimates may be considered relatively stable on this regard. Future steps of this project will involve the quantification of the variability due to subject in the validation of the HarP [13] , and the production of benchmark HarP segmentations on a set of 135 different subjects, to allow training on a wide range of morphologic variability for future tracers and for automated algorithms [16] .\nDifferent definitions for hippocampal segmentation may be useful for different aims, especially in areas of research other than AD. However, the definition of the HarP is inclusive enough that it covers most needs, at least as long as one is interested in measuring the whole hippocampus.\nOn the other hand, the inclusive definition of the HarP does include some structures that may not be considered as hippocampus proper, like the alveus and fimbria and the subiculum. These structures were included because their boundaries with the proper hippocampal gray matter can not be segmented reliably on ordinarily used MR scans. Because they also show a similar degree of atrophy as found in the rest of the hippocampal tissue in AD [11] , their inclusion has been considered acceptable for AD studies. However, the recently initiated project of harmonization of hippocampal subfields segmentation may provide evidence and consensus regarding subfield delineation (http://www. hippocampalsubfields.com/).\nIf the use of the HarP may be regarded as adequate also in different settings than the dementia-related, we should consider that its adoption by centers that are not expert in hippocampal volumetry may be challenging under some respects. The main issue consists in the fact that many users, unfamiliar to hippocampal segmentation, will undergo training a remoto, through a standard system. So far, the rather complex task of hippocampal segmentation was typically taught to new tracers in training sessions carried out personally by experts. The standard use of the HarP will require that sufficiently clear instructions are provided, allowing people in the world to familiarize with the segmentation tool, the preprocessing of the MR, and the segmentation of the hippocampus as prescribed. Within our harmonization project, we have created and tested a standard web-platform [27] devised to train people unfamiliar to the HarP to segment based on the consensual landmarks described in this article. Preliminary data suggest that this system works also for trainees who are not expert of hippocampal segmentation. However, tutorials explaining the whole procedure through a narrated video, reporting performance of segmentation examples with special attention to regions that are frequent sources of mistakes should be produced to help filling the gap of remote communication. We can also anticipate that the large amount of work foreseen for the standard use of hippocampal segmentation for Alzheimer's disease will soon be performed by automated algorithms, due to the long time and effort required by manual segmentation. Therefore, even greater efforts will be deployed to implement automated segmentation. These would easily be used in both expert and non expert centers. However, implementation of their use will require the development of user-friendly interfaces, and, more importantly and upstream, of accurate and evidencebased criteria enabling their certification as medical devices.\nThe subsequent steps of this project consist in the validation of the protocol [13] and the production of a large set of benchmark images reflecting appropriate hippocampal segmentation [16] . This set of actions will define a reliable and standard procedure for hippocampal segmentation, as a first step to the use of standard hippocampal volumetry in routine clinical and research activities.\nClinicians and researcher will be able to use hippocampal volumetry to apply, together with the panel of biomarkers recently defined for AD, the International Working Group/ National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association groups and European Medicines Agency criteria [1] [2] [3] [4] for diagnostic or enrichment aims in the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment; developers will be provided with a gold standard against which to validate their automated segmentation algorithms."}]
