[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Humans are innately averse to uncertainty. When uncertain, stress levels increase and peoples' mental health can suffer (1, 2) . The global coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid- 19) pandemic created a situation of severe uncertainty fuelled by disruptions finance, politics, social life and healthcare domains. As such, the pandemic constitutes an immense psychological challenge and puts at risk people's mental health.\nFirst studies have reported adverse psychological consequences of the pandemic among people with and without pre-existing mental health conditions. Patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia (3) (4) (5) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (6) were reported to experience a pandemic-related increase in symptoms. Likewise, the general public reported worsened mental health with a rise primarily seen in anxiety and depression levels (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) .\nOCD is likely to be disproportionally affected by the pandemic. Many OCD symptoms evolve around contamination and cleaning (13) , the key focus of Covid-related information campaigns. These news coverages and governmental guidelines may thus give validity to OCD-symptomatic behaviour, potentially intensifying or triggering them. Indeed, first evidence suggested a worsening of symptoms in OCD patients during the pandemic (6) . Moreover, as contamination-related concerns and behaviours increase in the general public, obsessivecompulsive (OC) symptoms may also be triggered in non-patient populations.\nElevated levels of psychiatric symptoms after a stressor, such as the pandemic onset, are common. Decades of research demonstrated that mental health worsens after stressful events (14,15). However, importantly, psychiatric levels usually improve after a reasonable time without inflicting long-term impairments (16) (17) (18) . This adaptation process has been attributed to coping and (re-)appraisal strategies (19) . A failure of this process, however, may lead to long-term adverse consequences and chronic mental-health problems (16, 17) . It is thus critical to not only assess momentary increases in psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic, but to also investigate the long-term trajectories of these symptoms.\nHere, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal study investigating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on OC, anxiety, and depression symptoms. We tracked these psychiatric scores over a period of several months and show that OC symptoms continuously increase, whilst anxiety and depression level and diminish . Moreover, we investigated how these symptoms impacted Covid-related information seeking and adherence to governmental .

This was approximately at the peak of the first pandemic wave in the UK (Figure 1 ). The second data collection (T2) directly followed the largest lift in pandemic-related restrictions in the UK (i.e. reopening of restaurants and pubs) which allowed us to assess the adaptation of mental health symptoms to a substantial environmental change.

Similarly, we found that OC symptoms predicted increased guideline adherence (r (302)=0.117, p=0.042) . Thus, not only were OC symptoms and increased information seeking linked, but both variables also showed a positive relationship with the adherence to government-imposed Covid-guidelines.\nTo closer investigate this relationship we performed a mediation analysis with all three factors (i.e. OC symptoms, information seeking and guideline adherence). The mediation analysis showed a significant direct effect of OC symptoms at T1 on guideline adherence at T2 (\u03b2=0.14, p=0.024, path c) and on information seeking at T1 (\u03b2=0.23, p<0.001, path a). It further showed a significant path from information seeking at T1 to guideline adherence at T2 (\u03b2=0.13, p=0.025, path b; see Figure 5 ). Thus, OC symptoms were associated with information seeking as well as guideline adherence, and information seeking and guideline adherence themselves were associated too.

We studied multiple psychiatric domains longitudinally during the first pandemic wave and show an elevation across all. However, while one of the psychiatric symptoms decreased another remained stable over time, we found a further rise of OC symptoms even though the peak of the first pandemic wave had passed. Our findings highlight that OC symptoms are disproportionally affected by the pandemic by documenting their selective increase throughout the pandemic for the first time, which may result in serious adverse long-term consequences.\nThe here documented elevations of anxiety and depression scores during the pandemic are in line with previous studies conducted of the (UK) general public (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . For the first time, we also report a heightening in OC symptoms in the general public with levels exceeding previous non-patient populations, in part matching patient levels (25, (38) (39) (40) . This observation is of particular importance as OCD is likely to be disproportionally affected by this pandemic with many of the governmental guidelines directly promoting OCD symptoms (43) .\nFurthermore, OC symptoms were also systematically elevated in domains not directly linked to Covid-related themes (e.g. increased checking vs. obsessional thoughts about harm to self or others and contamination obsessions and washing compulsions) speaking for a generalized and thus even more worrying effect.\nIn contrast to previous studies that looked at the psychiatric symptoms (before and) at one time point during the pandemic (8, 9) , we used a longitudinal design that allowed us to characterize the dynamics of psychiatric symptoms throughout the pandemic. Based on coping and stress adaptation theories (19, 42) we expected a decrease in symptoms after the peak of the pandemic which has been recently documented for some psychiatric domains (11) . However, we found an important dissociation in symptom dynamics. While depression decreased and anxiety levels plateaued with the ease of lockdown and the drop of Covid-19 infections, the OC symptom levels further increased. This increase spanned several sub-domains which may indicate that it was not purely elicited by health worries but uncertainty and stress during the pandemic. These prolonged high levels of OC symptoms are worrying and might develop into a disorder. It is thus critical to continue to closely observe their development.\nWe further investigated how OC symptoms related to daily behaviours such as information seeking and adherence to governmental Covid-guidelines.

Improving ecological validity, we developed a novel information-seeking measure related to Covid-19. We indeed found that individuals with high OC scores tended to seek more information, even when controlling for other psychiatric symptoms, the general news and media consumption, and demographic variables. Furthermore, this association between OC symptoms and information seeking persisted throughout the pandemic.\nWe further show that Covid-related information seeking was critical for later adherence to governmental guidelines. We found that information seeking mediated the influence of OC symptoms on guideline adherences, meaning that individuals with elevated OC symptoms stronger adhered to guidelines as they extensively sought Covid-related information. Our findings thus suggest that OC symptoms, albeit burdening for the individual, can be beneficial to society as they promote efforts to contain the virus.\nOur study has some unique strengths such as its large sample size, longitudinal testing and real-world relevance of the measures. However, it relies on self-reported measures which might not accurately reflect actual behaviours and their changes. It would be interesting to further investigate these associations using additional metrics, such as smartphone geolocation patterns, browser history, or in-lab experiments. Moreover, even though our study exploits its longitudinal design to report directional effects, causality cannot directly be inferred.\nOverall, this study provides a first account of OC-symptom dynamics in the general public throughout Covid-19 pandemic and how these symptoms translate into other behaviours such as information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. The increase and persistence of OC symptoms should serve as a warning sign stressing the importance of close monitoring of individuals at risk of developing OCD.

For this analysis, we used the data of all participants at T1 that had completed the informationseeking questionnaire and had not failed any attention checks [N=420 (235 females; Mage=34, SDage= 12.54)]. We checked assumptions for the PCA using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of Sampling Adequacy and Bartlett's test of the REdaS package in R (Supplemental Information) (46) . The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO =0.790) ensured that the proportion of variance among our variables, that might have been caused by an underlying factor, was large enough to be meaningful. The Bartlett's test of sphericity [\u03a72 (10) =608.63, p<0.001] indicated that the correlation matrix was not equal to an identity matrix.\nWe subsequently conducted the PCA using the prcomp function of the stats package (47) and the hornpa package (48) for Horn's parallel analysis in R (31) . The resulting screeplot of the PCA suggested a one-component solution (Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 2 ). Parallel analysis, in which components are retained if the associated eigenvalue is bigger than the 95 th of the distribution of eigenvalues derived from a random dataset, confirmed this solution. The first component accounted for 54% of the total variance validating that all items were targeting the same underlying construct. Item loadings are additionally displayed in Supplemental Table 2 showing that all items represented an underlying construct, i.e. information seeking. Importantly, the total variance explained by the first component was higher than what could have been obtained by chance.\nWe obtained a Cronbach's Alpha of \u03b1=0.772 for the internal consistency of our questionnaire which is considered reliable in this context (49) . Finally, we measured test-retest reliability using the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r(302)=0.585, p<0.001) suggesting a substantial test-retest reliability of our newly developed scale (50) . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted December 9, 2020. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted December 9, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20245803 doi: medRxiv preprint Supplemental Table 2 . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint"}, {"section_title": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) loadings of the Covid-19 information-seeking questionnaire", "text": "The copyright holder for this this version posted December 9, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20245803 doi: medRxiv preprint"}, {"section_title": "Decrease in information seeking from during the first pandemic wave to after the ease of lockdown", "text": "To show the robustness of our result indicating a decrease in average information seeking from T1 to T2 we conducted an additional permutation test to compare the observed difference in means (`xt1-`xt2) to a reference null distribution (Supplemental Figure 5 below) .

The results of our hypothesized model were replicated when using information seeking at T2 as a mediator (path a: \u03b2=0.18, p<0.001; path b: \u03b2=0.27, p<0.001; path ab: \u03b2=0.05, p<0.001; path c': \u03b2=0.09, p=0.138) . Thus OC symptoms as well as information seeking were associated with guideline adherence at T2 but the relationship between OC symptoms and guideline adherence was mediated by information seeking. The effect of OC symptoms on guideline adherence became non-significant when controlling for information seeking.\nThe additional model to control for directionality by reversing OC symptoms and information seeking did not show a significant mediation effect (\u03b2= 0.02, p= 0.0625; path ab) whereas the significant association between information seeking and OC symptoms (\u03b2= 0.21, p<0.001; path a) as well as information seeking and guideline adherence (\u03b2= 0.15, p= 0.003, path c; \u03b2=0.13, p= 0.020; path c') prevailed.
