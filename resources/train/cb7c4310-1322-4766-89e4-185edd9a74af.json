[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study was designed to evaluate whether subjects with amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathology, detected using florbetapir positron emission tomorgraphy (PET), demonstrated greater cognitive decline than subjects without A\u03b2 pathology. Sixty-nine cognitively normal (CN) controls, 52 with recently diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 31 with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were included in the study. PET images obtained in these subjects were visually rated as positive (A\u03b2+) or negative (A\u03b2\u2212 ), blind to diagnosis. Fourteen percent (10/69) of CN, 37% (19/52) of MCI and 68% (21/31) of AD were A\u03b2+. The primary outcome was change in ADAS-Cog score in MCI subjects after 36 months; however, additional outcomes included change on measures of cognition, function and diagnostic status. A\u03b2+ MCI subjects demonstrated greater worsening compared with A\u03b2\u2212 subjects on the ADAS-Cog over 36 months (5.66 \u00b1 1.47 vs \u22120.71 \u00b1 1.09, P = 0.0014) as well as on the mini-mental state exam (MMSE), digit symbol substitution (DSS) test, and a verbal fluency test (P o0.05). Similar to MCI subjects, A\u03b2+ CN subjects showed greater decline on the ADAS-Cog, digit-symbol-substitution test and verbal fluency (P o0.05), whereas A\u03b2+ AD patients showed greater declines in verbal fluency and the MMSE (P o 0.05). A\u03b2+ subjects in all diagnostic groups also showed greater decline on the CDR-SB (P o0.04), a global clinical assessment. A\u03b2+ subjects did not show significantly greater declines on the ADCS-ADL or Wechsler Memory Scale. Overall, these findings suggest that in CN, MCI and AD subjects, florbetapir PET A\u03b2+ subjects show greater cognitive and global deterioration over a 3-year follow-up than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects do."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The prognostic evaluation of people at risk for AD, such as normal elderly or those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is challenging due to considerable variability in progression rates and underlying pathologic heterogeneity. A reliable biomarker that could accurately identify subjects at greatest risk for progressive cognitive decline could enhance the clinical evaluation of at-risk subjects and accelerate the testing of preventive strategies. [1] [2] [3] Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) fibrils in the form of amyloid plaques is a neuropathological requirement for definitive diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4 Insights gained from pathologic and biomarker studies suggest that A\u03b2 changes in the brain begin years, and possibly decades, before cognitive symptoms emerge. Two recent cross-sectional studies of carriers at-risk for familial AD estimated that A\u03b2 changes may occur 15 years prior to expected symptom onset. 5, 6 Likewise, biomarker studies of older asymptomatic and MCI subjects have reported an increased rate of AD pathologic changes. Such findings have led to the concept of preclinical 7 and MCI stages of AD; 2 however, the predictive value of available biomarkers at both the individual patient level and group level is not yet fully elucidated. Among the various biomarkers in development to assess A\u03b2, position emission tomorgraphy (PET) tracers offer the potential of directly imaging changes in cortical A\u03b2. 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) was the first PET tracer to image cortical A\u03b2 plaques 8, 9 , and prior PiB studies have shown that PiB-positive normal and MCI subjects are more likely to show faster cognitive deterioration than PiB-negative subjects. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The short half-life of 11 C (20 min) limits its viability for routine clinical use. Florbetapir F 18 is a PET ligand with high affinity and specificity to A\u03b2, 20, 21 and a multicenter clinical histopathologic study has shown a significant correlation between visual ratings of florbetapir PET in living subjects and autopsy measured A\u03b2 pathology. 22 It was recently approved by FDA to detect neuritic plaques in the evaluation of patients with progressive cognitive decline. Other F 18 amyloid PET tracers are also being developed. 23, 24 A limitation of current F 18 amyloid PET tracers has been the relative lack of longitudinal data. The current study was designed to test whether florbetapir PET can predict subsequent cognitive decline in older at-risk subjects.

PET scanners included Discovery LS PET/CT (GE, Fairfield, CT, USA), Advance PET (GE), ECAT HR+ (Siemens, Washington DC, USA) and Biograph PET/CT (Siemens) models. Image reconstruction utilized an iterative algorithm (4 iterations, 16 subsets) and a post reconstruction Gaussian filter of 5 mm.\nThree nuclear medicine physicians, blinded to clinical data, independently rated the PET images at an imaging core lab (ICON Medical Imaging, Warrington, PA, USA). A binary qualitative scale (amyloid positive: A\u03b2+ or amyloid negative: A\u03b2\u2212 ) was implemented in this study according to the pattern of tracer uptake observed in cortical gray matter areas. The PET rating methods, visual rater training and reliability have been described previously. 22, 25, 27 In brief, scans were rated as amyloid negative if tracer retention was seen predominantly in white matter, with no appreciable or low levels of tracer retention in cortical gray matter.

A last observation carried forward (LOCF) methodology was implemented to impute the missing values during the followup. Subjects who had at least one postbaseline visit were included in the analysis, and the ANCOVA models were adjusted for baseline test score and age. As a sensitivity analysis, with observed data only, a mixed-effect repeated measure (MMRM) model was implemented that included fixed effects for baseline amyloid beta status (A\u03b2+ or A\u03b2\u2212 ), visit, amyloid-by-visit interaction, baseline score and age to compare the least square mean (LSM) change from baseline between A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 at month 36. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject correlation. We also generated illustrative line graphs using mixed model analyses that included fixed effects for amyloid status, age and month of followup, to estimate slopes of cognitive test score change per month. Key secondary analyses compared the percentage of A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 subjects in the MCI population who experienced a 4-point change in the ADAS-Cog, or had a change in diagnosis from MCI to AD dementia using Fisher's exact test. Other secondary analyses included the change from baseline ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB in CN and AD patients. Analyses of other psychometric and functional assessments, conversions in diagnosis, time to first AD medication (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine), were also done for all relevant patient groups.\nAll statistical tests were conducted with a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05, unless otherwise noted. Differences between diagnostic groups and A\u03b2 status on baseline characteristics continuous variables were assessed with two-sample t-tests; categorical variables were assessed with \u03c7 2 tests. The Mantel-Haenszel statistic was used to test for trend differences between A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 MCI subjects converting to either CN or AD. The Pearson \u03c7 2 test was used to test for differences in AD medication use between A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 groups. Fisher's exact test was used when a frequency table had a cell count less than or equal to 5. Analyses were conducted with SAS Windows (Version 9 or later).

Of these 152 subjects (69 CN; 52 MCI; 31 AD), 97% of CN, 88% of MCI and 87% of AD completed 18 months of followup, while 74% of CN, 71% of MCI and 52% of AD completed 36 months of followup. The most common reasons for termination were withdrawal of consent (N = 38) and loss to follow up (N = 8). The proportion of study completers did not differ by visual ratings of amyloid status in the AD, MCI or CN groups (P = 0.52, P = 0.21, P = 0.33, respectively).\nBaseline Florbetapir PET Amyloid Positivity by Diagnosis Figure 1 depicts illustrative amyloid positive (A\u03b2+) and negative (A\u03b2\u2212 ) PET scans. As reported previously 25 , 37% (19/52) of MCI, 14% (10/69) of CN and 68% (21/31) of AD dementia subjects were rated as PET A\u03b2+ (P o0.0001) at study entry.\nBaseline demographic characteristics and cognitive performance At baseline (Table 1) , A\u03b2+ subjects classified by visual ratings tended to be older and have worse cognitive performance at baseline than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects on some measures. Because of these potential differences, we adjusted for baseline score and age in longitudinal statistical models evaluating rate of change by amyloid status.\nFlorbetapir PET and rate of change from baseline to 36 months Table 2 provides the observed changes on each measure at 36 months for A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 classified subjects analysed by ANCOVA (LOCF) and by MMRM, adjusting for baseline age and cognitive function scores. The significance of the results using either analytical method was similar. At month 36, the LS mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog in the MCI group (the primary outcome variable) was 5.66 (worsening) for MCI subjects who had A\u03b2+ scans, compared with \u22120.71 (improvement) for MCI subjects who had A\u03b2\u2212 scans (P = 0.0014). For CN subjects, the mean change from baseline at month 36 for subjects who had A\u03b2+ scans was 3.24 (worsening), compared with \u22120.09 (improvement) for subjects who had A\u03b2\u2212 scans (P = 0.0013). For subjects with clinically diagnosed AD dementia, the mean change from baseline at month 36 for subjects who had A\u03b2+ scans was 8.88, compared with 3.81 for subjects who had A\u03b2\u2212 scans (P>0.05). For both the MCI and CN groups, the percentage of subjects with a clinically significant 4-point worsening in ADAS-Cog was significantly greater for subjects who had A\u03b2+ scans than for subjects who had A\u03b2\u2212 scans (A\u03b2+ MCI 8/17, 47%, A\u03b2\u2212 MCI 3/30 10%, P o0.01; A\u03b2+ CN 4/10, 40%, A\u03b2\u2212 CN 3/57 5%, Po 0.01).\nExploratory analyses of other cognitive outcomes (Table 2) : In ANCOVA analyses adjusting for age and baseline score, A\u03b2+ MCI Florbetapir F 18 amyloid PET and cognitive decline PM Doraiswamy subjects also showed a significantly greater deterioration than A\u03b2\u2212 rated subjects on the CDR-SB, MMSE, DSS and verbal fluency (vegetables). A\u03b2+ CN subjects similarly had greater decline on the CDR-SB, DSS and verbal fluency for vegetables. Among clinically diagnosed AD dementia subjects, A\u03b2+ classification predicted greater decline on the CDR-SB, MMSE, tests of verbal fluency and a trend on the ADCS-ADL. Significantly greater declines by amyloid status on the ADCS-ADL and Wechsler Memory Scale were not observed across any of the diagnostic groups. Figure 2 illustrates the slopes calculated for the ADAS-COG, CDR-SB and MMSE by clinical diagnosis in A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2\u2212 classified subgroups. In contrast to A\u03b2\u2212 subjects in whom significant declines were generally not observed, significant declines in slopes were observed for all A\u03b2+ classified subgroups regardless of clinical diagnosis.\nFlorbetapir PET ratings and change in diagnosis The proportion of MCI subjects progressing to AD dementia or reverting to CN over the 36-month study can be seen in Figure 3a . Overall, more MCI A\u03b2+ subjects converted to dementia and fewer converted to CN status than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects (P = 0.036). MCI subjects rated A\u03b2+ had an~3.5-fold higher conversion rate to AD dementia (6/17 A\u03b2+ MCI subjects (35.3%) vs 3/30 rated A\u03b2\u2212 (10.0%); P = 0.054). Fewer A\u03b2+ (1/17 (5.9%)] vs A\u03b2\u2212 (5/30, (16.7%)) MCI subjects reverted to CN status, although this difference was not statistically significant. Among the 30 MCI A\u03b2\u2212 subjects, 27 failed to progress to dementia and failed to show clinically significant worsening (a 4-point decline on the ADAS-Cog) over 36 months resulting in a negative predictive value of florbetapir PET for both outcomes of 90% (95% CI: 74.4%-96.5%). In MCI subjects, the positive predictive value was 47% with respect to a clinically significant ADAS-Cog decline by 4 points and 35.3% for conversion to AD dementia. The positive and negative predictive values based on SUVR were similar to those for the visual reads.\nFlorbetapir PET Ratings and Cumulative AD medication use over time The proportion of MCI subjects taking AD medications at the start of the study was greater among A\u03b2+ than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects (6/17 A\u03b2+ (35.3%) vs 1/30 A\u03b2\u2212 (3.3%); P = 0.0062) (Figure 3b) . By study end, 12/17 A\u03b2+ MCI subjects (70.6%) were taking AD medications vs 7/30 rated A\u03b2\u2212 (23.3%) (P = 0.0022). Among MCI subjects not taking AD medications at baseline, A\u03b2+ subjects had a greater likelihood of starting AD medications during the study (6/11 A\u03b2+ subjects (54.5%) vs 6/29 A\u03b2\u2212 (20.7%); P = 0.056)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "These results, from the first multicenter, 36-month follow-up study of florbetapir F 18 amyloid imaging, confirm and extend results from our prior 18-month interim report 27 and prior prognostic studies of 11 C-PiB [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 29, 30 and CSF A\u03b242. Subjects with A\u03b2+ florbetapir PET scans displayed greater cognitive and global deterioration than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects over the course of 36 months, regardless of diagnostic status. Conversely, the minimal decline in the A\u03b2\u2212 group is an important finding that has impact on clinical trials at all stages of AD when these subjects are included.\nThe diagnostic classification of MCI indicates an increased risk for AD but is not a definitive diagnosis. An A\u03b2 biomarker may increase the probability that the MCI syndrome is due to AD. In this study, compared with A\u03b2\u2212 subjects, A\u03b2+ MCI subjects showed greater mean worsening on the ADAS-Cog, MMSE, CDR-SB and tests of executive function (DSS, fluency for vegetables). A\u03b2+ MCI subjects were also more likely to experience a 4-point decline on the ADAS-Cog, a previously used benchmark for evaluating clinically meaningful change. [31] [32] [33] The greater deterioration on the CDR-SB and greater rate of AD medication prescriptions in A\u03b2+ MCI suggest that the declines observed in these subjects are relevant for clinicians and to the design of clinical trials. CN A\u03b2+ subjects worsened significantly more than CN A\u03b2\u2212 subjects on the ADAS-Cog, CDR-SB, DSS and verbal fluency test (vegetables). These findings confirm prior PiB study results in normal subjects 10, 18 extend them over a broader range of tests relevant to clinical trials and practice, and provide optimism that it may be possible to identify preclinical AD in CN, and test preventive interventions in these subjects. Among clinically diagnosed AD dementia subjects, A\u03b2+ classification predicted greater decline on the CDR-SB, MMSE, tests of verbal fluency and a trend on the ADCS-ADL. Cognitive decline in A\u03b2+ patients was typically least in the CN cohort and greatest in the AD cohort and (Figure 2 ) consistent with slower cognitive decline at earlier stages of the disease. In contrast, the slope of cognitive decline was relatively flat for A\u03b2\u2212 subjects, regardless of diagnostic classification.\nDespite the consistent changes in psychometric test scores, the difference in percentage of MCI subjects converting to AD fell just short of significance (P = 0.054). The latter may be due, in part, to the small sample size of the MCI cohort (a post hoc power analysis demonstrated only 56% power for this endpoint) and the limited 3-year duration of followup. The present findings suggest that amyloid PET may have bidirectional predictive value in MCI for progressing to AD dementia or reverting to CN. The 3.5-fold lower conversion rate from MCI to AD and the threefold higher reversion rate to normal status in A\u03b2\u2212 compared with A\u03b2+ MCI suggest that A\u03b2\u2212 MCI has a diverse etiology and is less likely to indicate a progressive neurodegenerative disease.\nRates of conversion from PiB A\u03b2+ MCI to AD dementia have varied in prior studies from 29-82% depending on entry criteria and duration of follow-up. 11, 12, 14, 16, 27 The relatively low conversion rate to AD dementia in our study (35% over 36 months) should be interpreted in the context of some key issues; as noted previously, 27 MCI subjects in this study were recently diagnosed and with respect to age, APOE4 status, ADAS-Cog and memory performance (Wechsler memory scale), they were more similar to early MCI than to late MCI subjects in prior studies such as ADNI (See Supplementary Table 1) . [34] [35] [36] [37] No threshold on delayed recall performance was required for inclusion in order to more closely simulate the diagnostic process typically used in clinical practice 2 and to not bias the amyloid status results toward only those MCI subjects who were more rapidly progressing or closest to conversion to AD dementia. These factors may also explain the lower rate of amyloid positivity observed in our MCI subjects (37%) compared with late MCI subjects in ADNI1(~62%), and the greater similarity to early MCI subjects from ADNI-GO/2 (~43%). 38 A significant proportion of A\u03b2+ subjects were already on cognitive medications at baseline, and there was a disproportionately higher rate of cholinesterase therapy initiation among A\u03b2+ subjects (71% vs 23% among A\u03b2\u2212 MCI subjects), which might have reduced conversion rates. Although the majority of A\u03b2+ MCI subjects did not decline to the point that they were considered 'converted', they did decline sufficiently to warrant pharmacological intervention. Dropouts between 18 and 36 months may have also resulted in a lower estimated conversion rate (and our power for detecting differences); however, the dropout rate in our study is consistent with similar length industry sponsored trials. Finally, prior studies have noted a prolonged gestation period between amyloid deposition and development of dementia suggesting that longer follow-up periods may be necessary to ascertain the ultimate conversion rate in A\u03b2+ MCI subjects, which would be consistent with the higher observed positive predictive value (47%) observed for 4-point decline on the ADAS-Cog. Some limitations should be considered when evaluating the present results. The primary objective succeeded in demonstrating greater decline on the ADAS-Cog in A\u03b2+ MCI patients; however, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons in the secondary and exploratory analyses; these analyses should therefore be interpreted in that context, despite general consistency across the ANCOVA, MMRM and conversion analyses. The A\u03b2+ subjects tended to be older than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects, so we included age as an adjustment factor in our analyses. We attempted to explore the effect of APOE \u03b54 in combination with amyloid status on cognitive and functional decline. However, as we and others have previously reported, 27,39 these two factors often provide overlapping information, leading to statistical models that fail to converge or require elimination of one factor from the model; in our exploratory analyses, typically only one of these variables was retained in the model indicating that when amyloid status was included in the model APOE \u03b54 generally did not provide additional prognostic information. The majority interpretation of three readers may differ from that provided by an individual reader in the clinical setting. Finally, we did not collect CSF, FDG-PET or MRI volumetric data and could not test the comparative or combined utility of florbetapir with other biomarkers.\nOur results suggest that amyloid PET has promise for detecting risk of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with MCI and CN older adults, and support the negative predictive value of amyloid PET 40, 41 in identifying patients unlikely to show clinical deterioration over several years of followup. Future longitudinal PET and cognitive data should further clarify the prognostic role of amyloid PET in the clinical setting, its ability to improve confidence in the recently proposed diagnoses of dementia 42 and MCI 2 due to AD, and for subject enrichment of therapeutic trials in the preclinical stages of AD. The bars depict the 36-month endpoint diagnostic status of subjects originally classified as MCI at baseline. The red and blue bars titled CN depict the percentage of MCI subjects who reverted to CN by amyloid status. The red and blue bars titled MCI depict the percentage of MCI subjects who continued to be classified as MCI at endpoint (that is, cognitive change was not sufficient to trigger conversion). The red and blue bars titled AD depict the percentage of MCI subjects who progressed to dementia by amyloid status. Conversion to dementia from MCI was almost three times higher in A\u03b2+ subjects while reversion to CN was almost three times lower than A\u03b2\u2212 subjects. The arrows depict conversion and reversion. Please see text for details. (b) Concomitant and initiation of AD medication use in MCI subjects over 36 months by baseline florbetapir PET status.

By study end, 70.6% of A\u03b2+ MCI subjects were taking AD medications vs 23.3% A\u03b2\u2212 MCI (P = 0.002) because of the greater percentage who initiated AD medications in A\u03b2+MCI vs A\u03b2\u2212MCI (54.5% vs 20.7%).
