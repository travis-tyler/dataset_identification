[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] These biomarkers are also increasingly used in clinical trials as both inclusion criteria and outcome measures.\nAt present, 5 AD biomarkers are sufficiently validated to be used in therapeutic trials, in large observational research studies, and, on occasion, for clinical diagnostic purposes. [16] [17] [18] [19] The major biomarkers of brain A\u2424 deposition are a low level of A\u242442 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a positive finding using positron emission tomographic amyloid imaging.\nisocortex determined by using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] Some of us recently proposed a hypothetical model of AD pathophysiology 44, 45 describing the temporal evolution of these 5 biomarkers based on the assumption that they do not change suddenly or simultaneously but rather over many years in an ordered, more sequential manner and that, likewise, they approach a pathological level in an ordered manner. The model does not assume a start-stop sequence whereby 1 biomarker changes then stops, the next changes then stops, etc. Rather, the model assumes that the maximum rate of change moves from 1 class of biomarker to the next, and, as the disease progresses, all biomarkers become progressively more abnormal simultaneously, albeit at rates that change over time in an ordered manner. It was proposed as a hypothetical biomarker cascade with validation awaiting additional data.\nEmpirical testing of this hypothetical biomarker cascade model 44, 45 can be approached in various ways 46 ; however, all testing methods require that different biomarkers be directly compared with each other in the same individuals. This can be conceptualized as plotting all biomarker values on a common graph with the vertical axis representing biomarker severity and the horizontal axis representing disease stage and/or time. Our present objective was to evaluate some aspects of the hypothetical biomarker cascade model by characterizing the prevalence of biomarker abnormalities at different disease stages defined by clinical cohort and by results of a MiniMental State Examination (MMSE). Comparing the proportions of participants with abnormal biomarker values allowed us to express significant biomarker deviations from normal in the same units for each biomarker. Cut points denoting abnormality for each biomarker were derived from independent autopsy cohorts, which limited our analysis to 3 of the 5 major AD biomarkers: the A\u242442 level in CSF, the t-tau level in CSF, and the hippocampal volume adjusted for intracranial volume (hereafter referred to as the adjusted hippocampal volume that was determined using structural MRI).

This requires that a cut point be established in the continuous distribution of values for each biomarker. Arguably the least biased and most valid approach to establishing biomarker cut points is to use an independent cohort in which ground truth is established by autopsy. Cut points for CSF A\u242442 and t-tau levels were established by Shaw et al 32, 53 using an ADNI-independent autopsy cohort of participants who were observed at the University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer's Disease Core Center and who were diagnosed by use of National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan criteria. 20 The cut points were chosen to maximize accuracy in separating highprobability from low-probability autopsy-proven AD.\nTo our knowledge, however, cut points have not been established for hippocampal atrophy using an independent autopsy data set that employed imaging methods identical to those used in the ADNI. To obtain an adjusted hippocampal volume cut point, we used an independent sample of 53 participants at the Mayo Clinic who had an MRI performed within 3.5 years before death and an autopsy diagnosis of high or low probability of AD using NIA-Reagan criteria. These participants had been enrolled in the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry or the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Our cut point was based on first calculating an adjusted hippocampal volume using the formula AHV=HV-(2.546201\u03e90.002139314\u03ebintracra-nial volume), where AHV (as the adjusted hippocampal volume) is the residual value obtained after regressing HV (as the hippocampal volume) vs intracranial volume. Next, we performed a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and chose a cut point in order to maximize accuracy in separating highprobability from low-probability autopsy-proven AD. That is, we chose the cut point to maximize sensitivity-(1-specificity)."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL METHODS", "text": "Each participant had 3 binary outcomes for his or her baseline visit defined as normal (y=0) or abnormal (y=1) for each of the 3 biomarkers.

Our predictors were clinical group (cognitively normal [CN] partici-pants vs participants with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] vs participants with AD dementia), biomarker, and their interaction. We used likelihood ratio tests to perform a global test of biomarker differences, after including the clinical group in the model, and to test for an interaction between clinical group and biomarker. We used Wald tests to perform pairwise comparisons of abnormality of a biomarker separately within each clinical group. This analysis was then repeated, replacing clinical group with the MMSE, modeled as a restricted cubic spline with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the MMSE distribution. We also performed a subset analysis among those with an abnormal baseline CSF A\u242442 level and examined the CSF t-tau levels and adjusted hippocampal volumes within groups.\nAmong those participants who also had a 12-month visit, we used baseline and 12-month data and fit a generalized estimating equations model that included group, visit, and biomarker along with all interactions.

A biomarker value for an individual participant at a given point in time (and, by extension, the percentage of abnormal values across a group at a given disease stage) is a function of 2 phenomena: (1) the elapsed time from the initial deviation of the biomarker away from normality to the present and (2) the average rate of change of the biomarker over this period of time.

We can, however, draw valid inferences from our data about the combined effect of time elapsed from onset and average rate of change, and we refer to this as the relative dynamic ordering of biomarkers.\nThe data presented herein support several key principles in our recently proposed hypothetical biomarker cascade model. 44, 45 These include the following: (1) All biomarkers become progressively more abnormal as participants' symptoms worsen clinically. (2) Reduction in the CSF A\u242442 level denotes an upstream pathophysiological process that significantly departs from normality (ie, is dynamic) early in the pathophysiological cascade, while participants are clinically asymptomatic, but does not change greatly during the clinically symptomatic MCI and dementia phases of the disease.

The whiskers above and below the box mark the largest and smallest data point that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the top and bottom of the box. A, For participants with both baseline and 12-month data, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u242442 level did not change from baseline to 12 months in the cognitively normal (CN) group (P = .52), the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group (P=.13), or the AD group (P = .51). B, The CSF total tau level is shown on the log scale. It increased from baseline to 12 months in CN participants (P=.002) but not in participants with MCI (P = .12) or AD (P = .36). C, The adjusted hippocampal volume decreased from baseline to 12 months in all clinical groups (P\u03fd .001). The dotted horizontal line extending across all box plots represents the cut point denoting normal vs abnormal for each biomarker.\nARCH NEUROL / VOL 68 (NO. 12), DEC 2011 physiological process that are dynamic later as the participant approaches and moves through the clinically symptomatic phases of the disease.\n56-64 (4) Cognitive decline is more closely related to biomarkers of neuronal injury than to biomarkers of brain A\u2424 load. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] (5) The CSF t-tau level is more dynamic earlier in the disease phase than is the adjusted hippocampal volume, but the proportions of the 2 biomarkers that are abnormal are similar in symptomatic participants such that the adjusted hippocampal volume \"catches up\" to the CSF t-tau level as symptoms worsen. This is supported visually by the steeper slope of the adjusted hippocampal volume vs the CSF t-tau level in Figure 2 .\nThe hypothetical model represents an idealized trajectory of an individual who progresses owing to pathologically pure AD dementia. Our sample, however, almost certainly consists of a mixture of participants, many of whom are on the AD pathway and many of whom are not (particularly those in the CN and MCI groups). [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] The fact that both an elevated CSF t-tau level and hippocampal atrophy can occur in other conditions that lead to dementia, 79 such as cerebrovascular disease, has led to the belief that, of the 3 biomarkers we examined, the CSF A\u242442 level should have the greatest specificity for AD. 80 Consequently, we performed a subanalysis of participants with an abnormal CSF A\u242442 level at baseline in order to isolate those participants who we were somewhat more confident were in the AD pathophysiological pathway. 56, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] Our results concerning evidence for biomarker ordering led to similar conclusions in the \"all-participants\" sample and in the sample of participants with an abnormal CSF A\u242442 level.\nUsing the percent-abnormal metric might not seem to be an obvious first choice for comparing biomarkers. Other options, however, have proven to be untenable. For example, using biomarker values in native measurement units precludes direct comparisons of biomarkers because they are not on a common scale; z scores or percentiles are also not tenable because, by construction, half the participants in the sample must be above average for each biomarker, and half must be below average. This constraint would make it impossible to test our major question: is 1 biomarker abnormal more often than another at different stages of the disease? The obvious advantage of comparing biomarkers on a percentabnormal basis is that the scoring method is standardized for all biomarkers over the entire cognitive continuum. A limitation is that the results are highly sensitive to the cut-point values, and hence the validity of the analysis depends on selecting valid cut points for each biomarker. We used cut-point values for each biomarker that were based on an independent autopsy-verified sample, and we used the same pathological criteria for all biomarkers (ie, high or low probability of AD using the NIAReagan criteria). Although using cut points based on diagnostic sensitivity, rather than accuracy, in the autopsy reference standard might seem a better approach, we found that that is not the case. Imagine a biomarker with identical distributions in autopsy-proven high-vs lowprobability AD. Fixing a cut point at a sensitivity of 90% in autopsy-proven high-probability AD would lead to the conclusion that 90% of cases of autopsy-proven lowprobability AD had abnormal biomarker values and that the biomarker in question comes \"early\" in the pathophysiological cascade. This would clearly be erroneous. Thus, our choice of selecting cut points in a manner that is constrained by both sensitivity and specificity, as is done for all clinically applied diagnostic tests, seems prudent in our study.\nOur hypothetical model 44, 45 was intended to represent an idealized trajectory that an individual follows from a time prior to the appearance of any AD pathophysiology in the brain through end-stage AD dementia, when all biomarkers have become maximally abnormal. The optimal way to test this model would be to follow the trajectory of multiple biomarkers over several decades in a large group of participants who enter a study prior to the first appearance of any AD pathophysiology and are followed up through the symptomatic stages of the disease to autopsy. Given that the total course of the disease may span 30 years or more, it will take many years to accumulate the necessary data to construct a temporally accurate disease model. While the data are being accumulated, perhaps the only realistic approach to empirical analysis is to attempt to build models of disease in a piecewise fashion from individual participants who are at various stages in the disease course, as we have done here."}]
