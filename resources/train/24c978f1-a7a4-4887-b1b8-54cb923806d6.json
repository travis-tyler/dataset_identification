It is estimated that half of the population above 80 years old may have symptomatic AD and this number will grow to approximately 81 million by the year 2040 [9] . AD is a widespread epidemic disease threatening social health. However, there is no current effective treatment for this disease [25] . The principal cause of the formation of such a situation is that the pathological mechanism of AD still remains unknown. It would be quite worthwhile to explore the brain activity characteristics from a network perspective.\nA number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported the existence of the default mode network (DMN) and its core regions which mainly include the posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC), inferior temporal cortex (ITC) and (para)hippocampus (HC) [3, 8] . Viewed as an integrated system, the DMN plays a critical role in monitoring the external environment and supporting internal mentation [10, 19] . However, the DMN was frequently found to be abnormal due to AD [1, 13, 27] . It is totally necessary to investigate how these DMN brain regions interact with each other and the altered causal interaction pattern in relation to AD.\nThis study combined independent component analysis (ICA) and multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA) to investigate the issue of effective connectivity within the DMN in AD patients and normal controls (NC). ICA was successfully used to identify DMN components and mGCA was applied to explore effective connectivity. It is worth noting that our approach of mGCA is quite different from previous implements which were based on the decrease of residual F to evaluate the causal effect [23, 24] . Since the residual-based F approximately obeys chi-square distribution, it is a little troublesome in subsequent statistical analysis for group level inference. Our approach applied signed-path coefficients to evaluate the causal effects among brain DMN regions. The signed-path coefficients are considered to be normally distributed and could be used in a parametric statistical analysis at the group level [7] . The use of this model greatly simplifies the subsequent statistical analysis procedure."}, {"section_title": "Materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu/).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date, these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

The first ten time points from each functional image were discarded to allow for equilibration of the magnetic field.

Prior to PCA, the optimal number of components was set to 25/30 for NC and AD patients, which was estimated based on minimum description length (MDL). In the first step, data from each subject were temporally reduced to the optimal number. Then, the reduction step was once again achieved by PCA according to the optimal numbers. In the second step, the data were separated by ICA using the Infomax algorithm [16] . Finally, independent components (ICs) and time courses for each subject were back-reconstructed. The IC that best matched DMN component was selected with a standard DMN template [13] . After the conversion of the intensity values in each IC spatial map to Z-scores, a one sample t-test (height threshold: false discovery rate (FDR), p = 0.05, extent threshold: k = 10 voxels, p < 0.01) was performed to determine the DMN for each of the two groups [6] ."}, {"section_title": "mGCA", "text": "Consider the bivariate linear autoregressive model of two timevariant processes x(t) and y(t):\n,j z j (t) + \u03b5 y (t) where z j (t) represents up to q exogenous processes (six orthogonal motion estimates and physiological noise) independent of the path network (j = 1, . . ., q).

These time-series data for each subject were then entered into mGCA.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This paper applied mGCA combined with ICA to study the effective connectivity patterns in NC and AD patients. In other words, the core regions in the DMN were identified by ICA and were subsequently used to constitute the nodes of mGCA. We noticed that our approach of ICA + mGCA procedure is not conceptually novel. However, the model of mGCA is not the same one as in previous studies [18, 29, 30] . As mentioned above, the mGCA here used normally distributed signed-path coefficients to evaluate the causal interaction among activated regions. To our best knowledge, this is the first study referencing this model to investigate the configuration of regions within the DMN from the perspective of a causal relationship for NC and AD patients.\nWe found that connections in AD patients were decreased than those in NC. In another words, some connections were disrupted because of AD. Previous studies on AD have reported decreased functional connectivity in the DMN [13, 28] . The abnormal connectivity has been interpreted to be directly related to AD and regarded as the potential biomarker [13, 22] . Our results from mGCA were consistent with these findings. What's more, we noted that the PCC was strongly connected with most of the DMN regions while tends to be attenuate in AD patients. PCC was believed to be the most metabolically active regions in healthy subjects and the most significant functional connectivity region in DMN during resting state [3, 14, 28] . It is involved in episodic memory function and the most common location appeared in early metabolic and perfusion abnormalities [13] . The decreased interactions may reveal decreased PCC activity which probably was proportional to the declining memory function in AD patients. Thus, the PCC activity could be used as an important clinical index to detect the degree of dementia. In addition, the PCC was the only region which merely received interactions from other regions. We deduced that the PCC may be the most important node of information processing in the DMN. All of the information from other regions must be integrated into the PCC and ultimately exert its function. However, since our research is only limited to the relationship within the DMN, bidirectional interactions may exist between the PCC and other resting state networks [17, 18] .\nIt is worth noting that interactions between the rITC and other regions within the DMN were stronger in the NC. That is, the activity of the rITC was inhibited in AD patients. Early evidence has demonstrated that the ITC participates in both visual perception and memory and the rITC is considered to be the repository of long-term visual memory [20] . Most of the AD patients have an obvious decline in memory function [13, 17] . The inhibited activity of the rITC, or more generally of the ITC lesion, could be the critical cause of the deficient memory and may reflect a breakdown of visual-related cortical networks in AD patients.\nIn addition to the reduced interactions within the DMN, increased interactions between the MPFC and bilateral IPC were also observed in AD patients. The MPFC is critical for episodic retrieval and the IPC was recorded to be related to short-term memory [4, 26] . Previous studies showed that AD patients presented increased activity in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and increased functional connectivity within the prefrontal regions during various memory tasks [11, 21] . This increased activity and connectivity have been interpreted to be compensatory recruitment of cognitive resources to maintain task performance [11, 12] . The increased interactions between the MPFC and bilateral IPC (prefrontal-parietal lobe) obtained in our study potentially indicate that AD patients possess a relative boost in short-term memory function compared with NC. The enhanced short-term memory well temporarily makes up for its long term memory function defect. With the worsening of the disease, the short-term memory function will eventually be lost. Our findings provided further support that AD patients can make use of additional neural resources in prefrontal regions to compensate for losses of cognitive function."}]
