[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Several positron emission tomography (PET) studies have explored the relationship between amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424), glucose metabolism, and the APOE 4 genotype. It has been reported that APOE 4, and not aggregated A\u2424, contributes to glucose hypometabolism in pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Objective: We hypothesize that typical measurements of A\u2424 taken either from composite regions-of-interest with relatively high burden actually cover significant patterns of the relationship with glucose metabolism. In contrast, spatially weighted measures of A\u2424 are more related to glucose metabolism in cognitively normal (CN) aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: We have generated a score of amyloid burden based on a joint singular value decomposition (SVD) of the crosscorrelation structure between glucose metabolism, as measured by [\n18 F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and A\u2424, as measured by [\n18 F]florbetapir PET, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. This SVD-based score reveals cortical regions where a reduced glucose metabolism is maximally correlated with distributed patterns of A\u2424. Results: From an older population of CN and MCI subjects, we found that the SVD-based A\u2424 score was significantly correlated with glucose metabolism in several cortical regions. Additionally, the corresponding A\u2424 network has hubs that contribute to distributed glucose hypometabolism, which, in turn, are not necessarily foci of A\u2424 deposition. Conclusions: Our approach uncovered hidden patterns of the glucose metabolism-A\u2424 relationship. We showed that the SVD-based A\u2424 score produces a stronger relationship with decreasing glucose metabolism than either APOE 4 genotype or global measures of A\u2424 burden."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Regional glucose hypometabolism and the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) plaques are considered to be prominent features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] [2] [3] [4] . The \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" [5] [6] [7] points to A\u2424 deposition as the key triggering event that induces reduced glucose metabolism, brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, and dementia. As such, investigators have extensively tested the amyloid cascade hypothesis to gain a better understanding of the relationship between A\u2424 deposition and AD-associated pathophysiological changes, such as glucose hypometabolism.\nIn an early study, Mega et al. [8] found an inverse relationship between [ 18 F]2-fluro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) signal and biochemical measures of soluble and insoluble A\u2424 in prefrontal and parieto-occipital cortical regions, thereby providing a basis for further investigations into the association between regional metabolic deficits and A\u2424 burden. While Drzezga et al. [9] found the relationship between A\u2424 deposition and glucose metabolism to be the same in normal aging and AD, more recent studies [10] [11] [12] suggest that fibrillar A\u2424 load and cerebral glucose metabolism follow temporally-divergent evolution paths across AD progression [13] , starting from the early, preclinical stages of the disease. Some investigations [10, 14] have found subtle hypometabolism in AD-signature regions for young, cognitively normal (CN) subjects who are apolipoprotein E 4 (APOE 4) carriers, but with no evidence of A\u2424 accumulation. Similarly, Jack et al. [10] showed that a high percentage of cognitively normal, elderly subjects had strong evidence of FDG PET hypometabolism before any signs of A\u2424 deposition. These studies have generally interpreted AD progression as a scenario where the APOE 4 status alone can induce hypometabolism, but A\u2424 deposition alone can also induce similar hypometabolism, especially in ADsignature cortical regions [14] . More generally, Kadir et al. [15] found an increase in fibrillar A\u2424 load in MCI patients followed by stabilization at the AD stage, while regional cerebral glucose metabolism declined in MCI patients and worsened with subsequent cognitive decline.\nIt has been also reported that APOE 4, and not aggregated fibrillar A\u2424, contributes to glucose hypometabolism in CN [16] and MCI [17] subjects. Similarly, Knopman et al. [18] reported that the effect of APOE 4 on glucose metabolism was not completely driven by the effect of A\u2424 deposition in CN. This work suggested that a set of AD-signature regions in AD progression might simply have unique susceptibility to both aging and APOE 4-related effects. In contrast, Yi et al. [19] found that, for CN subjects carrying the APOE 4 genotype, hypometabolism in AD-signature regions is primarily mediated by global cortical A\u2424 deposition. More general results suggest that, independently of the APOE 4 genotype, A\u2424 accumulation and hypometabolism are more likely to occur simultaneously through the spectrum of brain A\u2424 levels in a dose-dependent manner [20, 21] .\nA potential limitation of these previous studies has been the representation of A\u2424 by a single global index, computed either from the whole cortex or from a pre-specified target region-of-interest (ROI) with relatively high A\u2424 burden. As such, the global-to-distributed view of the relationship A\u2424-glucose metabolism has dominated the field. In order to overcome this limitation, some studies have focused on different spatial aspects of such a relationship, namely, the regional-to-regional view [20, 22, 23] (i.e., spatially concurrent measures of A\u2424 and metabolism) and the distributed-to-distributed view [24] . La Joie et al. [23] provided early evidence for regional variations in the relationship between A\u2424 load and hypometabolism, while Lowe et al. [20] showed strong associations between regional hypometabolism and regional Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET in CN subjects, particularly in typical AD-signature regions. However, for a combined cohort of CN and MCI subjects, regional A\u2424 accumulation showed little to no impact on concurrent regional glucose metabolism [22] . Similarly, using parallel independent component analysis (ICA) of FDG PET and PiB PET, A\u2424 showed only remote effects on brain metabolism in probable AD [24] .\nGiven the amount of reported contradictory results, we focus on revealing distributed-to-distributed and local-to-distributed views of the A\u2424-glucose metabolism relationship in CN and MCI subjects. Despite the fact that MCI is broadly considered a prodromal stage of AD, not all patients with MCI progress to AD, and even those individuals who convert show different rates of reduction in glucose metabolism and A\u2424 accumulation. Similarly, aging CN subjects may show incipient signatures of pathological AD, particularly those carrying the APOE 4 genotype. As such, it is extremely important to investigate the glucose metabolism-amyloid accumulation relationship at the earliest as possible stage of cognitive deterioration, namely aging CN and MCI. For such purpose, we employ a singular value decomposition (SVD) [25] , which is a data-driven technique that generalizes both principal components analysis (PCA) [26] and partial least squares (PLS) [27] to the case of two different image modalities. Essentially, SVD seeks to express the cross-correlation structure by a small number of pairs of \"principal components\", each associated with random weights or loadings that vary over subjects [25] .\nIn the current work, we hypothesize that the traditional choice of global A\u2424 measurements, either the whole cortex or pre-defined anatomical target ROIs with high A\u2424 uptake, limits our ability to uncover significant effects of A\u2424 burden on glucose metabolism. We also hypothesize that distributed-to-distributed and local-to-distributed patterns of the A\u2424 burdenglucose metabolism relationship are likely to appear in aging populations with varying degrees of cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and image acquisition", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

Let X and Y be two sets of N PET images (e.g., florbetapir and FDG SUVR images), where the rows are the image values and the N columns are the number of subjects. The number of subjects must be identical for the two image modalities, while the number of voxels may differ. We also assume that the columns of X and Y are centered by subtracting their mean value over subjects and normalized by dividing by their root sum of squares, respectively. The cross-correlation voxels\u00d7voxels matrix between X and Y is defined as\nSince the size of the cross-correlation matrix C is usually much larger than its rank (i.e., many more voxels than subjects), the statistical inference over this matrix, or even its storage, becomes impractical. As such, dimensionality reduction techniques based on matrix decompositions are required. The SVD of the cross-correlation matrix C is given by\nwhere U and V are orthonormal matrices whose columns are the so-called eigenimages or spatial loadings for X and Y respectively, and W is a diagonal matrix of component weights (i.e., eigenvalues). In practice, C is approximated by the first few components, ordered according to the values of the weights in W. Thus, there is no need to re-construct the matrix C for extracting significant cross-correlations patterns, but they can be straightforwardly obtained from the spatial loadings U and V. Within-modality, voxels with high spatial loading in U and V values co-vary together (i.e., are positively correlated), while voxels with high opposite signed values are negatively correlated. Thus, high spatial loadings of an eigenimage in U can be interpreted as a spatial network of highly correlated voxels that are, in turn, maximally crosscorrelated (i.e., in the sense of canonical correlations) with the spatial network of voxels showing high values in the matched eigenimage V. Hence, taken together, the ordered (i.e., according to the eigenvalues in W) pairs of eigenimages in U and V produce partial, but maximally, cross-correlated distributedto-distributed views of full cross-correlation matrix C. Indeed, the corresponding subject's scores corresponding to U and V are the weighted (i.e., by the spatial loadings) spatial averages of each PET modality that produce the largest possible betweenmodality cross-correlations.\nAdditionally, the dot product between a matched pair of eigenimages resembles the so-called homologous correlation (i.e., correlation between corresponding voxels), which is simply the diagonal of the voxel x voxel matrix C. Note that such homologous correlation would produce a local-to-local (at the voxel level) distributed view of the correlation between amyloid and FDG SUVR images.\nA straightforward computational way of finding analytical expressions for the matrices U, V, and W, as well as for the corresponding subject scores or eigenvectors, has been reported by Worsley et al. [25] . In particular, SVD-based A\u2424 scores (SUVR SVD ) are easily obtained by mapping the florbetapir data matrix X onto the space of the orthogonal eigenimages U (i.e., U'X). By definition, the SUVR SVD scores are (distributed) weighted averages of the whole cortex A\u2424 burden that maximally correlate with specific metabolic spatial network. Since the eigenvalues in W come in an ordered fashion, the pair of components corresponding to the first columns of U and V provide the maximum distributed-to-distributed cross-correlation pattern between A\u2424 burden and metabolism. In the following description, SUVR SVD will refer to the first (i.e., corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue in W) amyloid score (i.e., first row of U'X).\nNote that the computation of the individual scores described above depends on the eigenimages that have been, in turn, derived from the whole sample. In order to overcome any possible circularity effect, we have employed a leave-one-out cross-validation technique to produce the individual SVD-based scores. Thus, leaving each sample out one-at-a-time, the SVD and corresponding eigenimages are produced from the rest of the sample (as previously described). Then, the individual scores SUVR SVD for the left-out sample is computed by mapping it onto the space of the orthogonal eigenimages corresponding to the rest of the sample."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of global and local amyloid scores", "text": "A voxelwise analysis-of-covariance (ANCOVA) model that included FDG SUVR as dependent, predicting variable (Y FDG ); age, gender, and cognitive measurements (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) as global confounding covariates; GM density as a voxelwise confounding covariate (grouped as X Cov ); and A\u2424 burden (Amyloid), APOE 4 status, and Amyloid x APOE 4 status interaction as predictors-of-interest was assessed:\nNote that the GM density was also included as a covariate in order to minimize the potential confounding effect of inter-subject differences in brain atrophy [32] .

Statistically significant A\u2424-related decreases in metabolism were observed in a number of regions, including the bilateral right angular gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and precuneus (Fig. 2B) . Note a more limited set of significant regions when using the composite ROI average of A\u2424 burden (Fig. 2C) .\nWe subsequently re-evaluated the corresponding SVD-based A\u2424 scores for each of the subpopulations of CN, EMCI, and LMCI subjects. Supplementary Figure 1 shows the first SVD A\u2424 (A, C, E) and FDG (B, D, F) components, which accounted for 15.21%, 25.17%, and 28.55% of the total covariability, respectively. It is interesting to note that, while the topographical distribution of the first FDG eigenimage appeared to be similar across the three subpopulations, the A\u2424 eigenimage seems to be shifted from inferior parietal regions in CN subjects to inferior temporal regions in the LCMI cohort. For the CN group, the strongest positive weights in the first A\u2424 eigenimage (Supplementary Figure 1A) correspond to the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral inferior temporal gyrus, and right angular gyrus, while the strongest negative FDG weights appear in the right angular gyrus (Supplementary Figure 1B) . The A\u2424 eigenimage corresponding to the EMCI group does not appear to be strong in the right angular gyrus (Supplementary Figure 1 C ), but it maintains strong concurrent negative FDG weights (Supplementary Figure 1D) . However, the spatial patterns of the SVD components in the LMCI group are similar to those corresponding to the whole sample (Supplementary Figure 1E, F) . There was no significant effect of SVD-based scores or APOE 4 on metabolism for the individual sub-populations corresponding to CN and EMCI subjects (figures not shown here). In contrast, we observed (weak) statistically significant relationships between SVDbased A\u2424 and glucose metabolism in the angular gyrus and middle temporal gyri in the LMCI cohort (Fig. 2D) .\nSimilar to the previous SVD analysis on each particular cognitive cohort, we also assessed the value of the SVD-based A\u2424 scores on the two groups of subjects labelled as A\u2424+ and A\u2424-based on visual reads. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the first SVD amyloid (A, C) and FDG (B, D) components for the A\u2424-and A\u2424+ groups, which accounted for 12.19% and 10.85% of the total co-variability, respectively. While the strongest negative FDG weights appear in the right angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and precuneus areas for the A\u2424-cohort (Supplementary Figure 2B) , no clear indication of a focal relationship with distributed A\u2424 appear in the group of A\u2424+ subjects (Supplementary Figure 2D) . The topographical distribution of the first A\u2424 eigenimage in the A\u2424-subjects (Supplementary Figure 2A) appears to be strong in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral inferior temporal gyrus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and right angular gyrus. In contrast, the A\u2424+ group shows a more homogenous and globally distributed pattern of A\u2424 related to glucose metabolism ( Supplementary Figure 2 C) , particularly in the frontal cortex. Figure 3A shows the t-test parametric maps of the relationship between glucose metabolism and SVD-based A\u2424 scores corresponding to the A\u2424-cohort. Some areas of statistically significant correlations are observed in the right angular gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex. As a comparison, note a weaker relationship for the case of the composite A\u2424 ROI (Fig. 3B) , despite both A\u2424 measurements producing scores of similar magnitudes (see Fig. 3D ). As evidenced by Figure 3D , the boxplots of the SVD-based and composite ROI metrics show similar mean values in both cohort of subjects.

Figure 4A and 4B show the spatial distribution of the A\u2424 pattern of spread or \"amyloid network\" corresponding to each of these two seeds, respectively. As expected, relatively strong correlation values were obtained around the seed location. However, the seed-based amyloid network relative to the RANG seed (Fig. 4B) appears to be stronger and has a larger spatial extent compared to the one corresponding to the LFUSI seed (Fig. 4A) . In fact, the network relative to the RANG seed follows a spatial pattern similar (although weaker in magnitude) to the one resulting from the composite ROI amyloid \"seed\" (Fig. 4 C) . Pearson's correlation between local A\u2424 and local glucose metabolism (i.e., at the same seed location) in the LFUSI and RANG were r = -0.1613 (p < 0.001) and r = -0.2562 (p < 0.001), respectively. Figure 4D shows box-plots corresponding to the individual LFUSI and RANG SUVR seed amyloid measurements for the three different clinical classification groups. Note that, for each of the three clinical cohorts, the LFUSI seed region shows relatively lower A\u2424 burden than the RANG seed region. However, these local measures of amyloid showed distinct local-to-distributed patterns of cross-correlation with glucose metabolism (Fig. 5A, B) . The pattern observed with LFUSI A\u2424 (Fig. 5A) showed negative statistically significant correlations with glucose metabolism in the inferior temporal-parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus, which resembles the significant regions obtained with the SVD-based amyloid burden (i.e., Fig. 2B ). In contrast, as observed in Figure 5B , the A\u2424 burden in the RANG was negatively related to glucose metabolism in a small cluster within the RANG itself (i.e., local-to-local relationship). Remarkably, the strengths of these distinct seed-based correlation patterns seem to go in opposite direction as compared the corresponding A\u2424 networks (Fig. 4A, B) . While the A\u2424 network for the LFUSI seed appears to be weaker in magnitude and spatial extent than that corresponding to the RANG seed, the seed-based correlations with glucose metabolism follow a reverse relationship. In contrast, the local-to-distributed correlation patterns of the LFUSI seed with glucose metabolism seem to be stronger and more spatially extended than those relative to the RANG seed. Figure 5 C shows the local-to-distributed patterns of relationships with glucose metabolism corresponding to the LFUSI seed in the LMCI cohort. Here, we observed statistically significant local effects of LFUSI A\u2424, particularly in the angular gyrus and lateral middle and inferior temporal gyri. There was no statistically significant local-to-distributed effect of LFUSI amyloid on metabolism for the individual sub-populations corresponding to CN and EMCI subjects (figures not shown here). The local-to-local LFUSI seed correlations for the CN, EMCI, and LMCI cohorts were r = -0.0525 (p = 0.435), r = -0.1301 (p = 0.065), and r = -0.1884 (p = 0.011), respectively.

We applied these techniques to a set of florbetapir and FDG PET images from a cohort of CN and MCI ADNI subjects. Our analysis highlighted a set of spatially distributed regions covering not only typical areas of high A\u2424 burden, but also specific areas of relative low burden (e.g., fusiform gyrus) that are related to the reduction of glucose metabolism. We then derived an SVD-based score that does not only differentiate between A\u2424-and A\u2424+ subjects, but also accounts for a significant relationship with glucose metabolism on those subjects showing relatively lower values of A\u2424 burden. Additionally, our seed-based correlation analysis showed that focal regions with relatively low A\u2424 burden (e.g., fusiform gyrus) may exhibit a much stronger association to distributed patterns of decreasing metabolism than other regions with higher amyloid load (e.g., angular gyrus).\nIt has been a common practice to express A\u2424 burden by a global index that represent the A\u2424 accumulation in regions with relatively high burden. Such practice may originate in early studies that showed strong topographical overlap between the distribution of A\u2424 burden and FDG hypometabolism, particularly in lateral parieto-temporal, posterior cingulate, and precuneus regions [34, 35] , and more generally, within the so-called intrinsic connectivity networks (e.g., default model network) [36, 37] . Despite some more recent studies [38] having shown a mismatch between regional metabolic alterations and toxic A\u2424 presence, the use of a composite ROI for describing A\u2424 burden is still dominant in the field. In fact, studies of potential therapeutic agents designed to reduce A\u2424 have employed composite ROI scores as an outcome measure [39, 40] . Hence, despite the usefulness of composite ROI scores for assessment of A\u2424 burden progression and the development of anti-amyloid therapies, its validity for revealing interactions with other brain biomarkers (e.g., glucose metabolism, brain atrophy, brain functional connectivity) remains questionable.\nIn concordance with other studies [24, 38, 41] , our results from the seed-based correlation analysis suggest that distributed patterns of neurodegeneration may also be related to focal AD-related pathologies in remote, \"connected\" brain regions with relatively low A\u2424 burden. Nevertheless, the actual meaning of the term \"connected\" in this context still needs to be fully understood. It is still not clear whether distributed patterns of reduced metabolism were mediated by either functional connectivity or by the spread of A\u2424 pathology following the underlying structural connectivity. Even though, and in correspondence with other studies [42] , our findings point to the necessity of incorporating a more complex network perspective into the accepted temporal models [7, 43] of the amyloid cascade hypothesis [5, 6] .\nThe relationship between A\u2424 accumulation, hypometabolism, and functional connectivity has been explored in several studies [9, 36, 44] . In one study [9] , the authors identified a significant disruption of MRI-derived functional whole-brain connectivity in densely connected cortical regions (i.e., hubs) for amyloid-positive MCI subjects. Further, they found that increased A\u2424 burden was correlated with reduced whole-brain connectivity and glucose metabolism, particularly in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus hub region. As explained by Buckner and colleagues [36] , since cortical hubs are regions of high intrinsic activity and metabolism associated with information processing, they could explain the pattern of regional vulnerability in AD. Correspondingly, our joint SVD analysis revealed a specific pattern of distributed regions (first amyloid eigenimage in Fig. 1) where A\u2424 burden was maximally related to a decrease in glucose metabolism. Remarkably, the areas most strongly contributing (e.g., fusiform gyri, pars opecularis, medial frontal regions, inferior temporal gyri) to that specific A\u2424 pattern have been all highlighted as metabolic connectivity hubs in our previous study [17] . The concept of metabolic connectivity [45] evaluates across-subjects correlations of glucose metabolism between different brain regions, which have been proven [45] to be consistent with anatomical network architecture. Therefore, the identification of metabolic connectivity hubs as the main components of the first amyloid eigenimage lends further support to the vulnerability of hub regions to A\u2424 accumulation and functional/metabolic disconnection.\nThe different spatial patterns observed in the first eigenimage corresponding to the SVD analysis across the different cognitive subpopulations (Supplementary Figure 1 ) are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that global fibrillar A\u2424 load and cerebral glucose metabolism follow spatiotemporally-divergent [10, 13, 15, 21] evolution paths across AD progression. Indeed, our analysis showed that the bilateral angular gyri are common (across the three subpopulations) regions of strong reduced metabolism as revealed by the first FDG eigenimage, while they only have strong contribution to the A\u2424 eigenimage in the CN group. This finding suggests that the angular gyrus is a region demonstrating a local-to-local relationship between A\u2424 accumulation and metabolism at preclinical and early stages of AD, while at more advanced clinical stages that relationship seems to follow a more local-to-distributed pattern with minor involvement of the inferior parietal areas. In contrast, the fusiform gyrus maintained a strong contribution to the first amyloid eigenimage across the three cognitive populations, although they appeared to be significantly related to decreasing metabolism only for the LMCI cohort.\nIn agreement with our previous findings [21] , our present results also suggest that the statistically significant association between A\u2424 deposition and glucose metabolism can only be detected across a heterogeneous population of subjects representing the continuous spectrum of the AD pathology, rather than in discrete segments of the AD progression trajectories represented by homogeneous subpopulations (e.g., CN, EMCI). As shown in Figure 2 , statistically significant relationship between SVD-based A\u2424 and metabolism could be detected only in the LMCI subpopulation, perhaps due to the heterogeneity of the A\u2424 scores distribution across subjects (as shown in Fig. 1D ). In any case, those changes in glucose metabolism related to distributed A\u2424 suggest that putative anti-amyloid therapies should target individuals who are on the path to high amyloid burden like the LMCI subpopulation shown here, rather than using more homogeneous cohorts with more stable accumulation.\nWe also found a weak relationship between metabolism and APOE 4 genotype after accounting for distributed SVD-based scores of A\u2424. Our results are in agreement with those of other studies [19, 20] , who reported that, in a cognitively normal, aging population, most of the APOE-related differences in hypometabolism are mediated by A\u2424 burden. That is, APOE 4 genotype alone can be related to the reduction of glucose metabolism, particularly in AD-signature regions. However, when interacting with A\u2424 deposition, most of the reduction in metabolism is attributable to effect of A\u2424. As pointed out by other studies [46, 47] , such results should not be interpreted as APOE 4 genotype and A\u2424 burden providing redundant information, but as having an additive impact on the reduction of glucose metabolism.\nThe main limitation of the current study relates to the computation of SVD-based amyloid scores. By definition, the SVD computation is a group-level technique that requires a relatively large (N > 30) sample size for producing reliable and stable eigenimages. Since we have validated our results by using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique to produce the individual SVD-based scores, one would need to produce the A\u2424 eigenimages from an a priori training dataset of PET images for general clinical applications. The individual SVD-based amyloid scores can be easily computed from that given \"library\" of eigenimages. The sample size does not seem to be a limitation here provided the availability of large datasets, such as the ADNI study. Relative to the composition of the training dataset, our results suggest that in order to detect significant relationship with metabolism, it should be composed of subjects with an expected heterogeneous amount of A\u2424 burden (e.g., LMCI population) ranging from low A\u2424 load typical of CN individuals to more clear high levels of A\u2424 burden that are typically observed at later stages of the AD. Since we have also showed that the effect of APOE 4 seems to be mostly driven by the A\u2424 burden, we consider that no particular distribution of APOE 4 genotype should be taken into account during the composition of the training dataset."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have uncovered associations between glucose metabolism, A\u2424 burden, and APOE 4 status in a sample of CN and MCI subjects. Our analysis revealed that the classical approach of choosing a single index of global A\u2424 burden is sub-optimal from the perspective of discovering more complex, multivariate relationships with glucose metabolism. By exploring the large-scale, cross-correlation between A\u2424 and FDG PET images with the SVD approach, our analysis revealed key findings, including: 1) glucose metabolism is not only reduced in concurrent regions showing high A\u2424 load, and 2) not only spatially distributed, but also focal accumulation of A\u2424, can be related to metabolic dysfunction in remote regions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to relate glucose metabolism and A\u2424 burden from a network perspective that accounts for distributed-to-distributed and local-to-distributed patterns of cross-correlation. Future work will expand the current multivariate analysis to identify either distributed or local patterns of A\u2424 maximally-related (e.g., modulated) to metabolic connectivity.
