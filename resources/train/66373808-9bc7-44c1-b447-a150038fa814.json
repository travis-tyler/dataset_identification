Two methodological approaches were applied for the target-Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of these patients. In addition, we performed progranulin plasma dosage, C9Orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion analysis, and APOE genotyping. Results: We detected three rare known pathogenic mutations in the GRN and PSEN2 genes and eleven unknown-impact mutations in the GRN, VCP, MAPT, FUS, TREM2, and NOTCH3 genes. Six patients were carriers of only common risk variants (APOE and PRNP), and one did not show any risk mutation/variant. Overall, 69% (n = 9) of our early onset Alzheimer's disease (EAOD) patients, compared with 34% (n = 13) of sporadic late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients and 27% (n = 73) of non-affected controls (ADNI, whole genome data), were carriers of at least two rare/common risk variants in the analyzed candidate genes panel, excluding the full penetrant mutations. Conclusion: This study suggests that EOD patients without full penetrant mutations are characterized by higher probability to carry polygenic risk alleles that patients with LOAD forms. This finding is in line with recently reported evidence, thus suggesting that the genetic risk factors identified in LOAD might modulate the risk also in EOAD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The term early onset dementias (EOD) refers to a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD), affecting individuals aged between 45 and 65 years, and it represents roughly 5% of dementia cases [1] . The symptoms of EOD are similar to those of late onset AD (LOAD) and FTD. However, EOD is thought to be more severe and typically causes a rapid decline in health [2, 3] .\nBoth AD and FTD are pathologically heterogeneous disorders, characterized by a complex genetic architecture that is not yet completely understood. The heritability rates of the different dementia subtypes range from 40 to 80% with EOD showing a higher genetic component than late-onset dementia (for review [4] ).\nAD is clinically characterized by memory impairment and pathologically by the presence of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) peptide (the precursor of which is encoded by the APP gene) plaques and intraneuronal tangles of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau (a microtubule-associated protein encoded by the MAPT gene). The risk AD spectrum is composed of Mendelian genetic traits, genetic population risk factors (susceptibility genes), and nongenetic risk factors such as low cognitive reserve and head trauma [5, 6] . The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) 4 allele is a known population risk factor [7] that has been found to increase the risk of early onset AD (EOAD) [8] . Since its discovery, over 550 susceptibility genes have been suggested to increase the risk of AD [9] , though the impact of most of these genes seems to be much lower than that of APOE [10, 11] . In particular, the common variants with small individual effects jointly modify the risk and age at onset of AD and dementia, showing a stronger effect in carriers homozygous for APOE 4 [12] .\nThree genes have been identified to carry causative mutations for familial EOAD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) (for review [11] ). The estimated mutation frequencies of these three genes are 1% for APP, 6% for PSEN1, and 1% for PSEN2. Together, they explain a genetic background of only 5-10% of EOAD patients, leaving a large group of autosomal dominant pedigrees genetically unexplained (for review [13] ). This finding suggests that additional causal genes remain to be identified.\nFTD is characterized by personality changes, language impairment, and deficits of executive functions associated with frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. At least nine autosomal dominant genetic traits have been associated with this pathology: mutations in MAPT, in the progranulin gene (GRN), and in the hexanucleotide repeat expansion C9orf72 genes are the most common, with the highest prevalence of GRN mutations found in populations of northern Italy [14] [15] [16] [17] . GRN null mutations cause protein haploinsufficiency, leading to a significant decrease in the circulating progranulin levels in plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mutation carriers [18] [19] [20] . Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), fused in sarcoma (FUS), dynactin (DCTN1), and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell (TREM2) are rarer causes of this pathology [4, 21] . Mutations in VCP [22] , TARDBP [23] , and TREM2 [24] have been observed in Italian families with a history of FTD.\nInterestingly, mutations in some of these genes, such as MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72 have also been detected at low frequencies in AD patients, supporting the notion that a genetic heterogeneity exists for these diseases and that both diseases could form an AD-FTD disease continuum (for review [13] ). An AD-like phenotype has also been described with the presence of a nonsense mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP p.Q160*), which is responsible for inherited neurodegenerative spongiform encephalopathies [25] . In addition, the common coding polymorphism, methionine (M) to valine (V) at position 129 (M129V) in PRNP has been associated with EOAD, where the risk is higher for the VV genotype and is increased in patients with a positive family history [26] .\nThe recent development of extremely powerful, massively, parallel DNA sequencing technologies allows for the systematic screening of individual genomes for DNA sequence variations at base-pair resolution, enabling researchers to address the missing hereditability question and, thus, to uncover novel and/or potentially pathogenic rare variants in candidate genes. As previously documented [27] [28] [29] , targeted re-sequencing of a clinically significant gene panel may represent a powerful and cost-timeeffective technique compared to the previously used sequential Sanger sequencing.\nRecently, Cruchaga et al. [30] , confirmed that the genetic factors identified in LOAD modulate the risk also in EOAD cohorts, where the burden of these risk variants is associated with familial clustering and earlier onset of AD. In the present study, we estimated the genetic load in EOAD and LOAD, by identifying known and novel, both rare and common risk variants in candidate genes. We applied next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis in a selected retrospective cohort of Italian EOD patients and compared the frequencies of variants found with those estimated in samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A retrospective sample of patients was recruited in the context of studies investigating genetic forms of dementia at IRCCS Istituto Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli, Brescia Italy, Fondazione Case Serena, Pontoglio, Brescia, Italy, and Fondazione Europea Ricerca Biomedica, Centro di Eccellenza Alzheimer, Ospedale Briolini Gazzaniga, Bergamo, Italy. Specifically, twenty-two patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria for the present study: 1) phenotype of AD, FTD, or LBD and 2) early disease onset (<65 years old), or 3) family history suggestive of an autosomal dominant genetic form of dementia (i.e., high or medium risk of identifying a mutation according to Loy and Woods criteria [31, 32] , as described below). Family history was collected through interviews with a first-degree relative or the spouse of the proband. The clinical and medical history of each family member was collected, and all of the available documentation for affected members was acquired. The probability of identifying a genetic mutation for AD or FTD was estimated considering the family medical history, the number of first and second-degree affected family members, and the age of symptom onset, according to the criteria developed by Loy and colleagues [31] . According to Loy et al.'s criteria for AD, we defined a probability of identifying a genetic mutation of \u226586% as a high risk, a probability of 68-85% as a medium risk, a probability of 15-67% as a low risk, and a probability <15% as apparently sporadic/unknown significance. Considering the same criteria for FTD patients, we considered an \u226588% probability of identifying a genetic mutation as a high risk, a 31-41% probability as a medium risk, and a probability <13% as a low risk. FTD pedigrees were also scored according to Wood's pedigrees classifications criteria [32, 33] .\nAll participants were of Italian ancestry. Demographic features and clinical data (age at onset, MMSE) are reported in Table 1 . As the sample was retrospectively pooled for the analysis, a standard protocol for biomarker characterization was not applied. Sixteen patients underwent one of the following examinations as part of their diagnostic exam: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and/or lumbar puncture. MRI and PET/SPECT scans were visually evaluated to determine medialtemporal atrophy and hypometabolism, respectively. CSF samples were processed with local procedures to determine the level of A\u2424, tau, and p-tau. Positive diagnosis was determined based on established cut-offs.\nBlood samples were collected from all patients. DNA and plasma were obtained according to standard procedures.

A recent review on the correlation between TREM2 and AD [54] , showed a meta-analytic association of this mutation with the late onset form of the disease. Our results also showed its involvement in the early onset form of AD. Since the two patients were also homozygous for the APOE 4 allele, this finding suggests interactions between TREM2 and APOE, as already demonstrated in vitro [55, 56] . TREM2 is a lipid sensor that interacts with several AD risk factors involved in lipid metabolism, including APOE, which could decrease the threshold of disease occurrence [57] .\nIn the specific case of two AD patients carrying the GRN p.V77I and R19W mutations, there is evidence of AD pathology in imaging and from biofluid biomarkers ( Table 1) . Since these missense mutations do not affect the progranulin levels, a pathogenic role of these mutations seems unlikely. However, we cannot exclude that they might have a pathogenic role other than \"loss of function\", as no functional studies have been performed. Their presence in AD patients might rather indicate that this gene could be implicated also in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to AD dementia.\nOur analyses showed the presence of additional rare variants located in the 5'/3' UTR regulatory gene region of the GRN, VCP, MAPT, and FUS genes. A recent study reported that 3'UTR SNPs, such as rs80301724 in the FUS gene, are present in microRNA binding sites and could impact the post-transcriptional regulation, resulting in overexpression of the protein [58] . Also missense mutations in TREM2, GRN, NOTCH3, and VCP genes and a splicing variant in NOTCH3 gene were detected but, except for some information from bioinformatic tools, their specific functional impact was not assessed. The involvement of NOTCH3 gene in dementia patients is interesting, both with a missense and with a splicing variant. This gene encodes a single-pass trans-membrane protein of 2321 amino acids, predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells in adults. It is well documented that NOTCH3 mutations play a critical role in the pathogenetic mechanism of vascular smooth muscle cell degeneration linked to CADASIL, one of the most common hereditary forms of stroke [59] . A recent hypothesis of AD [60] suggested that in CADASIL triggering events in the pathogenic cascade are not amyloid deposits but damaged blood vessels caused by inflammatory reactions that lead to ischemia, amyloid accumulation, axonal degeneration, synaptic loss, and eventually irreversible neuronal cell death. Inflammation and blood vessel damage are well recognized complications of AD, but what causes them and why the cerebral microvasculature is affected is still under debate [60] . Mutations in NOTCH3 gene are known to provoke inflammatory reactions and damage the brain in a wide variety of diseases [59] , thus it is possible that one or more mutations in this gene may damage the microvasculature of the brain eventually leading that leads to dementia. The V1183M mutation was classified as a polymorphism in an Italian population [61] , though the A allele frequency observed was 0.006.\nInclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and/or FTD (IBMPFD) is a recently identified autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the VCP gene affecting muscle, bone, and brain. Interestingly, in our cohort we found the R93C (47832C>T) mutation in the VCP gene already described in patients with IBMPFD [62] [63] [64] [65] ."}, {"section_title": "247", "text": "consent.

The functional role of this polymorphism in AD pathogenesis is unclear. However, there is now strong evidence that APOE 4 could affect amyloid deposition [66] .

They could be sporadic cases with onset at the extreme end of expected age range. However, the hypothesis that EOD is caused by mutations in genes not included in the NGS panel cannot be ruled out. In this regard, whole genome sequencing could foster the investigation of additional genetic factors underlying apparently sporadic EOD. Nonetheless, this task was beyond the scope of the present work."}, {"section_title": "Additional observations", "text": "Interestingly, fifteen (68%) of the 22 patients carried at least one rare variant (TREM2, GRN, PSEN2 , MAPT, VCP, NOTCH3, or FUS). Among these, fourteen subjects carried also a common variant (APOE and/or PRNP). This result supports the hypothesis that EOD results from the interconnected mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration, where multiple genes can be implicated in one or more systems. Indeed, recent biochemical approaches [55, 56] have shown interactions among these genes, such as between TREM2 and APOE in vitro. These results strongly implicate a potential additive/synergic effect in EOD forms linked to the variable inter-and intrafamiliar expressivity. To indirectly assess this effect, we found through the ADNI database that, excluding the full penetrant mutations, 69% of our sample showed \u22652 rare/common risk variants, as compared to 34% and 27% in sporadic late-onset AD patients and controls, respectively. This indicates that the EOD is more often associated with rare variants or risk alleles, and this could be useful in the genotypephenotype correlations. Moreover, <10% of subjects, in our cohort, and in late onset AD patients, compared to 25% in a control group, were not carriers of any of the examined variants, which strengthens the idea of using an NGS whole/exome genome approach in a larger sample.\nOne AD patient with a very early age of onset (41 years) showed neither rare nor common-risk variants. Even an exome clinic investigation detected no rare or common risk variants. The family history was negative, as no other first-degree relatives were affected (neither the parents nor three siblings, two of whom were older than the patient, presented with the disease). Misdiagnosis is unlikely since this patient was positive for all AD biomarkers (abnormal CSF amyloid and tau levels, hypometabolism on FDG-PET, and medial temporal atrophy on MRI). Although we considered the possibility that the patient may show an extreme early-onset presentation of sporadic AD, this finding suggests that additional genes could be implicated in EOD, which strengthens the evidence that the panel of candidate genes needs to be expanded in the future.\nFor the first time, the D87N mutation in the TREM2 gene was detected in a LBD patient with early onset. LBD is the second most common form of dementia after AD, with a prevalence rate of 4% in the general population [68] . The core symptoms of LBD include sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and cognitive deficits, accompanied within the first year by Parkinsonian motor symptoms. A recent twin study did not show a strong support for a genetic contribution to LBD. However, other studies have demonstrated that LBD aggregates in families and may have an autosomal inheritance pattern (for review [4] ). To date, a few genetic markers have been identified. For instance, duplication and SNPs within \u2423, \u2424, \u2425\u2212synuclein genes have been associated with increased risk of LBD [69, 70] . Moreover, mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene are more common in LBD, in addition to mutations in the MAPT or leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) genes (for review [4] ). Only one genome-wide linkage study has been performed among patients with familial LBD. A locus on chromosome 2q35-q36 was identified, though none of the genes in this region could explain the relation with LBD [71] . Although further confirmation is needed, the presence of a TREM2 mutation in an LBD patient adds a new actor to its genetic architecture. Mutations in TREM2, a microglial receptor, can lead to aberrant innate immune cell signaling, contributing to the initiation and propagation of several neurodegenerative phenotypes [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] , including LBD. Moreover, this LBD patient was a carrier of the GG (Val/Val) PRNP risk genotype. This finding is in agreement with a previous study [84] that described a patient carrying the M232R mutation in the PRNP gene who developed dementia and died six years after onset. An autopsy revealed the patient had dementia with Lewy bodies, not Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study confirms the role of GRN and PSEN2 mutations in EOD, in the Italian population and provides evidence for roles of novel rare mutations located in the 5'/3' UTRs regulatory gene region of the GRN, VCP, MAPT, and FUS genes, missense mutations in TREM2, GRN, NOTCH3, and VCP, genes and a splicing variant in NOTCH3 gene, with a \"medium\" GDI value. As previously observed, mutations in the PSEN2 gene, a rare cause of dementia worldwide, are frequent in Italian patients. We also confirmed that mutations in GRN gene were present in both FTD and AD phenotypes. Moreover, six patients were carriers of only common risk variants (APOE and PRNP), and one patient did not show any mutation/variant. Overall, 69% (n = 9) of our EAOD patients, compared with 34% (n = 13) of sporadic LOAD patients and 27% (n = 73) of non-affected controls, were carriers of at least two rare/common risk variants in the analyzed candidates' genes panel.\nThough our findings are consistent with results obtained from large cohorts [12] , independent replications in larger samples are warranted. To further validate the role of polygenic risk variants in EOD, a systematic screening of rare and common variants in dementia-associated genes should be implemented in prospective cohorts with full clinical and biomarker characterization.
