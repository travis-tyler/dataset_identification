[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, which presents a significant public health issue 1 .\nCurrently, there is no vaccine available 2 . An FDA-approved standard of treatment for COVID-19 is not available either. Current treatment for COVID-19 patients can be classified into three categories: anti-viral treatments 3 , immunosuppression-based treatments 4 , and other supporting treatments such as convalescent plasma 5 . Specifically, in a few trials patients have been given combinations of antivirals including umifenovir 6 , remdesivir/ribavirin 7 , chloroquine 8 (an anti-malarial drug), chloroquine's analogue hydroxychloroquine 9 (a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug), and/or lopinavir/ritonavir 10, 11 . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibodies against IL-6 receptors, and corticosteroids have also been used during the early acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 to suppress the overactivated immune response 10 . Other supporting therapies include supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated (e.g., intubation, etc.).\nGiven the recent success of immunotherapy in cancer 12 , several immune cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 are being rapidly developed, which include quantification or adoptive transfer of monocytes or NK cells (NCT04375176, NCT04280224, and NCT04365101), universal 'off-the-shelf 'NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells (NCT04324996), and several stem cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies (NCT04416139). Clinically, NK cells were first defined as CD56 bright CD16and CD56 dim CD16 + in the peripheral blood 13 . These NK cells isolated from peripheral blood can be further modified to express CAR for treating a variety of cancer and infectious diseases 14 .\nIn this study, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022, a strong neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The data show that 'off-the-shelf' CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease."}, {"section_title": "Generation of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells", "text": "To develop an NK cell-based immunotherapy to treat COVID-19 patients, we modified NK cells with a CAR molecule specific against SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Previous studies show that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 15 . Recent studies also demonstrate that a previously isolated neutralizing antibody from a convalescent SARS patient (and later named CR3022) can specifically bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 16 (Fig. 1a) . Specifically, we chose the scFv domain of CR3022 antibody because of its strong binding activity against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins.\nTo overcome the limitations of T cell therapy and take advantage of the benefits of using NK cells in targeting SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, we propose a CAR-expressing NK cell therapeutic approach. To initiate our studies, we successfully generated CR3022-CAR-NK cells in the human NK-92 cell line background (Fig. 1a) . Specifically, the NK-92 cell line was transduced with CR3022-CAR (Fig. 1) . Then, the subsequent CR3022-CAR positive NK-92 cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Sorted CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells were maintained for 2 months to verify CAR expression (data not shown). The generation of CR3022-CAR is schematically described (Fig. 1b) . 293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids containing CR3022-CAR in the SFG backbone, RDF, and PegPam3, as previously described 17, 18 . The SFG retrovirus particles were used to transduce NK-92MI cells. After 4-5 days, NK-92MI and CR3022-CAR cells were stained with CD56 and human IgG (H+L) and the CAR expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1c) . Greater than 98% of CD56 + CR3022-CAR + NK-92MI cells were observed (Fig. 1) . In summary, we have successfully established the stable membrane expression of CR3022-CAR-NK cells."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of CR3022-CAR-NK92MI cells", "text": "To have a better understanding of the immunophenotype of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI, we CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells and NK-92MI cells were incubated with the recombinant His-RBD protein from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The complex of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI and the His-RBD protein was then recognized by anti-His and its corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorophore (Fig. 2b) . Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the binding efficiency of CR3022-CAR to the RBD of S protein from either SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with earlier results from previous studies 16 , CR3022 binds to the RBD of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 2c) . We therefore conclude that CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can specifically bind to the recombinant His-RBD protein from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "CR3022-CAR-NK cells bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles", "text": "However, the partial RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2-S may not fully reflect the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Therefore, we evaluated the binding activity of CR3022-CAR cells to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles purchased from GenScript, USA. Similar to the concept in Figure 2b , CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI binds to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles. The CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI and SARS-CoV-2-S viral particle complex can be recognized by the binding of anti-spike antibody and its corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 3a) .\nPrevious studies show that the RBD of spike protein binds to ACE2 and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry 19 . As a positive control, we included 293T-hACE2 in our experiment ( Fig. 3b) . In addition, we also included spike recombinant proteins, full-length and S1 subunit containing RBD as an additional control group. As expected, CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells was able to bind to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles (Fig. 3c) .\nHowever, the binding efficiency is slightly lower than that of full-length spike recombinant protein (highlighted in red in Fig. 3c ) and S1 subunit containing RBD protein (highlighted in green in Fig. 3c ) groups. Surprisingly, 293T-hACE2 cells showed a weaker binding efficiency with the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, compared to that of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells, indicating that the binding activities of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI is superior to the natural receptor of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In summary, CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can specifically and strongly bind to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles."}, {"section_title": "CR3022-CAR-NK cells can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain expressing infected target cells and specifically kill their susceptible target cells", "text": "After successful establishment of CR3022-CAR-NK cells and demonstration of recombinant His-RBD protein and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particle binding, we further evaluated whether CR3022-CAR-NK cells can be activated by SARS-CoV-2-S infected target cells. To test this, we first transfected the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into 293T-hACE2 cells (commonly used cell line for studying the SARS-CoV-2 virus) by transfecting these two cells with an RBD encoding plasmid ( Fig. 4a and Fig. 5 ). Greater than 90% of transfection efficiencies on 293T-hACE2 cell were obtained. The expression of RBD proteins on 293T-hACE2 cells were verified by flow cytometry (Fig. 4b and Fig. 5 ). After successful establishment of these 293T-hACE2-RBD target cells, we tested whether CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can be activated by these target cells using the conventional CD107a assay. Expectedly, the surface level expression of CD107a molecules on CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells after co-culturing with these 293T-hACE2-RBD target cells were significantly increased, which was measured by both the percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD107a on CR3022-CAR-NK92-MI cells, compared to cells cocultured with the parent cells alone (Fig. 4c) . In addition, the production of TNF-alpha and perforin were greatly increased on CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells after co-culturing with these 293T-hACE2-RBD target cells (data not shown).\nNext, we evaluated the capacity of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells (including 293T-hACE2). For 293T-hACE2 cells, an additional plasmid encoding firefly luciferase (FFLuc) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was also transfected to perform the standard Luciferase assay 2 . Successful luciferase expression on 293T-hACE2 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis ( Fig. 4b) . Compared to control NK-92MI cells, as described previously 17 , CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells showed significantly higher killing capacities against 293T-hACE2 cells transfected with RBD (Fig. 4d) .\nTo directly test whether CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can kill SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells in vitro, we used the 4-hour Chromium-51 ( 51 Cr) release assay (a gold standard assay). The data show that CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells effectively kill 293T-hACE2-RBD cells by in vitro 51 Cr release assay (Fig. 5c) . Thus, by using both the luciferase killing assay platform and 51 Cr release assay platforms using two different transfected cell lines, we demonstrated the CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can kill the SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells, which supports the clinical use for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Recent clinical trials testing cancer immunotherapies have shown promising results for treating infectious diseases 14 . One of crucial barriers to using primary NK cells for immunotherapy is the difficulty in obtaining an adequate number of NK cells from peripheral blood or cold blood before expansion 18 .

Thus, in this study, we focused on CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI, a NK-92 cell line expressing IL-2 molecule to sustain the persistence in vivo 20 .\nIn this study, we provide proof-of-concept for using CR3022-CAR-based cell therapy for "}, {"section_title": "Online content", "text": "Any methods, additional references, source data, and statements of code and data availability are available online.
