[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Medicaid expansions through the Affordable Care Act began in January 2014, but we have little information about what is happening in rural areas where provider access and patient resources might be more limited. In 2008, Oregon held a lottery for restricted access to its Medicaid program for uninsured low-income adults not otherwise eligible for public coverage. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used this opportunity to conduct the first randomized controlled study of a public insurance expansion. This analysis builds off of previous work by comparing rural and urban survey outcomes and adds qualitative interviews with 86 rural study participants for context. We examine health care access and use, personal finances, and self-reported health. While urban and rural populations have unique demographic profiles, rural populations appear to have benefited from Medicaid as much as urban. Qualitative interviews revealed the distinctive challenges still facing low-income uninsured and newly insured rural populations."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "What should rural areas expect from Medicaid expansion? Reducing health disparities is a key goal of the Affordable Care Act, and Medicaid expansion is a central strategy for achieving that goal. Proponents of the optional Medicaid expansions hope that increasing health insurance coverage will make health care more accessible to poor and underserved populations, better connect them to existing resources within the delivery system, and improve their outcomes. But health disparities between urban and rural populations may be a function of more than just the affordability of care. With Medicaid expansion, will rural areas see the same \"bang for the buck\" as urban settings?\nThere is no shortage of evidence that rural health disparities exist. When compared with suburban and urban settings, rural differences have been documented in such varying outcomes as obesity (O'Connor & Wellenius, 2012) , heart disease (O 'Connor & Wellenius, 2012) , general chronic disease (Meit et al., 2014) , cancer mortality (Singh, Williams, Siahpush, & Mulhollen, 2011) , cancer diagnosis and treatment (Sariego, 2009) , diabetes (Krishna, Gillespie, & McBride, 2010; O'Connor & Wellenius, 2012) , renal disease (Fan et al., 2007) , and injury and trauma (Grossman et al., 1997) .\nWhat is less clear, however, is why those disparities exist. Rural residents certainly face different socioeconomic and environmental challenges than urban or suburban counterparts. They are more likely to be older, to be poor, to be less educated, to smoke more, to exercise less, and to have poor diets (Anderson, Saman, Lipsky, & Lutfiyya, 2015; Meit et al., 2014) . In some areas, they consume more alcohol (Meit et al., 2014) . Rural residents additionally often face more difficult environmental and occupational conditions (Anderson et al., 2015; Fraser et al., 2005) .\nPrior to the Affordable Care Act, rural adults were also more likely than urban adults to be uninsured (estimated 22.1% vs. 17.4%). With Medicaid expansions this gap is narrowing, but has not yet closed (Karpman, Zuckerman, Kenney, & Odu, 2015) . Rural residents are less likely to have employer-sponsored coverage (57% vs. 51%) and, in states that have not expanded Medicaid, they often fall in the \"coverage gap\" between Medicaid and Marketplace Exchange eligibility; two out of every three uninsured rural residents live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid, compared with one of every two of the urban uninsured (Newkirk & Damico, 2014) .\nBut there are other systemic differences related to the health care delivery system that could also contribute to rural disparities. Although one in five Americans lives in a rural area, less than 11% of physicians practice in rural communities (Rosenblatt, Chen, Lishner, & Doescher, 2010) . Thus, rural residents often face reduced access to physicians, particularly in specialty areas such as mental health (Fields, Bigbee, & Bell, 2015) . A lack of public transportation infrastructure may also make it more likely that transportation barriers will prevent rural populations from travelling to the care they need (Douthit, Kiv, Dwolatzky, & Biswas, 2015; Weaver, Geiger, Lu, & Case, 2013) . Gaining insurance does not necessarily give you access to a resource that does not exist in or near your community.\nThere is also mixed evidence about the quality of care available to rural residents. Because rural practitioners see more patients, the quality of care may be compromised by high patient loads (Fields et al., 2015) . Some studies have found that rural residents are less likely to receive recommended preventive services and more likely to experience a delayed diagnosis (Aboagye, Kaiser, & Hayanga, 2014; Nguyen-Pham, Leung, & McLaughlin, 2014) . On the other hand, there is also some evidence that access and quality of some types of health care is actually the same or even better in rural areas (Kirchhoff, Hart, & Campbell, 2014; Miedema, Easley, & Robinson, 2013) .\nOverall, it is likely that urban-rural health disparities are both a function of socioeconomic differences and a function of rurality itself (Erwin, Fitzhugh, Brown, Looney, & Forde, 2010; Peterson & Litaker, 2010; Smith, Humphreys, & Wilson, 2008) . The prevailing interpretation of the research is that Medicaid expansions may be disproportionately important to rural low-income adults, but such individuals may also experience unique challenges and barriers to benefiting from the program when compared with their urban counterparts (Mueller et al., 2012 ). An assessment of the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansions should include a concentrated look at the experience of rural populations (Coburn et al., 2014) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2011) has identified those who live in rural areas as a high-priority population.\nThis study uses data from Oregon's 2008 Medicaid expansion, which was allocated by lottery to uninsured adults, to see if the causal impacts of Medicaid are similar across rural and urban populations. Previous findings from this study-the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE)-found that overall, Medicaid increased health care use with significant increases in outpatient visits, prescriptions, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits (Baicker et al., 2013; Finkelstein et al., 2011) . Coverage improved the financial stability of low-income adults by lowering medical debt and almost eliminating catastrophic medical costs (Finkelstein et al., 2011) . Medicaid reduced the prevalence of clinical depression, but it did not produce statistically significant reductions in high cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity, smoking, or cardiovascular risk (Baicker et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "New Contributions", "text": "For this study, we investigate whether gaining access to health insurance has a differential effect in urban areas compared with rural using several measures of rurality that capture increasingly isolated areas. Other research has addressed the impact of Medicaid cuts on rural populations (Silberman et al., 2005; Smith, 2013) , but the OHIE is the first study offering the opportunity to compare Medicaid expansions across rural and urban populations with an experimental design. In this article, we provide detailed comparisons not reported in our prior work. To produce a more nuanced understanding of potential coverage impacts among rural participants, we also follow up with in-depth qualitative interviews.\nOur conceptual model for this work is the \"voltage drop\" notion described by Eisenberg and Power (2000) . They argue that availability of health insurance does not guarantee that Americans receive high-quality care. Using the metaphor of an electric circuit that can lose voltage at multiple points, there are several notable points of vulnerability for low-income adults, particularly those in rural geographic regions. Individuals in our study have gained access to a Medicaid expansion program through a lottery, thus, the points most relevant for this study identified by Eisenberg and Power (2000) are (a) access to covered services, individual and institutional providers, (b) choice of providers and institutions, (c) access to consistent primary care, (d) access to referral (specialty) services, and (e) delivery of high-quality health care."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "In 2008, Oregon allocated limited slots in their otherwise closed Medicaid expansion program, Oregon Health Plan (OHP) Standard, by lottery. OHP Standard operated under a federal 1115 waiver to offer a Medicaid package to able-bodied low-income Oregonians, aged 19 to 64 years, not categorically eligible for public coverage. To qualify, an individual must have been a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant, an Oregon resident, without insurance for 6 months, had assets under $2,000, and made less than 100% of the federal poverty level, which changes each year to adjust for inflation. OHP Standard offered a comprehensive benefit package of inpatient, outpatient, and prescription coverage, with sliding scale monthly premiums ($0-$20) and no other cost sharing. There was no coverage for nonemergent dental care or vision (Allen et al., 2010) .\nOHP Standard closed to new enrollment in 2004 and experienced attrition to 19,000 covered lives by 2008, when there was adequate funding to add 10,000 new members (Allen et al., 2010) . To manage anticipated demand and allocate the expansion fairly, the state opened a \"reservation list\" for 5 weeks (January-February, 2008 ) with a broad outreach effort that allowed anyone who identified as low income and uninsured to sign up by phone, online, in person, or by mail. When the list closed, 89,824 individuals were on it. During eight lottery drawings from March through September 2008, 35,169 individuals were selected to apply for coverage. Individuals could enroll themselves and any family member but everyone had to meet eligibility requirements.\nThe OHIE was built around this natural experimental design and provides the first causal estimates of the impact of public coverage expansion for low-income adults (Finkelstein et al., 2011) . OHIE is unique because prior studies on the impact of Medicaid expansions cannot infer causality due to selection bias: Individuals with Medicaid are different in many ways from those who are uninsured, and it is impossible to know if any observed differences between the two groups are attributable to the coverage or to something else. For example, studies comparing Medicaid members with the uninsured have sometimes found that Medicaid patients fare worse than those with no coverage at all (Gaglia et al., 2011; LaPar et al., 2010) ; selection bias may help explain these findings if healthier people are less likely to sign up for coverage in the first place. The OHIE avoids such bias because whether someone had access to Medicaid was randomly determined, so any other differences between the groups should be equally present by chance.\nFor this article, we rely on our only sources of statewide survey data, collected at baseline and approximately 1 year after the Oregon Medicaid lottery. We also conducted qualitative interviews 3 years post-lottery with individuals who had returned a mail survey; the qualitative data are meant to enhance and complement the experimental quantitative findings."}, {"section_title": "Study Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mail Surveys", "text": "Questionnaires were mailed to almost all individuals who were selected to receive an OHP application, and a roughly equal number of individuals who were not. Surveys were developed by the research team using previously validated measurement constructs, and were conducted in English and Spanish. Outcomes of interest included access to care, use of care, health care quality, personal finances, and self-reported health outcomes. We followed a three-attempt fielding protocol and the first survey contained a $5 incentive. Baseline surveys were mailed in June and November of 2008. Twelve-month follow-up surveys were mailed in July and August of 2009. For the follow-up survey, we implemented an intensive protocol for approximately 30% of nonresponders that included phone calls, tracking efforts for those with bad addresses, and additional mailings; our effective response rate for the 12-month survey was 50%. Due to the considerable risk posed by response bias (particularly related to balance between treatment and control responses), this concern was empirically examined in Finkelstein et al. (2011) using a variety of data sources for comparisons and robustness checks under conservative assumptions-the results were reassuring (see Finkelstein et al., 2011, Tables A1 and A2 in the appendix). Details on our survey measures are available in Table A1 , and more information about the survey and study methodology can be found at www.nber/oregon.\nQualitative Interviews. We randomly selected a sample of 462 individuals living in rural zip codes in Oregon who had also returned a mail survey. Potential participants received a letter informing them about the study, the days that researchers would be in their area, and an offer of a $75 incentive for their time if they agreed to participate. Approximately a week after the invitation letter, a recruiting team made follow-up calls to secure participation. Oregon is composed of seven defined regions, six of them include rural townships where we recruited from: Willamette Valley (five towns), Oregon Coast (three towns), Mt. Hood/Gorge (one town), Central Oregon (two towns), Eastern Oregon (four towns), and Southern Oregon (five towns). Over a period of 2 weeks, 76 rural interviews were conducted across 12 locations that were central to the 20 townships in the sample. The number of interviews was limited by how many could be completed in each location in 1 day by two interviewers. However, to achieve diversity of experience in our sample, we conducted 10 phone interviews with people who expressed interest in participating but were unable to do so in person because of transportation barriers or poor health, therefore a total of 86 completed interviews.\nResearchers used an interview guide that explored a variety of themes related to the study with follow-up probes focused on potential impacts specific to the rural experience. Instead of relying on semistructured questions, interviewers were trained to probe around themes of interest, focusing on the most relevant to the individual participant. Examples of these included access to care, management of acute and chronic conditions, financial outcomes and medical debt, and other potential health impacts as a result of living in a rural area. This approach allowed the interviewer and respondent to focus on whatever facets of the participants' stories would elicit the richest data."}, {"section_title": "Survey Data Analysis", "text": "The main study sample consisted of 23,741 low-income adult respondents who signed up for a 2008 Oregon Medicaid lottery and responded to the 12-month follow-up mail survey in 2009. There were 5,986 participants who provided a zip code outside of a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), which was our primary definition of rural, and 17,755 urban participants who provided a zip code within an MSA. We evaluate 2008 baseline urban-rural differences using an overlap sample of 9,389 individuals who returned a baseline survey prior to being notified of lottery selection status and who also participated in the 2009 survey.\nFor our analysis of 12-month outcomes, we examined more restrictive definitions of rurality using U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2013 rural-urban continuum codes (RUCC) with two additional model specifications. The U.S. Department of Agriculture RUCC codes range from 1 to 9, with 1 being most urban. An MSA definition (25% rural in our sample) most closely resembled a RUCC definition of rural between 4 and 9 (27% rural). We additionally compared urban outcomes with RUCC 5 to 9 (15% rural, n = 3,501) and 6 to 9 (8% rural, n = 1,942). More restrictive definitions of rural were more likely to highlight the experiences of those who are truly geographically isolated, but there was a trade-off in statistical power to detect meaningful treatment differences; our sample size did not allow for further restrictions.\nWe assessed 2008 baseline urban-rural disparities using ordinary least squares regression, controlling for known demographic differences: race, ethnicity, English language, age, gender, and insurance status (insured vs. uninsured). To estimate differential impacts of Medicaid coverage resulting from the lottery, we used an instrumental variable approach, where the lottery was an instrument for Medicaid coverage. We calculated the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of Medicaid using twostage least squares regression.\nFor insurance, defined as ever having OHP Standard (Medicaid) during the study period, the first-stage equations were modeled as:\nLottery is an indicator variable for selection to receive a Medicaid application (0 = not selected) in each household h and for each individual i. Urban is an indicator variable for either residing in an MSA or in a RUCC-defined urban area (0 = rural) for each individual i in household h. Lottery * Urban is an interaction term of the two (0 = not selected, rural). All two-stage least squares regression equations were adjusted for household size on the lottery list, the month of selection, and an interaction of the two, since selection was random but all members of the associated household were invited to apply for Medicaid (X). Standard errors were clustered by household (h) to address intrahousehold correlation. The error term is signed as \u00b5.\nThe second stage equations were modeled as follows:\nInsurance, defined above, represents the implied effect of Medicaid coverage attributable to the lottery. The p value of the interaction term between insurance and urban indicates any statistical difference in LATE between the two. X and urban are defined in the first-stage equations above and \u03b5 is the error term. Consistent with our previous work, we used linear regression even with binary outcomes. Our analytic approach has been extensively described elsewhere (Finkelstein et al., 2011) and mirrors prior work. All analyses were weighted to account for the sampling, intensive follow-up, and fielding design. Survey responders were three percentage points more likely to be female and on average 2 years older than nonrespondents. Those not selected for the lottery were equally likely to respond to the survey as those selected (all p values were at least .28). For all of our statistical modeling, we used STATA 12.0."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative Data Analysis", "text": "The qualitative data were transcribed and entered into ATLAS.ti, a qualitative analytical software tool. Interviewers coded transcripts using a dictionary that had been used for 584 other qualitative interviews collected as part of the larger qualitative arm of the Oregon Health Study. Each interview transcript was individually coded by a research assistant, then those codes were reviewed by a different research assistant; any discrepancies between the research assistants were adjudicated by a trained qualitative analyst. Interviews were analyzed using framework analysis (Bryman & Burgess, 2002) , which lends itself well to applied policy research, and interpreted to provide context for the quantitative findings. Table 1 highlights the demographic characteristics of the study universe (lottery list) and study participants (survey returners) with any statistical differences between rural and urban populations. We present control means only because some of the reported characteristics could be modifiable by insurance. Individuals living in rural areas were similar to those living in urban areas on many characteristics. However, on average, the rural population was slightly older, more likely to be English-speaking and nonHispanic White, had lower educational attainment and had higher prestudy diagnoses of high blood pressure and emphysema. Table 2 shows available comparable outcomes from the baseline survey, prior to individuals being informed of their lottery selection status. There were some observable urban/rural differences in our baseline survey, even when adjusting for demographic factors. However, the disparities were not consistently better for those in urban areas. Individuals in urban areas were 8 percentage points less likely to report having a usual source of health care (p < .001) and 11 percentage points less likely to have a clinicbased usual source of care (p < .001). Similarly, urban survey responders were 4 percentage points less likely to have had any primary care visits in the prior 12 months compared to rural (p < .001). Urbanites were slightly healthier on average than the rural cohort, which was reflected in their overall assessment of health being good, very good, or excellent (p < .05) and fewer days of poor physical health (p < .001) and overall impairment (p < .05). The lottery was associated with an average \"first-stage\" 29 percentage point increase in Medicaid in the treatment group. While the lottery was random, applying and meeting eligibility criteria were not. We did not observe meaningful differences in \"take-up\" between urban and rural selected households; the lottery was associated with a 29% increase in Medicaid among MSA urban participants and a 30% increase among rural (see Table A2 )."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Survey Results", "text": "Across the board, there were no statistically significant differences in the Medicaid treatment effect between urban and rural populations (see Table 3 ). A few measures neared statistical significance, such as physical activity level (p < .10) and health improvement or stability (p < .10), which may be indicative of the underlying health advantage in urban areas observed in the baseline survey. The lack of statistical differences in the LATE of Medicaid between urban and rural study participants held true using the RUCC specifications of rurality, where we examine stricter definitions of geographic isolation (see Table A3 ) and when applying logistic regression as the functional form for the statistical models (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Rural Qualitative Interview Results: Rural Health Challenges", "text": "Distance as an Access Barrier. Despite improvements in access for rural insured respondents, our qualitative interviews suggest that proximity to care is a notable access barrier for both Medicaid-insured and Medicaid-uninsured respondents; 77% of qualitative interviewees (n = 86) reported living far from necessary care. Though There are problems where people can't get in [to the hospital]. So they go home with a broken finger or a broken toe or possibly even a leg and sit it out because they don't know anybody that has a car or they can't get anybody that's got a car. (Interview 11) For many of the participants without a car in rural communities, public transportation was nonexistent; in the few areas it was available, there were barriers to accessing and using it. Examples cited included long wait times between bus or van arrivals and difficulty waiting or standing at a bus stop for an extended period of time.\nAccess to Specialists. For OHP-insured participants, nearly half noted that access to specialty care was particularly challenging in rural areas. Even if respondents in a rural location had access to a hospital and/or options for primary care, they still faced a notable dearth of specialists and specialty care. For some, this meant significant, regular travel for continued care: Access to the Safety Net for the Uninsured. Uninsured participants described facing a different set of challenges in relation to receiving care-a lack of community health centers and sliding scale clinics in their area. Uninsured participants expressed a desire to seek low-cost care for a variety of medical issues; however, about 15% reported these types of care facilities were few and far between:\n[redacted city] has a program (84 miles one way), it's like a community program, a conglomerate and they have doctors that volunteer their time to see patients that don't have health insurance. They have a whole community type system, but they don't here Quality of Available Care. The qualitative interviews suggested that living in a rural area might affect how individuals perceive the quality of care they received. About 15% of both insured and uninsured qualitative respondents professed some lack of confidence in the quality of local care providers and hospitals in rural areas.\nThese doctors here freak me out, I don't know, but they do . . . I don't trust the physicians here. (Interview 55) For many participants, this mistrust contributed to the distance they traveled for care; though there might be a closer facility, the perceived poor reputation of providers and facilities led some respondents to seek care elsewhere. This perception was often a result of living in a small, close-knit community, having a poor personal experience, knowing someone who received subpar care, or having friends who worked at a particular facility such that the awareness of low-quality care at a certain facility was considered common knowledge:\n[ Rural Culture. Analysis of the interview narratives underscored a notable level of stoicism in rural respondents that may influence their use of health care and their health. This stoicism affected the way respondents sought care and, in many cases, avoided care. There were several accounts of respondents struggling with long-standing symptoms from unresolved injuries and the inevitable impacts of living life without health care; however, the general attitude among these respondents was to accept the outcomes and attempt to move on with their lives. The presence of stoicism was noted in almost one fifth (17%) of the rural interviews:\nI've pretty much learned to live with it. The toughest part was when the 2-3 vertebras up from my hip were going. It was pinching that sciatic nerve, which is kind of intense, and after that it sometimes hurts a lot and sometimes it hurts just a little and you just learn to live with it. (Interview 24) I'm a cowboy, I suck it up, you know. I don't whine too much. (Interview 56)"}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "We need to exercise caution when generalizing these results to the Affordable Care Act expansions. While our study population is similar to those gaining eligibility to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act expansions are much broader in scope and our study measures a limited expansion, which would be less likely to strain the delivery system. Furthermore, we can only generalize our findings to individuals who are likely to take up coverage since our average treatment effects are based on those who enrolled in Medicaid. However, low-income adults are offered an affordability exemption to the individual mandate, which means Medicaid take-up may still be perceived as voluntary. The smaller sample size of rural survey respondents may contribute to less sensitivity in detecting heterogeneous treatment effects; particularly using the more restrictive definitions of rurality. There was a notably higher percentage of Whites in the sample compared with the national average, which reflects the demographics of Oregon and many rural areas in general (Housing Assistance Council, 2012). Last, our survey measures the short-term impacts of gaining insurance; long-term impacts may differ. The qualitative interviews provide rich context for the survey results but suffer from the limitations of qualitative research in general, where respondents are not asked standardized questions and are not limited to standardized answers. The interview methods and the small sample size limits generalizability. Relatedly, while we noted the dominant themes from the 86 interviews as a whole, the themes were not present or proportional in every region we captured. To highlight this point, we created a \"truth table\" (Table A4 ) that shows the frequency of our highlighted themes as they were distributed regionally."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Given the many challenges of rural health care-distance, lack of access to specialists, and other factors-our experimental data suggest that Medicaid coverage resulted in considerable benefits for those living in rural Oregon, indistinguishable from those in urban areas. Despite concerns about inadequate provider networks or transportation issues, gaining coverage significantly increased the likelihood that rural individuals who reported health care needs felt those needs were addressed. Comparing urban and rural study participants, we found similar improvements in access to primary care, use of preventive screenings, and continuity of care. Rural participants also equally benefitted from the financial protections afforded by coverage. Whether it was because of increased financial security or actual health improvements, rural individuals who gained coverage reported better overall health and happiness.\nHowever, remaining barriers to optimal care in rural areas were evident in our qualitative interviews. When respondents described how they interacted with the health care system, living in a rural community meant traveling long distances to get necessary care, and bearing the burden of the financial hardship associated with the trip. This access barrier was especially pronounced when it came to seeking specialty care. Some rural respondents also had concerns about the quality of their care that is a result of being part of a small, close-knit community in which stories of poor care travel fast, as well as a sense that \"good\" doctors do not practice in rural communities. Of note, many rural participants expressed stoicism when it came to their circumstances and health; this culturally distinctive phenomenon (Beard, Tomaska, Earnest, Summerhayes, & Morgan, 2009) should be factored in when understanding how insurance expansion will affect the health of rural communities.\nPlacing the qualitative interviews in the context of the survey results suggests that gaining insurance reduced a first-order barrier to accessing quality health services. Once insured, individuals in rural areas still needed to navigate second-order access barriers such as transportation and availability of specialty providers (DeVoe, Graham, Angier, Baez, & Krois, 2008) . Second-order barriers, such as Medicaid-associated stigma or reservations about the quality of safety-net care, have been noted in newly insured urban populations as well (Allen, Wright, & Baicker, 2014; Allen, Wright, Harding, & Broffman, 2014) . Despite some concern among rural interviewees about the quality of available providers, survey respondents showed strong overall satisfaction with their care.\nWe conclude that Medicaid provides rural populations with benefits above and beyond what is currently being provided to uninsured adults through the safety net. As one person said: \"I'm truly thankful and grateful that I do have OHP [Medicaid] because I've needed to see the doctor from time to time and without it, I wouldn't be able to.\" Additionally, we find that the impacts of Medicaid coverage are not \"washed out\" by access barriers or other unique challenges of rural health care; in fact, the effects of coverage are of similar magnitude to those enjoyed by the urban respondents in the OHIE. Taken together, these results suggest that rural areas should expect comparable benefits from Medicaid expansion to those in more urban settings: improvements in access to health care services, use of preventive care, financial protection, and subjective well-being, balanced against the costs of providing the coverage and its associated increase in utilization of services.\ninsightful feedback on earlier drafts of the article.
