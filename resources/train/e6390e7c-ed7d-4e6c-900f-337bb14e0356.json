This project uses a suite of numerical models to examine the combined effects of projected future climate change on flooding in the Skagit floodplain and estuary. Statistically and dynamically downscaled global climate model scenarios from the ECHAM-5 GCM were used as the climate forcings. Unregulated daily river flows were simulated using the VIC hydrology model, and regulated river flows were simulated using the SkagitSim reservoir operations model. Daily tidal anomalies (TA) were calculated using a regression approach based on ENSO and atmospheric pressure forcing simulated by the WRF regional climate model. A 2-D hydrodynamic model was used to estimate water surface elevations in the Skagit floodplain using resampled hourly hydrographs keyed to regulated daily flood flows produced by the reservoir simulation model, and tide predictions adjusted for SLR and TA. Combining peak annual TA with projected sea level rise, the historical (1970-1999) 100-yr peak high water level is exceeded essentially every year by the 2050s. The combination of projected sea level rise and larger floods by the 2080s yields both increased flood inundation area (+ 74%), and increased average water depth (+ 25 cm) in the Skagit floodplain during a 100-year flood. Adding sea level rise to the historical FEMA 100-year flood resulted in a 35% increase in inundation area by the 2040's, compared to a 57% increase when both SLR and projected changes in river flow were combined."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is a strong scientific consensus that human behavior is altering greenhouse gas concentrations and the global climate system, and projected changes in climate are expected to substantially impact human and natural systems in the twentyfirst century (IPCC 2007) .

Natural climate variability also strongly influences PNW climate. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Mantua et al., 1997) and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are two climate phenomena that exert strong controls on seasonal air temperature and precipitation (Mote 2003 , flood risk (Hamlet and Lettenmaier 2007) , and sea level in the PNW.\nWater levels in estuaries and floodplains can be particularly sensitive to changing climate. These areas are impacted from the marine side by tidal anomalies (TA) (storm surge) and SLR, and from the freshwater side by seasonal changes in river flow and hydrologic extremes. Understanding these changes is a crucial step in developing proactive strategies for the management of both the natural and human systems in the floodplain and near-coastal areas.

In this study the time series behavior of individual storms, simulated by a regional climate model (RCM), is kept intact within the TA and hydrology models. In this way, coincident TA and riverine flooding can be modeled as products of each individual storm, which facilitates a realistic pairing of SLR, tidal cycle, TA, and river flooding events in the projection of impacts to estuarine flooding.\nThe research described here has important practical implications for coastal and riverine floodplain management. Nearly all present-day floodplain management strategies and policies rely entirely on the historical records of TA and river flow, which is a questionable practice in a non-stationary climate (Milly et al. 2008 ).

The assigned hydrograph is then scaled to match the four-day rising limb flood volume of the modeled daily flood. This method was chosen because it baseline sea levels, to which the hourly tidal cycle and simulated daily TA were added for each storm event.\nIt is important to note that these SLR scenarios are only intended to represent plausible values based on current projections of global SLR, and should not be confused with \"predictions\" of future conditions on specific dates, which for the reasons discussed above remain very uncertain. Based on the rapidly evolving scientific understanding of global ice dynamics, steadily improving measurements of local-scale vertical land motion, and the resulting relative SLR, future projections of SLR will undoubtedly continue to evolve, and could be substantially higher or lower than the values we have used here.\nThe NRC report (2012) also provided local estimates of SLR specifically for Seattle (in Table 5 .3), however we were reluctant to use these numbers because they included positive vertical uplift estimates (i.e. reduced relative SLR numbers) for all areas north of Cape Mendocino, when in fact there are large differences between local sites in Puget Sound and on the Pacific Coast.

In testing the approach on observed Skagit River floods, a reasonably accurate fit between observed and disaggregated hydrographs was achieved ( Figure 7A ). Regulated daily flows at Mount Vernon simulated by the SkagitSim reservoir model were similarly disaggregated to hourly hydrographs for all peak flow events that exceeded a 1275 cms threshold (roughly equivalent to the mean annual flood). To facilitate a more direct comparison between the floodplain impacts associated with the FEMA 100-yr flood (FEMA Q 100 ) and future projections of Q 100 using different downscaling methods, the FEMA Q 100 hourly hydrograph was simply scaled to match the fractional change in the Q 100 values for each future time period ( Figure 7B ) (Tohver et al. 2014 ).

Three observations are immediately apparent from this figure, 1) there are only minor variations between the three ECHAM5-WRF model runs indicating no systemic shift in TA due to climate change, 2) there is a small positive bias in the ECHAM5-WRF-1980s runs for the largest events relative to the ReAnal-WRF-1980s run, indicating that the nested ECHAM5-WRF model may produce somewhat more intense storms than have historically been seen, and 3) there is a relatively narrow range of tidal anomalies between the 1-yr and 100-yr events (about 45.7 cm). The PNW's lack of large tidal anomalies combined with little change in the TA probability distribution supports the argument that SLR, rather than storm surge, will more significantly alter the future probability distributions of water levels in Puget Sound (Tebaldi et al. 2012 ).\nThe relative importance of sea level rise impacts on tidal anomalies are clearly seen in Figure 9B , which adds the CDF of extreme TA to the SLR projection. In this figure, the ~ 1-yr event from the ECHAM5-WRF-2050s simulation exceeds the ~ 100-yr event of the ECHAM5-WRF-1980s simulation, meaning that the current-climate 100-year water level event is projected to be exceeded every year by the 2050s. Similar changes in the probability distributions are found when the hourly tidal signal is included in the analysis. In Puget Sound, the range of the tidal cycle is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the observed storm surge, and adding 60-90 cm of sea level rise to typical high tides (even without storm surge) is likely to dramatically increase extreme high water levels in the Puget Sound lowlands."}, {"section_title": "Coincident Occurrence of Flooding and Storm Surge", "text": "Combining temporally consistent riverine flooding and water levels in Puget Sound provides the ability to assess the likelihood of coincident events as they vary in time. This is especially important when considering the estuary and tidally influenced portions of the river channel. In some Puget Sound rivers, for example, backwater conditions created by TA or extreme tides can affect river flood stage as far as 20 km upstream (see e.g. Figure 11G , below). Figure 10 shows the coincident relationship between regulated peak annual streamflow in each year and the paired tidal anomaly. Although there is a wide range of response shown in the scatter plot, numerous large flood events in the future model runs occurred during periods of depressed sea levels, an association not apparent in the historical run. Attributing a cause to this observation is difficult but may be the result of increased influence of the ENSO phenomenon on flooding in the future simulations (e.g. more large floods in La Nina years which are associated with depressed sea levels) or altered storm dynamics (e.g., more frequent high pressure systems following large low pressure systems).\nA positive trend relating these two variables is found in each model run (i.e. high TA tends to be paired with high flow), but the trend is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. This suggests that the TA during peak flow events is essentially decoupled and primarily reflects a random pairing of events. Although streamflow is systematically higher in the future scenarios, any relationship between the two variables remains weak in all cases. This is an important result, because it demonstrates that base SLR, which will dramatically increase water levels in most if not all events in the future, is likely to be the dominant factor in comparison with tidal anomalies that vary widely from event to event. These results also support the argument that a random pairing of flooding and observed storm surge events in Monte Carlo simulations will successfully capture the joint probability distribution of these events and their uncertainties due to sample size and other factors."}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic Modeling Results", "text": "Two approaches were used to model the physical dynamics of future flooding in order to consider coincident changes in flood volume, tidal cycle, tidal anomaly, and SLR described above.

The other two storms produced lower simulated inundation areas.\nTo eliminate any potential bias in regulated flows from the WRF scenarios and to facilitate a more direct comparison with the FEMA analysis, the second approach to modeling future floods scaled the FEMA Q 100 storm to reflect projected increases in the Q 100 flood for the HD-2040s and HD-2080s runs.

Combining the historical Q 100 flood FEMA hydrograph with projected 2040s SLR (28.1 cm), produced increased inundated area of 35% (from 171 km 2 to 230 km 2 ) (Figure 11 G, Table 4 ). Combined with increases in flooding for the HD-2040s scenarios, inundation increases by 57% to 268 km 2 (Figure 11 B, Table 4 ). Thus inundated area increases by an additional 22% due to an increase in peak flow during the event. As expected, larger peak flows and SLR produce more extensive inundation in the simulations. A summary of peak flow and inundated area is shown in Table 4 . Increases in Q 100 increase inundated area, but SLR alone is also shown to be an important factor. For example, peak flows comparable to the FEMA Q 100 value, such as the largest WRF-2050s event (Figure 11 D) and the SLR sensitivity run (Figure 11 G) , can create substantial increases in inundation area when combined with mid-21st-century SLR projections."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study uses numerical modeling approaches to establish future flood risk in response to projected coincident changes in sea level, tidal anomaly, and regulated peak flows in the Skagit River projected for the 21st century. These changes are shown to dramatically increase extreme water levels and inundated area in the Skagit floodplain during high flow events (Table 4 , Figures 11-12 ). It is important to note that changes happen not only with the extreme 100-year flood events, but also with smaller, more frequent events that regularly impact communities. For example, the HD-2040s 5-year flood is projected to carry 30% more volume than historically (Table 3) , which could substantially increase impacts to communities in the floodplain.\nA dynamic storm surge model based on season, ENSO, and simulated barometric pressure effects shows little systematic effect of climate change on storm surge, and instead the impacts of SLR dominate increases in near-coastal flooding forced from the marine side. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in flooding due to SLR alone will be focused primarily in near-coastal areas, whereas increases in river flooding combined with SLR will affect the entire floodplain in the Skagit lowlands.\nAnalysis using dynamic downscaling demonstrated that peak flow events and tidal anomalies were essentially decoupled in the historical period, and remained so in the future scenarios. Furthermore, the probability distributions of storm surge were not meaningfully altered in comparison with historical observations. These findings supports the conclusion that base SLR will be the dominant effect on increased sea levels during flooding events, rather than storm surge.\nAs we move further into the twenty-first century, global climate change is expected to continue to alter the climate of the PNW. Assumptions of stationarity in flood plain management applications will become increasingly problematic under these conditions, and the results of this study highlight the need to develop forward-looking floodplain management strategies based on modeling rather than historical observations. The new approaches developed in this study are intended to help provide a detailed \"road map\" for future studies addressing the combined effects of future sea level rise, storm surge, and river flooding on extreme high water levels in coastal areas.\nA single large-scale forcing from the ECHAM5 GCM was used in this study. More realizations of PNW climate using regional scale climate models will be needed to better characterize the changing risks in the Puget Sound lowlands and to better understand the effectiveness of RCMs in simulating both local-scale climate and global teleconnections (e.g. ENSO) affecting extremes. Increased sample size is also needed to improve GEV fits and better characterize high-flow extremes."}]
