Both the degree of tax progressivity and the education subsidy are larger than in the current U.S. status quo.\nThis paper is situated at the intersection of two strands of the literature on optimal labor income taxation, discussed in more detail below. 1 Previous work (see Conesa and Krueger (2006) and Conesa et al. (2009) and the references therein) quantitatively characterized the optimal degree of labor income tax progressivity (within a parametric class of tax functions) in Auerbach and Kotliko\u00a4 (1987) style OLG models with idiosyncratic uninsurable wage risk, but took wages over the life cycle as exogenously given. 2 In this paper households partially choose, by deciding on whether to go college, the life cycle wage pro\u2026le they will be subjected to during their working years. The government, taking as given the behavioral and general equilibrium responses to an (unexpected) tax reform along the transition path 3 induced by the reform, determines the policy that maximizes Utilitarian social welfare among those currently alive at the time of the reform. 4 Second, a primarily theoretical literature has characterized the optimal combination of progressive labor income taxes and education subsidies in models that abstract from uninsurable income risk and precautionary asset accumulation (see e.g. Benabou (2002) , Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) and Jacobs and Bovenberg, 2010) . The latter paper, in particular, highlights how an education subsidy can mitigate the distortions of progressive labor income taxes (motivated by redistributive societal concerns) on the household education decision. Our paper contributes to this strand of the literature by quantifying the optimal policy mix between education \u2026nance and progressive income taxation policies.\nThis paper views itself distinctly in the Ramsey tradition in that, in our attempt to characterize optimal taxation in large-scale OLG models with unin-1 See Piketty and Saez (2012) for a comprehensive overview of the theoretical literature. 2 In addition, in contrast to these papers here we also fully take into account the transitional dynamics induced by the hypothetical tax reforms when computing the optimal tax system. 3 Fehr and Kindermann (2012) extend Conesa et al.'s (2009) steady state analysis by computing optimal tax transitions in a model that abstracts from endogenous schooling decisions. 4 The well-being of future generations enters the social welfare function through altruisitc preferences of those currently alive. surable idiosyncratic risk and endogenous education choices, we restrict the choices of the government to simple (and thus easily implementable) tax policies. We fully acknowledge that the paper is therefore subject to much of the critique of this approach by the New Dynamic Public Finance literature 5 (see e.g. , Kocherlakota (2010), Farhi and Werning (2013), Golosov and Tsyvinski (2013) for representative papers, and Bohacek and Kapicka (2008) and Kapicka (2011) for the analysis of models with endogenous human capital accumulation and education subsidies).\nThe paper is organized as follows. After relating our contribution to the literature in the next section, in section 3 we construct a simple, analytically tractable model to argue why progressive income taxes and education subsidies might simultaneously be part of an optimal government \u2026scal policy in the presence of an endogenous education decision. In order to make that argument most clearly, in that section of the paper we abstract from general equilibrium e\u00a4ects of these policies as well as the dynamics induced by asset accumulation and the intergenerational transmission of talent and wealth. These elements are then introduced in the quantitative model in section 4 where we set up the model and de\u2026ne equilibrium for a given \u2026scal policy of the government. Section 5 describes the optimal tax problem of the government, including its objective and the instrument available to the government. After calibrating the economy to U.S. data (including current tax and education policies) in section 6 of the paper, part 7 displays the results and interpretation of the optimal taxation analysis. Section 8 concludes, and the appendices contain the proofs of the propositions from section 3 as well as details of the calibration and the computation of the quantitative version of the model from section 4 of the main paper."}, {"section_title": "Relation to the Literature", "text": "Methodologically, our paper builds on the large literature that uses quantitative OLG models in the spirit of Auerbach and Kotliko\u00a4 (1987) , enriched by uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings risk as in Bewley (1986) , Huggett (1993 Huggett ( , 1997 and Aiyagari (1994) , to study the optimal structure of the tax code in the Ramsey tradition, see Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) .\nThe optimal tax code in life cycle economies with a representative household in each generation was characterized in important papers by Alvarez et al. (1992) , Erosa and Gervais (2002) , Garriga (2003) , Gervais (2009) and Bovenberg and Jacobs (2010) , and in economies with private information in the Mirrleesian (1971) tradition, by Judd and Su (2006) , Fukujima (2010), Bohacek and Kapicka (2008) , Kapicka (2011) , Findeisen and Sachs 6 and Weinzierl (2011).\n7 5 Note however, that we do not rule out lump-sum taxes. Such taxes are not optimal since they contribute to an unfavorable distribution of lifetime utilities in society. 6 The focus of the last three papers on optimal income taxation in the presence of human capital accumulation make them especially relevant for our work, although they abstract from explicit life cycle considerations. 7 There is also large literature on the positive e\u00a4ects of various taxes on allocations and\nOur paper aims at characterizing the optimal progressivity of the income tax code in an economy in which the public provision of redistribution and income insurance through taxation are desirable, but where progressive taxes not only distort consumption-savings and labor-leisure choices, but also household human capital accumulation choices. It is most closely related to the studies by Conesa and Krueger (2006) , Conesa et al. (2009) and Karabarbounis (2011) . Relative to their steady state analysis we provide a full quantitative transition analysis of the optimal tax code in a model with endogenous education choices.\nIn models in which progressive labor income taxes potentially distort education decisions a public policy that subsidizes these choices might be e\u00a4ective in mitigating the distortions from the tax code, as pointed out e\u00a4ectively by Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) . As in their theoretical analysis we therefore study such subsidies explicitly as part of the optimal policy mix in our quantitative investigation. Our focus of the impact of the tax code and education subsidies on human capital accumulation decisions also connects our work to the studies by Heckman et al. (1998 Heckman et al. ( , 1999 Kindermann (2012) , although the characterization of the optimal tax code is not the main objective of these papers.\nIn our attempt to contribute to the literature on (optimal) taxation in life cycle economies with idiosyncratic risk and human capital accumulation we explicitly model household education decisions (and government subsidies thereof) in the presence of borrowing constraints and the intergenerational transmission of human capital as well as wealth. Consequently our works builds upon the huge theoretical and empirical literature investigating these issues, surveyed partially in, e.g. "}, {"section_title": "A Simple Model", "text": "We now present a simple model 9 that allows us to make precise the intuition that with incomplete \u2026nancial markets progressive labor income taxes might be part of optimal \u2026scal policy because it implements a more equitable consumption distribution than the laissez faire competitive equilibrium, but that it distorts both the labor supply and the education decision. The latter distortion can be partially o\u00a4set by an education subsidy which then becomes part of an optimal policy mix as well. Relative to the quantitative model used in the next sections, the model analyzed here abstracts from general equilibrium feedbacks prices in life cycle economies.

To summarize, in light of an ine\u00a2 ciently dispersed consumption distribution in the unregulated equilibrium (relative to the one chosen by the utilitarian social planner) the implementation of a progressive tax system improves on the consumption distribution, but lowers average consumption by creating disincentives to work and go to college.

Introducing a progressive income tax in row 3 leads to an improvement in that distribution, but at the expense of reduced output and a smaller fraction of households attending college.

In our model one of the bene\u2026ts of going to college is to be able to raise children that will (probabilistically) be more able to go to college. 1 8 Gallipoli et al use a time cost instead of a monetary cost re \u2021ecting \"psychic stress\" based on Heckman, Lochner, Todd (2005). Our speci\u2026cation is closer to Caucutt et al. where the costs stand in for hiring a teacher to acquire education. 1 9 With this time cost we also capture utility losses of poorer households who have to work part-time to \u2026nance their college education.\nHouseholds start their economic life at age j a with an initial endowment of \u2026nancial wealth b 0 received as inter-vivos transfer from their parents. 20 Parents make these transfers, assumed to be noncontingent on the child's education decision 21 , at their age j f ; after having observed their child's ability draw e: This transfer is restricted to be nonnegative.

Households can self-insure against this risk by accumulating a risk-free one-period bond that pays a real interest rate of r t : In equilibrium the total net supply of this bond equals the capital stock K t in the economy, plus the stock of outstanding government debt B t .\nFurthermore we severely restrict the use of credit to self-insure against idiosyncratic labor productivity and thus income shocks by imposing a strict credit limit. The only borrowing we permit is to \u2026nance a college education through student loans. Households that borrow to pay for college tuition and consumption while in college face age-dependent borrowing limits of A j;t (whose size depends on the degree to which the government subsidizes education) and also face the constraint that their balance of outstanding student loans cannot increase after they have completed school. This assumption rules out that student loans are used for general consumption smoothing over the life cycle.\nThe constraints A j;t are set such that student loans need to be fully repaid by age j r at which early mortality sets in. This insures that households can never die in debt and we do not need to consider the possibility and consequences of personal bankruptcy. Beyond student loans we rule out borrowing altogether.\n2 0 This is similar to Gallipoli et al. (2008) . We model this as a one time payment only. The transfer payment captures the idea that parents \u2026nance part of the higher education of their children. Our simplifying assumptions of modelling these transfers are a compromise between incorporating directed inter-generational transfers of monetary wealth in the model and computational feasibility.\nIf we were to model \u2021exible inver-vivo transfers at all ages j = j f ; : : : ; j f +jc, we would have to deal with two continuous state variables.

During those years b is a state variable for the childrens' problem. Note that if parental borrowing constraints are not binding one-time transfers are equivalent to a commitment to transfers for many periods (as long as the contingency of parental death is appropriately insured). Thus the issue whether our assumption is quantitatively important depends on the speci\u2026cation of the borrowing constraint, and, given this speci\u2026cation, whether the constraint often binds for households at age j f : 2 1 Note that parents of course understand whether, given b; children will go to college or not, and thus can a\u00a4ect this choice by giving a particular b:\nThis, among other things, implies that households without a college degree can never borrow"}, {"section_title": "Government Policies", "text": "The government needs to \u2026nance an exogenous stream G t of non-education expenditures and an endogenous stream E t of education expenditures.

The parameter to be calibrated determines how tight the borrowing constraint for college is. Note that in contrast rp is not a calibration parameter but an endogenously determined repayment amount that insures that households don't retire with outstanding student loans.\nThe maximum amount of publicly provided student loans for four years is given by $27,000 for dependent undergraduate students and $45,000 for independent undergraduate students (the more relevant number given that our students are independent households). 33 Relative to GDP per capita in 2008 of $48; 000; this given maximum debt constitutes 14% and 23:4% of GDP per capita. Compare that to the 31% of total costs computed above, this indicates that shows independent undergraduate students can borrow at most approximately 75% of the cost of college, and thus we set = 0:75: The following table summarizes the parameters used in our optimal tax computations. Prior to presenting the optimal tax results it is instructive to discuss how households make their key economic decisions for a given policy. Ours is a fairly standard life cycle model with idiosyncratic wage risk, and thus the life cycle pro\u2026les of consumption, asset and labor supply are consistent with those reported in the literature (see e.g. Conesa et al. (2009) , \u2026gure 1). Instead, here we explore how the optimal education decision is made, as a function of the initial characteristics of the household. This focus is further warranted by the observation that the optimal policy will have a strong impact on this decision and will result in a signi\u2026cant change in the share of households obtaining an education in the aggregate, which is in turn important for understanding the optimality of the policy in the \u2026rst place. Recall that households, at the time of the college decision (that is, at age j a ) di\u00a4er according to (e; ; b); that is, their ability to go to college e; their wages outside college (as determined by the idiosyncratic shock ), and their initial asset levels resulting from parental transfers b: In \u2026gure 3 we display the share of households deciding to go to college, under the status quo policy, as a function of e; both for households with low and with high (and thus high income y)\nrealizations. All households with high abilities (e e 8 ) go to college, and non of the households with very low ability (e e 3 ) do. For households in the middle of the ability distribution, their decision depends on the attractiveness of the outside option of working in the labor market: a larger share of households with lower opportunity costs (low and thus y) attends to college. Finally, a share strictly between zero and one, conditional on ; indicates that wealth heterogeneity among the youngest cohort (which in turn stems from wealth and thus transfer heterogeneity of their parents) is an important determinant of the college decision for those in the middle of the ability distribution (e 2 [e 4 ; e 7 ]). This point is further reinforced by \u2026gure 4 which displays the college decision indicator function in dependence of initial assets b; and conditional on the non-college wage realization. A value of 0 on the y-axis stands for not attending college, a value of 1 represents the decision to go to college. Assets on the x-axis are normalized such that a value of b = 1 stands for assets equal to one time average asset holdings of the parental generation at the age intergenerational transfers are given. We display the policy function for those with low ability (e = e 3 ) and those with high ability (e = e 6 ). We make several observations. First, low-ability households never go to college, independent of their other characteristics (the low e policy function is identically equal to zero). For households with su\u00a2 ciently high ability (e > e 3 ) other characteristics matter. As discussed above, a higher non-college wage (high y) reduces the incidence of attending col-lege. Finally and perhaps most interestingly, the e\u00a4ects of initial wealth on the college decision are non-monotone. For households at the low end of the wealth distribution the borrowing constraint is important. Although the government subsidies college (in the status quo it covers a 38:8% share of the costs) and although households can borrow 75% of the remaining resource costs, at zero or close to zero wealth household might still not be able to a\u00a4ord college. That is, either it is impossible for these households to maintain positive consumption even by working full time while attending college, or the resulting low level of consumption and/or leisure make such a choice suboptimal. As parental transfers increase the borrowing constraint is relaxed and able households decide to go to college. Finally, su\u00a2 ciently wealthy households that expect to derive a signi\u2026cant share of their lifetime income through capital income \u2026nd it suboptimal to invest in college and bear the time and resource cost in exchange for larger labor earnings after college. Note, however, that although this last result follows from the logic of our model, it is not important quantitatively since the stationary asset transfer distribution puts essentially no mass on initial assets b 5:"}, {"section_title": "The Optimal Policy", "text": "Starting from the status quo, the optimal policy as de\u2026ned above is characterized by a signi\u2026cantly more progressive tax system with a marginal tax rate of l = 24:1% and a deduction of d = 32% of average household income. The associated optimal education policy subsidies the resource cost of going to college at a rate of = 70%; close to doubling the subsidy, relative to the status quo policy. The resulting welfare gain from the policy reform and its implied economic transition is equivalent to a uniform increase in consumption (over time, states of the world and households) of approximately 1:2%: In the next two subsections we, in turn, characterize the long run and then transitional consequences of this fundamental tax reform, before turning to an interpretation of the welfare gains implied by it in section 7.2.3."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Initial and Final Steady States", "text": "In table 6 we summarize the impact of the policy reform on macroeconomic aggregates in the long run, by comparing stationary equilibria under the status quo and the dynamically optimal policy. All variables are denoted in per capita terms. From the table we observe that the increase in the progressivity of the tax code and simultaneous rise in education subsidy triggers a signi\u2026cant decline in hours worked, by 1:3%: Furthermore, the expansion of government debt along the transition (see next subsection) crowds out physical capital accumulation, so that the steady state capital stock is now 1% lower than in the status quo. The capital-labor ratio falls by 3:3%, and wages per e\u00a2 ciency units decline by 1:1%, whereas the return on assets (and thus the interest rate on government debt) rises by 20 basis points.\nHowever, the policy does not lead to a substantial decline in per capita output, as one might suspect from the decline in capital and hours worked; in fact GDP per capita increases by 1:3%: Key to this \u2026nding is the increase in the share of households attending college and thus the shares of workers with a college degree, which is up by 14 percentage points. The doubling of the college subsidy rate more than o\u00a4sets the reduced incentives to acquire human capital due to a more progressive tax system. The improved skill distribution in the population in turn results in a larger e\u00a4ective labor supply in the new steady state, despite the fact that average hours are signi\u2026cantly down. Aggregate consumption in turn rises by 1:9% in the long run: On the distributional side, consumption, leisure and wealth inequality fall on account of a more redistributive labor income tax schedule, most signi\u2026cantly so for consumption. Overall, the signi\u2026cant reduction in hours worked and increase in aggregate consumption as well as a more equal distribution of resources indicates substantial welfare gains from this policy reform."}, {"section_title": "Transitional Dynamics", "text": "However, this discussion ignores the fact that it takes time (and resources) to build up a more skilled workforce, suggesting that an explicit consideration of the transition path is important. At any point in time, the youngest cohort constitutes just a small share of the overall workforce, so even if the education decision of this cohort is changed drastically on impact in favor of more college education, it takes years, if no decades, until the skill composition of the entire workforce changes signi\u2026cantly (as older, less skilled cohorts retire and younger, more skilled cohorts take over). In \u2026gure 5 we plot the evolution of the key macroeconomic variables along the policy-induced transition path. The lower right panel which displays both the share of the youngest cohort going to college as well as the overall fraction of the population highlights the observation described above. Whereas the share of the youngest cohort going to college moves strongly on policy impact, it takes approximately 60 years until the overall skill distribution have reached a level close to its new steady state value. It is this dynamics that a restriction to a steady state policy analysis would miss completely. That this omission has potentially profound consequences can be seen from the upper right and the lower left panel of \u2026gure 5 which show the evolution of GDP per capita (together with that of capital and e\u00a4ective labor supply), and that of consumption (together with average hours worked). The graphs show that while hours worked respond signi\u2026cantly on impact and the remain fairly \u2021at, e\u00a4ective labor supply falls early on and then recovers as the skill composition of the population changes. Consequently the drop in GDP and consumption per capita is very substantial early in the transition, prior to education-driven transitional growth setting in.\nThe dynamics of government debt (which is mechanically determined, through the sequence of government budget constraints, given its initial level and the tax and education policies) mirrors that of GDP per capita, as the upper left panel of \u2026gure 5 displays. During the transitional years of low economic activity (due to a falling capital stock and lower hours worked) the government accumulates debt and the debt to GDP ratio rises from its 60% level in the initial steady state. As the economy recovers the debt-to-GDP ratio then stabilizes at its higher steady state level of about 77%:\nFinally, both the public debt-induced capital crowding-out e\u00a4ect and the early collapse and subsequent recovery of e\u00a4ective labor supply induces substantial swings of the capital-labor ratio and associated movements of wages and interest rates. As \u2026gure 6 shows, after the initial collapse of hours and implied increase of this ratio the recovery of e\u00a4ective labor supply and continued decline in the capital stock leads to a lower capital-labor ratio and wages as well as higher interest rates in the long run, whereas households living through the transition enjoy higher wages and lower returns for most of their lifetime. To conclude this section, the analysis of the transition path induced by the optimal policy indicates that a steady state analysis of welfare might potentially be problematic since it ignores the transitional costs of temporarily lower output and consumption induced by a progressive tax reform that slows down labor supply and capital accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Interpreting the Optimal Policy and Welfare Results", "text": "Despite the previous discussion, the tax reform does increase social welfare signi\u2026cantly (in the order of 1:2% of consumption) even when the transitional cost of the policy is fully taken into account. An important element of these gains stems from a more equal distribution of consumption (and also leisure). The substantial increase in labor income tax progressivity induces a gradual reduction, over time, in earnings, consumption and wealth inequality, in the order of about 2-3 points for the Gini coe\u00a2 cient, depending on the variable. The cross-sectional dispersion of leisure, on the other hand, changes relatively little, with a Gini coe\u00a2 cient that falls by less than one percentage point. Thus the aggregate welfare gains documented above stem primarily from two sources, a decline in aggregate hours worked and resulting increase in leisure for the typical household, and from a more equal consumption and leisure distribution. They are signi\u2026cantly mitigated by a substantial decline in aggregate output and thus consumption that the policy brings about in the short run, due to lower incentives to work and the crowding out of physical capital by government debt.\nFinally note that, relative to the status quo, the optimal policy mix induces a substantial increase in college attendance (and thus, over time, a rising share of high-skilled households) despite the fact that the incentives from the labor income tax side for acquiring a college degree have substantially weakened. The optimal choice of = 0:7 is crucial for this \u2026nding. More generally, this result points to the important interaction of progressive taxes and education subsidies that Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) stressed theoretically. In fact, had remained constant at its status quo value of 0.388, a change in the progressivity of the labor income tax alone (to d = 32%) would have led to a decline in the share of the young cohort going to college by 3% in the short run and 6% in the long run, an optimal of only d = 30% and welfare gains of only 0:3% of consumption: In this sense an important complementarity exists between progressive taxation and education subsidy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we characterized the optimal mix of progressive income taxes and education subsidies and argued that a substantially progressive labor income tax and a positive education subsidy constitute part of the optimal \u2026scal constitution once household college attendance decisions are endogenous. In our thought experiment we took the tax on capital income as exogenously given. Ongoing and future work will determine whether these conclusions remain robust once the government chooses not only the progressivity of the labor income tax, but also the optimal mix between capital and labor income taxes.\nFurthermore, we made several important auxiliary assumptions that deserve further scrutiny. On the calibration side, the assumption of a perfect substitutability between skilled and unskilled labor implies that an expansion of the stock of college-educated workers has no impact on their relative productivity and thus wages. As such, this parametric assumption gives education subsidies a potentially (too) important role in raising aggregate labor productivity and thus societal welfare.\nFinally we determined the optimal tax policy as one which maximizes utilitarian social welfare among households currently alive. 34 We also documented that the optimal tax reform is not uniformly preferred to the status quo, implying that other social welfare functions imply alternative tax policies as optimal. We leave for future work a detailed analysis which elements of our optimal \u2026scal constitution remains intact if these alternative societal rankings of individual household preferences are considered.\nA Theoretical Appendix A.1 Proof of Proposition 6 Proof. Recall that e CE ( = = 0) = e SP and thus aggregate output net of education costs coincide in the unregulated equilibrium and the solution to the social planner problem. Consequently aggregate consumption is identical as well: In the social optimum the utilitarian social planner equalizes lifetime utility across all household types (this follows directly from the \u2026rst order conditions of the planning problem) and therefore \nfor all e; and thus especially for e = e SP : In the competitive equilibrium, at the education threshold (and only there) we have \nthat is, the consumption premium of the marginal type going to college is the same in the unregulated equilibrium and in the social planner problem.
