[{"section_title": "Chapter 1 | Introduction Chapter and Chapter 2", "text": "In the United States, more than 4 billion dollars is provided annually in the form of assistantships, fellowships, or tuition waivers to support science and engineering (S&E) doctoral students. Such grant-based financial aid (GFA) may increase the number of S&E doctorates, but it may also attract those who are likely to drop out of their programs or those who may take more time to complete their programs. Does increased financial aid attract less desirable graduate students or more qualified students who may complete their programs in a timely manner? Does the current GFA policy efficiently use financial resources to produce a given number of S&E PhDs? Is there an alternative GFA policy that is more cost-efficient than the current policy? This dissertation attempts to answer these questions. The cost-efficiency of GFA policies for S&E doctoral programs is an urgent policy issue in the United States (US) in several aspects. Firstly, the percentage of S&E doctoral students who receive GFA as their primary financial source is estimated to be as great as 70 percent. Since grant-type support does not require repayment, the investment in doctoral students is not recoverable once the allocation of financial support has been made. Secondly, the budget for higher education in S&E is getting tighter. Since 20012, national investment in the S&E higher-education sector has experienced zero or negative growth rates [1]. This does not mean, however, that S&E PhDs are becoming less important to society. The US economy is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge-based industries, while global competition in these science and technology industries has become fiercer over time [1,2]. Under these circumstances, it is in policy-makers' best interests to utilize their limited resources as cost-efficiently as possible. To investigate the cost-efficiency of the current GFA policy in producing S&E doctorates, I construct a dynamic structural model of S&E college graduates who can be regarded as potential entrants to S&E doctoral programs. In the model, I assume that an individual makes decisions over work and graduate education each year after graduating from college. Such decisions are assumed to be made even after the student enrolls in a graduate program. Four different categories of graduate programs exist, and one of them is doctoral programs in S&E. Each category of program has its own rules of admission, GFA structures, and degrees requirements. When an individual enrolls in a program, she is uncertain about if and when she can complete the program. Whether a graduate student completes her enrolled program is realized only at the end of the enrollment period. If she fails to earn the degree in a given year she can always continue to study from the next period on. I model the labor market and graduate-school environments. Different individuals face different wage rates and different job opportunities. They also have different chances of receiving admission to given graduate programs and different chances of completing those graduate programs to which they are admitted. Two items deserve special attention. First, I assume that S&E doctorates are granted with some probability to those whose accumulated enrollments total at least our years, though this depends on individual characteristics. Second, a GFA policy consists of two components, an annual amount and the probability of receiving that amount. The annual amount of GFA is the same among aid-recipients, but the probability of receiving it depends on individual characteristics. Cognitive ability and motivation level are the most important factors in individuals' self-selection into different career paths. Cognitive ability is assumed to directly influence outcomes such as wage rates, job offers, admission offers, GFA offers, and program completion. Motivation, on the other hand, indirectly influences outcomes in the labor market and in graduate programs. Strongly motivated individuals are defined to be those who reap non-pecuniary benefits from schooling. For instance, strongly motivated individuals tend to complete S&E doctoral programs because such individuals tend to continue to enroll in the programs, accumulate human capital, and increase their chances of completion. Whether GFA is effective in increasing the production of S&E doctorates is not obvious from the quantitative model ex-ante before estimation. Suppose that those with high cognitive ability tend to receive offers of admission, GFA, and S&E doctoral degrees. Even in this scenario, it is unclear whether high-ability individuals tend to be attracted to S&E doctoral programs. This is because for high-ability individuals, the payoff of enrolling in S&E doctoral programs even with GFA may be much lower than the payoffs of the alternative options that are available to them. Similarly, GFA may fail to attract strongly motivated individuals, because the non-pecuniary benefits from schooling are also possible to attain by enrolling in other graduate programs, such as professional programs. If the market returns to professional degrees sufficiently outdo the market returns to S&E doctorates, professional programs will be preferred to S&E doctoral programs. In order to understand what types of individuals that GFA would attracts, I estimate a dynamic model. The estimation utilizes Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study for 1993-2003, which was commissioned by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This data set targets students graduating from US colleges and universities in the academic year 1992-1993, most of whom are US citizens (95.8 percent). 1 My sample is comprised of those with majors in the natural sciences (excluding the social sciences) and engineering. B&B 93-03 provides information about individuals' employment and enrollment decisions as well as their related outcomes, including information on GFAreceipt experiences. Detailed information on academic scores and family background is also available, allowing researchers to take into account the heterogeneity underlying individuals' self-selection into work and schooling. The identification comes from parameterization rather than from random policy changes. The dynamic model is estimated via a two-step estimation procedure. The first step considers 42 parameters that can be inferred directly from the data, since both the dependent and independent variables are observed. The second step considers 31 parameters that can only be inferable or better inferable by solving the individuals' dynamic programs by utilizing the method of simulated moments [8,9]. It is noteworthy that motivation level is assumed to be private information and estimated in the spirit of finite mixture models [10,11]. Cognitive ability, on the other hand, is assumed to be observable to all, including researchers, and is approximated by using S&E-related undergraduate GPAs (S&E-specific ability), as well as an index variable derived from SAT scores and undergraduate overall GPAs (general ability). The estimated model turns out to match data moments reasonably well. Moreover, individuals' self-selection into different career paths turns out to be largely dependent on general ability and motivation compared to other individual traits including S&E-specific ability. In particular, general ability increases labor-market opportunities and increases wage rates. Those with high general ability tend to be admitted to S&E doctoral programs and receive GFA while enrolled in the programs. Yet the probability of completing S&E doctoral programs, conditional on at least four years of enrollment in the programs, is negatively correlated with general ability. The estimated model predicts that drop-outs of S&E doctoral programs have, on average, higher general ability than those granted PhDs for two reasons. First, individuals with high general ability are subject to more promising payoffs in the labor market. That is, such individuals incur higher opportunity costs by continuously enrolling in S&E doctoral programs, making them more likely to drop out. Second, since general ability is negatively correlated with the conditional probability of completing S&E doctoral programs, those with high levels of general ability may take more years to complete the programs or fail. Note that these predictions imply that the current GFA policy may not be costefficient since GFA is more likely to be offered to those with high general ability who have lower probabilities of completing S&E doctoral programs. By lowering the GFA-receipt probability for such individuals, it may be possible to reduce the total GFA amount while producing the same number of S&E doctorates. By experimenting with hypothetical GFA policies, I find that it is possible to spend 25 percent less while producing the same number of S&E doctorates. The alternative policy that I propose lowers the probability of GFA-receipt for those who would drop out under the current GFA policy without changing (ex-post) the annual amount of GFA. Note that this alternative policy also lowers the probability of GFA-receipt for those who would become S&E PhDs (potential PhDs), but the probability reduction is not critical, meaning that the incentives for potential PhDs to enter and complete their programs remain. As far as I know, this is the first paper that investigates GFA policies in S&E doctoral programs. Economics literature rarely focuses on the production of S&E doctorates. The exception to this is [12], which investigates the stipends given to S&E graduate students in the US. 2 Many economists pay attention to firms' R&D activity [14][15][16]; however, that a specially trained human workforce is required for such R&D activity and that it is challenging for policy-makers to guarantee a sufficient supply of researchers are facts that often ignored in the literature. In the education literature, graduate-school attrition has long been a concern [17][18][19]. However, quantitative research is rare, and those quantitative studies that do exist focus on exclusively either baccalaureates' decision to enter graduate school [20,21] or pre-enrolled graduate students' completion performances [19]. The types of individuals financial aid attracts to graduate programs is not discussed in this literature."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4", "text": "While Chapters 2 and 3 consider a partial equilibrium model and focus on the supply of S&E doctorates, Chapter 4 seeks to understand the supply and demand of researchers in a general equilibrium model. Economists have paid little attention to the fact that particular training or education in science and engineering is required for individuals to become R&D researchers. 3 What if individual-side market friction limits the supply of R&D researchers? How would such market friction ultimately influence national R&D activity? What happens to the characteristics of R&D researchers and R&D firms if a policy relaxing the market friction is implemented? Chapter 4 aims to answer these questions. To this end, I construct and analyze a static general equilibrium model of heterogeneous firms and individuals. Firms engage in either production or R&D, where the former uses labor services and the latter uses research services. Individuals differing in good endowment and talent decide whether to supply labor services or research services. To produce research services, individuals need to attain education, and in doing so, they incur education costs. Firms of different productivity levels decide over production and R&D investment. The more productive the firms are, the higher their profits are from both producing and performing R&D. It thus follows that the most productive firms engage in production with R&D, the second-most productive firms engage in production without R&D, and the least productive firms remain inactive. The only market friction in the economy is credit-constraints: individuals cannot borrow and use their endowed consumption good to finance education. Market friction prevents poor but talented individuals from becoming researchers, resulting in the misallocation of talent in the economy. Under these circumstances, I investigate how tuition subsidies influence the price of research services and labor services, as well as the composition of firms and individuals engaging in R&D. I first show that tuition subsidies lower the costs of research services compared to the costs of labor services. The lowered costs of research services encourage firms to perform R&D, so that some firms that would otherwise produce without R&D now begin to perform R&D. The increased costs of labor services make production more expensive, so that some firms that would otherwise produce without R&D become active. How do the tuition subsidies change the composition of researchers? In particular, do the subsidies attract less-talented or more-talented individuals to pursue education? This is an important question because some criticize financial-aid policies for encouraging lower-ability or less-motivated individuals to pursue education. 4 I find that subsidies exert two offsetting effects. First, they lower education costs so that less-talented individuals also enroll in school (the partial-equilibrium effect). Second, subsidies lower the relative price of research services to the price of labor services, making educational attainment less attractive (the general-equilibrium effect). If the general-equilibrium effect is sufficiently greater than the partial-equilibrium effect, less-talented individuals will not pursue education even though the effective education costs decrease. I find that with moderate levels of credit-constraints, or sufficiently education subsidies, only the most talented individuals pursue education."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2 |", "text": "On the cost-efficiency of financial aid in producing science and engineering doctorates: Part I"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Statistical inference", "text": "This section provides background information on grant-based financial aid (GFA) in S&E doctoral programs in the US. In this dissertation, S&E refers to natural sciences and engineering. Many figures presented in this section are based on the National Science Foundation (NSF) publications. In most of NSF publications, \"science and engineering\" is defined as S&E plus social sciences. To avoid confusion, let SS&E denote this extended definition of science and engineering. Table 2.1 shows the mechanisms and sources of graduate financial aid. I consider four mechanisms: grants, loans, work-study, and miscellaneous. Miscellaneous mechanisms include veterans' benefits and military tuition aid, as well as state vocational rehabilitation and job-training grants. Assistantships, such as teaching assistantships or research assistantships, also count as miscellaneous. On the other hand, graduate financial aid can be provided by the federal government, academic institutions, state governments, or miscellaneous sources. The miscellaneous sources include grants from employers. Note that Table 2.1 takes into account the direct sourcing of financial aid. For instance, some grants a graduate student receives from her academic institution may originally come from the federal government. According to Table 2.1, these grants would be categorized as \"grant\" sourced by \"institutions.\" Next, we illustrate how financial-aid allocations were different across S&E master's programs (SEM), S&E doctoral programs (SED), non-S&E graduate programs (NSE), and professional programs (PRO) in the 2003-2004 academic year. I only consider graduate students who were US citizens and who were enrolled in US institutions. 1 For each type of aid, Table 2.2 reports the chance of receiving the aid, while Table 2.3 reports the average amount of the aid. From Table 2.2, we know that SED graduate students are more likely to receive institutional aid than other program enrollees. More than 80 percent of SED graduate students receive institutional aid, with the majority of the aid-recipients receiving more than $2,000 each. For SED graduate students, the average amount of institutional aid is $21,792. More than 80 percent of PRO graduate students receive federally funded aid, while only about 23-40 percent receive such aid in other programs. State governments rarely offer financial support to graduate students. Across all program enrollees, the chance of receiving aid from state governments is fewer than 9 percent. Finally, compared to SED graduate students (19.21 percent), non-SED graduate students (32-40 percent) are more likely to receive aid from sources other than institutions, though the average amount of aid from other sources is less than the average aid from institutions or the average aid from the federal government. Table 2.3 shows how the aid of a given mechanism is distributed. First, more than 70 percent SED graduate students receive grants, and the average amount of a grant in SED is about $14,000. This magnitude is particularly large compared to other programs. For instance, the second-highest program for receiving grants is SEM, but SEM graduate students, on average, receive 60 percent less grants than SED graduate students. Moreover, among SED graduate students, the aid of miscellaneous mechanisms is prevalent and significant: about 61 percent of SED enrollees receive such aid, and the average amount is $15,018. Again, these numbers are much higher than in other graduate programs. For other programs, the percent of graduate students receiving aid via such alternative mechanisms ranges between 8.6 -28.1 percent, while the average amounts range between $8,112 -$9,898. This paper focuses on grant-based financial aid, or GFA. By GFA, I mean to suggest grants from any sources as well as teaching or research assistantships. Table 2.4 shows the prevalence of GFA in SED: 72.04 percent of SED graduate students receive grants, while 67.95 percent of SED graduate students receive either teaching or research assistantships. The average amount of GFA that SED graduate students can expect to receive is then (0.72 * $13, 784) + (0.67 * (0.42 * $14, 383 + 0.25 * $9, 752)) = $15, 768. The corresponding numbers are $2,943, $2,051, and $2,845, respectively, for SEM, NSE, and PRO graduate students. 2 Figures 2.1a and 2.1b suggest that the way financial aid is distributed has remained stable over time for SS&E fields. These figures reflect both US citizens and non-US citizens in SS&E. Figure 2.1a shows the percentage of SS&E graduate students who depend on aid from one of the following sources: institutions, the federal government, other US sources, foreign sources, and self-support. On the other hand, Figure 2.1b considers the percentage of SS&E graduate students who depend on aid from one of the following mechanisms: teaching assistantships, research assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and other mechanisms. It is also shown that the distribution of aid mechanisms in SS&E fields has not changed dramatically."}, {"section_title": "Historical Background", "text": "The federal government has played a critical role in establishing the generous funding available S&E graduate students. 3 This has been the case since July 1945, when Vannevar Bush, the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, called for federal support to \"enable a large number of young men and women of ability to take up science as a career\" [28]. This initiative proposed by Bush gained strong public support when the then-Soviet Union launched the satellite Spunik, helping Americans to recognize the importance of science and technology in national defense. 4 After the enactment of a series of federal laws (e.g. the National Defense Education Act) and the establishment of government agencies such as the NSF in the mid-1950s, the percentage of S&E graduate students began to increase rapidly until the late 1960s. 5 Beginning in the 1970s, the federal funding for S&E graduate students started to decline considerably. Yet around 16.1 percent of S&E graduate students still received fellowships or traineeships from the federal government. While the federal support for S&E graduate students experienced ups and downs from 1970 to 2012, its average growth rate remained around 2 percent. Note that US policy-makers continue to emphasize advanced education in S&E, as shown in a series of policies supporting STEM education. 6 The federal government also influences the way research universities support their S&E graduate students, as the government is responsible for more than 60 percent of the national investment in S&E higher education. 7 This federal research funding allows research universities to support S&E graduate students via the universities' own financial resources, endowments, and transfers from their instructional budgets [35]. S&E universities are typically willing to support S&E graduate students not only because the graduate students can assist in undergraduate instruction but also because the graduate students contribute to research and development activities at the universities."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data treatment", "text": "The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study for 1993-2003 (B&B 93-03) is the main data set used in this paper. B&B 93-03 consists of approximately 11,000 individuals who represent graduating seniors in US colleges/universities for the academic year 1992-1993. 8 The individuals were tracked for ten years using three follow-up surveys in 1994 (B&B 93/94), 1997 (B&B 93/97), and 2003 (B&B 93/03). Respondents' parents were also interviewed in the base survey in 1993 (B&B 93), and official institutional records are also contained in B&B 93 and B&B 93/94. I confine my sample to those who majored in S&E (natural and physical sciences and engineering), responded to all follow-up surveys, were 19-31 years old in 1993, and were US citizens in 1993. The size of my final sample is 870. 9 B&B 93-03 provides rich and credible information on academic scores and family background. Researchers have access to the base-year population individuals' admission scores, such as their ACT or SAT scores; overall or course-specific GPAs; the highest levels of education attained by parents; and family-income percentiles . Employment and (graduate) education data are also available in B&B 93-03. During each of the follow-up surveys, the individuals were asked to report their part-time or full-time jobs, their working hours, and their salaries. Individuals could also report between three to five graduate programs that they had enrolled in after college graduation. For each reported graduate program, an individual reported the program's field and type, the beginning and ending months and years of enrollment, whether she had received GFA during enrollment in the program, and whether she had completed the enrolled program. B&B 93/94 and B&B 93/97 also contain information on whether individuals applied to graduate programs and whether they were admitted to the programs. Academic scores are used to approximate individuals' cognitive ability. General cognitive ability \u03b8 1 is constructed from SAT scores and undergraduate overall GPAs depending on how SAT scores and overall GPAs are valued in wage-rate regressions. 10 To control for the fixed effects of colleges/universities, I consider overall GPA deviations within a given baccalaureate institution. 11 For S&E-specific cognitive ability \u03b8 2 , I use the undergraduate GPA deviations in S&E-related courses. When only ACT scores were reported, I convert the ACT scores into equivalent SAT scores based on the ACT-SAT concordance table. 12 The fact that B&B 93-03 is not an annual data set poses two challenges. The first is to connect graduate programs mentioned in the four B&B surveys (the base survey and the 9 Out of the original sample, 16.52 percent were S&E majors, 81.4 percent responded to all follow-up surveys, 59 percent were 19-31 years old, and 95.84 percent were US citizens. 10 I regress wage rate on SAT and overall GPA with other covariates. The coefficients associated with SAT and overall GPA are used to construct \u03b8 1 . One can think that \u03b8 1 captures the cognitive ability that is particularly appreciated by employers in the labor market. 11 The regression equation considered is GP A ij(i) = j \u03b2 j D j =j(i) + \u03b5 i , where i refers to student i and j(i) refers to the student's college. D j =j(i) equals one if j = j(i) and zero, otherwise. 12 Provided by ACT (www.act.org/aap/concordance) three follow-ups) in a consistent way. For example, consider an individual who reported that she had enrolled in two programs in 1997 (for the survey B&B 93/97) and three programs in 2003 (for the survey B&B 93/03). I must match these graduate programs to one another. Since little information is available in B&B 93-03 that can be used to identify each of graduate programs (either the university or the department) in which the respondent had enrolled, I use the following procedure. Above all, I focus on variables contained in B&B 93/03 indicating the highest (the most advanced) graduate program in which the individual enrolled and that the individual completed from 1993-2003, which I define by myprog. Next, I find the graduate program that matches myprog.I then examine first B&B 93/03, followed by B&B 93/97, and then finally B&B 93/94, because the most recent follow-up survey often covers enrollment history contained in the earlier surveys. Another challenge emerges when I extract an individuals' employment and enrollment status each year from 1993-2003. B&B 93/97 provides monthly information on individuals' employment and enrollment status from 1993-1997. Such information on labor market participation and relevant outcomes for 2003 is available in B&B 93/03. However, direct information regarding employment and enrollment is missing for 1998-2002. To tackle this problem, I adopt the following ad-hoc procedure. For enrollment history, I first determine the duration between the first enrollment and the last enrollment for individuals who had enrolled at least once in an SEM, SED, NSE, or PRO program between 1993-2003. I then focus on those respondents that reported at least the first or the last enrollment date. Any missing beginning or ending years are filled in by assuming that enrollment durations are similar among individuals who were enrolled in the same program and who had the same completion/dropout status. For instance, if the individual for whom I need to fill in missing information is an SED drop-out, then I approximate her duration with a Poison random variable whose expected value equals the average duration of SED drop-outs. After filling in the information regarding the interval between the first and the last year of enrollment, I consider yearly enrollment decisions. In B&B 93/03, individuals who had attended graduate programs were asked to report whether they took one semester or more offer during the period of enrollment. For those who said that they had not taken any time off, I assume that they were continuously enrolled during their enrollment periods. If individuals reported that they had taken one semester or more off, however, I approximate their enrollment decisions using binomial random variables, again assuming that the annual enrollment patterns would be similar among those who chose the same graduate programs and had the same completion/drop-out status. Employment history for 1998-2002 is similarly recovered. More details regarding data treatment and variable definitions is contained in the appendix. Additional data sets are used to obtain information regarding average annual amounts of program-specific tuition, GFA, and loans, since B&B 93-03 provides only limited information in this regard. 13 For annual tuition and fees of SEM and SED, NSF WebCASPAR was used; and for annual tuition and fees of NSE and PRO, NCES publications are used. To find annual amounts of GFA and loans, I exploit another NCES data setNational Graduate Student Survey 2004, obtaining the average amounts of GFA and loans among US-citizen graduate students in 2003. For the rest years 1993-2002, the levels of GFA and loans in 2003 and the growth rates of tuition and fees from 1993-2003 are utilized. Table  A.4 provides the relevant numbers. Table 2.5 contains some basic statistics regarding my sample. In the table, \"weighted observations\" refers to the number of observations that take into account the sampling weights provided by the NCES. 14 When I use the weights provided by the NCES, my sample represents 83,800 US baccalaureates in the academic year 1992-1993.Since the weighting is based on the nationwide representative sample, statistics gained from the weighted observations suffer less from sample-selection errors. For this reason, all the moments from the data are obtained based on the weighted observations."}, {"section_title": "Data statistics", "text": "Each of the individuals in my sample was on average 22.43 years old when she obtained her baccalaureate in the academic year 1992-1993. The second (general ability) and third (S&E-specific ability) rows represent two proxies for individuals' cognitive abilities. Higher values for these variables are assumed to imply higher abilities. More than 30 percent of the individuals were from families in which the parents have graduate degrees. Furthermore, about 14.9 percent were employed in 1993, and more than 10 percent were enrolled in graduate programs in that same year. How popular is graduate education among S&E baccalaureates? As shown in Table  2.6, just over 40 percent of S&E baccalaureates in my sample attended an SEM, SED, NSE, or PRO program at some point between 1993-2003. The attendance rates show that SED (7.56 percent) and PRO (8.69 percent) are less popular than SEM (12.46 percent) and NSE (11.56 percent). Not all enrollees completed their programs, however. To understand the differential attrition rates across graduate programs, I compare those who enrolled in graduate programs at some point from 1993-2003 (# Attended) and those who completed the enrolled programs during the same period (#Completed). The last row in Table 2.6 reports completion rates that are defined by #Attended #Completed \u00d7 100. SEM has the lowest completion rate (59.55 percent), PRO has the highest completion rate (80.78 percent), and SED and NSE have intermediate rates (64.55-65.26 percent). The first three columns in Table 2.7 illustrate how individuals' decisions regarding work and schooling vary over time. Three activities are considered: engaging in the labor market without enrollment (work-only), enrolling in graduate programs with or without labormarket participation (schooling), and engaging in neither the labor market nor graduate school (full leisure). Over time, fewer baccalaureates attended graduate programs, while more of them engaged in the labor market. This seems reasonable since investment in education becomes less attractive as one grows older and since some individuals would already have completed the programs at later points in time. The last four columns in Table 2.7 indicate the percentage points of those respondents who enrolled in graduate programs while participating in the labor market. SED and PRO enrollees were less likely to combine work and schooling than SEM and NSE enrollees. This may be because SED and PRO require stronger academic commitments. Figure 2.8 also hints at institutional heterogeneity, which shows different growth rates in the number of degrees over time. SED and PRO seem to pose a minimum-year requirement since the numbers of degree-holders in SED and PRO increase only after several years. Such threshold years do not seem to exist for SEM and NSE as the numbers of degree-holders in SEM and NSE increase immediately beginning in 1994. 15 Who attends which graduate programs? Table 2.9 shows individual characteristics observed in 1993 according to the graduate programs attended during the period 1993-2003. Several observations can be made. First, older individuals are less likely to attend graduate programs after college graduation. This seems sensible as becoming older implies that one has a shorter lifetime during which to enjoy the returns to education. 16 Second, the proxies for cognitive ability, \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 , are higher for those who attended graduate programs. This is not surprising since individuals with higher academic scores tend to enjoy schooling and are also more likely to be admitted to the programs. SED and PRO attendees show particularly stronger abilities than those who never attended graduate programs (No GS). Third, graduate-program attendees are likely to have parents who have post-BA degrees. Those who have parents with graduate degrees is nearly 50 percent for SED attendees, while the corresponding number is only 28 percent for the No GS case. Finally, attendees of all graduate programs except NSE are less likely to work and more likely to only be enrolled in school. In particular, only 5.5 percent of SED attendees participated in the labor market in 1993, while more than 54 percent of them enrolled in graduate programs in 1993; that is, immediately after college graduation. In Table 2.10, the individual characteristics observed in 1993 are compared, among graduate program enrollees, and in particular, between those who dropped out of the programs (Drop) and those who completed the programs (Com). It is observed first that regardless of program type, the drop-outs were older than those who completed the programs. Second, those who dropped out of the programs sometimes had higher abilities than those who stayed in and completed the programs. For instance, SED drop-outs had higher average general ability (3.96) than SED degree-holders (3.91); PRO dropouts had higher average S&E-specific ability (0.52) than PRO degree-holders (0.34). Combining these facts with those in Table 2.9, one may conclude that higher ability proxies could lead individuals to decide to attend graduate programs, but such ability proxies seem to be less influential on degree completion. Some unobservable individual characteristics, such as motivation, may be more influential. Table 2.11 compares years of work and schooling, GFA-receipt experiences, and annual salaries in 2003 among both program drop-outs and degree-holders. First, the drop-outs tended to have more years of work experience than degree-holders. This is not surprising since graduate students may drop out as they receive attractive job offers, or as they fail to meet academic requirements and attempt to find jobs. The causality link is ambiguous, but it seems clear that work and schooling can be substitutionary for each other to some extent. The third row in Table 2.11 reports the percentage of graduate students receiving GFA at least once during their enrollment period, which I call the GFA-receipt rate. GFA appears to be common for SED attendees, with more than 96 percent of them receiving GFA. Note that this may be partly because SED programs last longer than the other types of programs, and graduate students thus tend to stay longer in these programs. The final row in Table 2.11 reports the average annual salary in 2003 among individuals participating in the labor market. Drop-outs tended to receive 7-13 percent lower salaries than degree-holders across all graduate programs. Rather surprisingly, S&E PhDs earned less than SEM or NSE degree-holders. What are the reasons for this? First, it is possible that the market returns to SED are not particularly high compared to the market returns to SEM or NSE even though an SED program takes more years to complete. Second, it is possible that returns to work experience are highly valued in the labor market but S&E PhDs did not build up such experience because they were fully committed to their doctoral studies up to 2003. Table 2.12 shows the transition patterns between period t and period t + 1 from 1993-1997. I consider three cases: full leisure, work-only, and schooling. The numbers indicate the average probability of transitioning from the row activity to the column activity. The first panel reports the case for all observations in my sample, and is followed by the panels for SEM, SED, and PRO. From the first panel, we can see that individuals engaging in a given activity in period t tend to choose the same activity in period t + 1. The returning rate is particularly higher in the case of work-only. More than 90 percent of those working in period t also worked in period t + 1, and fewer than 4 percent of them chose to leave their jobs and attend graduate programs instead. The returning rate related to schooling was also high (73 percent), but around 20 percent of enrollees in period t decided to work in period t + 1. This transition from schooling to work is caused in part by program completion or attrition. The transition patterns are similar in the other panels. It is noticeable that the transition probabilities from school-only at t to work-only at t + 1 are particularly low for SED (7.86 percent) and PRO (8.13 percent), compared with SEM (19.44 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "I create a discrete choice dynamic model in which S&E baccalaureates decide over employment and enrollment each year after college graduation. My focus is on how GFA influences an individual's decision on whether to enroll in SED, and if so, whether the individual continuously enroll in the program until the degree is earned. I begin by illustrating how the model is linked to the data. Recognizing that the labor market is an important alternative for SED students, I model labor-market engagement in terms of job-offer functions and wage-rate functions, as shown in Tables 2.11 and 2.7. The model is able to explain why, when attractive jobs emerge, some qualified S&E baccalaureates may decide not to pursue science careers, or some S&E graduate students may decide to leave their programs. Other types of graduate programs function as alternative for potential S&E PhDs. Table 2.6 shows that more than 60 percent of S&E baccalaureates enroll in graduate programs, yet only 7.56 percent enroll in SED. The model assumes four options of graduate education: SEM, SED, NSE, and PRO. The model assumes that each type of graduate program has its own rules of offering admission and GFA, and degrees. The returns to education also differ, and these different returns are ostensibly accounted for in wage rates. The dynamic nature of graduate enrollment decisions is also incorporated into the model. Table 2.7 shows that employment rates increase while enrollment rates decrease over time. I reflect these patterns by assuming that an individual can only enroll in only one graduate program during her lifetime, while she always has the opportunity to engage in the labor market. Moreover, many individuals change activities over time, though the majority of them seem to maintain their previous activities (Table 2.12). To reflect such patterns, I introduce individual heterogeneity, state variables, and idiosyncratic shocks. Transition patterns are similar among individuals of similar characteristics or similar past actions. The shocks capture uncertainties that exist beyond individuals' control, such as the emergence of job offers or offers of admission, or program arrivals of job offers or admission, or program outcomes. Moreover, unobservable heterogeneity is considered in this model. Individuals' levels of academic motivation, that is, how much individuals enjoy schooling, is unknown to employers, graduate schools, and the researcher. Strongly motivated individuals enjoy higher utilities from schooling, meaning that they tend to continuously enroll in and complete their enrolled programs, even though attractive job offers may come up or GFA offers may be unappealing. In this way, the model explains why, among a pool of similar observables, some enrollees ultimately drop out, while others finish their PhDs (see, for instance, Table 2.10)."}, {"section_title": "Basic elements Individuals' dynamic problem", "text": "An S&E baccalaureate's problem is to find an optimal sequence of state-dependent functions to maximize the expected present discounted lifetime payoff. 17 A decision at a period t is to choose the best alternative k \u2208 {00, 0m, 0d, 0n, 0p, w0, wm, wd, wn, wp}, where the first part of k indicates whether to work (w) or not (0), and the second part of k indicates whether the individual enrolls in SEM (m), SED (d), NSE (n), or PRO (p), or does not enroll at all (0). d k t is a dummy which equals 1 if k is the optimal at t, and zero otherwise. d t is a vector that has d k t 's as its element.

If an individual has not enrolled in any graduate program before the decision-making period and if she receives one or more admissions, she can consider enrolling in one of admitted programs. If enrollment is made at a period, she decides over whether to continuously enroll in the same period from the next period on instead of considering a new program to enroll in.

At the moment of enrollment, individuals remain uncertain about whether they can complete their programs, which is realized at the end of enrollment.

Sample-selection problems arise when the dependent variables of interest are observed for only the group under treatment when the treatment is not randomly assigned. Issues of selection bias are prevalent in the first-step estimates. For instance, wage rates are observed for those who applied for jobs, were offered jobs, and accepted the offers. Ex-post wage rates observed among labor-market participants may be higher than ex-ante wage rates expected by all potential workers. One can manage selection bias either by utilizing the Mills ratio suggested by [44] or by explicitly considering the correlation between the main equation (of researchers' interest) and the selection. In both cases, the researcher identifies variables that relate to the dependent variables of the selection equation but that do not directly influence the dependent variable of the main equation (exclusion restriction). The exclusion restrictions are found outside and inside of the model. For instance, among the exclusion restrictions for the estimation of wage rates are F inc, P edu GT BA , age in 2003, gender, and family size. First note that F inc and P edu GT BA satisfy the exclusion restrictions since the family-background variables are related to motivation level, but the variables do not directly influence the wage rates. The decision to use age in 2003 as one of the exclusion restrictions is made based on the dynamic model. 1 On the other hand, gender and family size, which are found outside of model, can also serve as exclusion restrictions since such variables can influence individuals' decisions to work but do not directly influence the wage rates. The exclusion restrictions for other regressions (job offers and graduate-education outcomes [admission, GFA, completion] for SEM and NSE) are found both inside and outside of the quantitative model (see the Appendix)."}, {"section_title": "Second-step estimates", "text": "Given that the second-step parameters are estimated utilizing the method of simulated moments, it is important to understand how the selected moments help to identify the second-step parameters.

The main objective is to understand how abilities determine the probability of receiving GFA and earning a degree. Including family background or initial conditions as an additional covariate in the regression is important to isolate the effect of abilities on the outcomes of interest. The remaining moments are used to identify preferences and levels of academic motivation. Preference parameters are identified in the process of rationalizing individual choices given observable variables and idiosyncratic shocks. For instance, the (common) non-pecuniary benefit of schooling (\u03bb S ) should not be significant if there are only a small number of baccalaureates who attended graduate programs. The non-pecuniary benefits from schooling that are only applicable to strongly motivated individuals (\u03bbsm) can be identified in the process of justifying why observationally equivalent individuals make different education choices. It is challenging to identify type-specific benefits from schooling separately from type distribution. For instance, the percentage of those who enrolled in graduate programs at some point from 1993-2003 increases either by augmenting the schooling-related utility enjoyed by each of the strongly motivated individuals or by expanding the percentage of strongly motivated individuals. In this paper, the aforementioned two components can be separately identified because each of them contributes to a given moment in different magnitudes. That is, the identification comes from model parameterization. Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 contain the first-step and the second-step estimates, respectively. First consider the labor-market environment. The chance of receiving a job offer increases with general ability and age. S&E-specific ability is not a statistically significant factor in job offers. In the wage-rates equation, both abilities turn out to be statistically significant. Moreover, wage rates increase alongside the accumulated years of work and decrease in the squared term. All graduate programs except for NSE yield statistically significant returns to education. Professional degrees increase the wage rate by 66 percent, S&E doctorates by 48 percent, and S&E master's degrees by 19 percent."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimates and goodness of fit", "text": "Admission-outcome information from the B&B 93-03 data set is only available according to degree-programs; that is, B&B 93/93 asks students who applied to graduate schools about only the types of programs to which they applied, rather than the fields of the programs. This is problematic when estimating the admission probabilities for SEM, SED, and NSE. I assume that SEM and NSE follow the admission probability of the estimated \"master's program,\" while SED follows the admission probability of the estimated \"doctoral program.\" Given that MBA programs are the most popular among NSE according to B&B 93-03, I assume that MBA programs follow \"master's programs\" in general. Both general and S&E-specific abilities influence master's programs and doctoral programs, though general ability seems to exert stronger effects. In the case of PRO, however, only S&E-specific ability is statically important, and the magnitude of the coefficient (0.635) is much larger than in other cases (0.01 for master's programs; 0.306 for doctoral programs). This may be because S&E-related academic scores are one of the most critical factors for medical-school admission. For SEM and NSE, GFA-offer functions and program-completion functions are also estimated during the first-step. It is assumed that there is no restriction on the minimum number of years of enrollment for SEM and NSE. Instead, I assume that the function probabilities depend on abilities as well as the number of years enrolled. As shown in 3.1, once I control for years of enrollment, abilities are not significant factors in programcompletion outcomes. The second-step estimates are contained in Table 3.2. The GFA-offer functions and program-completion functions estimated for SED and PRO are not particularly satisfactory, as some of the estimates have unexpected associated signs. For instance, S&E-specific ability exerts negative effects on the chances of obtaining GFA offers. In the case of PRO, the probability of receiving GFA is estimated to be nearly zero, failing to capture the average GFA-receipt probability observed in B&B 93-93. On the other hand, abilities do not seem to be important factors in (or positively associated with) program-completion outcomes. Similar results are found for SEM and NSE. In the model, the minimum number of years of enrollment necessary for graduate students to complete SED and PRO are 4 years and 2 years, respectively. These estimates seem to imply that once students meet the minimum-year requirements, the academic score-based ability proxies do not matter. 2 The last two parts of Table 3.2 report the estimates of preference and motivation-type parameters. First consider the preference parameters. Working entails positive utility, while schooling entails negative utility. This explains in part why a relatively small number of individuals attends graduate school, and most of them participated in the labor market. Strongly motivated individuals, however, gain additional utility from schooling. The additional utility (0.809) is large enough to offset the utility from the (common) negative utility (\u22120.653). Strongly motivated individuals also have extra utility from enrolling in SED, though the extra utility is not statistically significant. Combining work and schooling leads to dis-utility, and the dis-utility level is greater for enrollees in either SED or PRO. For all graduate programs except for SEM, the application costs turn out to be statistically significant. The application costs are highest for PRO, and lowest for SED. The low application costs for SED are unexpected as an SED PhD involves preparation for additional exams, such as the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE). Regarding the function of determining the strong-motivation type, none of considered covariates turns out to be statistically significant. Nevertheless, I compare the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients associated with the motivation type. This helps clarify the simulation results that are presented from the subsequent section onwards. F inc shows a larger value than P edu GT BA , so that the simulation from these estimates assigns \u00b5 = 1 to those with F inc = 1 more than those with P edu GT BA = 1. Engagement in the labor market in 1993 produces a coefficient with a large negative magnitude (-1.157). The magnitude is large, especially compared with the coefficient related to enrollment in SED in 1993 (0.079). Also note that those who enrolled in SEM, NSE, and PRO in 1993 are more likely to be of \u00b5 = 1, than those who enrolled in SED. Though some of the second-step estimates do not seem to be reasonable at first glance, the predicted model (taking the first-step estimates as a given) generates moments that are fairly close to data moments. Figure 3.1 shows the goodness of moments fit. In the figure, the horizontal axis shows the data moments, and the vertical axis shows the predicted moments. The scatter-plot dots are located around the 45-degree line drawn in the figure, which implies that the 31 parameters perform well in matching 49 moments. A similar conclusion follows when I regress the data moments on the predicted moments: a coefficient of 0.895, close to 1 (Table 3.3)."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "To understand how the estimated model works, I simulate 1000 individuals' responses using the estimated model."}, {"section_title": "Motivation is positively correlated with abilities", "text": "The percentage of strongly motivated individuals among B&B baccalaureates is estimated at 68 percent.

The contribution of each trait to the self-selection observed in the data is measured by the coefficients that I obtain when regressing the data moments on the new moments. If an individual trait is associated with a slope close to one, it means that the trait is not important in explaining the self-selection. The first column of Table 3.5 reports the results. It is evident that the absence of motivation or general ability makes enlarges the gap between simulated moments and the data moments. This message is also clear from the average distance between data moments and predicted moments. The mean and standard deviations of such distances are reported in the second and third columns of Table 3.5. 3. The higher the \u00b5 or the \u03b8 1 at the moment of college graduation, the higher the expected optimized payoffs.

This result is related in part to the differentiated opportunity costs of SED enrollment among individuals; it is also due in part to the completion probabilities for SED. 4 Table 3.7 contains the average motivation level according to graduate-education outcome. 5 Note that all SED PhDs are strongly motivated, while 87.5 percent of SED drop-outs are strongly motivated."}, {"section_title": "Policy Experiments", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "How GFA influences the production of S&E doctorates", "text": "How does GFA influence the magnitude and quality of those who enroll in, drop out of, and complete S&E doctoral programs? To answer this question, I simulate individuals' choices for the ten years after college graduation under different amounts of GFA. In this experiment, I change the amount of GFA without altering the GFA-receipt probability functions. The results are described in Figure 3.4 and Table 3.8. Figure 3.4a graphically illustrates show the numbers of SED PhDs and SED dropouts would vary along with the policy changes. In the figure, the horizontal axis is over percentage changes in the amount of GFA, while the vertical axis is over percentage changes in the number of SED PhDs (real lines) and SED drop-outs (dashed lines). Note that if the percentage change in GFA equals zero, it indicates the current GFA policy. Several aspects of Figure 3.4a are noteworthy. First, the number of S&E doctorates and the number of SED drop-outs both increase in aid amounts. One can understand that while GFA contributes to the production of S&E doctorates, it also attracts those who tend to drop out of the programs. Second, S&E doctorates are more responsive to generous financial aid (positive percentage changes in GFA amounts), while SED drop-outs are more responsive to stringent financial aid (negative percentage changes in GFA amounts). This implies that most of the current SED PHDs would stay in their programs even if they were offered smaller aid amounts. Next, Table 3.8 illustrates how heterogeneous individuals respond differently to policy changes. Two extreme policies are considered: eliminating GFA completely (\"no aid\"), and doubling the amount of GFA (\"doubled aid\"). For general ability and then S&E-specific ability, I consider three groups: the bottom-ranked (\"3\"), intermediate-ranked (\"2\"), and top-ranked (\"1\"). Each cell in Table 3.8 indicates the percentage change in the number of SED enrollees, drop-outs, or PhDs within the group. For instance, as a result of implementing \"no aid\" policy, the number of SED enrollees decreases by 1.82 percent among individuals with top-ranked \u03b8 1 and intermediate-ranked \u03b8 2 . 6 Observe the different levels of policy responsiveness of group A with (2,2) or (1,1) and group B with (1,2) or (2,1), where (x, y) indicates that x is the rank of general ability and y is the rank of S&E-specific ability. In terms of S&E doctorates especially (the third panel of Table 3.8), group A responds only to the \"no aid\" policy, while group B responds only to the \"doubled aid\" policy. Under \"no aid\" policy, some of the current SED PhDs (those who would complete SED under the current GFA policy) from group A would drop out of their programs or would not enroll in SED at all. On the other hand, the current SED PhDs from group B would not respond at all to the \"no aid\" policy. Therefore, the smaller number of S&E doctorates produced as a result of the \"no aid\" policy can be attributed to group A. Under the \"doubled aid\" policy, new S&E doctorates would be produced from group B. Under the \"doubled aid\", some individuals in group B would choose to enter SED and complete programs, or some of the current SED drop-outs (those who would drop out of SED under the current GFA policy) would continuously enroll in SED and become PhDs. On the other hand, group A would have new SED enrollees, but all of the new enrollees would drop out of their programs. Therefore, the increased number of S&E doctorates as a result of the doubled aid can be ascribed to group B. In a nutshell, it follows from Figure 3.4 that less-favorable GFA policies would prevent some of the current SED drop-outs from entering SED while preserving keeping the enrollment incentives of most current PhDs. From Table 3.8, we also learn that it may be possible to spend less but produce the same number of S&E PhDs by altering the current probability that different-ability individuals receive GFA."}, {"section_title": "Alternative combinations of GFA policy variables", "text": "I consider an alternative GFA policy is provided for each t, and the probability of receiving GFA to individuals with (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) is now given by . Note that the current GFA policy is equivalent to the policy (p 1 , p 2 , p 3 ) = (0, 0, 0). I consider the values of all possible combinations of 9 values of p 1 , 10 values of p 2 , and 10 values of p 3 : Thus, 900 policies are considered in total. For each alternative policy, I simulate individuals' choices for their first ten years after college graduation. I calculate the total number of S&E PhDs that have been produced by the tenth year of college graduation, the total amount of GFA aid provided to S&E enrollees (whether SED drop-outs or SED PhDs), and the per-PhD aid (the ratio of total aid to total number of S&E doctorates). The first panel of Figure 3.5 plots the relationship between the number of S&E PhDs and the total amount of GFA aid. Not surprisingly, the number of S&E PhDs increases along with the total amount of GFA aid. However, the number of S&E PhDs increase with the total amount of aid, but the marginal increase becomes smaller with the total amount of aid. That is, we can say that the marginal cost of producing one more S&E doctorate is increasing. The second panel of Figure 3.5 plots the relationship between the completion rate and the total amount of GFA. The completion rate is defined as the ratio of the number of S&E PhDs to the number of S&E enrollees. The completion rate first decreases with aid and then begins to increase. This may be because GFA first attracts primarily those who are likely to drop out of SED, but later on it primarily attracts those who are likely to complete SED. 7 The per-PhD aid amounts are shown in the last panel of Figure 3.5. The per-PhD aid is on the horizontal axis, while the total number of PhDs is on the vertical axis. The dashed curve in the figure shows the policies that entail the minimum total aid for a given number of S&E PhDs. That is, the curve shows GFA policies that are the most cost-efficient among those considered. The circle in the figure indicates the combination of the two variables in the current GFA policy. Figure 3.5 shows that alternative policies exist that can reduce the total amount of GFA while producing the same number of S&E doctorates. In Table 3.9, the first three columns indicate the values of the policy variables p 1 , p 2 , and p 3 . The fourth column is the probability of GFA-receipt for average-ability SED enrollees. The fifth and sixth columns state the probabilities of GFA-receipt for average SED drop-outs and average SED PhDs. The last three columns summarize how each alternative policy performs relative to the current policy in terms of the total number of S&E doctorates, total aid, and per-PhD aid. The last row in the table reports the performances of the current GFA policy. The largest gain in cost-efficiency is achieved for the policy (p 1 , p 2 , p 3 ) = (0, \u22121.5, 0.9). Under this policy, the average probability that current SED drop-outs would receive GFA decreases from 100 to 73.6, while the average probability that current SED PhDs would receive GFA decreases from 100 to 80.6. Though the alternative policy hurts both current PhDs and current drop-outs, it produces the same number of S&E doctorates as the current policy while reducing the total aid. This is possible because the new policy maintains the enrollment incentives of the current SED PhDs who are less responsive to policy changes. Some alternative policies can even produce additional S&E doctorates while spending less. For instance, the policy of (p 1 , p 2 , p 3 ) = (0.5, \u22121.5, \u22121.5) increases the number of S&E doctorates by 0.70 percent while reducing the total aid by 16.58 percent. The new policy increases the amount of GFA by 50 percent, and lowers the aid-receipt probability especially for current SED drop-outs from 100 to 29.9. As a result, the benefit from the 50-percent increased aid goes mainly to those who are likely to complete their programs, so that more S&E doctorates are produced with a smaller budget. Several points deserve attention. First note that all alternative policies presented in Table 3.9 entail non-negative values of p 1 ; that is, equal or larger amounts of GFA aid are suggested. This is not surprising because under the current policy, the probabilities of receiving GFA are indiscriminately high for all types of SED graduate students and because the aid-receipt probability function is the tool by which to target a particular type of students. 8 Another point to note pertains to the interpretation of the last row of Table 3.9. The 100 percent probability of aid-receipt among SED enrollees does not mean that the average probability of receiving GFA is 1 among current SED enrollees. Rather, it means that the probability of receiving GFA is 1 among those whose abilities are the average of SED enrollees."}, {"section_title": "Alternative GFA mechanisms", "text": "The previous section considers alternative policies that utilize the same mechanism as the current policy assumed in the model: that is, a feasible GFA policy is assumed to consist of the amount of GFA and the GFA-receipt probability functions, in which the aid-receipt probabilities depend only on individual abilities (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ). In this section, we consider different mechanisms of GFA policies as follows: A No uncertainty: All SED enrollees receive the same amount of GFA as under the current policy with certainty B No uncertainty, 20% less: All SED enrollees receive 20 percent less GFA with certainty C SED=SEM: SED graduate students receive the same amount of GFA with the same probability as SEM graduate students D No uncertainty, \u00b5 = 0 only: GFA is provided only to weakly motivated graduate students with certainty E No uncertainty, \u00b5 = 1 only: GFA is provided only to strongly motivated graduate students with certainty F More support to \u00b5 = 0: The current GFA policy is changed such that weakly motivated individuals receive 50 percent more GFA G More support to \u00b5 = 1: The current GFA policy is changed such that strongly motivated individuals receive 50 percent more GFA H No uncertainty up to the 2nd year: The current GFA policy is changed such that GFA is offered only during the enrollees' first and second years of enrollment I No uncertainty, only from the 4th year: The current GFA policy is changed such that the GFA is offered only when the enrollees have reached at least the fourth year of enrollment. Table 3.10 reports percentage changes in given measures under alternative policies relative to the current policy. The measures relate to, in order, the magnitudes (in SED enrollees and SED PhDs), duration (time to attrition and degree), the characteristics of SED PhDs (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 , \u00b5), the amount of GFA (aid given to SED drop-outs, aid given to SED PhDs, and the total aid), and per-PhD aid. I discuss the results briefly focusing on percentage changes in the number of S&E doctorates and total GFA aid. First, since SED graduate students receive GFA with a high probability under the current GFA policy, removing uncertainty would not change individuals' enrollment decisions considerably. As expected, policy A increases the number of S&E PhDs by 0.71 percent, and the total amount of GFA aid by 0.98 percent. If GFA is offered only to strongly motivated individuals (policy E) , there is no change in the magnitude and quality of S&E PhDs. Since policy E prevents weakly motivated individuals from receiving any GFA, the policy reduces the budget by 1.48 percent. What if the support were given only to the weakly motivated? Then would some of the weakly motivated individuals become S&E PhDs? The answer is still no. Even if the weakly motivated were provided with unconditional support (policy D), only a few of the weaklymotivated would enter SED and all of them would still fail to attain S&E doctorates. As a result, supporting only the weakly motivated turns out to be equivalent to supporting a few potential drop-outs and ignoring the majority of the other SED students. Under policy D, the number of S&E doctorates decreases by 2.13 percent and the total aid decreases by 98.11 percent. Different treatments based on motivation level are attempted in policies F and G. If a 50-percent increase in GFA is offered to the weakly motivated (policy F), the enrollment incentives of the current SED PhDs remain the same, but some of the current SED drop-outs are encouraged to stay in the programs longer than they might have otherwise. As a result, policy F produces the same number of S&E doctorates while spending 0.14 percent less. 9 When there is a 50-percent increase in GFA for the strongly motivated (policy G), 1.42 percent more doctorates are produced at the expense of a 1.23 percent increase in the budget. When does GFA critically help SED graduate students to complete their studies, in the earlier period or the later period of S&E doctoral studies? In policy H, GFA is provided to all SED students without uncertainty during their first and second enrollment periods. In policy I, GFA is provided to all SED students without uncertainty beginning from their fourth year of enrollment on. The results show that policy H produces 2.84 percent more S&E doctorates, while policy I causes 2.13 percent drop in the number of S&E doctorates. This implies that supporting graduate students in the early period is critical for increasing the pool of S&E doctorates. Those who stay in their programs during the fourth year are likely to stay regardless of GFA policies. That is, they are not those individuals whose program completion need to be supported by GFA. On the other hand, if support is provided unconditionally for the first two enrollment periods, SED graduate students tend to stay, and after the third year, though there is no GFA, they have enough reason to stay in their programs since they have accumulated human capital and have fewer years to go before graduation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper investigates a question that has yet to be sufficiently answered in the existing literature: is the current grant-based aid policy for S&E doctoral students in the United States cost-efficient? I attempt to answer this question by constructing a structural dynamic model of S&E college graduates and fitting the model to the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study data set for the years from 1993-2003. The estimated model is then used to simulate individuals' post-college graduation ten-year responses in order to understand how GFA effects influences the individuals' decisions and to find more cost-efficient GFA policies. I find that GFA increases the number of S&E PhDs, but it also attracts those who are not likely to complete their programs. I also find that those who are likely to complete SED under the current GFA policy respond less elastically to policy changes than those who are likely to drop out of their programs under the current policy. By exploiting this differential elasticity with respect to policy changes, this paper is able to identify an alternative GFA policy that reduces the budget by 25 percent to produce the same number of S&E PhDs: it maintains the annual amount of GFA, but it lowers the probability of GFA-receipt particularly for potential drop-outs. If the unobservable trait of motivation level is observed by policy makers, we can also improve the cost-efficiency of GFA policies by providing GFA only to those who are strongly motivated individuals unconditionally. This paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the cost-efficiency of GFA policies for S&E graduate students and by considering the trajectory of PhD production from first enrollment to completion. The model and estimation methodology suggested in the dissertation can also be applied to other graduate programs. Policy results, however, should be interpreted with caution. In particular, this dissertation ignores credit-constraints or wealth inherited from parents, and financial aid mainly attracts those who are likely to complete S&E doctoral programs rather than relaxing market friction. My model results show that unobservable motivation type is closely related to family income level. If credit-constraints play an important role, then my model assign the type of strong motivation to those who could finance their graduate education with help from their parents. In addition, the lack of unobservable ability may pose another problem -while ability may be unobservable to researchers, it may be known to the students or graduate schools. Financial-aid offers can depend on such abilities. Without capturing such unobservable ability, then the model may fail to properly describe the current aid policy, instead exaggerating the cost-efficiency of the policy. I leave these issues for future research.               \nMy general equilibrium model illustrates how a market friction hinders the allocation of talent, restricts the supply of R&D input, and ultimately limits national R&D activity. Two general equilibrium effects are noteworthy. First, under some initial conditions, only talented individuals are encouraged to attain education, even with full tuition subsidies. Second, as an increased supply of researchers increases the wages of production workers, less productive firms exit the market when there are education subsidies. Moreover, I show that, due to distributional effects, the full-subsidy policy financed by a lump-sum tax increases the relative supply of R&D inputs, more so than policies under which individuals take out loans or use their future income to finance their education. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that pays attention to the market friction confronting potential R&D researchers and investigates the implications of such market friction in the composition of R&D researchers and R&D firms. This chapter also relates to economic growth and development, however. A natural extension is the introduction of knowledge spillover. If the supply of researchers or the national R&D activity in the current period enhances the total factor productivity of active firms in the subsequent period, education subsidies relaxing the individual-side market friction will lead to the better allocation of talent in the short run, as well as economic growth in the long run. Moreover, the tuition subsidies financed by a lump-sum tax will moderate the national inequalities. I leave this to future work. individuals' cognitive abilities. SAT scores (SAT i ) are individuals' combined scores of the verbal and math portions of the SAT. 2 Cumulative-GPA deviations (GP Adev i ) measure how good an individual's academic performance is relative to classmates at his or her undergraduate institution. Technically, GP Adev i is the residual that remains after regressing cumulative GPAs on the undergraduate institutions' dummy variables. GPA deviations in S&E courses (GP Adev SE i ) can be obtained similarly. To reduce the number of covariates and ease analysis, I decide to use two cognitive ability proxies rather than the four variables. 3 I assume that an S&E college graduate i's cognitive ability is approximated by general academic score A 1i and S&E academic score A 2i . While the S&E-specific academic score A 2i is simply GP Adev SE i , the general academic score A 1i is assumed to be a linear combination of SAT i and GP Adev i . I suggest an ad-hoc way of determining such a linear combination. I consider a pooled wage-rate regression. By regressing wage rates on SAT i , Rank i , GP Adev i and other covariates (while taking into sample-selection bias), I am able to determine how each of the three academic variables contributes to individuals' wage rates, i.e., the estimated coefficient parameters. The coefficients are now used as weights of linear combination to calculate the general academic score A 1i . Finally, I assume that A 1i is given by SAT i * 0.0312 + GP Adev i * 0.089 and A 2i = GP Adev SE i . \u2022 Employment/Enrollment Individuals decide whether to work (employment) and/or whether to enroll in a graduate program (enrollment). Using B&B 93-03, I observe the monthly employment and enrollment status for the years 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, as well as the employment and enrollment status in 2003. In the case of years 1993-1997, the enrollment and employment status in a given year is assumed to correspond to individuals' enrollment and employment status in January of that year. I assume that an individual worked in a year when she had a full-time job during the year. On the other hand, I assume that an individual enrolled in a graduate program when she enrolled in a post-graduate program either as a part-time or full-time student. In B&B 93-03, individuals did not report which graduate programs they attended. 4 \u2022 Decision period Individuals are assumed to make decisions regarding employment and enrollment each year after college graduation. I focus on individuals' decisions made from 1994-2003, while the decisions in 1993 are treated as initial conditions. \u2022 Graduate education: graduate programs and degrees Individuals can decide which field of graduate study they wish to pursue. There are four possible options: S&E terminal master's programs (SEM), S&E doctoral programs (SED), non-S&E academic programs (NSE), and professional programs (PRO). There are four possible academic degrees: a master's degree in S&E, a doctorate in S&E, a non-S&E academic degree, and a professional degree. I assume that some of the S&E doctoral students have the chances to earn master's degrees in S&E after having completed two years of enrollments in their S&E doctoral programs. In the data, terminal master's programs in non-S&E fields, doctoral programs in S&E, and MBA programs are categorized as NSE, while medical schools and law schools belong to the category of PRO. I do not have direct information on whether those with S&E master's degrees attained the degrees via either SEM or SED. Therefore, I make the following assumptions: if the highest level of graduate program an individual enrolled in was a master's program in S&E and her highest degree was a master's in S&E, she attended SEM; on the other hand, if the highest level of graduate program enrolled was a master's in S&E, I assume that she dropped out of SED after earning an S&E master's degree. For analytical simplicity, I ignore the fact that that there exists in practice a multiple number or heterogeneous graduate schools within a given study-field. \u2022 Graduate education: Tuition and fees, loans, and GFA If an individual enrolls in a graduate programg in period t, she needs to pay tuition and fees, T N g t . The tuition and fees vary across graduate programs and time. Whenever an individual enrolls in a graduate program, she makes on loan Loan g , which varies only across graduate programs. For an enrollee of program g at t, it is possible that she can earn grant-based financial aid (GFA) with some probability. While the probability of receiving GFA may vary among enrollees, the amounts of GFA (GF A g t ) that the enrollees of program g are the same at t. B&B 93-03 is not the best data set for gathering information on tuition and fees, loans, and GFA. Individuals in B&B 93-03 report such information if they have enrolled in graduate programs, but such information reflects their accumulated experiences in graduate school, and the variations over time are difficult to capture. For this reason, I utilize external data sources: IPEDS and the Graduate Student Survey series. Table A.4 provides information on tuition and fees, loans, and GFA amounts for graduate programs during the years 1993-2003. [INSERT Table A.4 "}, {"section_title": "R&D 4.1 Model", "text": "A static general equilibrium model is constructed to investigate how policies relaxing individual-side market friction influence the composition of firms and individuals engaged in research and development (R&D). In the model, individuals differ in their levels of consumption good and talent, and they decide whether to supply labor services or research services. More talented individuals can supply more efficiency units of research services. However, supplying research services require individuals to attain costly education. In the presence of credit-constraints, individuals need to finance the education costs only with their good endowment. Firms, on the other hand, differ in their levels of productivity and decide whether to produce and whether invest in R&D. 1 Firms employ labor services to produce goods, and employ research services to invest in R&D.

The education, which is necessary for supplying research services, costs T units of good (numeraire).

They are different in productivity \u03d5, which is drawn from a distribution G on the domain [\u03d5 m , \u221e). Firms that produce consumption good (which is numeraire) employ labor services. The profit from production is where L is the employment size of labor services and f denotes the fixed production cost. I assume that \u03c3 > 1, which leads to decreasing returns to scale. One can consider that the business owner faces it more challenging as the size of workers increases (span of control [47]). Firms also decide whether to invest in R&D. Investing in R&D is equivalent to hiring f R units of research services. If a firm of \u03d5 invests in R&D, the firm productivity \u03d5 immediately upgrades to \u03b2\u03d5, where \u03b2 > 1. Thus, the profit of firm \u03d5 that engages both in production and R&D is given The optimal choice of L by firm \u03d5 is given by As the labor choice is linear in \u03d5, the ratio of optimal labor choices between two different firms \u03d5 1 and \u03d5 2 equals firms' productivity ratio: One can easily see that if the firm engages both in production and R&D, the optimal choice of L is given by w \u2212\u03c3 L (\u03d5\u03b2). The increased firm productivity as a result of R&D induces the firm to employ more labor services. 2 Since both the incentive to produce and the incentive to engage in R&D increase in firm productivity, firms will be sorted out in three types of activities: remaining inactive, producing without R&D investment, and producing with R&D investment. Define firms' decision function K : [\u03d5 min , \u221e) \u2192 {n, p, pr}, where n denotes remaining inactive, p producing without R&D investment, and pr producing with R&D investment. To understand firms' profit-maximizing behavior, observe where \u03c0(\u2022) denotes the profit function of p-firms, \u03c0 R (\u2022) the profit function of pr-firms, and z(\u2022) the differential profits between p-and pr-firms. The variable profit from production, w L ( L (\u03d5) \u03c3\u22121 ), is increasing in firm productivity, and the benefit from R&D investment, , is also increasing in firm productivity. Therefore, we can find firm thresholds \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R such that firms of \u03d5 < \u03d5 * choose n, firms of \u03d5 \u2208 (\u03d5 * , \u03d5 * R ) choose p, and firms of \u03d5 \u2265 \u03d5 * R choose pr. The firm thresholds \u03d5 an \u03d5 * can be calculated from solving \u03c0 (\u03d5 * ) = 0 for \u03d5 * and \u03c0 (\u03d5 * R ) = \u03c0 R (\u03d5 * R ), respectively: Note that the relation between the firm thresholds and services prices follows immediately from (4.5) as stated in the following lemma. Lemma 1 This indicates that a unique pair of (w L , w R ) is determined by a pair of (\u03d5 * , \u03d5 * R ): This implies that individual's ability threshold for education \u03b8 c (given in (4.1)) can be also expressed in terms of \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R instead of w L and w R ."}, {"section_title": "Equilibrium Analysis", "text": "In order to analyze how the economy works, I first present a simpler version of equilibrium conditions. Two things are critical in this simplification. The first is the fact that the aggregate firm economic activity can be summarized by the activity of the average firm. To see this, define the conditional densities of firm productivity in the group of p-firms and pr-firms: Then the average productivity for p-firms, denoted by \u03d5 * , and the average productivity for pr-firms, denoted by \u03d5 * R , are given by It is immediate to see that the average productivity of p-firms decreases in \u03d5 * , and the average productivity of pr-firms decreases in \u03d5 * R . The second thing that helps to simplify equilibrium conditions is the relation between (\u03d5 * , \u03d5 * R ) and (w L , w R ) as stated in Lemma 1. If \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R are determined, the firm thresholds will directly determine w L , w R as well as the individual ability threshold \u03b8 c . We now need to consider only three equilibrium conditions: the market clearing condition for labor services (E3), the market clearing condition for research services (E4), and the freeentry condition (E6). 3 Moreover, we can go further to eliminate M e by dividing the LHS and RHS of the equation (E3) by the corresponding LHS and RHS of the equation (E4). Proposition 1 states that an equilibrium can be characterized by solving two equations for \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R .

First note that \u03d5 * R decreases the relative demand for R (the LHS of (MC)) while increasing the relative supply of R (the RHS of (MC)). The relative demand for R decreases because fewer firms engage in R&D investment, and the relative supply of R increases the higher w R by Lemma 1. Similarly, \u03d5 * moves the relative demand and supply of R in an opposite way. That is, \u03d5 * increases the relative demand for R, while decreasing the relative supply of R. Therefore, if either one of \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R increases, the other should decrease the meet the equality given in (MC). By As the higher level of f decreases the demand for labor services and makes being active less attractive, fewer firms become p-firm, so that \u03d5 * increases. The change in \u03d5 * R is ambiguous because the higher f also lowers expected profits of pr-firms, but the increased f also encourages firms to engage in R&D investment. If the fixed cost of doing R&D, f R , increases, the only change made is that (MC) is shifted upwards. As a result, first \u03d5 * R increases because the more expensive R&D costs discourages firms from becoming pr-firms. Second, \u03d5 * decreases because p firms should fill the room remaining from the exit pr-firms and to satisfy the free-entry condition. Next, consider an increase in f e . The higher f e means that there should be more profitability from becoming p-firms or pr-firms, which in turn implies that a lower level of either \u03d5 * or \u03d5 * R . On the other hand, the higher f e leads to a higher demand for labor services, resulting in more expensive price of the labor services. This creates more incentives for firms to become pr-firms rather than p firms, meaning an decrease in \u03d5 * R and an increase in \u03d5 * . \u03d5 * R always decreases with the increased f e , while \u03d5 * may increase or decrease. Now consider in increase in \u03c3. A higher level of \u03c3 implies that there is more demand for the labor services as the coefficient associated with labor services in the production technology is \u03c3. Therefore, it results in a larger price of labor services, which would result in more firms to become pr-firms and fewer firms to become p-firms, so that \u03d5 * increases and \u03d5 * R decreases. What happens if \u03b2 increases, the level of increase in the productivity due to R&D? As shown in (FE) and (MC), the effect of \u03b2 is similar to the effect of f on firm thresholds, so that \u03d5 * increases but the change in \u03d5 * R is ambiguous. Changes in supply side also matter for equilibrium outcomes. It is easily to imagine that a lower level of education cost T , or relatively either rich good endowment or talent endowment, will increase the relative supply of research service (RHS of (MC)), so that it shifts (MC) downwards, so that \u03d5 * increases and \u03d5 * R decreases. The following proposition summarizes the comparative statistics results. "}, {"section_title": "Policy Analysis", "text": "Suppose that a government cannot eliminate credit-constraints. Consider a tuition-subsidy policy that is financed by a lump-sum taxation rate \u03c4 . Education costs T are subsidized by the government so that the effective costs are now T \u2212 s. Given the size of subsidy s and the mass of educated individuals, \u03c4 is determined such that the government's budget is balanced. As expected, increases in subsidy s encourage more individuals to attain education and become researchers. With the lump-sum tax that is in terms of the consumption good, the government budget's balance condition leads the tax or subsidy-related aggregates to cancel each other out at the RHS of (4.10). Then the subsidy s only affects the RHS of (MC), while (FE) remains untouched. As a result, the relative supply of research services increases, which subsequently shifts (MC) downwards in One can imagine that any policy that relaxes the credit-constraints so that individuals are encouraged to attain more education would have similar results. Here I compare several cases: the default case in which borrowing is not possible and a subsidy is not available (\"default\"), future income can be used to finance education (\"future income\"), borrowing and lending are allowed at fixed interest rate r (\"borrowing\"), and the full-subsidy policy where s = T (\"full subsidy\"). For each of those policies, the condition of educational attainment is given in Table 4.1.  Note that for all cases, the only changes that arise are for the RHS of (MC) since the firm side remains intact from the policy changes. In order to determine how much change each policy causes relative to default case, we compare the mass of individuals pursuing education, given w L and w R . From Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2, it is clear to see that the \"full subsidy\" case leads to the largest mass, followed by the \"future income\" use case, \"borrowing\" case. It is not surprising that the \"full subsidy\" policy promotes the largest mass of individuals since only the policy involves the transfer from the endowment from rich and less-talented individuals to poor and more-talented individuals."}, {"section_title": "Proposition 5", "text": "The \"Full subsidy\" policy is more effective than the \"future income\" and \"borrowing\" policies at increasing the mass of educated individuals."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this dissertation, I have considered a general equilibrium model that can be used to show how a policy relaxing supply-side market friction penetrates equilibrium objects, the composition of R&D firms.

Suppose all individuals and firms foresee that R e = R low then the gain from R&D investment P (R e )\u03b2 is also expected to be low. Languid demand for research services results in a low wage rate, which in turn discourages individuals from becoming researchers. As a result, the realized aggregate supply of research services ends up coinciding with R e = R low . A similar flow applies to the case of R e = R high .

For instance, consider individuals who report having enrolled in SED during 1995 and 2000. During the B&B 93/97 and B&B 93/03 surveys, she should report having enrolled in SED; however, the reported information may not be consistent. In such inconsistent cases, I consider the latest information so that the data are constructed relying on B&B 93/03. Second, in practice, it is possible that an individual may have enrolled in more than one graduate program. For instance, an individual may enroll in SEM in the life sciences during 1993-1994, and then enroll in medical school from 1995-1999. It follows that B&B 93/94 includes information on enrollment in SEM, whereas B&B 93/03 has information on enrollment in PRO.

In the simulation of an individual's enrollment duration, I use average duration as the mean parameter of Poisson distribution for those whose highest level of graduate program enrolled in and completed are the same as the individual who is missing a year. The missing information regarding either the starting or ending year is filled in from the equation simulated Duration = End year \u2212 Starting year +1. 6. Construction of the highest level of graduate program enrolled in (S 3 t ) and the highest degree earned (S 4 t ): From the information on the starting and ending years of graduate-school enrollment, as well as the completion status of the relevant program, I construct S 3 t and S 4 t . For instance, if an individual enrolls in SED from 1994-1999, S 3 t = 0 for t < 1994, and S 3 t = SED for 1994 \u2264 t \u2264 2003.

Construction of the total years of graduate-school enrollment (S 2 t ): (i) I first check whether an individual has enrolled in a graduate program during the years 1993-2003. B&B 93/03 asks whether graduate students have continuously enrolled in graduate programs (B3GRCN1,B3GRCN2). If individuals report having continuously enrolled in their graduate programs, I assume that they decided to enroll in the graduate programs for the years between the starting and end years of enrollment. (ii) Next, I consider those who have not continuously enrolled in their graduate programs for that period, as well as those who have graduate-education experience not reported in B&B 93/03 but in B&B 93/94 or B&B 93/97. In this case I need to consider individuals' yearly enrollment decisions from 1993-2003. For the years 1993-2007, individuals' enrollment decisions can be recovered from the variables in B&B 93-03, which provides information about whether individuals had part-time or full-time enrollment from April 1993 through April 1997 (B2EN9304-B2EN9704). 6 For the years 1998-2003, as I do not have information on yearly enrollment choices, I simulate the choices. The simulation utilizes some of the information from 1993-1997. Specifically, I calculate the average probability of enrollees in graduate program g enrolling in the year of t conditional on their enrollment and employment status in year of t \u2212 1. Such probabilities are obtained for each of the categories, which are based on individuals' highest level of graduate programs enrolled in and completed (mygroup), as follows: Then, I simulate individuals' enrollment status from 1997-2003 under the assumption that their decisions at t follow binomial distributions and the relevant average equals the average probability of those who belong to the mygroup category and who show the same enrollment and employment pattern in the previous year t \u2212 1.

Construction of the total year of employment (S 1 t ): The method I use for constructing S 1 t , the total years of employment is very similar to the method I use for constructing S 2 t , the total years of enrollment. For the years 1993-1997, I use the employment status variables from April 1993 through April 1997 (B2EM9304-B2EM9704). For the years 1999-2003, the default method for determining variables is to simulate individuals' employment decisions at t based on employment status at t \u2212 1 for each of mygroup category. But for those who never enrolled in a graduate program from 1997-2003, if they also have no years of unemployment, I assume that they participated in the labor market every year from 1997-2003. 7 Finally, based on the employment decision variables, I construct S 1 t , the total years of employment.     ) 2 ), time variables (Y R t = t \u2212 1992), dummy variables indicating whether one achieves the degree in graduate program g with g \u2208 {SEM, SED, NSE, and PRO }, and ability proxies.

The constant 5 is added to take into account true parameters whose values are nearly zero. Parameter identifiers are on the horizontal axis. The dots connected by real lines (param1_diff ) are the result for sample size of 500, the dots connected by long-dashed lines (param2_diff ) for sample size of 350, and the dots connected by long-dashed lines (param3_diff ) for sample size of 150. Overall, we can see that the estimator with sample size of 500 outdo the other estimators with smaller sample sizes. The improvement is not uniform across parameters though: for some parameters, the estimator with sample size of 150 outdoes the estimator with sample size 500, and for some parameters. Similar interpretation can apply to B.4b. Now the vertical values are percentage differences between (pseudo-) data moments and predicted moments ((m 0 j \u2212 m e j )/(m 0 j + 5) \u00d7 100, where m 0 j denotes the jth data moment and m 0 j denotes the jth predicted moment). The constant 5 is added to take into account (pseudo) moments whose values are nearly zero. Moment identifiers are on the horizontal axis. The dots connected by real lines (mmt1_diff ) are the result for sample size of 500, the dots connected by long-dashed lines (mmt2_diff ) for sample size of 350, and the dots connected by long-dashed lines (mmt3_diff ) for sample size of 150. For 10th moment, the estimator with sample size 500 is inferior to other estimators. However, for other moments, the estimator of the largest sample size performs much better compared to the other estimators with smaller sample sizes. The presented results are the case without weighting matrix. I also conduct the experiment with a weighting matrix. The conclusion that estimators with large sample sizes appear to identify the parameters better also applies for the cases with a weighting matrix. Figure B.5 corresponds to Figure B.4. Such convergence patterns are much clearer when we compare the mean and standard deviation values, which are contained in Table  B.14. As shown in Figure B.2 and Figure B.3, estimators with the weighting matrix do not appear to outdo the unweighted estimators. At the sample size of 500, the statistics related to distance between true parameters and estimated parameters are similar: the mean is 19.22 for the unweighted case, and 20.98 for the weighted case, and the standard deviation is 24.78 for the unweighted case, and 24.31 for the weighted case. For the results from experiments with smaller sample sizes, using weighted matrix does not appear to outdo the unweighted estimators. However, for such cases with small sample sizes, using a weighting matrix is better than now using it since the average and standard deviations for the percentage differences in moments (mmt2_diff and mmt3_diff ) are both lower for the weighted cases (45-47 for the means, 39-51 for the standard deviations), relative to the unweighted cases (61-71 for the means, and 61-149 for the standard deviations). This is not surprising because the introduction of weighting matrix would adjust parameters that are more critical in matching predicted moments with data moments."}, {"section_title": "B.4.3 Weighting matrix and standard errors", "text": "I consider 48 moments to estimate 31 parameters. Weights are considered only for the moments other than regression-based moments (those moments of no.1 -no.20 in Table  B.3). The weighting matrix considered is the inverse of covariance-variance matrix of data moments. In The same type of weighting matrix is considered when the identifiability of selected moments is investigated by a Monte Carlo experiment. To get standard errors of the second-step estimates, I calculate the square root of matrix (1 + 1/N S )(\u2206 W\u2206), where N S denotes the number of simulations, and \u2206 is the (numerical) derivate of the moment vector with respect to the parameter vector."}, {"section_title": "B.4.4 Programming issues", "text": "PIKAIA is used for estimating the second-step estimates. PIKAIA is a FORTRAN-77 subroutine for optimization based on a genetic algorithm. It is publicly available from the ftp archive of the High Altitude Observatory (HAO). 7 To enhance the computing speed, I use the MPI version of PIKAIA, which is also a public domain software. 8 Genetic algorithms are useful when the optimization problem of interest may have multiple local solutions or its derivatives are not of closed form, such as the dynamic programming problem of this paper. PIKAIA is considered in particular because it is publicly available and is written in FORTRAN language as well as its MPI-version is also available. PIKAIA maximizes the function value provided by the user. Since the second-step estimators minimize the distance between predicted moments and data moments, I calculate a sum of moment-specific distances, say, ff, and let PIKAIA to maximize -ff. To generate the predicted moments, I simulate individual decisions over th period from 1994 through 2003. The number of simulated individuals range from 400 to 950. The first 50 draws are dropped and not counted in the calculation of the optimizing function value ff. The seeds for random numbers are all controlled at the beginning of estimation procedure. The termination criterion of PIKAIA is not through comparing between the goodness of fit and some preset value, but through setting the number of generation. 9 In practice, the population size ranges between 100 (default) and 200, and the number of generation ranges between between 1000 (default) and 1500. If the program set-up is given, running time is expected in advance. Under the implementation of 4 nodes of MPI, and with the number of parameters, simulations, population, and generation set as 29, 350, 100, and 1000, respectively, PIKAIA takes approximately 40 hours to get the solution. Finally, the initial ranges of the second-step estimates are reported in Table B.15.      Figure B.4.      where \u03c0 active denotes the average profit of active firms (p-or pr-firms) and (1 \u2212 G (\u03d5 * )) indicates the chance of being active. By definition, \u03c0 active is given by"}, {"section_title": "B.4.5 Figures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proof. First,", "text": "average profit of p-firms where the last inequality follows from Lemma 4. We proceed to have where the second equality comes from (C.3), and the third equality comes from the definition of \u03d5 * . Similarly, where the second equality again comes from (C.3), and the third equality comes from the definition of \u03d5 * R . Then, the free entry condition leads to when we divide (C.5) by w L and utilizing w R w L f R = (\u03b2 \u2212 1) f \u03d5 * R \u03d5 * , then the desired equation (MC) follows. Next consider the derivation of (MC). The market clearing condition for R is given by The aggregate demand for L is given by where the second-last inequality utilizes similar tricks used in (C.3) and (C.4), and the last equality comes from Combining this expression of aggregate demand for L with the aggregate demand for R, we have equation (MC). The relative market clearing condition and free-entry condition are equations consisting of only \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R . If we get \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R that solve (MC) and (FE), the rest of equilibrium objects would follow. That is, Lemma 1 pins down the prices of L and R, which in turn determines \u03b8 c by (4.1); and finally, the mass of entry firms, M e , will be obtained from the 119 market clearing condition for L or R. Lemma 2 Proof. Let us first define A F E and B F E as the first and second part on the RHS of (FE): where the last inequality uses where the last equality again uses The FE equation is now given by As \u03d5 * increases, the right-hand of (FE') decreases. To make the equality to hold, \u03d5 * R should decrease. Therefore, (FE) implies a negative relation between \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R ."}, {"section_title": "Lemma 3 Proof.", "text": "The left-hand side of (MC) is given by where Q (\u03d5 * , \u03d5 * R ) \u2261 f e + f (\u03c3\u22121)  where the last inequality comes from \u221e (1 \u2212 G (\u03d5)) d\u03d5 > 0. On the other hand, it is clear to see that the LHS M C increases in \u03d5 * . Next, consider the right-hand side of (MC), which is denoted by RHS M C . By Lemma 1, Moreover, the partial derivatives of \u03b8 c = w L +T w R with respect to \u03d5 * and \u03d5 * R are given by For instance, suppose that f increases. This lowers the LHS of (FE). Then, for each value of \u03d5 * , a greater value of \u03d5 * R should be matched for the equation (FE) to hold. Consequently, when f increases, the (FE) curve of Figure 4.1 is shifted upwards. To understand the effect of a greater value of f on (MC), first note that, given \u03d5 * , the LHS of (MC) decreases in \u03d5 * R , while the RHS of (MC) increases in \u03d5 * . In such a graph for \u03d5 * R (given \u03d5 * ), a decrease in f shifts down the LHS of (MC). Then a smaller value of \u03d5 * R should be assigned for each \u03d5 * for the equation (MC) to hold. The (MC) curve in Figure 4.1 is shifted down as a result. Combining the previous result related to the (FE) curve in Figure 4.1, this implies that \u03d5 * increases, while \u03d5 * R may either increase or decrease. The remaining statements (cii)-(cvii) can be proved similarly. Proposition 4 Proof. First note that the lump-sum tax \u03c4 appears neither in the equation (MC) or (FE). The tuition subsidy s, on the other hand, influences the RHS of (MC) when the effective costs of education decrease from T to T \u2212 s. This in turn decreases the RHS of (MC). It follows that a lower value of \u03d5 * R should be assigned for each value of \u03d5 * in order for the (MC) equation to hold. This means that the (MC) curve is shifted down in Figure 4.1, so that, as a result, \u03d5 * increases and \u03d5 * R decreases. By Lemma 1 this increases w L and decreases w R . The effect of s on the threshold of individual ability is ambiguous. \u03b8 c = w L +(T \u2212s) w R decreases as s increases (partial equilibrium effect), while \u03b8 c increases from the changes in input prices w L ad w R (general equilibrium effect). Depending on which of theses effects dominates, \u03b8 c can increase or decrease. To see why the effect of tuition subsidy on the mass of entering firms M e is ambiguous, note that M e is the ratio of the aggregate supply of L (R) to the individual firm's demand for L (R). Since we cannot pin down the change in the aggregate supply of L or R, the effect of tuition subsidy on the mass of entering firms is ambiguous."}]
