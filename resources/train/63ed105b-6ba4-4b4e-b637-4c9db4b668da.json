It is this dialogue that precipitates significant mathematical ideas and makes this discourse foundational to meaningful insights for both students and teachers (Thompson & Thompson, 1996) .

The desired outcome is communicating to learn mathematics rather than learning to communicate mathematically."}, {"section_title": "Classroom Questioning", "text": "Researchers have attempted to examine how student-teacher talk was related to student learning. For instance, Buggey (1971) and Aagard (1973) found that students exposed to a larger number of higher order questions performed better on an outcome measure than students exposed to fewer higher order questions. However, the Stanford Program on Teaching Effectiveness (Gage, 1976) found that students exposed to a greater quantity of higher order questions underperformed their counterparts. Ryan (1974) and Winne (1979) found no measurable effect between students experiencing a greater quantity of higher order questions as opposed to fewer higher order questions. The various methodologies employed in these studies lacked the necessary power to yield a unified theory. However, a meta-analysis of 20 articles on teacher questioning revealed a standardized effect of 0.72 in favor of students whose teachers asked higher order questions over students of teachers who did not use higher order questions (Redfield & Rousseau, 1981) .\nIn application, the purpose of teacher questioning has been to evaluate what students knew (Dillon, 1988) , but as sociolinguistic findings have begun to influence the field of education, research interest on effective questioning has grown (Bellack, Herbert, Hyman, & Smith, 1966; Carlsen, 1991; Cazden, 1988) . Effective questioning consists of question combinations intended to probe or evaluate what students know about the topic (Dillon, 1988; Graesser & Person, 1994; Winne, 1979) , guide toward specific understandings (van Zee & Minstrell, 380 Journal of Advanced Academics CLASSROOM CONVERSATIONS 1997), elicit discussion, or check progress of the lesson (Gall, 1984; Mehan, 1985; Stevens, 1912) ."}, {"section_title": "Classroom Discourse and Questioning", "text": "Persistent questions by both teacher and student can help facilitate the development of mathematical understanding in students (Kazemi, 1998; Knuth & Peressini, 2001; Martino & Maher, 1999 ; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 1996) . Research on classroom discourse often cites the NCTM (1991) teaching standards recommendation that mathematics teachers initiate and \"orchestrate discourse by posing questions that elicit, engage, and challenge students' thinking,\" by \"listening carefully to students' ideas,\" and by \"asking students to clarify and justify their ideas orally and in writing\" (p. 35). More recently, NCTM (2000) recommended that teachers encourage and enable students to \"communicate their mathematical thinking coherently and clearly to peers, teachers, and others\" and that students need to learn \"what is acceptable as evidence in mathematics\" (p. 60). Teacher questioning remains an important means to achieving this standard for students (Mason, 2000) . Classroom discourse, properly managed, allows students to concentrate on sense making and reasoning; it allows teachers to reflect on students' understanding and to stimulate mathematical thinking.\nTeachers can stimulate students' growth of mathematical knowledge through the ways they ask and respond to questions. One method of stimulation is asking open-ended questions that are designed to initiate problem solving and aid conceptual understanding (Martino & Maher, 1999) . By accepting correct answers and issuing a series of related questions or by providing evaluative or neutral comments to incorrect answers followed by a rewording of the original question, Chin (2006) found that teachers \"further elicited student responses, stimulated productive thinking, and extended lines of conceptual thought in students\" (p. 1326). Teachers' questions can serve to scaffold students' thinking and lead students toward conceptual Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro understanding through teacher-student discourse (Chin, 2006) . For example, Japanese teachers, more than U.S. teachers, often orchestrate the kind of discourse that is advocated in reform documents and ask \"more describe/explain questions, and fewer yes/no questions\" (Stigler, Gonzales, Kawanaka, Knoll, & Serrano, 1998, p. 123) ."}, {"section_title": "Student Questioning", "text": "Classroom teachers in the United States find it difficult to provide a classroom environment rich with question-posing while ensuring the required curriculum is presented. Students have questions. So why, when classrooms are observed, do researchers not find students asking these questions (Nathan & Knuth, 2006) ? One explanation may be that teachers do most of the talking in classrooms (Cazden, 1988; Stigler et al., 1998) . Hervey (2006) proposed that because teachers ask most of the questions and do not encourage students to ask their questions, students are likely to refrain from questioning.\nResearchers have shown that the questions students ask illustrate their focus on the content of the material (Palinscar & Brown, 1984; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991) . When students pose questions, they are thinking about their thinking. These metacognitive strategies can help students learn to take control of their own learning by self-defining learning goals and self-monitoring progress in achieving those goals (Donovan & Bransford, 2005) . Martinello (1998) suggested that many children do not know how to effectively pose questions without explicit instruction in asking questions. A review of intervention studies found that teaching students to generate questions improved their comprehension of material they had read, which led to gains in comprehension as measured on written tests (Rosenshine, Meister, & Chapman, 1996) . Additionally, King (1994) and Lampert (1990) found that when students were encouraged to ask questions, they were able to generate links among thoughts within the content of the lesson and connect those links to their prior knowledge. Additionally, students who posed questions were more flexible with the content and demonstrated greater comprehension."}, {"section_title": "Responses to Student-Initiated Questions", "text": "In every lesson, teachers make discursive decisions spontaneously as they lead discussions and convey content knowledge (Hayes, 1999) . For example, teachers wrestle with what to say next to connect prior knowledge to the material at hand. These spontaneous moments cannot be planned and often occur at inopportune moments. When students ask questions or make comments (provide a glimpse of their incremental conceptions), a process is triggered that challenges the teacher to quickly consider the following and respond: (a) assess student thinking, (b) formulate a plan, and (c) engage or dismiss the comment. The assessment process happens nearly instantaneously and simultaneously with plan formation. Depending on various real-life teaching demands, the teacher either engages the student by creating an opportunity for discourse, by asking a question(s), by reteaching, or in some cases by avoiding the question (King, 1991) . These spontaneous and frequent decisions have an impact on the quality and direction of classroom discourse."}, {"section_title": "Examining Discourse", "text": "Previous studies have examined discourse in terms of utterances within small discrete time periods. These small time periods and isolated utterances allowed for the counting of words and phrases but rarely include sentences or entire discourse segments (cf. Cazden, 1988; Kazemi, 1998; Knuth & Peressini, 2001; Martino & Maher, 1999; Mehan, 1985; Winne, 1979) . In the early 1990s, studies examined questioning as a structure for eliciting discourse as opposed to counting questions based on taxonomies, such as Bloom's taxonomy. Researchers examined the function of open-ended questions for provoking discussion, facilitating learning, and gaining insight into children's thinking (Ralph, 1999a (Ralph, , 1999b Stenmark, 1991) .\nTeachers can use openended questions to cue students, to improve on weak responses, to develop a discussion atmosphere, or to foster curiosity and inquiry.\nTherefore, it is important to understand the influence of dialogic interactions in actual classroom settings as teachers and students explore new content. Thus, this study examined the nature of classroom discourse related to teaching and learning. Specifically, we examined how the dialogue, student-student or teacher-student, resulted in changes to a questioning and question-explanation framework."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data for this study were 3 years of classroom video . All middle school mathematics teachers (grades 6-8) from 5 school districts participated (for more information, see Nelson, Kulm, & Manon, 2000) . Each participant was scheduled to be videotaped four times per year. However, due to illness and professional commitments, substitutes taught some of the target lessons, resulting in fewer recorded lessons. Thus, there were three or four videos per participant. The lessons' topics were selected by the research team to match the scope and sequence for the districts. The lessons were taught throughout the year, but the lesson objectives were identical. The lessons revolved around (a) symbolic equations used to summarize how a quantity of something changes over time or in response to other changes; (b) equivalent forms of integers, fractions, decimals, and percents to interpret and compare numbers; and (c) measures of central tendency. The researchers conducted a one-week summer in-service to train participants in the discourse strategies under investigation. The training focused on viewing classroom videos and notating and commenting on the questions asked and answered by participants in the videos. As part of the training, teachers were encouraged to differentiate among question types (e.g., probing, guiding) to encourage them to become more aware of the different types of questions and the advantages these types of questions can have on the development of active learning by students (Sahin, 2007) . Probing questions are defined as questions that encourage students to express their knowledge or understanding and to clarify, justify, interpret, or represent their knowledge or understanding (Martino & Maher, 1999) . Guiding questions are classified as questions that are related to experiences or learning with realworld examples or representations by guiding students to interpret and reason about experiences or learning with real-world examples or representations. They generally provide hints or suggestions to help students to interpret and reason (Kawanaka & Stigler, 1999) .\nThe allotted time for mathematics instruction was either 60 or 90 minutes; however, engaged time rarely exceeded 50 minutes regardless of allocated time. Engaged time for this study was time used to address the identified objectives; therefore, checking homework, reviewing prerequisite knowledge, doing silent seatwork, working on that evening's homework, and making announcements were among the activities not counted as engaged time. The mean engaged time was 42 minutes (SD = 15.23), the range was 10 to 72 minutes, and the mode was 46 minutes. For this study, almost 8,700 minutes of mathematics instruction were analyzed. The students in these classes represent 5 different school districts spanning rural, urban, and suburban communities. All districts were diverse with at least 55% to as much as 70% minority enrollment. The methodology for this study closely parallels that of Stigler et al. (1998) , in which they examined classroom videotapes from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, now known as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. The major difference was that those researchers used a random sampling of the videos available; however, like our work, they carefully selected the content, the criteria, and time period for coding enactments. The present research explored whether a rich, meaningful dis- Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro course might stem from \"more describe/explain questions, and fewer yes/no questions\" (Stigler et al., p. 123 ). The following questions are similar to the describe/explain questions discussed in Stigler et al.: \"How could we figure out how many rhombuses we would need to make the figure we just made with triangles?\" \"How did you know?\" and \"Describe how to convert from a fraction to a percent. How can we prove they are equivalent?\""}, {"section_title": "Coding", "text": "Coder training. Ten individuals were trained to identify interactive classroom discussions. Each video was chunked by a four-member subset of the 10 trained individuals. Chunking is segmenting a video into manageable units of data for analysis based on the criteria for discursive interactions. For purposes of this study, we only analyzed information chunked for interactive discussion and questioning. To ensure reliability, training included chunking and time-coding teachers across time (i.e., a teacher who participated all 3 years), across grade and content (algebra, number, and/or data objectives) and across curricula (i.e., MathThematics, 1999; Mathematics: Applications and Connection, 1999; and Connected Mathematics Project, 1998) . Agreement among coders had to reach the 95% threshold before coders were authorized to chunk and time code on their own. Agreement was determined by meeting three criteria: (a) questions and discussions were all identified, (b) time codes matched within 20 seconds for each instance (i.e., for every question or discussion that was coded, the identified time period matched within 20 seconds), and (c) particular questions or discussions were captured by the coder. The 20-second window was selected to allow for contextualization of the specific observation. This window allowed researchers to disagree about the exact moment the instance started but sufficient time to ensure the coders were certain about who initiated the interaction, were able to ascertain the relevance of the interaction to the content, and were able to ensure that the instance was not carry over from the immediately preceding interaction.\nVideos were assigned so that at least four different coders examined each video. The coders did not know who was also assigned the same videos because they worked individually. When they submitted their chunked and time-coded results, discrepancies were noted. When any coder deviated more than 10% from the other coders, the particular coder was retrained. However, final decisions about chunking discrepancies were judged by the primary researcher. To control coder change over time, groups of coders were not fixed, but variable, ensuring that individuals remained consistent to the initial training and that no group variation crept into the coding process. This resulted in 210 single-spaced pages of time codes and transcriptions. The entire research team reviewed each transcription by time code for final analysis. The time codes were organized into categories in an attempt to formulate conclusions about what leads to rich mathematics discourse. Each research team member organized each transcribed chunk into meta-categories. It was the content of these chunks that contributed to the organization of the chart and individual chunks, rather than linkages across chunks that demonstrated the pattern in responses that emerged. These meta-categories were then reviewed and named for the processes common to each meta-category. Because time was continuous within lessons, chunks were able to be sorted and resorted for meaning and finally identifiable patterns. Those patterns were then depicted in graphical form.\nA grounded theory approach was utilized throughout the analysis of the data (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1990) to develop a mapping and theory explaining teacher and student questioning and the interactions originating from these questions. Grounded theory, as an inductive approach to analyzing the data, was used so the researchers could avoid any preconceived explanations for and about student and teacher questioning and the connections between emerging categories. All of these student-teacher interactions were analyzed by five researchers who were interested in the paths followed by the classroom communications. Separate paths were assigned depending on whether the interaction was initiated by the Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro teacher or the student. Categories and pathways were refined through constant comparison of data to the emergent categories and pathways. Goetz and LeCompte (1981) noted, \"As events are constantly compared with previous events, new topological dimension, as well as new relationships, may be discovered\" (p. 58). These paths included (a) where the communication started, (b) how it progressed, (c) how discourse initiated, and (d) how it ended. Unlike previous researchers, this team did not attempt to judge the quality or quantity of the interactions, nor did it presuppose paths that would occur. Rather, the observed paths organized the emergent question types and were graphically displayed in a map based on the initial framework."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "The coding process afforded several insights that, while not conclusive or definitive, led to some assumptions about the efficacy of the coding training and implementation. For instance, once the first year's coding was established, the map was relatively fixed. While some basic refinement occurred and occasionally a new path emerged, in general, teacher questioning changed little over time and the frequency of the paths remained stable in subsequent years.\nThe categories were organized into a map that emerged from the analysis of communication paths between the teacher and students showing that rich mathematics discourse can occur in many ways (see Figure 1 , Table 1, and Table 2 ). The Dynamic Student-Teacher Communications Pathways (DSTCP) map illustrated that rich mathematics discourse began with either the student or the teacher and could begin with a variety of questioning techniques and was not limited to higher order question prompts.\nA questioning interaction was classified as teacher-generated or student-generated according to who asked the initial question that began the conversation. Both teachers and students utilized \"cloze\" or \"cloze-type\" questions-fill-in-the-blank questions or Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro questions for which a limited set of specific and correct answers will suffice (Pimm, 1987) . This category of questions is borrowed from the literature on reading comprehension and language development (cf. Bellon-Harn, Hoffman, & Harn, 2004 ). An example of this type of question is \"The definition of a fraction is [pause]\" where an acceptable answer of \"part of a whole\" would be provided by the student(s). Questions that also were categorized as cloze or cloze-type questions were those that were lower Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro level, factual questions that also required a limited number of correct or acceptable responses such as, \"What was the answer to number two?\" These were labeled as A, for teacher questions, and A 1 , for student questions. In our study, these cloze or clozetype questions never led to rich discussions. When asked by the teacher, this type of question usually started with \"what,\" and to a lesser degree, \"why\" or \"how.\" Generally \"what\" questions could be answered with one or two words in a convergent setting so we coded these as cloze questions on the map. Less often, teachers used \"why\" and \"how\" questions that were either rhetorical or were answered by the teacher. For example, \"How do we add two fractions with unlike denominators?\" and then the teacher starts the lesson, or \"Why did you add those two numbers?\" and then the teacher answers the question. In other studies (Hiebert & Wearne, 1993; Klinzing, Klinzing-Eurich, & Tisher, 1985) , these questions would have been classified as higher order process questions. When in actual usage, those questions were neither higher order nor related to a process. This is in contrast to \"why\" or \"how\" questions for which teachers provided wait time and encouraged answers that reflected higher order process skills. Therefore, in our decision process, rather than classifying a question based only on the interrogative word, student responses also were used to decide if a question was a cloze question or not."}, {"section_title": "Teacher-Initiated Questions", "text": "With \"A\" questions, the teacher seemingly had a single response that he or she was trying to elicit. These cases were typically characterized by the teacher calling on one student after another until the predetermined answer was given. It is important to note that at times divergent answers were passed over to finally arrive at an expected response. In a few instances, the teacher asked the question in another way to the same student in hopes of getting the predetermined answer. Questions such as, \"What operation do we use?\" \"How many sheep would I want here?\" \"What is this graph called?\" \"How would I represent that as a decimal?\" and \"How would I change it to a percent?\" were typical for this code. These last two examples illustrated times when questions were used to elicit choral process skill responses such as, \"move the decimal place two places when converting between decimal and percent.\"\nWhen teachers asked procedural questions and then asked follow-up questions to a student's response, the path was labeled with a B 1 or B 2 according to the amount of additional inquisition. Teachers who initiated a series of repeated cloze questions were seemingly responding to a student's inability to explain his or her reasoning or to articulate difficulty in either understanding or answering the question. An example of a B 1 question was the teacher asking a series of cloze questions (mainly \"how\" prompts). This questioning exemplified classroom discourse in which the teacher asked questions not to ascertain whether students gained conceptual understanding but merely to make sure students were able to verbalize procedural steps for solving the problem. Another type of questioning sequence that earned a B 1 code was when the teacher asked a series of questions leading to an affirmation that students were on the right track. This sequence contains a rhetorical question with the teacher answering her own question with a question. In addition, the teacher went from student to student until she found a student who had the \"prescribed answer.\" She did not appear to be interested in understanding the answer given by Laura. She wanted someone to give the answer, \"add it up.\" When that answer was verbalized, the discourse on this topic was over. From the conversation we are somewhat certain that David knows to \"add it up,\" but the teacher has not ascertained what the other students know. Therefore, this B 1 question on the map led to a G 1 (i.e., the teacher moves on without knowing if the students understand). If the teacher asked probing questions during classroom discourse, the interaction received a label of C 1 . A series of probing questions was defined by the research team to mean a cohesive series of questions that further investigated a student's understanding of a concept or process by utilizing student-generated ideas about the concept or process. The label C 2 was used for guiding questions. A series of guiding questions were a series of related and sequential questions that guided a student's understanding of a concept or process. On several occasions, a teacher would alternate between C 1 and C 2, and when this occurred, the interaction was given the designation C 3 .\nThe following series of interactions exemplify each of the C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 labels. The first interaction shows a teacher asking a series of probing questions. This interaction was coded as a C 1 . Notice the ways the teacher further investigated student understanding of the problem using the student's previous responses. The next interaction shows a teacher utilizing a series of guiding questions to lead a student to a deeper understanding of the mathematical ideas being taught. This interaction was coded as C 2 . The teacher transitioned from understanding how the components of the formula function to having students work on representing the equation using symbols and numbers.\nThe next set of interactions shows a teacher's use of a series of related questions to sometimes guide and probe for understanding. In these interactions, there was some evidence that the student was beginning to show understanding, and therefore, required a coding beyond just C 3 . The labels E 1 , E 2 , and E 3 were used to indicate that these probing or guiding interactions led to evidence that the student was beginning to show understanding depending on the type of question: probing or guiding. In the interactions below, the teacher probes the class and individual students with questions about their understanding of tabular numbers about cats. When necessary, the teacher guides individuals with specific questions intended to help the students understand the This sequence demonstrated a set of probing and guiding questions where the teacher moved between probing what students knew and then guiding them to answers as the discussion proceeded and included several students. Teachers who initiated more open-ended questioning techniques were able to engage students with probing and guiding discourse that allowed students to validate or broaden their understanding of the question(s) being answered. Also, teachers who used multiple questioning techniques, such as openended and cloze questions, appeared to promote students' initial understanding.\nDeciding when students demonstrated understanding was difficult to determine from extant video. Two of the issues in determining student understanding were that many of the analyzed segments seemed to provide for prolonged interaction when compared to other segments and there was a diversity of interpretations of student verbal responses. Three indicators were used to judge student understanding: (a) they engaged in successively more revealing questions; (b) they offered more than comments such as, \"I understand\" or \"okay\" to terminate the sequence; and (c) they summarized or generalized the idea back to the teacher without teacher prompting. Although students might acknowledge understanding after asking one question, this response was not necessarily indicative of understanding at any significant level; therefore, we opted for a more rigorous demonstration. We used E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , G 2 , and J designations to show which paths led to evidence of initial understanding. Interactions ending with a coding of E 1 , E 2 , or E 3 were generally long, taking 3-7 minutes to complete, and some were interrupted with other students asking questions. Typically, the ending of an interaction was similar to the following: "}, {"section_title": "Student-Initiated Questions", "text": "Students also initiated questions that were cloze in nature. With A 1 questions, the students asked a \"what\" question in which the student-teacher discussion also did not lead to rich discussion or deeper interactions. The interaction was initiated by the student, but the response by the teacher was limited and procedural in nature. In our study, there were no \"how\" or \"why\" prompts asked by the student or the teacher. For example, S: What does \"b\" mean? T: Oh, it means to make a table like this. S: Oh, okay. Do I have to write down all the answers and stuff? T: Yes, just like this. S: Okay. (videotaped dialogue, March, 19, 2003) Procedural questions initiated by the students received a label of H. The response of the teacher was used to distinguish between H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , and H 4 . If students asked the teacher why or how something happened or just stated that they did not understand the question and the teacher restated the students' statement without providing supplementation, a label of H 1 was coded. The following example illustrated an H 1 student-generated question and explanation:\nS: Where did we get \"lbs.\" to stand for pounds? T: I honestly do not know, but that is a good questiona good mathematician kind of question. It is not until the student began to engage in a series of cloze questions from the teacher that an H 3 label was coded. The following example illustrated a student-generated question with the teacher responding with a series of cloze questions: In general, only dialogue-terminating responses by the teacher in response to student-generated questions led to H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , or H 4 coding.\nThe teacher's response also was vital in encouraging or discouraging rich discussions. When students used \"why\" prompts such as, \"Why something happened,\" the teacher generally provided an explanation as can be seen in this example of the label I 1 . The following episode is within the context of simplifying fractions:\nT: Yes, Alyssa, you have your hand up? S: You said that 6 \u2044 9 gets smaller. I thought it gets bigger. T:\n12 \u2044 18, 6 \u2044 9? We went . . . S: 6 \u2044 9. T: Our unit went down. Our unit was 18 when we had our triangles. The pieces are getting bigger, but our unit overall is being reduced. S: Oh. T: Did everyone understand that? She was confused.\nShe said, \"Okay, I thought that when I divided it into"}, {"section_title": "401", "text": "Volume 19 \u2724 Number 3 \u2724 Spring 2008 Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro fewer pieces that it got bigger.\" Well, yes, the pieces are bigger, but I am talking about the overall unit here. We had 18 whole units, but then we divided it up. And then we went down to 9. Then we went down to 3. So we were still reducing it. But yes, our pieces did get larger, but our total unit went down. We went from 18. Then, we went down to 9. Then we went down to 3. (videotaped dialogue, October 8, 2002) If the teacher also used additional questions to check for student understanding, a label of I 2 was applied. If the researchers could tell from student responses captured on video that the student was beginning to understand, a label of J was used. The following example was labeled I 2 leading to J even though the initial student \"question\" was a statement: Persistent questioning originated from both teacher-generated and student-generated questions and led to a level of discourse perceived to be at a deeper conceptual mathematical level. Typically, verbalized persistent questioning emanated from the teacher, whereas students often used intonation to indicate their questions rather than explicitly asking questions. Even nonverbal questions often prompted the teacher to provide more indepth responses, deeper and more robust explanations, and more persistent inquiry into student understanding. When teachers engaged in persistent questioning, they often explored incomplete answers to queries. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Many researchers, teachers, and teacher education programs operate under the assumption that discourse benefits student learning; if students are talking about mathematics, they must be learning about mathematics. Although theoretical arguments for this assumption are strong and some research does exist to support this assumption, definitions of discourse should be clarified (Hiebert & Wearne, 1993) . For example, Brown and Kane (1988) found that students who verbally elaborated on an idea, with or without coaching, outperformed students who were provided an explanation of the idea. Theoretical arguments for the discourse-learning connection are based on social-constructivist and social-cognitive perspectives (Cobb, Yackel, & Wood, 1992; Hatano, 1988; Pimm, 1987) .\nBecause classroom discourse is frequently initiated by questions, a strong relationship between questioning and learning also may be frequently assumed. Martin and Pressley (1991) provided some support for this assumption. They found that when students were asked \"why\" questions, learning was enhanced even when students were not able to successfully answer. Although their findings are somewhat incongruous with the findings of this study, Good, Grouws, and Beckerman (1978) found a positive relationship between factual teacher questions and student achievement. As documented in our research study, although detailed mathematical interactions do not ensure quality mathematical learning, these interactions, especially those emphasizing mathematical reasoning, afford students who listen and participate the opportunity to learn rather than just memorize.\nRich, meaningful discourse between teacher and student in a mathematics classroom is a complex, yet important, objective for educators to understand and implement in the classroom. Hicks (1995 Hicks ( -1996 suggested that the analysis of classroom discourse provides one possible means through which educators across disciplines can explore how teachers and children collectively and individually construct disciplinary knowledge.\nIn this study, teacher talk was dominant and student talk was mainly a response to teacher questioning, emphasizing the need for further research on how better to provide students with the skills and mathematical competence to ask and engage in rich mathematical discourse with teachers. Based on the questioning paths and complexity of the discourse when students initiate and persist in their questioning, our findings seem to support previous findings (Corwin, Storeygard, Price, Smith, & Russell, 1995; Dillon, 1988; Kazemi, 1998; King, 1994 ) that students need the opportunity not only to hear what the teacher is teaching, but actually converse and articulate their own understanding of the content being presented. Conceptual understanding of the content coupled with an ability to engage in rich mathematical discourse through a probing, guiding, and interactive dialogue is a goal many teachers should strive to attain. It is reasonable to extrapolate that when this goal is attained, student achievement in advanced academics will follow.\nAs shown in the DSTCP map that resulted from this study, the paths between teacher and student can be initiated from several different inception points. The map created from this study could be refined and confirmed through further research Piccolo, Harbaugh, Carter, Capraro, and Capraro with other participants to further unpack the nature of discourse associated with teacher and students' questioning in mathematics classrooms across broader mathematical curricula. However, these paths clearly address a research niche identified by previous researchers (Hicks, 1995 (Hicks, -1996 Kazemi, 1998; King, 1994; Lampert, 1990; Redfield & Rousseau, 1981) and provide a framework that can link both teacher and student outcome measures as well as teacher evaluation and development protocols used in every school district (Ralph, 1999a) . Stryker (1987) asked an important question to which researchers and practitioners may want to pay close attention and attempt to answer: \"The proper question is not whether human social behavior is constrained or constructed; it is both. The proper question is under what circumstances will that behavior be more or less heavily constrained, more or less open to creative constructions\" (p. 93). The implications that these and related results have for professional development opportunities could be important for any mathematics teacher wanting to make the most of classroom discourse and for those who wish to understand the importance of student-posed questions in the teaching and learning process for advancing academic success for all students. Given a confirmed version of the map and associated pathways, practitioners could be guided to include in their questioning and response practices more characteristics that have been shown to lead to rich, meaningful discourse. Imagine a classroom in which teachers engage discourse on the student's level of interest without preconceived notions about question composition or how much must be completed by the next class session. For a more discursive classroom to exist, professional development should extend teacher's understandings of how students seek assistance and include how more successful teachers address student questioning. During professional development opportunities, teachers could view and analyze videos using the DSTCP map and reflected upon their questioning techniques. These teachers might become action researchers who improve classroom discourse practices and subsequent student understanding of mathematics."}]
