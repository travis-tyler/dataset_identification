The most common early symptom is difficulty remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms often include problems with language, altered affect, disorientation, lack of motivation, problems with self-care, and behavioral abnormalities (Burns, 2009; Burns and Iliffe, 2009) . As a patient's condition declines, they may withdraw from family and society. Gradually, more and more bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression varies, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is 3-9 years (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010; Todd et al., 2013) . AD has a typical pattern of progression, with anatomical changes that correspond to the types and severity of symptoms. The symptoms, the order in which they appear, and the duration of each clinical stage vary from person to person. Disease progression can be divided into three main stages: normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. All of these classifications are defined clinically based on behavioral and cognitive assessments, and although a person with MCI has elevated risk of developing AD, many people with MCI remain stable for some time or may develop other degenerative conditions pathologically distinct from AD, such vascular dementia or fronto-temporal dementia. and NC represents the subset of the population who are aging normally, and do not have sufficiently severe symptoms to be considered cognitively impaired. MCI involves cognitive impairments, but at a level that is not significant enough to interfere with a person's daily activities (Petersen et al., 1999) . MCI is often a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia: every year, around 10-15% of people with MCI progress to probable AD (Grundman et al., 2004) . However, not all people with MCI deteriorate cognitively and some even improve. Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage, MCI, are crucial for drug trials, given the urgent need for treatments to resist or slow disease progression.\nMany neuroimaging studies have used anatomical measures derived from T1-weighted brain MRI, such as cortical thickness, and volumetric or shape measures of subregions of the brain, to differentiate AD or MCI from NC (Fan et al., 2008; Hua et al., 2008a,b; Gerardin et al., 2009; Magnin et al., 2009; Hua et al., 2010; Cuingnet et al., 2011; Westman et al., 2011; Hua et al., 2013; Gutman et al., 2015) .\nMoreover, measures derived from functional imaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays have also been used to help classify individuals with cognitive impairment vs. healthy controls (De Santi et al., 2001; Morris et al., 2001; Bouwman et al., 2007; Mattsson et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2009; Fjell et al., 2010) . Diffusion weighted MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide clinical information on white matter integrity in a variety of diseases, such as schizophrenia (Zalesky et al., 2011) , autism (Lewis et al., 2014) , traumatic brain injury (Dennis et al., 2015b) , and even in genetics and sex difference . The white matter integrity can be analyzed with both the tract-based analysis such as tract-based spatial statistics (Smith et al., 2006) , fiber clustering , and the parcellation-based connectome analysis (Toga et al., 2012) .\nIn particular, many studies have used diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to study AD and MCI. Demirhan et al. (2015) studied the added value of diffusion tensor derived measures, over and above structural MRI, and showed they provided added diagnostic accuracy for classification of disease stages (Demirhan et al., 2015) . Nir et al. (2013) found that standard diffusion tensor derived measures were strongly correlated with several clinical ratings that are widely-used in AD research (MMSE, CDR-sob, and ADAS-cog) (Nir et al., 2013) . When effect sizes were ranked, mean diffusivity (MD) measures tended to outperform fractional anisotropy (FA) measures for detecting group differences in tracts that pass through the temporal lobes and the left hippocampal component of the Cingulum. Diffusivity measures tended to detect the more subtle differences in MCI, even when comparisons of FA measures did not. Jin et al. (2015) also used various diffusion-derived measures to relate fornix degeneration with cognitive decline. MD was also shown to be more sensitive to group differences among AD, MCI, and normal controls than FA (Jin et al., 2015) .\nSeveral studies used the ADNI DWI scans to compute structural connectivity measures, including measures of the brain's network properties. Li et al. (2013) proposed a spectral diffusional connectivity framework to explore the connectivity deficit in AD. Li et al. (2013) The framework was based on studying the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the diffusion tensor field at the voxel level. The peaks of the diffusional connectivity spectra were shifted in the AD group versus the normal controls. Prasad et al. (2015) ranked several connectivity measures, to see which ones best distinguished AD from normal aging (Prasad et al., 2015) . Graph-based network measuressuch as small-world properties, clustering, and modularityhelped in differentiating diagnostic subgroups relative to just using the raw connectivity matrices; there was also additional predictive value in computing a very dense connectivity matrix to represent the structural connectivity between all adjacent voxels in the image. This approach, known as \"flow-based connectivity analysis\" complemented the more standard analysis of large-scale tracts interconnecting cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Even so, brain networks and their features depend to some extent on the choice of field strength (Zhan et al., 2013c; Dennis et al., 2014) , scanners (Zhan et al., 2014a) , feature space (Zhan et al., 2014b) , imaging acquisition parameters , fiber tracking parameters (Dennis et al., 2015a) , fiber tracking algorithms used to infer the trajectories of pathways in the brain (Zhan et al., 2013b (Zhan et al., , 2015a . Dozens of tractography algorithms are now available (Conturo et al., 1999; Mori et al., 1999; Basser et al., 2000; Lazar et al., 2003; Parker et al., 2003; Behrens et al., 2007; Aganj et al., 2011) yielding visually very different brain networks.\nFor this study, we adopted the tensor-based fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm (Mori et al., 1999) to compute structural brain networks in a cohort of elderly patients with various levels of cognitive impairment (none, mild, severe). Tensor-based FACT can yield false positive fibers that may add noise to the computed network properties, but it is still one of the most widely used tractography algorithms due to it being simple and flexible. Here we propose a novel framework for network classification, with the goal of improving diagnostic classification by combining diffusion and structural MRI. We also set out to show how this new framework could be applied to networks that might contain false positive fibers (such as those derived from FACT) and used for differentiating different stages of cognition in the stages of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Figure 1 summarizes our proposed framework for brain network classification using higher order singular value decomposition (HO-SVD) and sparse logistic regression (Sparse LG). Its two component techniques are explained below."}, {"section_title": "HO-SVD", "text": "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a powerful tool for dimension reduction that is widely used in machine learning and data mining.

The diagonal entries of , known as singular values, are non-negative and assumed to be in descending order.\nFIGURE 1 | Here we show the workflow used in this paper to classify patients based on their brain structural networks. We model brain networks as connectivity matrices, and then stack them up, across subjects, as a 3D tensor. We then perform feature reduction and use sparse methods for diagnostic classification.\nThe higher order SVD (HO-SVD) is one common generalization of SVD from matrices to tensors (De Lathauwer et al., 2000) . In HO-SVD, a tensor X \u2208 R I 1 \u00d7I 2 \u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7I N is decomposed as\n. . , N are orthogonal matrices where the ith column of U (k) is the ith k-mode singular vector.

U (N) , the core tensor S is given by\nInspired by the dimension reduction via SVD in the 2D case, we propose to reduce the dimensions of diffusion MRI derived brain networks, using higher order SVD (HO-SVD). Similar to the matrix case, the ordering assumption for tensor singular values suggests that most of the information contained in a tensor may be expressed by the first few \"components.\" Let the first mode of data tensor X correspond to the sample size n (i.e., I 1 = n) and the remaining modes correspond to feature dimensions. Then, by keeping the largest R 1 , . . . , R N singular values for each mode, a reduced tensor with size n \u00d7 R 2 \u00d7 R 3 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 R N can be obtained by\nT is the core tensor with the first R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R N singular values kept for each mode,\nThe proposed dimension reduction of the tensor is also analogous to principal components analysis (Mocks and Verleger, 1986 ) for a matrix input.

Figure 2 illustrates the basic idea of HO-SVD and feature reduction."}, {"section_title": "Sparse Logistic Regression", "text": "Let x \u2208 R m be a sample vector and y \u2208 {\u22121, +1} be a binary outcome.

However, when dimension m is far larger than the sample size n, solving the logistic regression problem is ill-posed, and the learned model may suffer from the over-fitting problem. Sparse logistic regression embeds the feature selection into classification using the Lasso penalty (Tibshirani, 1996 (Tibshirani, , 2011 which results in a sparse solution for w.

This process was repeated for all ROI pairs, to compute a whole brain fiber connectivity matrix. This matrix is symmetric, by definition, and has a zero diagonal, i.e., we did not consider self-connections.

One can always use SVD to decompose an arbitrary matrix to reduce the dimensionality, by using its top k singular values and left singular vectors.

The rows in the extracted data matrix correspond to samples, and the columns represent features. We first normalize each feature column of the input data matrix by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. As the outcome has an imbalanced distribution, we used undersampling techniques to mitigate the bias. Undersampling used in this paper is a special case of subsampling, and our method is essentially the bagging procedure where a bunch of models built on subsampled dataset are averaged. Different from a general subsampling strategy, undersampling requires the numbers of positive and negative samples to be the same. Thus, undersampling does not introduce any additional prior knowledge of the data distribution, so it is less likely to create classifiers that favor the majority class. For each evaluation procedure, we first randomly split data into two parts: first, 85% of the samples were used for training, and the remaining 15% of the samples were used for testing. We next ran a 5-fold cross-validation on the training data alone to select a model parameter (the LASSO parameter) and we then re-trained a model on the whole training data with the selected parameter to produce the final prediction model.

Our results indicate the connection patterns among these regions may also be affected by the disease. Thus, this result deserves further investigation.

The column SVD > Raw in Table 3 indicates statistical differences in classification performance of the SVD and Raw feature sets; there was no detectable difference in classification performance between these feature sets for all three diagnostic tasks. Therefore, for this particular set of tasks and this dataset, performing SVD does not improve classification performance. SVD can reduce the dimension of the data, perhaps also reducing the noise, it may still discard useful information that may be vital for classification.\nA similar result is seen when using HO-SVD in the classification task AD vs. NC. For task AD vs. NC in Table 3 , both SVD and HO-SVD feature sets performed similarly to the raw feature set. One possible explanation for this could be that the AD and NC groups are the most biologically different, so they are easier to differentiate than the other two, as is evident in Table 2 . The classification performance is already quite good for raw features and there is little room for improvement.\nOn the other hand, our proposed HO-SVD had a significant advantage in accuracy for the other two differentiation tasks. As listed in Table 3 , HO-SVD performed significantly better than raw features for accuracy and specificity for AD vs. MCI; and in accuracy and sensitivity for the task, MCI vs. NC.\nBrain networks derived from FACT-based tractography often include a substantial number of false positive fibers generated. Our experimental results suggest that HO-SVD is quite effective in handling feature reduction for these noisy networks, especially in the more challenging task of differentiating cognitively healthy controls from MCI. Alzheimer's disease involves structural atrophy detectable on MRI, as well as pathological amyloid depositions and metabolic alterations in the brain. In this study, we compared the brain network properties in different stages of Alzheimer's disease using different analysis methods. In our first two assessments using element-wise brain connectivity matrices and global network measures, respectively, we were unable to differentiate the diagnostic classes MCI and NC. But while within our HO-SVD framework, the classification performance was significantly improved compared to using raw features. The choice of tractography algorithms can also affect the generated brain network, but in our previous studies , we presented a very detailed paper that was not able to detect any significant difference in classification accuracy, using brain networks generated from different tractography methods. This was extremely surprising to us, as some tractography methods lead to a much sparser representation of brain connectivity than others. But it seemed like they were all somewhat sensitive to disease effects and their accuracy was hard to distinguish even in a DTI sample of a reasonable size. In the meantime, we also conducted similar studies using different network derived from different tractography algorithms, the accuracy was also boosted by HO-SVD in compared to SVD or raw. Because of these, we only presented the result from the most common tractography algorithm, FACT, and focused our analysis on the features from the networks and classification algorithms best suited for distinguishing between the various stages of neurodegeneration. Taken together, it seems like using HO-SVD makes more difference than the tract tracing method, at least among the ones we analyzed, which were all quite well validated and widely used. Of course the possibility remains that someone will develop a better algorithm in the future."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we proposed a novel framework to differentiate different stages of cognitive impairment-from no impairment in healthy controls to mild cognitive impairment and ultimately Alzheimer's disease, using diffusion MRI derived structural networks in conjunction with a sparse machine learning method.
