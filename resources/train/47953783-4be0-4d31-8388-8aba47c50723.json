This model remains hypothetical with the timing of each stage in relation to disease progression yet to be confirmed. Accumulated data, however, support this model and it provides a useful framework for investigating the properties of different biomarkers [1, 2] . Clinical trials would be improved by identifying the biomarkers most strongly associated with cognitive and functional declines at each stage of AD. Identifying biomarkers associated with subtle declines in cognitive functions among cognitively normal and mildly affected subjects is especially critical as research efforts move toward early identification of high risk subjects and prevention of progression.\nOne issue not examined systematically across various biomarkers is which component of commonly used AD biomarkers-baseline value or progression of biomarker values (biomarker progressions)-is more strongly associated with cognitive declines. In the cascade model [1, 2] , the capacity of each biomarker to predict cognitive decline depends on the stage of AD disease process (e.g., normal, early mild cognitive impairment [MCI] , late MCI, or AD), and whether biomarker baseline values or biomarker progressions are used. It is likely, for example, that brain beta amyloid burden is already high and probably plateaus by the time of AD diagnosis [3, 4] , and although brain amyloid burden may distinguish among subjects with AD, MCI, and normal subjects cross-sectionally, continuing declines in cognitive functions at late MCI or AD stages will not be related to brain amyloid burden. Although baseline biomarker values are examined often in relation with subsequent longitudinal cognitive or functional trajectories, there is a paucity of data regarding biomarker progressions and their associations with cognitive or functional trajectories. Examining the relative ability of baseline values versus biomarker progressions at each stage of AD in explaining cognitive trajectories could improve clinical trial designs by allowing the recruitment of high risk populations with higher accuracy. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study (ADNI-1) to examine which components (baseline values or biomarker progressions) are associated with declines in memory and executive cognitive functions. To conduct a fair comparison across different biomarkers and to increase clinical applicability of our results, we standardized all biomarkers and provided the clinical values corresponding to each standard deviation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI is to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological (NP) assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, and lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited more than 1500 adults, aged 55 to 90 years, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols of ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

MCI participants had MMSE scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), a memory complaint, evidence of objective memory loss as measured by education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, a CDR of 0.5, absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and absence of dementia. Mildly demented AD participants had MMSE scores between 20 and 26, global CDR scores of 0.5 or 1.0, and met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD [8] .The ADNI-1 study collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) from approximately 50% of participants at baseline, and from smaller subgroups subsequently. CSF and FDG-PET biomarker acquisition procedures for ADNI are described in detail elsewhere [9] [10] [11] .

Baseline and slopes of progression of the following biomarkers and their association with declines in cognitive function (described later) were examined: MRI total brain volumes, hippocampal volumes, ventricular volumes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, CSF total tau protein (t-tau) and Ab 42 levels, cortical thickness of selected regions (precuneus and medial temporal cortical thickness, the latter being the summary variable obtained by adding averaged means for left and right entorhinal, perirhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortical region thicknesses [12, 13] ), and FDG-PET (summary variable by averaged mean for left and right temporal, right, and left angular and posterior cingulate cortices [9, 14] ).

These measurements were validated previously, robust, and have external validity [15] [16] [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Individual-specific slopes (i.e., random component) of the longitudinal trajectory of each biomarker were estimated using mixed effects models. We defined changes in diagnosis when subjects remained in a new diagnostic category for at least two consecutive assessments. Less than three cases changed diagnosis among the control group using this criterion. Therefore, we did not include the indicator variable for these subjects when analyzing control subjects. These estimates and observed baseline values were used as predictors of cognitive decline (decline in ADNI-Mem and ADNI-Exe) using mixed effects models, controlling for age, sex, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele status (\u03b54 present or absent), years of education, and practice effects. Practice effects, which refer to improvements in cognitive test scores over repeated administrations, are often observed at the second and third assessments, especially among those with normal cognition or early stage MCI [18, 19] . The magnitude of practice effects may be an indicator of future cognitive decline, but the normative magnitude of practice effects and precise timing of when practice effects subside are not established. Therefore, we first examined the amount and timing of practice effects by assessing changes in cognitive slopes using a piecewise approach (i.e., allowing slope changes between baseline and sixth-month assessment, between sixth month assessment and year 1 assessment, etc.). This change point analysis identified that for memory function (ADNI-Mem), model fitness is best if we assume that practice effect peaked at the sixth month assessment, and for executive function (ADNI-Exe) at the 12th month assessment. We evaluated indicators allowing shifts in slopes beyond 12th month assessment, but they were not significant. That is, the change point in slope occurs only at sixth month assessment (for memory) and at year 1 (for executive function) and cognitive function declines continuously thereafter. Accordingly, this change point was included in the model to control for practice effects (see Appendix). Variability in cognitive decline (i.e., individual differences in slopes) explained by the subject-specific baseline biomarker values was compared with variability in cognitive decline explained by subject-specific biomarker progressions. Each model included time in months (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months from baseline). Baseline biomarker values and time interactions, and biomarker progressions and time interactions were added separately to examine the variability in random slopes in cognitive declines explained by each component (baseline biomarker values vs. biomarker progressions). Each brain volume was divided by intracranial volume (ICV). All biomarker variables were standardized so that estimated effects of biomarkers on cognitive decline could be meaningfully compared across different biomarkers. WMH/ICV was normalized first with a log transformation due to its skewed distribution. All biomarkers were standardized using baseline means and standard deviations. Intercept and time were treated as random effects in all models. All models assumed an unstructured withinsubject error covariance structure and restricted maximum likelihood was used for estimation. We applied the same mixed effects models to each stage separately (controls, MCI, and AD) to examine the predictive effect of biomarkers on cognitive declines within each group. A variable indicating changes in diagnosis (from MCI to AD) was included when analyzing subjects in MCI group. The overall fit of the models was examined using a combination of formal fit criteria and visual inspection of residual plots. Results were considered significant at P , .05. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of study samples by diagnostic category at baseline. As shown, CSF, t-tau, and Ab42 (U2 series) were assessed only up to twice in ADNI-1. Figure 1shows spaghetti plots of cognitive functions and biomarkers used in the analysis. Table 2 shows the proportion of variability in ADNI-Mem and ADNI-Exe declines over time explained by baseline biomarker values or biomarker progressions. Table 2 is read as follows: Among MCI subjects, for example, one standard deviation larger expansion in ICV-adjusted ventricular volume is associated with 0.12 further decline in memory scores each year (slope effect: 20.12) and biomarker progression explains 39.4% of variability in cognitive decline, whereas the baseline value explains only 8.7% of variability in memory decline. When inclusion of biomarker baseline and progression values in the model causes more estimation errors (i.e., noise, indicated by increased variability in ADNI-Mem and ADNI-Exe declines), we noted N/A in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of study samples", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cognitive declines", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Memory decline", "text": "Among normal subjects, FDG-PET score biomarker progression, precuneus thickness baseline and progression, and medial temporal lobe thickness progression explained variability in memory declines, but only to a limited extent: 1.5%, 4.5%, 1.2%, and 4.4%, respectively. Among MCI subjects, several biomarkers predicted memory decline; biomarkers which explained the most variability were progression of ventricular volumes (39.4%), followed by shrinkage of medial temporal cortical thickness (28.7%), and hippocampal atrophy (19.8%). For all biomarkers except WMH volume and t-tau, biomarker progressions explained a greater fraction of memory decline than baseline values. Differences between baseline and progression in explaining variability of memory declines were especially large for total and ventricular brain volume atrophy, with five times or more variability explained by biomarker progressions than baseline values. Among AD subjects, much higher proportions of variability were explained by biomarker progressions than by baseline biomarker values. Differences in explanatory capacities between baseline values and biomarker progressions were larger than those observed among MCI subjects. The highest proportion of variability in ADNI-Mem changes was explained by progression of FDG-PET scores (84%), followed by ventricular volume loss (63.8%). Looking at each biomarker across diagnosis groups, with the exception of CSF Ab 42 and t-tau, the explanatory ability of biomarker progression values increased with progression from normal through MCI to AD. Progression of CSF Ab42 level was associated with memory decline more strongly during the MCI stage, although the proportion is not high compared with other biomarkers.

Among MCI subjects, as with memory declines, biomarker progressions had stronger associations with executive declines than baseline values. Ventricular volume progression explained the highest variability of executive declines (44.5%). Unexpectedly among MCI subjects, CSF Ab42 explained more variability in executive declines than in memory declines: its baseline value explained 23.7% and its progression explained 14.4% of variability in executive declines, whereas the corresponding figures were 5.1% and 10.3% in memory declines. Among AD subjects, ventricular volume progression also explained the highest variability of executive function declines (65.1%), followed by FDT-PET scores progression (39.5%). As expected, neither hippocampal volume baseline nor progression explained the variability of ADNI-Exe decline among AD subjects, whereas they did for ADNI-Mem.

For most biomarkers, biomarker progressions explained more variability of cognitive declines than baseline values.\nA number of studies show support for the hypothetical AD progression model developed by Jack et al. [1, 2] . Our study results coincide with the model to some extent; across diagnostic groups, the percentage of variability in cognitive declines explained by functional (FDG-PET) or structural (brain morphometric) biomarkers, either their baseline values or progressions, increased significantly as disease progresses from normal to AD, although structural changes seem to be more closely to or coincided with FDG-PET change than hypothesized [20] . These results reflect that these functional or structural biomarkers change relatively late in a long disease process. This trend was more apparent in memory declines than executive functional declines. Among normal subjects, there was relatively little association between biomarkers and memory decline, but there were more associations between biomarkers and executive decline. This result might be due to the fact that memory decline is minimal among normal subjects and the variability in memory functions does not increase until during later disease stages, whereas executive function declines earlier as a part of normal aging. Among normal subjects, the estimated time slope for memory was 20.01 whereas that for executive functions was 20.04, suggesting that executive function (ADNI-Exe scores) declined more than memory function (ADNI-Mem). This difference in the magnitude of decline between executive and memory functions among normal subjects could also explain the unexpected result among normal subjects; both CSF Ab42 baseline and progression were not associated with memory decline, but CSF Ab42 progression did explain some of the variation in executive function declines. Also CSF Ab42 progression might be related to executive function in MCI because it detects a subgroup of MCI patients with a progressive disorder, not so much because the degree of declines is related to the amount of CSF Ab42 progression.\nUsing [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET, Landau et al. [21] found that Ab deposition estimated by [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET was associated with cognitive decline measured by ADAS-Cog retrospectively, but FDG-PET summary score was not, among normal subjects. In our study, FDG-PET progression, precuneus thickness, and medial temporal cortical thickness progressions explained variability of ADNI-Mem score changes across all diagnostic groups, although its predictive ability in the normal group was limited. Similarly, FDG-PET and ventricular volumes progressions were the only biomarkers to explain variability in ADNI-Exe score changes across all diagnostic groups. The outcome measures in our current study are psychometrically optimized distinct indicators of memory and executive functions, whereas the global ADAS-Cog scores combined all cognitive domains. The difference in outcome measures may explain differences in results between those reported by Landau et al. and our current study. Prospective studies are warranted as more data on amyloid PET imaging accumulates.\nLooking across the two major cognitive domains examined in this study, memory and executive functions, there was some overlap in individual biomarker progressions' capabilities to explain cognitive declines. In MCI and AD groups, FDG-PET score changes, ventricular volume increases, whole brain volume declines, and medial temporal cortical thinning progressions generally exhibited parallel and often robust effects in explaining both ADNIMem and ADNI-Exe score declines. Robust association with cognitive change in both domains suggests that these biomarker progressions may be particularly useful in trial design and subject selection. As the field moves toward trials in presymptomatic populations, defining useful biomarkers predictive of cognitive declines during the presymptomatic period is particularly important. Among normal subjects in this data set, precuneus thickness baseline values and medial temporal cortical thinning progressions explained variability in ADNI-Mem declines by more than 4%, showing more explanatory ability than CSF Ab42. The precuneus is a site of preferential amyloid uptake in PiB studies, and its thinning is documented as an early sign of AD pathology [22] [23] [24] [25] . Dickerson et al. [13] , showed that early stage AD is associated with a large degree of medial temporal cortical thinning, although the volumes of medial temporal cortical regions may decrease with both aging and AD. The relatively poor performance of CSF Ab42 and t-tau biomarker progression values in explaining the cognitive trajectories could be due to shorter duration of follow-up of these markers in comparison with other markers in the current study. Alternatively, the control group in ADNI is likely to be heterogeneous and include significant numbers of individuals who will not progress to AD, although the group has a higher proportion of those with APOE \u03b54 allele than most population norms. Because trials in AD are increasingly focusing on prevention in asymptomatic individuals, there is a need for markers more strongly associated with cognitive decline during the presymptomatic stage. Further follow-up of normal subjects is required to compare associations of biomarkers and cognitive functions between those who transited to AD and remained normal.\nIn most biomarkers, progressions were more strongly associated with cognitive declines measured by NP tests. This suggests that clinical trials recruiting at risk subjects may be improved by using progression rather than baseline values in biomarkers to appropriately enrich study cohorts. Use of biomarker progressions requires at least two assessments before the trial enrollment. Two or three assessments are also required to phase out practice effects in cognitive test scores and obtain robust estimates of cognitive declines. Grill et al. [26] , estimated required sample sizes per arm for a 36-month trial in detecting differences in changes in cognitive test outcomes using ADNI baseline biomarker information among those with normal cognition. When CDR sum of boxes is an outcome, FDG-PET and lateral ventricle volume values gave relatively small sample sizes; sample sizes required are 1039 given enrichment by FDG-PET summary values, and 1686 given lateral ventricle volume, whereas the required sizes given enrichment by CSF Ab, t-tau, p-tau, and Apoe4 were 1710, 2136, 2901, and 2372, respectively. That is, enriching with FGD-PET baseline scores actually gave the smallest sample size estimates when outcome was CDR-sum of boxes. Future studies are warranted to estimate the incremental effectiveness of improving clinical trial statistical power by using biomarker progression criteria.\nWMH expansion was shown to be an early marker associated with MCI incidence [27] , and is associated with cognitive decline among nondemented subjects [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . WMH progression was found to be a better predictor of cognitive decline than baseline values [35] . In the current study, WMH did not explain the variability in either memory decline or executive function decline, but rather increased the noise in estimating cognitive declines among normal subjects. The association between WMH expansion and cognitive declines is complex and may be affected by the specific cognitive functions measured and floor effects during disease progression. It is possible also that different regional WMH has differential associations with specific cognitive function declines [35] [36] [37] . Alternatively, subjects in ADNI have lower vascular burden due to the study exclusion criteria and the WMH volume is low at enrollment, which may make it difficult to observe associations with cognitive functions. Finally, large measurement variability associated with WMH assessment could lead to our study result. Fluctuation in longitudinal WMH measurement is large. Over a long run with several follow-up assessments, WMH trajectory estimates would become more robust, but when only a few data points are available, estimation of WMH trajectories are vulnerable to measurement fluctuations. Analysis involving WMH (either as outcome or predictor variables) could require more data points than some of other biomarkers examined to obtain robust estimates.\nThere are several potential limitations of this study. As with other studies using ADNI data, subjects in each diagnostic group were recruited separately, but not followed throughout the disease spectrum. As such, our interpretation of the cascade of pathologic events discussed in this study is limited to inferences. In our preliminary analysis, we confirmed that missingness of biomarkers in ADNI data is not missing completely at randomand is assumed to be missing at random. However, it is possible that missingness is due to informative dropout. Sensitivity analysis can be conducted if more knowledge is available for the informative dropout mechanism.\nIn conclusion, for most biomarkers, biomarker progressions explained higher variability in cognitive decline than biomarker baseline values. Enriching the recruitment of at-risk subjects using biomarker progressions could improve clinical trials. The incremental effectiveness of improving clinical trial statistical power by using biomarker progression criteria is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Data collection and sharing for this project were funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904).

Stage 2: Association between biomarker baseline/ progression and outcome\nWe use memory score in mild cognitive impairment group as an example, and similar models are used for memory score and executive function score in all groups. For memory score, model fitting statistics from model diagnostics indicate that slope changes at 6 months (t 5 0.5 year). Let y it denote the memory score of the ith participant at time t, and we assume the following linear mixed model after model diagnostics: Percentage of variation in outcome progression explained by baseline biomarker and biomarker progression.\nFor each outcome, we are interested in comparing how much variation in outcome progression is explained by each baseline biomarker and biomarker progression, respectively. To do so, we obtain the estimated variance of the random slope from the following three models, which are the same as the final model described in previous section except for the level 2 slope model S 2i :\nNull 2. Interpretation: In most biomarkers, progressions were more strongly associated with cognitive declines than baseline values. Across diagnostic groups, the percentage of variability in cognitive declines explained by functional or structural biomarkers increased significantly as disease progresses from normal to AD.
