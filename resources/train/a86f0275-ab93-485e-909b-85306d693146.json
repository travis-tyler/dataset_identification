[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Conservation Tillage (CT) is one of the most widely promoted conservation practices to conserve soil by reducing soil erosion. Compared with more intensive conventional tillage, CT minimizes soil disturbance by leaving more crop residue on the soil surface and could potentially improve soil structure, increase soil organic carbon, minimize soil erosion risks, decrease fluctuations in soil temperature and enhance soil quality (Busari et al., 2015). According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, no till and reduced till was used on 72% of U.S. acres for which a tillage system was reported. Despite widespread adoption and continued promotion of CT for soil conservation, water quality and climate regulation via carbon sequestration, there remain concerns among non-adopters about there being a yield penalty or \"yield drag\" when using CT. A large number of agronomic studies have investigated on the yield effects of CT using field trials, but their overall findings are mixed. Meta-analyses of U.S. related studies by DeFelice et al. (2006) and Toliver et al. (2012) have concluded that the impacts of CT on crop yields vary by cropping system, soil properties, land slope, and climatic conditions. A global meta-analysis by Pittelkow et al. (2015b) (also in Pittelkow et al. (2015a)) concluded that no-till has negative impacts on crop yields, especially for rice (-7.5%) and corn (-7.6%). Few observational studies have examined the yield effects of CT. A recent exception is Deines et al. (2019), which quantified the impacts of CT on crop yields in the U.S. using remotely sensed tillage data and a doubly robust treatment estimation method (i.e., augmented inverse propensity weighted estimation). After controlling for soil and climate variables, they found that long-term CT (more than 10 years' continuous adoption) has a positive yield effect in corn (3.3%) and soybeans (0.74%). The study by Deines et al. (2019) faces a limitation that, due to lack of the data, their analysis does not account for socioeconomic factors (e.g., farm size, household income, land tenure, education, etc) that can affect CT adoption (Prokopy et al., 2008;Baumgart-Getz et al., 2012;Prokopy et al., 2019) and also yields (e.g., Soule et al., 2000;Sheng et al., 2019). Ignoring these variables \"could cause omitted variable bias\" (Deines et al., 2019, p.6). For example, the treatment effect estimates could be upwards biased if, for instance, the socioeconomic factors are positively 1 associated with both CT adoption and crop yields. Drought risk is also an important factor in CT adoption -some observers reported that farmers are more inclined to adopt CT when facing higher drought risks (Ding et al., 2009;Wallander et al., 2013), probably due to that CT adoption could benefit soil water retention and potentially mitigate the impact of moisture deficiency on yields. Failing to control for these variables leaves room for skepticism that CT might not actually lead to higher yields. This study estimates the treatment effects of CT on corn and soybean yields in the U.S., while controlling for individual socioeconomic factors and drought risk. The analysis is based on fieldlevel survey data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) that contains rich information about field operations, farmer characteristics and economic costs and returns. These data are merged with external fine-scale weather (from the PRISM database) and soil (from the gSSURGO database) data to construct variables to control for drought risk and soil characteristics. We employ the bias-corrected matching estimator (Abadie and Imbens, 2011) to estimate the treatment effects, and the identification relies on a key assumption that selection into CT adoption is independent of the outcome after controlling for observed covariates. We minimize the risk of violating this assumption by exploiting a rich set of covariates. In addition, we follow Imai and Kim (2019) to incorporate state and year fixed effects into matching to control for state-and year-specific heterogeneity. Our article contributes to a large body of literature concerning the yield effect of CT adoption (e.g., DeFelice et al., 2006;Van den Putte et al., 2010;Toliver et al., 2012;Pittelkow et al., 2015b;Deines et al., 2019). Our major findings are that, after controlling for socioeconomic factors and biophysical factors, CT has a positive effect on corn yields (about 3%) and soybean yields (about 6%) among adopters. In addition, we show that CT also saves production costs and is thus a profitable practice for adopters. This finding is consistent with the prior belief noted in the literature (Claassen et al., 2018b). Our study is also related to the literature focusing on determinants of CT adoption (Prokopy et al., 2019). We discuss our identification strategy next section, followed by a description of the data, empirical results, and conclusions."}, {"section_title": "Identification Strategy", "text": "The aim of our analysis is to quantify the effects of CT on crop yields and crop profitability. To do this, we need to address the issue of missing data on the counterfactual: what would yields and profits be if farmers who did adopt CT had not adopted. Because CT adoption is voluntary, our empirical strategy needs to account for self-selection into CT adoption. Many methods have been proposed to account for selection bias (see Imbens and Rubin (2015); Abadie and Cattaneo (2018) for reviews). One type of methods uses selection on observables estimation, including regression adjustment, matching, re-weighting, and the doubly-robust estimator. These methods estimate treatment effect based on the assumption that, conditional on the observed covariates, treatment is as-good-as randomly assigned. Another approach uses selection on unobservables estimation, which primarily deals with the non-observable factors that drive nonrandom assignment to treatment. The popular methods under this category consist of instrumental variable (IV) regression, difference-in-difference (DiD), and the endogenous switching regression. Because a rich set of observable covariates are available to us, we are not as concerned about unobservables as is often the case in the literature. Further, the methods of DiD and IV regression are not applicable here because our data are cross-sectional and we have not been able to identify a valid instrument that is strongly correlated with CT adoption but not simultaneously associated with the outcome. Thus, we choose the bias-corrected matching estimator proposed by Abadie and Imbens (2011), a doubly-robust estimation method, to perform the analysis. This method is good for controlling bias in observational studies under the selection on observables assumption (Rubin, 1980;Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983), and it has been widely used for program evaluation across disciplines."}, {"section_title": "The Bias-corrected Matching Estimator", "text": "We employ the bias-corrected matching estimator (Abadie and Imbens, 2011) to account for selection into treatment based on observable characteristics. 1 In randomized experiments, random-In the case of one-to-one matching, M is equal to 1. The estimated outcomes in the treatment 93\u1ef8 i (1) and the non-treatment\u1ef8 i (0) cases are estimated as follows: Given the values of potential outcome, treatment effects can be directly calculated as follows: where ATT refers to the average treatment effect on the treated, and N 1 is the number of treated 4 units. ATU refers to the average treatment effect on the untreated, and N 0 is the number of untreated units. We incorporate sample weights, represented by \u03c9 i , into the calculations because the ARMS data to be analyzed are probability-weighted (National Research Council, 2007). Using the sample weights can ensure that the results derived from the sample are representative of the population. Abadie and Imbens (2011) derived large sample properties of matching estimators, and they found that matching estimators include a conditional bias stemming from matching discrepancy (i.e., the difference in covariates between treated units and counterfactual units). To address the bias, we follow Rubin and Thomas (2000) and Abadie and Imbens (2011) to combine matching with a bias correction based on simple linear weighted least-squares regression, which can remove the conditional bias of matching without affecting the asymptotic variance (Abadie and Imbens, 2011). Specifically, we estimate two weighted linear regressions: \u00b5 z (x) = E{Y (z)|X = x} for z = 0 or 1, and then use the fitted values to adjust for the matching discrepancy. Equation (1) and Equation(2) are then rewritten as follows: The identification of treatment effects using matching relies on three key assumptions. The first assumption is unconfoundedness or selection on observables, which requires that selection into treatment is independent of the outcome after controlling for observed covariates. Our survey data include a large set of variables that we include as covariates in our estimations. Following Imai and Kim (2019), we incorporate state and year fixed effects into the estimations by restricting matches among units in the same states and same year only. This allows us to further control for state-and year-specific heterogeneity that might confound our estimates. The covariate set does not include variables on environmental awareness that may affect CT adoption (Prokopy et al., 2019), but such variables are expected to have a limited effect on our outcome variables (yield and production cost). The second assumption is common support, which requires sufficient overlap in the distribution of covariates between the treated and untreated units. When the common support condition is violated, not all treated units have comparable untreated units, and matching may not improve covariate balance (Colson et al., 2016). Many procedures have been proposed to address the issue of poor or thin common support (see Lechner and Strittmatter (2017) for a review), and a common procedure is to drop the observations that are \"off support\" or those having the differences larger than a pre-specified tolerated difference level (or caliper). For instance, Lechner and Strittmatter (2019) recommends pruning observations in the treated group with propensity scores larger than the maximum value (or the 99th percentile) of the propensity score in the untreated group. Crump et al. (2009) derived an optimal rule for pruning observations. Similar to previous studies, we handle the common support issue through data pruning. Yet, we do not make any arbitrary choice of the tolerance level for matching distance but report all estimates along with data pruning, starting from dropping the observations with the largest matching distances. This approach allows us to evaluate sensitivity of our estimates to the common support assumption. The third assumption required for the matching estimator is the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) that the potential outcome of each unit needs to be independent of the potential outcomes of all other units (or no spillover effect). We are not concerned about this assumption because each field in our sample is managed by different farmers and has different locations (mostly across counties, and even states). Thus, it is unlikely that treatment to one field affects the outcome of another field."}, {"section_title": "Matching Methods and Covariate Balance", "text": "We use two methods to perform matching: Mahalanobis Metric (MM) matching (Cochran and Rubin, 1973;Rubin, 1980) and Propensity Score (PS) matching (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). Mahalanobis Metric (MM) matching searches for matches based on the Mahalanobis distance met-ric, for which we define as follows: where X 1 and X 2 denote covariates of treated and control units, respectively. As in Abadie and Imbens (2006) and Abadie and Imbens (2011), we let A be a diagonal matrix, with the inverse of the sample covariance matrix of the covariates on the diagonal. PS matching searches for matches based on propensity scores. A propensity score is the conditional probability of receiving treatment given a vector of observed covariates that summarizes the joint influence of all the covariates on treatment. In most cases, propensity scores are unknown and thus have to be estimated (usually by logit regressions). This is a limitation of propensity score matching because mis-specification of the propensity score model leads to estimation bias (King and Nielsen, 2019). A key criteria for matching to succeed in reducing bias is achieving balance in covariates for treated and control units. As noted in King and Nielsen (2019), if the matching process does not produce good balance, the observed systematic differences between the treatment groups, rather than the treatment of interest, may be responsible for differences in outcomes. Indeed, estimation based on matched data with better covariate balance is generally less biased (Colson et al., 2016). Here we rely on a commonly used balance measure in the literature, standardized mean difference (SMD) (Imbens and Rubin, 2015;Colson et al., 2016), to assess covariate balance. Specifically, SMD refers to the absolute difference in means between the treatment and control groups, divided by the pooled standard deviation of the groups. Large values for the SMD indicate that the average covariate values in the two groups are substantially different. A rule of thumb for getting sufficient balance is that SMD should be less than 0.2 (Cohen, 1988, p.25). 2 Throughout the analyses, we incorporate sample weights into the SMD by calculating the weighted mean differences, divided by the pooled weighted standard deviation of the groups. With weights, SMD can infer population 2 As noted in Cohen (1988, p.25), a SMD equal to 0.2 means that the Pearson correlation coefficient between population membership (treated versus untreated) and the covariate is 0.1. The R 2 is accordingly 0.01, meaning that population membership only accounts for 1% of the variance of the covariate in the data. Besides, Mayer (2011) showed that SMD lower than 0.2 means that the differences are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (sample size is around 800) through Monte Carlo simulations. balance of covariates that \"is crucial to the estimation of population treatment effects\" (Lenis et al., 2019, p.160)."}, {"section_title": "Data and Descriptive Analysis", "text": "Our data are from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS is administered by the the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the USDA for the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), and it is the primary annual source of information on the production practices, resource use, and economic well-being of America's farms and ranches. The ARMS is collected in three data collection phases (I, II, and III). Phase I is a telephone screening to verify that an operation belongs in the sample. Phase II occurs at the field-level and targets particular crops, which vary from year to year, and collects information on production practices and chemical use. Different commodities are surveyed on a predetermined rotation with up to five commodities surveyed in a given year. Phase III gathers information on the entire farm enterprise and the household associated with its principal operator. We use two years of data for corn (2010 and 2016) and one year of data for soybean (2012) that were available at the time of analysis. For all our analyses, we focus on rain-fed and non-organic fields only. The outcome variables are logged yields and logged production costs per acre and the treatment variable is conservation tillage (CT) from the phase II survey. Production cost is the sum of operating costs (including costs of seed, fertilizer, chemicals, custom operations, fuel, lube, and electricity, repairs, interest on operating capital) and allocated overhead costs (including costs of hired labor, opportunity cost of unpaid labor, capital recovery of machinery and equipment, opportunity costs of land, taxes and insurance, general farm overhead). We follow Claassen et al. (2018a) to define CT as tillage management practices that result in a Soil Tillage Intensity Rating (STIR) of less than or equal to 80. 3 As reported in figure 1, the percent of planted acres using CT was 65.5% for corn in 2010, 63.7% for corn in 2016, and 70.2% for soybeans in 2012. These numbers are nearly identical to those reported by ERS using the same methodology (Claassen et al., 2018a). We include in the set of covariates a large number of variables from ARMS and external sources that can affect farmers' tillage decision and the outcome variables we study. All the covariates and their definitions are listed in table 1. In general, these variables can be categorized into four groups. The first group of variables measure the land and soil characteristics that are relevant to farmers' tillage practice choices (Wu and Babcock, 1998;Wu et al., 2004). Following Claassen et al. (2018b), we include a binary indicator of whether a field was adjacent to a wetland (Wetland = 1). In addition, we include four soil variables (available water capacity, K-factor, soil pH, organic matter) processed from the USDA-NRCS gSSURGO soils database. These soil variables are merged with the survey data by county (we do not have geographic coordinates of the surveyed fields but know the counties where fields are located). We exclude fields that were classified as highly erodible land by the NRCS, primarily because the majority of those fields (more than 70%) were treated (used CT). 4 Thus, it is hard to find untreated fields that are also erodible to be matched with those fields. The second group of covariates are measures of weather and climate conditions, including drought risk. Specifically, we include growing degree days (GDDs) and cumulative precipitation over the growing season (from March to August). Bounding temperatures for moderate GDDs for corn and soybeans are 10-29 \u2022 C and 10-30 \u2022 C, respectively; extreme GDDs that expose crops to excessive heat are those above 29 \u2022 C and 30 \u2022 C for corn and soybeans, respectively (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009). We follow Ding et al. 2009 The third group of variables are household and farm characteristics, including education, farming experience, farm size, land tenure, and corn-soy ratio. Education and land tenure are binary indicators of whether the farmer has a college degree and owns the surveyed field, respectively. The number of years that the operator has managed the field is a proxy for farming experience. Farm size is the log of total cropland acreage. Corn-soy ratio is the ratio of the total acres planted with corn or soybeans to total cropland acreage. Data on these variables are from the ARMS Phase III survey. 5 The forth group of variables are farm management practices, including binary indicators for whether the surveyed field is planted with seeds containing herbicide-tolerant traits, part of a crop rotation, was planted with cover crop before, is covered by the federal crop insurance program, receives conservation payments, or is part of a nutrient management or pest management plan. We also include continuous variables that measure seeding rates and planting dates of the surveyed field. Table 2 reports weighted averages of regression variables by treatment status (i.e., CT adoption) and by commodity. A naive comparison of the weighted averages shows that corn yield of the treated fields is 3% higher than that of untreated fields, while for soybeans there is no discernible difference in yields between treatment groups. Production costs per acre are lower in treated fields than in untreated fields both for corn (-4%) and soybeans (-10%), implying that CT adoption is cost-saving."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "This section reports the empirical results, starting with the estimated propensity scores. Then we report the estimated treatment effects (both for ATT and ATU) based on PS matching and MM matching, focusing on lands not designated as highly erodible. Control and treatment units are matched exactly on state and year (for corn) to control for interstate differences in yields and across years that are explained by the observed covariates."}, {"section_title": "Propensity Score Estimation", "text": "We start by estimating propensity scores (i.e., probability of using CT) using logit regressions with all covariates listed in table 1 as linear predictors of CT adoption by crop. The estimated coefficients and marginal effects are reported in table 3. Several variables have significant (p < 0.1) positive coefficients in the corn logit regression, including drought risk measured by coefficient of variation in summer precipitation (Drought Risk 2), age, education, farm size, seeding rate, GM seed, rotation, cover crop, government payments, and corn-soy ratio. This result suggests that farmers are more likely to adopt CT when they are older, more educated, operate larger farms, and are more specialized in planting corn and soybeans. They are also more likely to adopt CT when using GM seed, growing crops in rotation, using a cover crop, receiving government payment, and facing more drought risks. In the logit regression for soybeans, only a few variables have significant coefficients, including drought risk measured by coefficient of variation in summer precipitation (p < 0.05), moderate GDDs (p < 0.1), and farm size (p < 0.1). This might be due to the sample size for soybean being relatively small, reducing the estimation efficiency. Figure 2 are histograms that present the distributions of the estimated propensity scores by treatment groups for corn (panel A) and soybeans (panel B). The main takeaway from this figure is that, overall, the treated fields have higher propensity scores than the untreated fields. To put this into perspective, we count the number of fields that have propensity scores greater than 0.9 by treatment groups. The number for treated corn and soybean fields is 160 and 223 respectively. In contrast, the number for untreated corn and soybeans fields is 8 and 10 respectively. The striking difference suggests presence of positive self-selection into treatment. More importantly, it also implies that some treated fields might not have comparable untreated fields to be matched with, especially for the treated fields with high likelihood of using CT. Thus, the common support assumption might be violated. We address this issue next."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Conservation Tillage on Crop Yields and Production Cost", "text": "Having estimated the propensity scores, we proceed to conduct one-to-one nearest neighbor PS matching and MM matching with replacement to estimate ATT and ATU for yields and production costs per acre. Each treated (or untreated) field is matched to an untreated field (or treated) field with the highest similarity in their covariates, defined by the lowest discrepancy in propensity scores or Manalanobis distance. The treatment effects are obtained by comparing the outcomes between the matched pairs, augmented by bias corrections (see Equation 5 and 6). We find that the ATT estimates for corn yields are substantially lower when a certain amount of treated fields are dropped. Specifically, the ATT estimate for corn yield by PS matching constantly reduces from 5.9% (with full sample) to about 0% when more than 400 treated fields are dropped from the sample (see figure 3-A1). For MM matching, the ATT estimate for corn yield reduces from 5% (with full sample) to about 2% when dropping 300 treated fields (see figure 3-B1); yet, unlike PS matching, the ATT estimate by MM matching stops declining when we drop more data but increases to around 3%. These results imply that our initial ATT estimate based on the full sample is likely upwards biased, possibly due to limited overlap between treated and untreated fields. As for corn production cost, both PS and MM matching produces an ATT estimate of around -3% after a certain amount of treated fields are dropped. We prefer the estimates by MM matching to the estimates by PS matching, because MM matching produces better balance, especially combined with data pruning. As shown in figure 3-B3, when dropping more than 300 treated fields, the median SMD across covariates in the matched data shrinks to 0.02 with MM matching. This is nearly half of the median SMD generated by PS matching (see figure 3-A3). The observed phenomenon that pruning with PS matching does not reduce imbalance on covariates is not unique to our study. King and Nielsen (2019) showed that this is common in real applications and referred this phenomenon to as the \"propensity score paradox\" -PS matching aims to approximate complete randomization, and after achieving this goal, further pruning increases imbalance. MM matching is not subject to the \"propensity score paradox\" and can thus be continuously effective at reducing imbalance. This is evident in figure 3-B3. Even though data pruning can be effective at improving on covariate balance and thus reducing estimation bias (Colson et al., 2016), it comes at the cost that our estimates might not represent the corn fields that are dropped from the sample. In other words, our estimates can only represent the remaining treated fields for which good matches exists. Therefore, we must carefully consider how the quantity of interests changes as balance improves. Toward this goal, we track all the dropped treated fields along with data pruning. Appendix figure S1 reports the numbers of dropped treated fields by states. Interestingly, we find that most dropped treated fields are located outside of the Corn-Belt states (i.e., Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota) that has dominated corn production in the U.S., especially at the beginning stage of data pruning. This might due to that Corn-Belt states have sufficiently large number of data observations and are relatively more homogeneous in environment and corn production, leading to high chances of finding good matches. Figure 4 is similar to figure 3 but reports the ATU estimates for corn. Again, MM matching performs better in reducing imbalance than PS matching and is thus our preferred method (see figure 4-A3, B3). The results displayed in panel B1 and B2 of figure 3 suggest that CT has a positive effect on corn yields and a negative effect on corn production costs among the untreated 13 fields. This finding is robust to potential violation of the common support assumption, because the bounds on the strength of the parameter estimate are further away from zero (i.e., larger effect) relative to the estimates based on the full sample. The issue of lacking overlap is more pronounced with the soybean data. In particular, it is hard to find good matches to the treated soybean fields that have high propensity scores, because the number of untreated soybean fields having high propensity scores is low (see figure 2). Pruning the data could potentially alleviate this issue, but a significant amount of data would have to be removed, including the observations in the Corn-Belt states, making the estimate hard to interpret. In the light of this, we focus on ATU instead, since it is easier to find comparable treated fields to be matched with untreated fields. The relevant outputs of estimating ATU for soybean yields and production costs are displayed in figure 5. A similar figure for ATT is included in the Appendix ( figure S4). We find a large positive effect of CT on soybean yield among the untreated soybean fields. Based on MM matching, the initial point estimate of ATU for soybean yields with the full sample is 5%, and this estimate increases to 6% as balance improves as a result of data pruning (see figure 5-B1). In addition, MM matching produces an ATU estimate of around -10% for soybean production cost, and this estimate is robust to data pruning. Appendix figure S3 tracks the untreated fields dropped in each state along with data pruning. It turns out that the untreated fields having good matches are mostly located in the Corn Belt states (except Minnesota). Our estimate for the treatment effect on CT on soybean yield is larger than that for corn yield as well as the estimate reported in Deines et al. (2019). This is probably due to that the soybean data being analyzed here is for the year of 2012, when a severe drought hit almost the entire U.S. Corn Belt. The actual soybean yield at the national level in 2012 was 35.2 bushels per acre, which was 18% lower than the trend yield (43 bushels per acre). So, an appropriate interpretation of our results is that CT can play a role in offsetting the negative drought impacts on soybean yields. To put this into perspective, our analysis suggests that a typical soybean field in the U.S. Corn Belt using conventional tillage with yield of 35.2 bushels per acre can produce an additional 2.1 bushels per acre, if CT has had been applied to that field. This would reduce the negative impact of drought on soybean yield from 18% to 13.3%."}, {"section_title": "Profit gains of conservation tillage adoption", "text": "In the above section, we present treatment effect estimates suggesting that CT can increase yield and reduces product cost for corn and soybeans. Now we combine the estimates to derive the effect of CT on profit. To do this, we calculate the average yields and production costs in three Corn Belt states (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana) among the untreated fields. Then we calculate their yields and production costs in a counterfactual scenario that those untreated fields have had been treated (or used CT) based on the ATU estimates. The crop prices are directly from the ARMS phase II survey. The results are reported in table 4. The results suggest that CT is a profitable conservation practice. Specifically, our estimates suggest that the profits of corn production in fields with conventional tillage could have been 52 and 53.14 dollars per acre higher than observed (112 dollars per acre and -9.54 dollars per acre) in 2010 and 2016, respectively, if those fields have had used CT. These are higher than the observed profits. The profits of soybean production in fields with conventional tillage could have been 88 dollars per acre higher than observed (155 dollars per acre) in 2012, if those fields have had used CT."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This article aims to estimate the treatment effects of Conservation Tillage (CT) on crop yields and crop profitability in the U.S. We use data from the ARMS survey that contains a large set of variables regarding production practices, farm management, and demographic information of farmers. We further link the survey data with soil and weather data from external sources. These data allow us to control for a sufficiently large set of variables that can affect adoption of conservation tillage and yields. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first observational study that controls for both biophysical factors (e.g., soil and weather) and socioeconomic variables that can affect CT (Prokopy et al., 2019;Wallander et al., 2013). Given a large set of relevant covariates, we are able to minimize the omitted variable bias that concerns the previous studies (Deines et al., 2019). To do the estimation, we employ the bias-corrected matching estimator (Abadie and Imbens, 2011) that is robust to model specification and matching discrepancy. Our analyses suggest that corn farmers using conventional tillage can likely benefit from adopting CT in improving yield (3%) and reducing production costs (-5%). We also find that CT can improve on soybean yields (6%) when there was a drought like in 2012. Due to lack of data, we are unable to examine how CT might affect soybean yields under a normal weather condition. Given the effects on yield and production cost, we show that adopting CT can provide higher profits to farmers. Note that our results should be interpreted with caution. Most treated fields in our sample have used CT for a long time. The ARMS explicitly asks farmers that in which year CT was first used on the field. The responses from farmers show that the average time length of CT adoption is 13 years, both for corn and soybeans. Hence, the treatment effects on yields, production costs, and profits reported in this article are better interpreted as long term effects. More analyses have to be conducted to assess the short run effects of CT on yields and production costs.
