In this study, we quantified the severity of 2012 drought which affected the agricultural output for much of the Midwestern US. We used several popular drought indices, including the Standardized Precipitation Index and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index with multiple time scales, Palmer Drought Severity Index, Palmer Z-index, VegDRI, and PADI by comparing the spatial distribution, temporal evolution, and crop impacts produced by each of these indices with the United States Drought Monitor. Results suggested this drought incubated around June 2011 and ended in May 2013. While different drought indices depicted drought severity variously. SPI outperformed SPEI and has decent correlation with yield loss especially at a 6 months scale and in the middle growth season, while VegDRI and PADI demonstrated the highest correlation especially in late growth season, indicating they are complementary and should be used together.

The 2012 US drought is one example of an extreme, widespread drought disaster which led to serious crop losses throughout one of the largest agricultural regions in the country [2] . In recent decades, studies have focused on a range of drought related topics, including basic concepts [3] , monitoring [4] , impacts [5] , vulnerability [6] , and mitigation [7] . In terms of monitoring, both univariate and multivariate drought indices have been proposed to assess the severity of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts separately and as a whole [8] . Severity is a major component during a drought event, which indicates a cumulative deficiency of a specified drought parameter below a critical level [9] . Drought severity should not be confused with other major components (i.e., intensity), therefore, it is worth highlighting the difference between these as PADI, compare to precipitation-based SPI in capturing the 2012 Midwestern US drought? We then use the assessment to answer the broader question: What is the ability of different drought indices to capture agricultural drought severity and impact?"}, {"section_title": "Study Area and Data", "text": "To investigate the impacts on agriculture during the 2012 drought and avoid influences from other land cover types (i.e., urban, grassland and wetlands), we extracted the cropland area in the Midwestern US, shown in Figure 1 . The Midwestern US represents one of the most intense agricultural areas in the world. The 2012 Census of Agriculture identified the Midwestern US has a market value of 182 billion dollars, producing over 93% of corn and soybeans in the total US. Corn is the dominant crop in this area and therefore was selected for the impact assessment in this study. According to the 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) conducted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), irrigated farm land in Midwestern US is about 29.3%, while 70.7% is rain-fed [35] , making it more susceptible to droughts caused by a precipitation deficit. Both precipitation and root zone soil moisture data from 1979 to 2013 are available from the North American Land Data Assimilation System-Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Particularly, monthly total precipitation and root zone soil moisture were extracted from NLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 Monthly 0.125 \u00d7 0.125 degree V002 [36] . These datasets have been validated [37] and applied in the USDM and National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) [38] .

Using the data described above, the SPI, Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) were computed as described in the methodology section. In addition, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-Vegetation Health Product (VHP) was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Center for Satellite Applications and Research. AVHRR-VHP is a reprocessed vegetation health dataset that includes multiple-indices (i.e., NDVI, VCI, and TCI) [39] . In this study, weekly VCI 4 km product from 2011 to 2013 was selected. Finally, data from the US Drought Monitor, VegDRI, Self-calibrated PDSI, SPEI, and Palmer Z-index were obtained for comparison. SPI and SPEI with 1-12 month scale were used in this study due to the relatively short growth period of corn. Details of these datasets are listed below in Table 1 . It should be noted that the datasets have different spatio-temporal resolutions and this inconformity may affect the comparison results. [48] Corn phenology information in the Midwestern US was retrieved from the USDA NASS for 2012. Three different corn growth stages are defined with their different water-stress sensitivity coefficients [49] in Table 2 and Appendix A. Based on that, it was found reproduction stage (i.e., July) is particularly vulnerable. In addition, a decadal average (2002-2012) of the planting acreage and production weight of corn were also obtained from NASS at a county-scale. Using the decadal average, the yield anomaly index (YAI) [50] of every county was calculated for 2012. YAI is designed to identify deviation of yield for a particular year from its long term trend. Based on yearly corn yield data from NASS at county-scale, the YAI for a particular year is calculated using the following formula:\nRemote Sens. 2017, 9, 767\nwhere Y is the crop yield in the particular year, \u00b5 is the long term average yield, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. Additionally, the SPEI, self-calibrated PDSI, Palmer Z-index, VegDRI, and USDM datasets were obtained from the Global SPEI database [51] , National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) [52] , West Wide Drought Tracker, United States Geological Survey (USGS), and National Drought Mitigation Center, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Drought Evolution Process Analysis", "text": "Agricultural drought depends on the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation, soil moisture, and the availability of soil moisture to cover losses from evapotranspiration. As discussed in Zhang et al. [20] , the determination of agricultural drought can be obtained by Evolution Process-based Multisensory Collaboration (EPMC) analysis.\nIn EPMC, there are four defined evolution phases in an agricultural drought, including: (a) Latency, (b) Onset, (c) Development, and (d) Recovery. Each phase corresponds to one critical change in the life cycle of an agricultural drought discussed below.\nThe latency phase describes the initial period of a precipitation deficit compared with the long-term mean. This is the start of a meteorological drought, but not the start for an agricultural drought. Due to irrigation and water storage in the soil, the root zone soil moisture will not decline dramatically during this phase. That is to say, the vegetation has not yet been influenced by the drought, though precipitation is below average.\nThe onset phase represents the period when the root zone soil moisture drops below the long-term mean. This phase indicates the start of water-stress in soil. It is known that not only different types of vegetation, but also vegetation at different growth stages, have different water-stress responses. For example, water-stress in early growth time will usually benefit deeper root development; on the contrary, water-stress in flowering time will result in serious production loss. We will take advantage of this information in calculating drought severity.\nThe development phase is the period during which the drought has fully developed. In this phase, the impacts on the vegetation caused by the drought can be detected. Here, the vegetation response to drought refers to long-term stable response by leaves, instead of daily response by stoma closure.\nThe recovery phase describes the period of water-recharge in soil. In this phase, enough rainfall helps to bring the root zone soil moisture back to normal, so the agricultural drought condition is eliminated. Though the precipitation and soil moisture return back to normal, the vegetation condition usually does not return.\nGiven this evolution process, it is more reasonable to take the preceding drought conditions into consideration when assessing drought impacts than to use the conventional method in which the conditions are refreshed periodically. To quantify these phases using a remote sensing-based approach, three indices were selected: the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). PCI, SMCI, and VCI measure the deficit (or stress) of precipitation, root zone soil moisture, and vegetation in the background of more than 30 years. They use the following formula.\nwhere Index i is the PCI (or SMCI or VCI) value in month i, while Variable i is the precipitation/soil moisture/vegetation in month i. Variable max and Variable min are the pixel values of precipitation/soil moisture/vegetation in month i, and its maximum and minimum value during more than thirty years, respectively. Before calculating the indices, outliers determined by a Grubbs test were excluded. PCI/SMCI values range from zero to one, corresponding to changes in precipitation/soil moisture conditions Remote Sens. 2017, 9, 767 6 of 22 from extremely dry to water logging. For example, during periods of low precipitation, the PCI is close or equal to zero, while during flood conditions, the PCI is close to one [53] . The selection of the threshold for determining the anomaly is a key aspect of the EPMC analysis. We tested several different threshold values for PCI, SMCI, and VCI, and concluded that a value of 0.5 was adequate to represent an anomalous precipitation/soil moisture/vegetation event. This threshold also matched well with our previous study [20] . It is worth noting that the threshold used in the EPMC analysis may differ from place to place [9] . Overall, based on the EPMC method, the evolution process of an agricultural drought can be determined, and therefore, the time length of each phase can be obtained."}, {"section_title": "Drought Indices for Comparison", "text": "A total of six drought indices were compared and evaluated based on how they portrayed the spatio-temporal characteristics and severity of the 2012 Midwestern US drought. These indices included the SPI, SPEI, PDSI, Palmer Z-index, VegDRI, and PADI. These indices are benchmarked against the crop yield loss.\nSPI was designed to be a relatively simple, robust index, which is based on precipitation alone [12] . Positive SPI values indicate greater than median precipitation, while negative values indicate less than median precipitation or drought conditions. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the SPI, but it includes the role of temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [16] . The SPEI takes into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with the simplicity of calculation and the multitemporal nature of the SPI. SPEI bears the advantage of being a multi-scalar drought index and is attractive for drought monitoring and applications related to future climate change [26] .\nPDSI is a classical measure of drought due to moisture condition across regions and time [17] , and has been widely used around the world [54] . In this study, a self-calibrated PDSI with Penman-Monteith potential evaporation was adopted [52] . The Palmer Z-index is similar to the PDSI, and reflects the departure of the meteorological conditions of a particular month from the average moisture climatology for that month, regardless of what has occurred in prior or subsequent months [18] . The VegDRI integrates satellite-based observations of vegetation conditions, climate data, and other biophysical information [19] , and has shown considerable capability in US [28] .\nPADI represents the latest multivariate drought index and its application is guided by the EPMC framework, described above. PADI is used to assess the drought severity by integrating drought evolution processes from the EPMC analysis with crop phenology information (see Appendix B). A distinct feature of PADI is the accumulative severity, which quantifies since drought onset, instead of the monthly refreshed severity calculated in SPI or VegDRI."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Drought Evolution Process", "text": "The evolution of 2012 Midwestern US drought as determined by the EPMC is shown in Figure 2 . In particular, the temporal evolutions of PCI (blue line), SMCI (brown line), and VCI (green line) in the study area from 2011 to 2013 were obtained. Corn growth period with three stages in 2012, thresholds, and four drought evolution phases with the inflection time points are marked. These three crop growth stages are marked as light green, green, and bottle green strips, respectively. These four phases are marked as faint yellow, orange, pomegranate, and light blue strips, respectively. An inflection time point presents the change of drought phases defined in EPMC. A period of time between two inflection points is the duration of one phase. It is shown in the figure that from 2011 to 2013, the drought emerged, evolved, and recovered several times. For the 2012 drought, the latency phase actually occurred around June 2011, as the PCI dropped from 0.53 to 0.44, crossing the threshold of 0.5 (discussed in the methodology section). This is the pre-phase of an agricultural drought with below-normal precipitation. Then the drought officially started around September 2011 when the SMCI decreased to 0.42 in response to the precipitation deficit. This is the start of the agricultural drought when root zone soil moisture shows deficit compared with normal value. It should be noted that VCI values were higher than normal when PCI and SMCI were lower than 0.5 during the end of 2011 and the start of 2012. There are several potential explanations for this unusual phenomenon; however, more experiments are needed. The drought persisted until July 2012, after which the development phase began with vegetation in the Midwest showing significant drought impacts. In other words, the length of onset phase in this drought was about 10 months. This time period is affected by multiple environmental variables, such as the timing of soil moisture deficit, follow-up rainfall amount, air temperature, wind speed, storage of underground water, and type of ground vegetation. Further investigation into the inherent reason that caused this long onset period is planned for future studies. It should also be noted that the SMCI reached over 0.5 in November and December 2011, while the PCI was still below 0.5. This indicates that the water deficit condition in this study area was still obvious and ongoing at that time. This means that the recovery phase did not occur, and the onset phase was still ongoing in the late months of 2011. Previous studies from Hoerling et al. [55] and Otkin et al. [28] suggested the 2012 Great Plain drought belonged to a \"flash drought\", as it developed rapidly in May 2012 and had reached peak intensity by that August. The total duration of this drought event is only 4 months. This result can be seen in Figure 2 , where there was a dramatic decrease of vegetation condition and precipitation in May 2012. However, using the EPMC method, we found that this change was simply an intensification of long-term drought that had been developing since September 2011. In other words, the Midwestern US actually had been under water deficit long before May 2012, which was not found in previous studies. The key to this result was the use of multiple drought indices in the EPMC framework, through which the drought evolution process becomes traceable. Similar results were also obtained by replacing PCI and SMCI with SPI-1 and SSI-1, as shown in Supplementary Materials Figure S1 . Therefore, our study demonstrated that this multi-index integrated analysis method was a useful way to uncover the creeping manifestation of agriculture drought.\nBased on the above divisions of this drought event, the length of each drought phase can be calculated in days [20] . The corn growth phase in 2012 (30 April to 7 September, as shown in Figure  2 ) was impacted by 77 days of drought onset and 54 days of drought development. On the contrary, corn only had 6 days and 37 days of drought onset in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Therefore, only considering the drought duration, the 2012 drought can be considered highly notable. The sensitivity of corn to drought stress is higher in silking stage, but lower in grain filling (blister to dent) and vegetative development (pre-silking), as discussed by Niyogi and Mishra [56] . As shown in the Figure 2 , the drought development phase started in the reproduction stages, indicating the potential for significant impacts on the corn yield, as shown in the statistical data [2] .

In addition to PADI, VegDRI also performed well in identifying drought severity in terms of yield (\u03c1 It is shown that PADI had the highest correlation with YAI, with correlation value (\u03c1) of \u22120.74. In addition to PADI, VegDRI also performed well in identifying drought severity in terms of yield (\u03c1 was 0.61, and 0.32 when only drought condition was considered). Out of the three univariate indices integrated in EPMC, PCI had good correlation with YAI (\u03c1 was \u22120.58, and \u22120.54 when only drought condition was considered), which was consistent with the finding of Zhang et al. [20] . SMCI and VCI on the other hand had weak correlations, consistent with the findings of Otkin et al. [28] . Given that PADI is calculated by integrating SMCI and VCI, this correlation result demonstrated the added value of PADI in modeling drought severity by fusing multiple sources of information. The Palmer Z-index and PDSI had poor feasibility as an indicator for yield loss caused by drought. As meteorological drought indicators, SPI and SPEI also had weak correlations with YAI. Interestingly, the SPI showed better performance than SPEI. The highest correlation of 0.34 occurred in SPI-6 and -9 indices. The best SPEI index was the SPEI-1, with the highest correlation value of 0.48. This result indicated meteorological drought with 1-9 month scales had more significant impacts on corn yield loss in Midwestern US 2012. When only drought conditions were taken into consideration, similar patterns were observed: SPI-6 and -9 had the highest correlation values of 0.29 and 0.28, and SPEI-6 and -9 highest correlation values were 0.23 and 0.24.\nAs discussed in the Introduction, the crop-specific SPEI can improve the accuracy when calculating water balance for a specific crop land. Therefore, more studies will be needed in the future to test this crop-specific SPEI in quantifying drought severity compared with traditional SPEI. To assess the robustness of PADI in different sub-regions, its correlation with YAI was investigated for different states in the US Midwest as shown in Figure 8 . It was found that PADI showed quite stable performance across the Midwest. Mean correlation value was \u22120.70, ranging from \u22120.38 (Missouri) to \u22120.87 (Michigan). Therefore, within the different drought indices considered, PADI was a good indicator for quantifying drought severity from yield loss. In terms of impact assessment, studies suggested that soil moisture can be one but not the only aspect in assessing agricultural drought severity. This is reflected in the correlation between YAI and SMCI which was only \u22120.34.

[20] . SMCI and VCI on the other hand had weak correlations, consistent with the findings of Otkin et al. [28] . Given that PADI is calculated by integrating SMCI and VCI, this correlation result demonstrated the added value of PADI in modeling drought severity by fusing multiple sources of information. The Palmer Z-index and PDSI had poor feasibility as an indicator for yield loss caused by drought. As meteorological drought indicators, SPI and SPEI also had weak correlations with YAI. Interestingly, the SPI showed better performance than SPEI. The highest correlation of 0.34 occurred in SPI-6 and -9 indices. The best SPEI index was the SPEI-1, with the highest correlation value of 0.48. This result indicated meteorological drought with 1-9 month scales had more significant impacts on corn yield loss in Midwestern US 2012. When only drought conditions were taken into consideration, similar patterns were observed: SPI-6 and -9 had the highest correlation values of 0.29 and 0.28, and SPEI-6 and -9 highest correlation values were 0.23 and 0.24. As discussed in the Introduction, the crop-specific SPEI can improve the accuracy when calculating water balance for a specific crop land. Therefore, more studies will be needed in the future to test this crop-specific SPEI in quantifying drought severity compared with traditional SPEI. To assess the robustness of PADI in different sub-regions, its correlation with YAI was investigated for different states in the US Midwest as shown in Figure 8 . It was found that PADI showed quite stable performance across the Midwest. Mean correlation value was \u22120.70, ranging from \u22120.38 (Missouri) to \u22120.87 (Michigan). Therefore, within the different drought indices considered, PADI was a good indicator for quantifying drought severity from yield loss. In terms of impact assessment, studies suggested that soil moisture can be one but not the only aspect in assessing agricultural drought severity. This is reflected in the correlation between YAI and SMCI which was only \u22120.34. Again, PADI as an integrative index, demonstrated the value added by combining soil moisture with drought duration and crop phenology. As shown in Table 4 , in different states with different irrigation rates, there was a small advantage of soil moisture integrated drought index (i.e., PADI and VegDRI) in irrigated area compared with drought indices without soil moisture information (i.e., SPI-1 and SPEI-1). In less irrigated area, this advantage was greater. However, it is difficult to quantify the value added by soil moisture in PADI and VegDRI; therefore, we conclude that adding soil moisture alone could lead to a theoretical improvement in agricultural drought assessment, however, this single improvement not be obvious in yield loss analysis due to the complex mechanism of agricultural drought and crop yield. There are many variables that play roles in causing an agricultural drought, and as many as possible should be taken into consideration when assessing the impacts of such droughts.

(2) SPI basically performed better than SPEI, which is consistent with the results in Section 4.3. (3) SPI-6 and SPEI-6 were the two best indicators to represent yield loss among all SPIs and SPEIs.

Their variables, modeling approaches, performances in drought severity, correlation with YAI, and features were analyzed. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Gauging the severity of drought is critical for precisely assessing drought impacts. It becomes more challenging due to numerous drought indices we have [34] . This study investigated the severity of the 2012 Midwestern US drought based on several popular drought indices, including precipitation based, vegetation based, and hybrid indices. In particular, PDSI, Palmer Z-index, VegDRI, PADI, SPIs, SPEIs, were compared along with the USDM. The drought severity was assessed from three aspects: spatial distribution, temporal evolution, and crop impacts. This study had several new findings in assessing 2012 US drought compared with existing studies [2, 28, 33, 55] . It was concluded as follows.\nAccording to EPMC analysis, the duration of the 2012 Midwestern US agricultural drought was 20 months. It began as a meteorological drought around June 2011, developed into a minor agricultural drought around September 2011, intensified around July 2012, and was eliminated by May 2013. This finding is different from previous studies [28, 55] , which suggested this drought belonged to a \"flash drought\", as it developed rapidly in May and reached peak intensity by August. And the total duration of this drought event was only 4 months. Based on our analysis, not only this dramatic change was detected, but also found this change was just the intensification of long lingered 2012 drought since September 2011. In other words, the Midwestern US actually had been under water deficit long before May 2012, which was ignored by previous studies. Only few studies like [2, 33] has revealed part of this fact. Therefore, our study demonstrated this multi-index integrated analysis was able to fully uncover the creeping manifestation of agriculture drought.\nAlthough drought spatial distribution of severity varied among different indices as pointed out by [2] , southern and central regions, especially NE, KS, IA, and IL were impacted most during the 2012 Midwestern US drought. Different drought emerging places and relief places were determined by different indices. For example, most indices suggested drought relief in IL and IN from August to September (PDSI increased from \u22123.60 to \u22122.67, Palmer Z-index increased from \u22120.38 to 1.54); however, only VegDRI and PADI still indicated extreme drought condition (PADI increased from 0.27 to 0.38). The unique feature of PADI is also distinct, which is designed for accumulative drought impact assessment, instead of periodic refreshment.\nAccording to PADI, 51% of the Midwest was impacted by exceptional drought, 27% by extreme drought, and nearly 20% by severe drought, and KS, IA, MO, WI, and IL had the most impact, which is basically consistent with [55] . Moreover, PDSI and PADI agreed well with USDM in terms of the percentage of evolution. Spearman's rank correlation between PADI and USDM in percentage of different drought categories was 0.87 **, 0.27, 0.71 **, 0.80 **, and 0.83 **, respectively. This finding highlights the advantage of considering an accumulated drought impact index.\nWith regard to the ability in representing yield loss by drought stress, PADI and VegDRI had the highest significant correlation with corn yield loss (\u03c1 was 0.74 and 0.61, p < 0.01), better than precipitation, soil moisture, or vegetation based index alone in September. It was also found that PADI showed quite stable performance across the Midwest. Mean correlation value was \u22120.70, ranging from \u22120.38 (Missouri) to \u22120.87 (Michigan). In addition, strong correlation between PADI and corn yield was noted a month before harvest (\u03c1 was around 0.7, p < 0.01) and increased substantially until the end of the drought event. This result highlighted the value of PADI in quantifying the drought impacts [2] using a remote sensing-based approach.\nFor comparison, the coefficient of SPI/SPEI with YAI was higher in July (mean value was 0.63 when using SPI-6), while lower in May and September (mean value was 0.37 and 0.34, respectively using SPI-6). This result emphasized the importance of choosing a critical period when using SPI/SPEI [29] , and an appropriate time scale is also vital [25] . Although both SPI and SPEI in middle growth season had the highest coefficients with YAI, SPI basically performed better than SPEI. This finding highlights the effectivity of SPI [26] , but it is different from [24, 31] which suggested SPEI was better. The correlation coefficient of VCI with YAI showed double peaks. On peak reached up to 0.60 on 25 June and the other reached up to 0.66 on 30 July. While the lowest correlation coefficients around 0.30 occurred at the beginning and end of this drought. Besides that, the number of coefficient values with p < 0.05 was only 46.7% and 26.3% in SPI and VCI, while this number was 98.7% in PADI. PDSI and Palmer Z-index had weak correlation with yield loss, which is consistent with [24] but different from [30] . The above comparison between this study and previous studies did not represent which one is right or wrong because of different drought assessment approaches. Instead, this discrepancy highlights the importance of site-specific drought research [33] and a standardized drought database for thorough comparison in the future. Based on this study, PADI is especially more suitable in late period of drought event, while it should also be used together with other indices like SPI in early and middle drought periods.\nThis study demonstrated the advantages and limitations of different drought indices in drought monitoring. In particular, distinct features of hybrid drought index like PADI have been found, compare to only precipitation-based SPI, vegetation-based VCI, and other hybrid indices. This is the first comprehensive analysis of PADI in US, as there was only a brief discussion in China before [20] . Although this study selected the 2012 Midwestern US drought as a case study, it also can be easily applied over other regions. And we also emphasis that we should not use single drought index alone.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/8/767/s1, Figure S1 : The temporal evolution from 2011 to 2013 of SPI-1, SSI-1, and VCI in the study area under the EPMC, Figure S2 : Details of 2012 Midwest US drought evolution spanning from May to September 2012 from perspectives of multi-drought indices, including USDM, PDSI, Palmer Z-index, VegDRI, PADI, 1-12 month SPI, and SPEI, Figure S3 : Scattering plot between YAI and nine drought indices (PADI, PCI, SMCI, VCI, PDSI, VegDRI, Palmer Z-index, SPIs (SPI-1, -3, -6, -9, and -12) and SPEIs (SPEI-1, -3, -6, -9, and -12)) based on all counties in the study area, Figure S4 : Selected nine climate divisions in the study area for testing the relationship between drought category and yield loss, Figure S5 : Drought category and corresponding yield anomaly index of USDM, PDSI, Palmer Z-index, VegDRI, PADI, SPIs, and SPEIs with YAI in the early growth season (May), Figure S6 : Same as Figure S5 , except in the middle growth season (July), Figure S7 : Same as Figure S6 , except in the late growth season (September)."}]
