[{"section_title": "[Introduction]", "text": "Pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is now responsible for massive human morbidity and mortality worldwide (1\u20135). The virus was first documented to cause severe respiratory infections in Wuhan, China, beginning in late December 2019 (6\u20139). Global dissemination occurred extremely rapidly and has affected major population centers on most continents (10, 11). In the United States, the Seattle and the New York City (NYC) regions have been especially important centers of COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. For example, as of August 19, 2020, there were 227,419 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in NYC, causing 56,831 hospitalizations and 19,005 confirmed fatalities and 4,638 probable fatalities (12). Similarly, in Seattle and King County, 17,989 positive patients and 696 deaths have been reported as of August 18, 2020 (13).\nThe Houston metropolitan area is the fourth largest and most ethnically diverse city in the United States, with a population of approximately 7 million (14, 15). The 2,400-bed Houston Methodist health system has seven hospitals and serves a large, multiethnic, and socioeconomically diverse patient population throughout greater Houston (13, 14). The first COVID-19 case in metropolitan Houston was reported on March 5, 2020 with community spread occurring one week later (16). Many of the first cases in our region were associated with national or international travel in areas known to have SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreaks (16). A central molecular diagnostic laboratory serving all Houston Methodist hospitals and our very early adoption of a molecular test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus permitted us to rapidly identify positive patients and interrogate genomic variation among strains causing early infections in the greater Houston area. Our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes causing disease in Houston has continued unabated since early March and is ongoing. Genome sequencing and related efforts were expanded extensively in late May as we recognized that a prominent second wave was underway (Figure 1).\nHere, we report that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to the Houston area many times, independently, from diverse geographic regions, with virus genotypes representing genetic clades causing disease in Europe, Asia, South America and elsewhere in the United States. There was widespread community dissemination soon after COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston. Strains with a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and in vitro cell infectivity, increased significantly over time and caused virtually all COVID-19 cases in the massive second disease wave. Patients infected with strains with the Gly614 variant had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. Some naturally occurring single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein resulted in decreased reactivity with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, consistent with the idea that some virus variants arise due to host immune pressure."}, {"section_title": "Description of metropolitan Houston. ::: RESULTS", "text": "Houston, Texas, is located in the southwestern United States, 50 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. It is the most ethnically diverse city in the United States (14). Metropolitan Houston is comprised predominantly of Harris County plus parts of eight contiguous surrounding counties. In the aggregate, the metropolitan area includes 9,444 square miles. The estimated population size of metropolitan Houston is 7 million (https://www.houston.org/houston-data)."}, {"section_title": "Epidemic curve characteristics over two disease waves. ::: RESULTS", "text": "The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Houston metropolitan region was reported on March 5, 2020 (16), and the first confirmed case diagnosed in Houston Methodist hospitals was reported on March 6, 2020. The epidemic curve indicated a first wave of COVID-19 cases that peaked around April 11\u201315, followed by a decline in cases until May 11. Soon thereafter, the slope of the case curve increased with a very sharp uptick in confirmed cases beginning on June 12 (Figure 1B). We consider May 11 as the transition between waves, as this date is the inflection point of the cumulative new cases curve and had the absolute lowest number of new cases in the mid-May time period. Thus, for the data presented herein, wave 1 is defined as March 5 through May 11, 2020, and wave 2 is defined as May 12 through July 7, 2020. Epidemiologic trends within the Houston Methodist Hospital population were mirrored by data from Harris County and the greater metropolitan Houston region (Figure 1A). Through the 7th of July, 25,366 COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston, 37,776 cases in Harris County, and 53,330 in metropolitan Houston, including 9,823 cases in Houston Methodist facilities (inpatients and outpatients) (https://www.tmc.edu/coronavirus-updates/infection-rate-in-the-greater-houston-area/ and https://harriscounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/c0de71f8ea484b85bb5efcb7c07c6914).\nDuring the first wave (early March through May 11), 11,476 COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston, including 1,729 cases in the Houston Methodist Hospital system. Early in the first wave (from March 5 through March 30, 2020), we tested 3,080 patient specimens. Of these, 406 (13.2%) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, representing 40% (358/898) of all confirmed cases in metropolitan Houston during that time period. As our laboratory was the first hospital-based facility to have molecular testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 available on site, our strain samples are likely representative of COVID-19 infections during the first wave.\nFor the entire study period (March 5 through July 7, 2020), we tested 68,418 specimens from 55,800 patients. Of these, 9,121 patients (16.4%) had a positive test result, representing 17.1% (9,121/53,300) of all confirmed cases in metropolitan Houston. Thus, our strain samples are also representative of those responsible for COVID-19 infections in the massive second wave.\nTo test the hypothesis that, on average, the two waves affected different groups of patients, we analyzed individual patient characteristics (hospitalized and non-hospitalized) in each wave. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found significant differences in the COVID-19 patients in each wave (Table S1). For example, patients in the second wave were significantly younger, had fewer comorbidities, were more likely to be Hispanic/Latino (by self-report), and lived in zip codes with lower median incomes (Table S1). A detailed analysis of the characteristics of patients hospitalized in Houston Methodist facilities in the two waves has recently been published (17)."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. ::: RESULTS", "text": "To investigate the genomic architecture of the virus across the two waves, we sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains dating to the earliest time of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Houston. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains causing disease in the first wave (March 5 through May 11) identified the presence of many diverse virus genomes that, in the aggregate, represent the major clades identified globally to date (Figure 1B). Clades G, GH, GR, and S were the four most abundantly represented phylogenetic groups (Figure 1B). Strains with the Gly614 amino acid variant in spike protein represented 82% of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in wave 1, and 99.9% in wave 2 (p<0.0001; Fisher\u2019s exact test) (Figure 1B). This spike protein variant is characteristic of clades G, GH, and GR. Importantly, strains with the Gly614 variant represented only 71% of the specimens sequenced in March, the early part of wave 1 (Figure 1B). We attribute the decrease in strains with this variant observed in the first two weeks of March (Figure 1B) to fluctuation caused by the relatively fewer COVID-19 cases occurring during this period."}, {"section_title": "Relating spatiotemporal genome analysis with virus genotypes over two disease waves. ::: RESULTS", "text": "We examined the spatial and temporal mapping of genomic data to investigate community spread during wave 1 (Figure 2). Rapid and widespread community dissemination occurred soon after the initial COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston. The heterogenous virus genotypes present very early in wave 1 indicate that multiple strains independently entered metropolitan Houston, rather than introduction and spread of a single strain. An important observation was that strains of most of the individual subclades were distributed over broad geographic areas (Figure S1). These findings are consistent with the known ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread very rapidly from person to person."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between virus clades, clinical characteristics of infected patients, and additional metadata. ::: RESULTS", "text": "It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 genome subtypes have different clinical characteristics, analogous to what is believed to have occurred with Ebola virus (18\u201320) and known to occur for other pathogenic microbes (21). As an initial examination of this issue in SARS-CoV-2, we tested the hypothesis that patients with disease severe enough to warrant hospitalization were infected with a non-random subset of virus genotypes. We also examined the association between virus clades and disease severity based on overall mortality, highest level of required care (intensive care unit, intermediate care unit, inpatient or outpatient), need for mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. There was no simple relationship between virus clades and disease severity using these four indicators. Similarly, there was no simple relationship between virus clades and other metadata, such as sex, age, or ethnicity (Figure S2)."}, {"section_title": "Machine learning analysis. ::: RESULTS", "text": "Machine learning models can be used to identify complex relationships not revealed by statistical analyses. We built machine learning models to test the hypothesis that virus genome sequence can predict patient outcomes including mortality, length of stay, level of care, ICU admission, supplemental oxygen use, and mechanical ventilation. Models to predict outcomes based on virus genome sequence alone resulted in low F1 scores less than 50% (0.41 \u2013 0.49) and regression models showed similarly low R2 values (\u22120.01 \u2013 \u22120.20) (Table S2). F1 scores near 50% are indicative of classifiers that are performing similarly to random chance. The use of patient metadata alone to predict patient outcome improved the model\u2019s F1 scores by 5\u201310% (0.51 \u2013 0.56) overall. The inclusion of patient metadata with virus genome sequence data improved most predictions of outcomes, compared to genome sequence alone, to 50% to 55% F1 overall (0.42 \u2013 0.55) in the models (Table S2). The findings are indicative of two possibilities that are not mutually exclusive. First, patient metadata, such as age and sex, may provide more signal for the model to use and thus result in better accuracies. Second, the model\u2019s use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may have resulted in overfitting. Most importantly, no SNP predicted a significant difference in outcome. A table of classifier accuracy scores and performance information is provided in Table S2."}, {"section_title": "Patient outcome and metadata correlations. ::: RESULTS", "text": "Overall, very few metadata categories correlated with patient outcomes (Table S3). Mortality was independently correlated with increasing age, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) equal to 0.27. This means that 27% of the variation in mortality can be predicted from patient age. Length of stay correlated independently with increasing age (PCC=0.20). All other patient metadata correlations to outcomes had PCC less than 0.20 (Table S3).\nWe further analyzed outcomes correlated to isolates from wave 1 and 2, and the presence of the Gly614 variant in spike protein. Being in wave 1 was independently correlated with mechanical ventilation days, overall length of stay, and ICU length of stay, with PCC equal to 0.20, 0.18, and 0.14, respectively. Importantly, the presence of the Gly614 variant did not correlate with patient outcomes (Table S3)."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the nsp12 polymerase gene. ::: RESULTS", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also referred to as Nsp12) used in virus replication (22\u201325). Two amino acid substitutions (Phe479Leu and Val556Leu) in RdRp each confer significant resistance in vitro to remdesivir, an adenosine analog (26). Remdesivir is inserted into RNA chains by RdRp during replication, resulting in premature termination of RNA synthesis and inhibition of virus replication. This compound has shown prophylactic and therapeutic benefit against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection in rhesus macaques (27, 28). Recent reports indicate that remdesivir has therapeutic benefit in some COVID-19 hospitalized patients (29\u201333), leading it to be now widely used in patients worldwide. Thus, it may be important to understand variation in RdRp in large strain samples.\nTo acquire data about allelic variation in the nsp12 gene, we analyzed our 5,085 virus genomes. The analysis identified 265 SNPs, including 140 nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) SNPs, resulting in amino acid replacements throughout the protein (Table 1, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure S3, and Figure S4). The most common amino acid change was Pro322Leu, identified in 4,893 of the 5,085 (96%) patient isolates. This amino acid replacement is common in genomes from clades G, GH, and GR, which are distinguished from other SARS-CoV-2 clades by the presence of the Gly614 amino acid change in the spike protein. Most of the other amino acid changes in RdRp were present in relatively small numbers of strains, and some have been identified in other isolates in a publicly available database (34). Five prominent exceptions included amino acid replacements: Ala15Val in 138 strains, Met462Ile in 59 strains, Met600Ile in 75 strains, Thr907Ile in 45 strains, and Pro917Ser in 80 strains. All 75 Met600Ile strains were phylogenetically closely related members of clade G, and also had the Pro322Leu amino acid replacement characteristic of this clade (Figure S3). These data indicate that the Met600Ile change is likely the evolved state, derived from a precursor strain with the Pro322Leu replacement. Similarly, we investigated phylogenetic relationships among strains with the other four amino acid changes noted above. In all cases, the vast majority of strains with each amino acid replacement were found among individual subclades of strains (Figure S3).\nImportantly, none of the observed amino acid polymorphisms in RdRp were located precisely at two sites known to cause in vitro resistance to remdesivir (26). Most of the amino acid changes are located distantly from the RNA-binding and catalytic sites (Figure S4 and Table 1). However, replacements at six amino acid residues (Ala442Val, Ala448Val, Ala553Pro/Val, Gly682Arg, Ser758Pro, and Cys812Phe) may potentially interfere with either remdesivir binding or RNA synthesis. Four (Ala442Val, Ala448Val, Ala553Pro/Val, and Gly682Arg) of the six substitution sites are located immediately above the nucleotide-binding site, that is comprised of Lys544, Arg552, and Arg554 residues as shown by structural studies (Figure 4). The positions of these four variant amino acid sites are comparable to Val556 (Figure 4), for which a Val556Leu mutation in SARS-CoV was identified to confer resistance to remdesivir in vitro (26). The other two substitutions (Ser758Pro and Cys812Phe) are inferred to be located either at, or in the immediate proximity of, the catalytic active site, that is comprised of three contiguous residues (Ser758, Asp759, and Asp760). A proline substitution we identified at Ser758 (Ser758Pro) is likely to negatively impact RNA synthesis. Although Cys812 is not directly involved in the catalysis of RNA synthesis, it is only 3.5 \u00c5 away from Asp760. The introduction of the bulkier phenylalanine substitution at Cys812 (Cys812Phe) may impair RNA synthesis. Consequently, these two substitutions are expected to detrimentally affect virus replication or fitness."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the gene encoding the spike protein. ::: RESULTS", "text": "The densely glycosylated spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its close coronavirus relatives binds directly to host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells (35\u201337). Thus, the spike protein is a major translational research target, including intensive vaccine and therapeutic antibody (35\u201364). Analysis of the gene encoding the spike protein identified 470 SNPs, including 285 that produce amino acid changes (Table 2, Figure 5). Forty-nine of these replacements (V11A, T51A, W64C, I119T, E156Q, S205A, D228G, L229W, P230T, N234D, I235T, T274A, A288V, E324Q, E324V, S325P, S349F, S371P, S373P, T385I, A419V, C480F, Y495S, L517F, K528R, Q628E, T632I, S708P, T719I, P728L, S746P, E748K, G757V, V772A, K814R, D843N, S884A, M902I, I909V, E918Q, S982L, M1029I, Q1142K, K1157M, Q1180R, D1199A, C1241F, C1247G, and V1268A) are not represented in a publicly available database (34) as of August 19, 2020. Interestingly, 25 amino acid sites have three distinct variants (that is, the reference amino acid plus two additional variant amino acids), and five amino acid sites (amino acid positions 21, 27, 228, 936, and 1050) have four distinct variants represented in our sample of 5,085 genomes (Table 2, Figure 5).\nWe mapped the location of amino acid replacements onto a model of the full-length spike protein (35, 65) and observed that the substitutions are found in each subunit and domain of the spike (Figure 6). However, the distribution of amino acid changes is not uniform throughout the protein regions. For example, compared to some other regions of the spike protein, the RBD has relatively few amino acid changes, and the frequency of strains with these substitutions is low, each occurring in fewer than 10 isolates. This finding is consistent with the functional constraints on RBD to mediate interaction with ACE2. In contrast, the periphery of the S1 subunit NTD contains a dense cluster of substituted residues, with some single amino acid replacements found in 10\u201320 isolates (Table 2, Figure 5, Figure 6). Clustering of amino acid changes in a distinct region of the spike protein may be a signal of positive selection. Inasmuch as infected patients make antibodies against the NTD, we favor the idea that host immune selection is one force contributing to some of the amino acid variation in this region. One NTD substitution, H49Y, was found in 142 isolates. This position is not well exposed on the surface of the NTD and is likely not a result of immune pressure. The same is true for another highly represented substitution, F1052L. This substitution was observed in 167 isolates, and F1052 is buried within the core of the S2 subunit. The substitution observed most frequently in the spike protein in our sample is D614G, a change observed in 4,895 of the isolates. As noted above, strains with the Gly614 variant significantly increased in wave 2 compared to wave 1.\nAs observed with RdRp, the majority of strains with each single amino acid change in the spike protein were found on a distinct phylogenetic lineage (Figure S5), indicating identity by descent. A prominent exception is the Leu5Phe replacement that is present in all major clades, suggesting that this amino acid change arose multiple times independently or very early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Finally, we note that examination of the phylogenetic distribution of strains with multiple distinct amino acid replacements at the same site (e.g., Arg21Ile/Lys/Thr, Ala27Ser/Thr/Val, etc.) revealed that they were commonly found in different genetic branches, consistent with independent origin (Figure S5)."}, {"section_title": "Cycle threshold (Ct) comparison of SARS-CoV-2 strains with either the Asp614 or Gly614 amino acid replacements in spike protein. ::: RESULTS", "text": "It has been reported that patients infected with strains having spike protein Gly614 variant have, on average, higher virus loads on initial diagnosis (66\u201370). To determine if this is the case in Houston strains, we examined the cycle threshold (Ct) for every sequenced strain that was detected from a patient specimen using the SARS-CoV-2 Assay done by the Hologic Panther instrument. We identified a significant difference (p<0.0001) between the mean Ct value for strains with an Asp614 (n=102) or Gly614 (n=812) variant of the spike protein (Figure 7). Strains with Gly614 had a Ct value significantly lower than strains with the Asp614 variant, indicating that patients infected with the Gly614 strains had, on average, higher virus loads on initial diagnosis than patients infected by strains with the Asp614 variant (Figure 7). This observation is consistent with the conjecture that, on average, strains with the Gly614 variant are better able to disseminate."}, {"section_title": "Characterization of recombinant proteins with single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain region of spike protein. ::: RESULTS", "text": "The RBD of spike protein binds the ACE2 surface receptor and is also targeted by neutralizing (36, 37, 41, 43\u201346, 48\u201362, 71). Thus, single amino acid replacements in this domain may have functional consequences that enhance virus fitness. To begin to test this idea, we expressed spike variants with the Asp614Gly replacement and 13 clinical RBD variants identified in our genome sequencing studies (Figure 8, Table S4A, B). All RBD variants were cloned into an engineered spike protein construct that stabilizes the perfusion state and increases overall expression yield (spike-6P, here referred to as spike) (64).\nWe first assessed the biophysical properties of spike-Asp614Gly, an amino acid polymorphism that is common globally and increased significantly in our wave 2 strain isolates. Pseudotyped viruses expressing spike-Gly614 have higher infectivity for host cells in vitro than spike-Asp614 (66, 67, 69, 72, 73). The higher infectivity of spike-Gly614 is correlated with increased stability and incorporation of the spike protein into the pseudovirion (73). We observed a higher expression level (Figure 8A, B) and increased thermostability for the spike protein construct containing this variant (Figure 8C, D). The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) elution profile of spike-Asp614 was indistinguishable from spike-Gly614, consistent with a trimeric conformation (Figure 8A). These results are broadly consistent with higher-resolution structural analyses of both spike variants.\nNext, we purified and biophysically characterized 13 RBD mutants that each contain Gly614 and one additional single amino acid replacement we identified by genome sequencing our clinical samples (Table S4C). All variants eluted as trimers, indicating the global structure, remained intact (Figure 8 and Figure S6). However, several variants had reduced expression levels and virtually all had decreased thermostability relative to the variant that had only a D614G single amino acid replacement (Figure 8D). The A419V and A522V mutations were especially deleterious, reducing yield and precluding further downstream analysis (Figure 8B). We next assayed the affinity of the 11 highest-expressing spike variants for ACE2 and the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR3022 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Figure 8E\u2013G and Table S4C). Most variants retained high affinity for the ACE2 surface receptor. However, importantly, three RBD variants (F338L, S373P, and R408T) had substantially reduced affinity for CR3022, a monoclonal antibody that disrupts the spike protein homotrimerization interface (63, 74). Notably, the S373P mutation is one amino acid away from the epitope recognized by CR3022. These results are consistent with the interpretation that some RBD mutants arising in COVID-19 patients may have increased ability to escape humoral immune pressure, but otherwise retain strong ACE2 binding affinity."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this work we analyzed the molecular population genomics, sociodemographic, and medical features of two waves of COVID-19 disease occurring in metropolitan Houston, Texas, between early March and early July 2020. We also studied the biophysical and immunologic properties of some naturally occurring single amino acid changes in the spike protein RBD identified by sequencing the 5,085 genomes. We discovered that the first COVID-19 wave was caused by a heterogenous array of virus genotypes assigned to several different clades. The majority of cases in the first wave are related to strains that caused widespread disease in European and Asian countries, as well as other localities. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was introduced into Houston many times independently, likely by individuals who had traveled to or from different parts of the world, including other communities in the United States. In support of this conclusion, the first cases in metropolitan Houston were associated with a travel history to a known COVID-19 region (16). The data are consistent with the fact that Houston is a large international city characterized by a multi-ethnic population and is a prominent transport hub with direct flights to major cities globally.\nThe second wave of COVID-19 cases also is characterized by SARS-CoV-2 strains with diverse genotypes. Virtually all cases in the second and ongoing disease wave were caused by strains with the Gly614 variant of spike protein (Figure 1B). Our data unambiguously demonstrate that strains with the Gly614 variant increased significantly in frequency in wave 2 relative to wave 1 in the Houston metropolitan region. This shift occurred very rapidly in a matter of just a few months. Amino acid residue Asp614 is located in subdomain 2 (SD-2) of the spike protein and forms a hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction with two residues in the S2 subunit of a neighboring protomer. Replacement of aspartate with glycine would eliminate both interactions, thereby substantively weakening the contact between the S1 and S2 subunits. We previously speculated (75) that this weakening produces a more fusogenic spike protein, as S1 must first dissociate from S2 before S2 can refold and mediate fusion of virus and cell membranes. Stated another way, virus strains with the Gly614 variant may be better able to enter host cells, potentially resulting in enhanced spread. Consistent with this idea, Korber et al. (66) showed that the Gly614 variant grows to higher titer as pseudotyped virions. On initial diagnosis infected individuals had lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds suggesting higher upper respiratory tract viral loads. Our data (Figure 7) are fully consistent with that finding Zhang et al. (73) reported that pseudovirus with the 614Gly variant infected ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than the 614Asp. Similar results have been described by Hu et al. (67) and Lorenzo-Redondo et al. (68). Plante et al. (76) recently studied isogenic mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains with either the 614Asp or 614Gly variant and found that the 614Gly variant virus had significantly increased replication in human lung epithelial cells in vitro and increased infectious titers in nasal and trachea washes obtained from experimentally infected hamsters. These results are consistent with the idea that the 614Gly variant bestows increased virus fitness in the upper respiratory tract (76).\nAdditional work is needed to investigate the potential biomedical relevance and public health importance of the Asp614Gly polymorphism, including but not limited to virus dissemination, overall fitness, impact on clinical course and virulence, and development of vaccines and therapeutics. Although it is possible that stochastic processes alone may account for the rapid increase in COVID-19 disease frequency caused by viruses containing the Gly614 variant, we do not favor that interpretation in part because of the cumulative weight of the epidemiologic, human RT-PCR diagnostics data, in vitro experimental findings, and animal infection studies using isogenic mutant virus strains. In addition, if stochastic processes solely are responsible, we believe it is difficult to explain essentially simultaneous increase in frequency of the Gly614 variant in genetically diverse viruses in three distinct clades (G, GH, and GR) in a geographically large metropolitan area with 7 million ethnically diverse people. Regardless, more research on this important topic is warranted.\nThe diversity present in our 1,026 virus genomes from the first disease wave contrasts somewhat with data reported by Gonzalez-Reiche et al., who studied 84 SARS-CoV-2 isolates causing disease in patients in the New York City region (11). Those investigators concluded that the vast majority of disease was caused by progeny of strains imported from Europe. Similarly, Bedford et al. (10) reported that much of the COVID-19 disease in the Seattle, Washington area was caused by strains that are progeny of a virus strain recently introduced from China. Some aspects of our findings are similar to those reported recently by Lemieux et al. based on analysis of strains causing disease in the Boston area (81). Our findings, like theirs, highlight the importance of multiple importation events of genetically diverse strains in the epidemiology of COVID-19 disease in this pandemic. Similarly, Icelandic and Brazilian investigators documented that SARS-CoV-2 was imported by individuals traveling to or from many European and other countries (82, 83).\nThe virus genome diversity and large sample size in our study permitted us to test the hypothesis that distinct virus clades were nonrandomly associated with hospitalized COVID-19 patients or disease severity. We did not find evidence to support this hypothesis, but our continuing study of COVID-19 cases accruing in the second wave will further improve statistical stratification.\nWe used machine learning classifiers to identify if any SNPs contribute to increased infection severity or otherwise affect virus-host outcome. The models could not be trained to accurately predict these outcomes from the available virus genome sequence data. This may be due to sample size or class imbalance. However, we do not favor this interpretation. Rather, we think that the inability to identify particular virus SNPs predictive of disease severity or infection outcome likely reflects the substantial heterogeneity in underlying medical conditions and treatment regimens among COVID-19 patients studied herein. An alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that patient genotypes play an important role in determining virus-human interactions and resulting pathology. Although some evidence has been presented in support of this idea (84, 85), available data suggest that in the aggregate, host genetics does not play an overwhelming role in determining outcome in the great majority of adult patients, once virus infection is established.\nRemdesivir is a nucleoside analog reported to have activity against MERS-CoV, a coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, several studies have reported that remdesivir shows promise in treating COVID-19 patients (29\u201333), leading the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization. Because in vitro resistance of SARS-CoV to remdesivir has been reported to be caused by either of two amino acid replacements in RdRp (Phe479Leu or Val556Leu), we interrogated our data for polymorphisms in the nsp12 gene. Although we identified 140 different inferred amino acid replacements in RdRp in the 5,085 genomes analyzed, none of these were located precisely at the two positions associated with in vitro resistance to remdesivir. Inasmuch as remdesivir is now being deployed widely to treat COVID-19 patients in Houston and elsewhere, our findings suggest that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating in our region should be susceptible to this drug.\nThe amino acid replacements Ala442Val, Ala448Val, Ala553Pro/Val, and Gly682Arg that we identified occur at sites that, intriguingly, are located directly above the nucleotide substrate entry channel and nucleotide binding residues Lys544, Arg552, and Arg554 (22, 23) (Figure 4). One possibility is that substitution of the smaller alanine or glycine residues with the bulkier side chains of Val/Pro/Arg may impose structural constraints for the modified nucleotide analog to bind, and thereby disfavor remdesivir binding. This, in turn, may lead to reduced incorporation of remdesivir into the nascent RNA, increased fidelity of RNA synthesis, and ultimately drug resistance. A similar mechanism has been proposed for a Val556Leu change (23).\nWe also identified one strain with a Lys477Asn replacement in RdRp. This substitution is located close to a Phe479Leu replacement reported to produce partial resistance to remdesivir in vitro in SARS-CoV patients from 2004, although the amino acid positions are numbered differently in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Structural studies have suggested that this amino acid is surface-exposed, and distant from known key functional elements. Our observed Lys477Asn change is also located in a conserved motif described as a finger domain of RdRp (Figure 3 and 4). One speculative possibility is that Lys477 is involved in binding a yet unidentified cofactor such as Nsp7 or Nsp8, an interaction that could modify nucleotide binding and/or fidelity at a distance. These data warrant additional study in larger patient cohorts, especially in individuals treated with remdesivir.\nAnalysis of the gene encoding the spike protein identified 285 polymorphic amino acid sites relative to the reference genome, including 49 inferred amino acid replacements not present in available databases as of August 19, 2020. Importantly, 30 amino acid sites in the spike protein had two or three distinct replacements relative to the reference strain. The occurrence of multiple variants at the same amino acid site is one characteristic that may suggest functional consequences. These data, coupled with structural information available for spike protein, raise the possibility that some of the amino acid variants have functional consequences, for example including altered serologic reactivity and shown here. These data permit generation of many biomedically relevant hypotheses now under study.\nA recent study reported that RBD amino acid changes could be selected in vitro using a pseudovirus neutralization assay and sera obtained from convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies (86). The amino acid sites included positions V445 and E484 in the RBD. Important to note, variants G446V and E484Q were present in our patient samples. However, these mutations retain high affinity to CR3022 (Figure 8F, G). The high-resolution structure of the RBD/CR3022 complex shows that CR3022 makes contacts to residues 369\u2013386, 380\u2013392, and 427\u2013430 of RBD (74). Although there is no overlap between CR3022 and ACE2 epitopes, CR3022 is able to neutralize the virus through an allosteric effect. We found that the Ser373Pro change, which is located within the CR3022 epitope, has reduced affinity to CR3022 (Figure 8F, G). The F338L and R408T mutations, although not found directly within the interacting epitope, also display reduced binding to CR3022. Other investigators (86) using in vitro antibody selection identified a change at amino acid site S151 in the N-terminal domain, and we found mutations S151N and S151I in our patient samples. We also note that two variant amino acids (Gly446Val and Phe456Leu) we identified are located in a linear epitope found to be critical for a neutralizing monoclonal antibody described recently by Li et al. (87).\nIn the aggregate, these findings suggest that mutations emerging within the spike protein at positions within and proximal to known neutralization epitopes may result in escape from antibodies and other therapeutics currently under development. Importantly, our study did not reveal that these mutant strains had disproportionately increased over time. The findings may also bear on the occurrence of multiple amino acid substitutions at the same amino acid site that we identified in this study, commonly a signal of selection. In the aggregate, the data support a multifaceted approach to serological monitoring and biologics development, including the use of monoclonal antibody cocktails (46, 47, 88)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUDING STATEMENT", "text": "Our work represents analysis of the largest sample to date of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from patients in one metropolitan region in the United States. The investigation was facilitated by the fact that we had rapidly assessed a SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test in January 2020, more than a month before the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed in Houston. In addition, our large healthcare system has seven hospitals and many facilities (e.g., outpatient care centers, emergency departments) located in geographically diverse areas of the city. We also provide reference laboratory services for other healthcare entities in the Houston area. Together, our facilities serve patients of diverse ethnicities and socioeconomic status. Thus, the data presented here likely reflect a broad overview of virus diversity causing COVID-19 infections throughout metropolitan Houston. We previously exploited these features to study influenza and Klebsiella pneumoniae dissemination in metropolitan Houston (89, 90). We acknowledge that every \u201ctwig\u201d of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary tree in Houston is not represented in these data. The samples studied are not comprehensive for the entire metropolitan region. For example, it is possible that our strain samples are not fully representative of individuals who are indigent, homeless, or of very low socioeconomic groups. In addition, although the strain sample size is relatively large compared to other studies, the sample represents only about 10% of all COVID-19 cases in metropolitan Houston documented in the study period. In addition, some patient samples contain relatively small amounts of virus nucleic acid and do not yield adequate sequence data for high-quality genome analysis. Thus, our data likely underestimate the extent of genome diversity present among SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 and will not identify all amino acid replacements in the virus in this geographic region. It will be important to sequence and analyze the genomes of additional SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19 cases in the ongoing second massive disease wave in metropolitan Houston, and these studies are underway. Data of this type will be especially important to have if a third and subsequent waves were to occur in metropolitan Houston, as it could provide insight into molecular and epidemiologic events contributing to them.\nThe genomes reported here are an important data resource that will underpin our ongoing study of SARS-CoV-2 molecular evolution, dissemination, and medical features of COVID-19 in Houston. As of August 19, 2020, there were 135,866 reported cases of COVID-19 in metropolitan Houston, and the number of cases is increasing daily. Although the full array of factors contributing to the massive second wave in Houston is not known, it is possible that the potential for increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the Gly614 may have played a role, as well as changes in behavior associated with the Memorial Day and July 4th holidays, and relaxation of some of the social constraints imposed during the first wave. The availability of extensive virus genome data dating from the earliest reported cases of COVID-19 in metropolitan Houston, coupled with the database we have now constructed, may provide critical insights into the origin of new infection spikes and waves occurring as public health constraints are further relaxed, schools and colleges re-open, holidays occur, commercial air travel increases, and individuals change their behavior because of COVID-19 \u201cfatigue.\u201d The genome data will also be useful in assessing ongoing molecular evolution in spike and other proteins as baseline herd immunity is generated, either by natural exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or by vaccination. The signal of potential selection contributing to some spike protein diversity and identification of naturally occurring mutant RBD variants with altered serologic recognition warrant close attention and expanded study."}, {"section_title": "Patient specimens. ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "All specimens were obtained from individuals who were registered patients at Houston Methodist hospitals, associated facilities (e.g., urgent care centers), or institutions in the greater Houston metropolitan region that use our laboratory services.

Metadata considered for prediction in regression analysis included ICU length of stay, IMU length of stay, total length of stay, supplemental oxygen use, and ventilator use. Because sex, blood type, Rh factor, age, age decade, ethnicity, and ethnic group are features in the patient features and combined feature sets, models were not trained for these labels using patient and combined feature sets. Additionally, age, length of stay, IMU length of stay, ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation days, and supplemental oxygen days were treated as regression problems and XGBoost regressors were built while the rest were treated as classification problems and XGBoost classifiers were built.\nThree types of features were considered for training the XGBoost classifiers: alignment features, patient features, and the combination of alignment and patient features. Alignment features were generated from the consensus genome alignment such that columns containing ambiguous nucleotide bases were removed to ensure the models did not learn patterns from areas of low coverage. These alignments were then one-hot encoded to form the alignment features. Patient metadata values were one-hot encoded with the exception of age, which remained as a raw integer value, to create the patient features. These metadata values consisted of age, ABO, Rh blood type, ethnic group, ethnicity, and sex.
