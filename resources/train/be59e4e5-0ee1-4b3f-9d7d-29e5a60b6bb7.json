[{"section_title": "", "text": "At the end of December 2019, an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China [1] [2] [3] . The pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus, SAR-CoV 2 [4] . Sequence identity between this pathogen and SARS-CoV is \u223c80% [5] [6] [7] [8] . SARS-CoV 2 is highly contagious, with the number of cases increasing rapidly in just 1 month, and the number of cases in China exceeded 80,000 at the end of March 2020. Although the fatality rate is around 2%, the severity rate can reach 25%, seriously endangering people's health, and affecting their normal work and lives [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Rapid screening of suspected patients is a prerequisite for prevention and control of SARS-CoV 2 infection.\nAccording to the guidelines for the prevention and control of coronavirus infectious disease published by the national center for disease control (CDC) [17] , nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2 infection. Due to the lack of specialized nucleic acid extraction and amplification laboratories in primary institutions, testing has primarily been conducted by CDC sections and tertiary hospitals. With the further expansion of the epidemic, it is difficult for the provincial CDCs and tertiary hospitals to finish all tests in time. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop simple sample processing and a nucleic acid testing system for application in primary medical institutions, enabling clinicians to quickly triage patients, and effectively prevent and control the epidemic.\nIn the early stages of our pathogen identification efforts, we designed three sets of primers and probes based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV 2, identified an S gene primer set with high sensitivity, and established a qRT-PCR assay capable of identifying SARS-CoV 2 infection. In this study, we combined this qRT-PCR assay with a new automatic nucleic acid detection system. The resultant system can detect SARS-CoV 2 directly in original samples, enabling its application in primary medical institutions."}, {"section_title": "Design of primers and probes", "text": "Based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV2, we designed primers and probes for the non-coding region, N gene, and S gene.

None of the three primer sets including Cov-p1, Cov-p2, and Cov-p3 crossreacted with any of the 20 species of respiratory associated viruses.\nBecause we could initially determine the sensitivity of the primers by comparing differences in their CT values, we used two patient samples as RNA templates to rapidly select the most sensitive primer for SARS-CoV 2 detection. The results revealed that Cov-p3 yielded the lowest CT values for both samples, indicating that the Cov-p3 was the most sensitive primer for the detection of SARS-CoV 2 in both samples (Table 1) .\nTo accurately quantify the detection sensitivity of Cov-p3, we performed ten-fold serial dilutions of T7 transcript RNA containing specific target genes and used them as templates in qRT-PCR, which demonstrated that the LOD was about 1-100 copies per reaction (Supple Figure 1) . We then performed qRT-PCR on 2-fold serial dilutions. Two independent experiments with 8 replicates per sample were conducted at concentrations around the detection end point determined in the previous dilution experiments. As shown in Figure 3 (a), Cov-p3 had a sensitivity of 14.8 copies/reaction (95% confidence intervals: 9.8-21)."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity and specificity of AIGS", "text": "RNAs from a SARS-CoV 2 culture (8 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/ml) was quantified by qRT-PCR using recombinant T7 transcript RNA containing specific target genes quantification standard. From the standard curve, it was calculated that 1 pfu SARS-CoV 2 culture generated 455.6 gene copies of SARS-CoV 2.\nFor the LOD determination of AIGS, initially we performed experiments on 10-fold serial dilutions of the SARS-CoV 2 culture, which demonstrated that the LOD was about 50-2000 copies/ml.\nTwo independent experiments with 8 replicates per sample were conducted at concentrations around the detection end point determined in the previous dilution experiments. Eight concentrations and 200 \u00b5l aliquots of each sample were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the AIGS. At the same time, nucleic acids from an equivalent amount of diluted viruses were extracted and subjected to conventional qRT-PCR amplification.

This indicated that although the LOD per reaction of AIGS was lower than that of conventional qRT-PCR (73 copies/reaction versus 15 copies/reaction), AIGS used a larger volume of samples than the conventional qRT-PCR and achieved comparable LOD to the conventional qRT-PCR for the original samples test.\nFor the specificity detection, we used inactivated 37 clinical swab samples positive for other respiratory disease associated viruses and 20 respiratory infection associated virus culture including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, OC229E, OC43, adenovirus type 3, 4, 7, 11, 14 and type 55, influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, type 2, and type 3, and respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus EV71, CA16 as templates to confirm the specificity of the AIGS.

In parallel, we compared the results with those of the commercial 2019 nCoV nucleic acid detection kit (Sansure, Changsha). The results were shown in Table 2 .\nIn total, 230 pharynx swabs, three samples of lung lavage, eightnose swabs, 22 sputum samples, and three blood samples were tested using the commercial 2019 nCoV nucleic acid detection kit, which identified 126 positive samples and 140 negative samples. By contrast, the AIGS identified 125 positive samples and 141 negative samples. The clinical sensitivity of this AIGS was 97.62% (95% CI: 0.9320-0.9951) based on the commercial 2019 nCoV nucleic acid detection kit, and concordance analysis showed a high agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection between the two assays, Pearson R was 0.9623(95% CI: 0.9523-0.9703).\nAmong the 266 clinical samples, three negative samples tested by AIGS were identified as positive by the commercial kit, and two positive samples tested by AIGS were identified as negative by the commercial kit. Then we tested IgM antibodies for SARS-CoV 2 in the sera from the five inconsistent patients, all of the five sera samples were positive, indicating that all the five inconsistent patients were positive for SARS-CoV 2 infection.\nWe also compared the results among different types of samples from the same patient, including lung lavage, sputum, throat swabs, and blood samples. Lung lavage contained the highest concentration of nucleic acid, followed by sputum and pharynx swab; blood samples yielded a much lower positive rate than other sample types ( Table 3 ), suggesting that samples from the lower respiratory tract, such as lung lavage and sputum, are optimal for nucleic acid detection to identify SARS-CoV 2 infection."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "qPCR results reflect the presence of viral nucleic acid in samples; accordingly, this method is well suited for early diagnosis of virus infection. At present, qPCR is the most important detection method for clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases [18] [19] [20] [21] . SARS-CoV2 was first reported in late December 2019 [1] , and the first commercial kit for nucleic acid detection was authorized on January 26, 2020. As early as January 5, we started performing test to identify suspected cases of COVID. To develop a suitable qRT-PCR method, we designed and screened sensitive primer sets for qRT-PCR assays. The LOD could reach 15 copies per reaction (95% CI: 9.8-21) with no crossreaction with other respiratory disease associated virus. Testing of 171 clinical samples (41 positive and 130 Figure 3 .

The LOD of AIGS could reached 365 copies/ml (95% CI: 350-375) for original sample, which was similar to that of conventional qRT-PCR (740 copies/ml, 95% CI: 690-750). In single reactions, the LOD of AIGS was lower than that of conventional qRT-PCR (73 copies versus 15 copies per reaction), this might because AIGS integrated extraction and amplification and accommodated a larger sample size, all of the extracted nucleic acid was contained in the reaction cartridge used for amplification. By contrast, the conventional qRT-PCR required a separate extraction process, and the volume of RNA was limited to 5-10 \u00b5L, meaning that only 10% of extracted RNA could be added into the reaction tube. Thus, if volume consideration was disregarded, AIGS could have comparable sensitivity to that of conventional qRT-PCR for the original samples analysis. Since AIGS could detect SARS-CoV2 in original samples directly, it permited a more accurate description of the LOD in terms of copies per volume instead of copies per reaction.\nWe tested a variety of clinical samples, including lung lavage, sputum, nose swab, throat swab, and other types, and identified a total of 125 positive samples (CT value: 25.07-38.72) and 141 negative samples by AIGS. Compared with the commercial test, concordance rate was 97.62% for the positive samples and 98.5% for the negative samples. IgM test confirmed that all of the five inconsistent patients were positive for COVID-19, these results confirmed that the AIGS would be potentially useful for detect multiple types of respiratory tract samples in clinical use.\nWe also measured different types of samples from the same patients, including lung lavage, sputum, throat swabs, and blood. Of these four types of samples, lung lavage had the highest concentration of nucleic acid, followed by sputum, indicating that samples from the lower respiratory tract are optimal for nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV 2.\nFor diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV2, the current commercial nucleic acid detection kits use conventional qRT-PCR methods that require inactivation and extraction procedures in specialized laboratories and work by trained professionals, as well as larger amounts of time [22] [23] [24] . More and more suspected cases have appeared around the world, leading WHO to characterize COVID-19 as a pandemic. By May 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases had exceeded 5 milion wordwide. It is urgent to carry out COVID-19 testing early in primary medical institutions. However, such institutions often cannot conduct qRT-PCR testing because they lack professional laboratories. Consequently, samples from suspected cases must be sent to other professional departments for testing, prolonging the time required for case confirmation and increasing the risk of further spread of the virus [25, 26] .\nOur AIGS integrates nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification, thus can be used to detect samples directly. According to the CDC's 2019 guidelines for COVID diagnosis and treatment, the virus in clinical samples can be inactivated by incubation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min [12] . Therefore, for primary laboratories without a biosafety rating, a water bath combined with this AIGS could be used to test for COVID cases. Moreover, the cartridges of AIGS can be operated separately, so samples can be tested at any time without waiting, which is ideal for application in primary medical institutions.\nAlthough the AIGS we used can only detect 4 samples at same time, eight and more detection sites of AIGS instruments are being developed at present, moreover, multiple detections can be performed since AIGS has five different fluorescence detection channels. So, combining more sites of instrument with multi channels detection, the AIGS can be expanded into more samples and more pathogens detection.\nWith its advantages of simple operation, rapid process, and high accuracy, this AIGS is potentially useful in primary medical institutions, and could thus play an important role in the prevention and control of SARS-CoV 2. 2018ZX10711001-003, 2018ZX10732401, 17SAZ07&AWS16J020) and Science and Technology Development Program of Beijing City (Z2011100001020001).
