Cotton importers desire cotton that is longer in fiber and more uniform than U.S. base grade cotton (Anderson) .\nThe trend in U.S. cotton production has been to lower costs, increase yield and expand acreage through the use of genetically engineered seeds (e.g., Bt and herbicide-tolerant varieties). Lange estimates that a t least 16 million bales of exports are necessary to keep the U.S. cotton infrastructure in place and profitable. The need to export two thirds of the U.S. crop could make fiber characteristics a t least a s important as insecticide resistance or herbicide tolerance and yield.\nIn a recent acreage survey, 47% of cotton growers surveyed reported fiber quality to be \"very important\" when selecting a variety to plant. About 25.5% indicated \"fairly important,\" and another 25.5% thought it was a factor but not a deciding factor. Less than 2% said it was \"not a t all important,\" and none reported it to be \"not very important\" (Anonymous 2005) . Because of the relative importance of quality in domestic and international markets (Anderson; Anonymous 2004; Cleveland; Kausik) , producers must balance quality, yield, and cost of production considerations when making production decisions. Seed characteristics and their resulting production outcomes are a critical component in this decision process, and these decisions are likely to be influenced by factors such as farm size, labor availability, and their mechanization complement.\nThe overall objective of this study is to examine producers' preferences for cottonseed. Specifically, we examine the preferences for alternative cottonseed packages varying by different levels of the attributes seed price, seed typelvariety, lint yield, and fiber quality. Of particular interest is whether the recent emphasis on fiber quality in world markets translates into producer choices for seed characteristics. This study allows a direct estimation of the relative importance of seed characteristics on producer seed choices. Additionally, the effect of farm characteristics such as size and labor availability on seed choice is also examined. Using an extension of the McDonald and Moffitt decomposition for the two-limit Tobit model, Fernandez-Cornejo, Daberkow, and McBride studied genetically engineered (Bt and herbicide-tolerant) corn and herbicide-tolerant soybean. Results of that study did not support the a priori hypothesis that the adoption of Bt and herbicide-tolerant corn was scale-neutral, although it supported the hypothesis that adoption of herbicide-tolerant technology for soybean was invariant to farm size (scaleneutral) . This is in keeping with Rogers' observation that the effect of farm size on adoption is more responsive to farm size at the early stages of the diffusion of an innovation (the case of the herbicide-tolerant corn), and becomes less important as diffusion increases.' Willingness to pay (WTP) for seed characteristics is examined by utilizing a choicebased conjoint (CBC) experiment. The CBC analysis is used because it enables the estimation of the marginal values (utilities derived from profit) of different attributes through simple mail surveys. The CBC approach has been used in a number of contexts and settings to examine respondent WTP for characteristics of a good or service (Beggs, Cardell, and Hausman; Hudson and Lusk; Lusk, Roosen, and Fox; Nalley et al.) . The resulting marginal WTP values provide information about the relative importance of seed characteristics, which provides information to seed breeders and genetics companies about potential demand for these characteristics. Additionally, this approach also allows for a direct investigation of the effects of farm characteristics on the marginal WTP for different seed characteristics/technologies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "A random utility model is used to represent utility of profit for seed characteristics, where utility of profit is a function of the attributes consistent with Lancaster's hedonic theory.

A mail survey of cotton producers in Mississippi was conducted in February and March 2005. To determine the relative importance placed by producers on the attributes of price, seed type, lint yield, and fiber quality of cottonseed, each producer was presented with discrete choices between two packages and a choice of neither package (or \"opt out\" or \"do not buy\"). Each attribute was varied by three different levels ( Table 1) . The decision to choose a certain package could be viewed as a choice of a bundle of attributes, each of which provides subjective utility from profit to the producer (Lancaster) . This method is relatively easy to administer compared with the alternative of personal interview and does not limit sample size (Ayidiya and McClendon; Hudson and Lusk; McFarlane and Garland) .' The CBC method is often used in transportation, environmental, marketing, and other business literature to estimate the utility of product attributes (\"product\" being broadly defined) or predict consumer choice by determining the relative importance of various attributes in consumers' choice process (Adamowicz et al. 1997 (Adamowicz et al. , 1998 Beggs, Cardell, and Hausman; Hudson and Lusk; Jayne et al.; Lusk, Roosen, and Fox; Mark, Lusk, and Daniel; Roe, Boyle, and Tiesl; Unterschultz et al.; Wardman) . The CBC analysis has been known to effectively predict the success of new products (Jayne et al.) , genetically modified products (Lusk, Roosen, and Fox; Lusk et al.) , and quality-differentiated products (Loureiro and Hine; Lusk and Schroeder; Nalley et al.) . It has been shown to be consistent with consumers' revealed preferences Adamowicz et al. 1997 ) and robust to hypothetical bias (Carlsson and Martinsson; Hudson, Gallardo, and Hanson) . The CBC method is also appealing in that it is based on random utility theory (Louviere, Hensher, and Swait) , allows for 'It should be noted that the 117 participants in this survey generated 4,488 observations on choice. multiattribute valuation (Hudson and Lusk) , and permits the measurement of trade-offs among numerous attributes (Lusk, Roosen, and Fox) . Although the use of the CBC method is limited on producer preferences to cater to the interest of agribusinesses such as seed companies, technology and equipment dealers, and agricultural service providers, it has occasionally been used to elicit producer (farmer) WTP for a new product or service (Hudson and Hite; Lusk and Hudson) ."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Survey Design", "text": "The CBC technique provides the inherent advantage of allowing deliberate manipulation of attributes across choice sets to test specific hypotheses. However, administering an experiment with the full factorial design of all possible combinations of attribute levels is cumbersome and expensive (Hudson and Lusk) . On the basis of the number of attributes and attribute levels, a full factorial design would consist of 34 = 81 possible scenarios. It was unrealistic to expect that each individual would examine all 81 different choice sets.4 To restrict this number, a fractional factorial design was created that maximized design efficiency (minimized attribute correlation) while maintaining design orthogonality (Kuhfeld, Tobias, and Garratt) .5 A total of 26 scenarios were created by this process. To minimize respondent fatigue and increase response rates, the scenarios were randomly divided into two blocks of 13 41n designing an experiment, it is often necessary to make a trade-off between statistical eff~ciency and the number of possible choice sets administered. Although a larger design has better statistical efficiency and larger burden on the respondent o r in administering, a smaller design is clearly advantageous for visual inspection and investigation of the choice sets \"for poorly matched attribute options\" (Lusk and Norwood, p. 774) . Obviously, the latter is a task that becomes increasingly difficult with the growth in size of the design. 'Lusk and Nonvood, AJAE, Aug 2005 , showed that the approach on CBC experimental design followed by Kuhfeld, Tobias, and Garratt performs as well at identifying the underlying utility function as any other experimental design.\nscenarios: each scenario containing two alternative choice packages (A and B) of specified levels of each attribute with the option of choosing none of the two choice packages (Choice C, \"Neither,\" meaning \"Don't Buy Either Package A or Package B\").\nA questionnaire consisting of the 13 scenarios as well as demographic questions was sent to each of the 600 cotton producers (300 receiving each block) selected randomly by a simple MS-Excel random number generator from a possible list of 1,319 cotton producers in the Mississippi Delta region provided by county extension offices. Following Dillman's general mail survey procedures, the questionnaire was sent along with a postage-paid return envelope and a cover letter explaining the purpose of the survey. A follow-up mailing was sent to producers not responding to the initial mailing approximately 3 weeks later. (Dillman) , and the demographic characteristics well represented the region (Table 3) .\nProducers who grew cotton in 2004 or planned to grow it in 2005 were presented with a set of attributes: seed price, seed type (variety), lint yield, fiber quality, and other considerations. With the use of a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very important) to 5 (very unimportant), producers were asked to evaluate how each of these attributes would influence their decision when purchasing cottonseed.\nThe choice variables were defined, with seed price (per acre) referring to the buying price of cottonseed (i.e., the cost producers incurred or were willing to incur to buy cottonseed). The three price levels presented were $16, $34, and $75 per acre.' Seed type referred to the type (or variety) of cottonseed producers could buy. Three different types were included: conventional, herbicide-tolerant, and stacked-gene (i.e., herbicide-tolerant as well as insect-resistant). The design allowed each of these types to assume any of the three price levels specified, thus not constraining conventional seed to always be the least expensive seed and stacked-gene the most expensive seed.8 Lint yield (pounds per acre) referred to the lint yield producers could expect from the seed presented in the scenario, which were representative of typical \"low\" (750 lb), \"average\" (1,000 lb), and \"high\" (1,500 lb) yields for the Delta region. Fiber quality referred to the quality of fiber produ-'These prices were derived with the use of normal seeding rates for the Mississippi Delta. Although some producers might seed at greater or lesser rates than commonly prescribed, these prices encompassed typical per-acre seed charges in this area.\n8Although constraining seed prices so that conventional seed was always the least expensive might seem to make intuitive sense, it would fracture the factorial design, thus introducing unknown correlations of attributes. cers could expect. Three different standards were assumed in this study: Low, Average, and High. For Low quality, profits were lowered by a discount of 0 to 2 cents per pound of lint; a premium of 0 to 2 cents per pound of lint would be received for Average quality, and High quality would receive a premium of 3 to 5 cents per pound of lint. The different attributes and attribute levels used in this study are shown in Table 1 .\nEach of the 13 scenarios was presented in the form of a table, with the names of the attributes (choice variables) on the first column and the attribute levels of price, seed type, lint yield, and fiber quality stated on the two subsequent columns. Each column defined a choice package (A or B), with a certain level each of seed price, seed type, lint yield, and fiber quality. These levels were varied across scenarios and within the two blocks in accordance with the derived fractional factorial design. The fourth column had the heading \"Neither,\" giving the respondent the option to choose neither Package A nor Package B. An example scenario is shown in further discussion. where Uu is the ith producer's subjective utility of profit for seed bundle j under the maintained hypothesis that this seed bundle will affect profitability, V, is the deterministic portion of this utility of profit (to be maximized) and E~ is the stochastic component. The probability of choosing any of these j seed bundles is PrG is chosen)\nwhere Cj is the choice set for producer i (Ci = { A , B, C)), Choice C = \"Neither\" in Figure 1 , and is the indirect utility-of-profit function of option j for respondent (producer) i to be estimated. The explanatory variables are described in Table I , and Po through P6 are the parameters to be estimated. In particular, Po is an alternative-specific constant (ASC), also known as a location parameter, associated with option j for respondent (producer) i. Assuming the random errors in Equation (1) are independently and identically distributed across thejalternatives and N individuals, and have a Type I extreme value distribution and scale parameter equal to 1, Ben-Akiva and Lerman have shown the probability of producer i choosing choice j is given by\nwhere p is the scale parameter, assumed equal to 1, because it is unidentifiable within any particular data set (Lusk, Roosen, and Fox The estimated coefficients in Equation ( 5 ) represent the marginal utilities of the relevant attributes. When the ratio of a particular marginal utility of an attribute is taken relative to the marginal utility of money (the price coefficient), this yields the marginal rate of substitution of money for the attribute, or the marginal WTP. The values producers place on the different attributes represent the profit increase (decrease) needed to offset the positive (negative) utility provided by a particular attribute. For example, assume that producers received positive marginal utility of profit from both yield and fiber quality. These assumptions suggest that the producer is willing to forgo some yield to obtain better fiber quality. By examining the ratio of the parameter estimate for fiber quality relative to the parameter estimate of profit (the ratio of marginal utilities of profit), an estimate of the amount of money the producer is willing to forgo to obtain better fiber quality is obtained (Hudson and Lusk) . This has been discussed further in the WTP Estimates subsection after the discussion of Approach 2."}, {"section_title": "Approach 2: Random Parameters Logit Model", "text": "The CL model above is limited primarily in two ways. First, the model outlined assumes all respondents share the same coefficients for all relevant attributes, meaning they are assumed to have the same preferences for cotton attributes. Such homogeneity in preferences is likely unrealistic. In many cases, one might expect heterogeneity in preferences within the population. Second, because farm or other respondent characteristics are fixed Bunerjee, Hudson, and Martin: Choice-Based Conjoint Experiment across all choices for each respondent, they are WTP Estimates perfectly collinear with the intercept and must be dropped. This result prevents analysis of Point estimates of WTP are obtained in both the effects of these characteristics on choice. the above modeling approaches by the simple A mixed or random parameters logit formula: (RPL) model is often used to investigate heterogeneity of preferences (Layton and (6) WTPj = Brown; Revelt and Train; Train) . In the RPL model, the ps from Equation ( 5 ) are allowed to vary across the population with an assumed (in this case, normal) distribution. In general, individual i will have a coefficient vector given by Pi = p + oui, where p is the population mean, o is a diagonal matrix of coefficient standard deviations, and u is a vector of independent standard normal deviates. This specification assumes the coefficients vary randomly over individuals to capture the potential variation in tastes for specific cottonseed attributes and relaxes the restriction that every respondent exhibits constant marginal utilities of profit for choice attributes. Although the parameters are allowed to vary across the population, the individual characteristics can then be used to examine systematic elements of the preference heterogeneity.\nThe advantage of the RPL method is that it is not subject to the independence from irrelevant alternatives assumption found in the CL model and accounts for the repeated observations taken from each respondent (Layton and Brown; Revelt and Train; Train) . The results of this model provide an indication of the variability of seed characteristic preferences within the sample. Additionally, individual-specific (farm) characteristics can then be used to explain any observed heterogeneity in preferences, which affords a direct analysis of farm characteristics on preferences.\nThe price coefficient is assumed fixed in the population. The same data from modeling approach 1 were used to estimate the RPL in modeling approach 2. Louviere, Hensher, and Swait contend that, if respondents are relatively homogeneous in their preferences (as in this case for cottonseed attributes), modeling approaches 1 and 2 should be equivalent (Lusk, Roosen, and Fox) . where p, is the response coefficient for the jth attribute, and pl is the estimated coefficient for price, holding all other potential influences constant (Louviere, Hensher, and Swait, p. 61 ). Krinsky and Robb proposed bootstrapping confidence intervals around the WTP estimates to facilitate statistical tests. The variance~ovariance matrix produced during the estimation process was thus used to generate a bivariate normal density on WTP, with 1,000 simulated observations, and a 95% confidence interval on WTP, was constructed from these simulated observations."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Assuming a cotton producer derives utility from profit and the decision to purchase cottonseed depends on the attributes of seed price, seed type, lint yield, fiber quality, and other considerations, the survey asked the respondents to evaluate on a scale of 1 to 5 how each of these attributes would influence their decision when purchasing cottonseed. Based on the responses received, \"other considerations\" had the highest mean of 2.53. Seed price was second, with a mean of 2.28. The means of fiber quality, seed type, and lint yield were, respectively, 1.82, 1.68, and 1.60. These results, along with their standard deviations, are shown in Table 2 .\nThe means and standard deviations of age, farm labor, education, and income are presented in Table 3 . These demographic variables were similar to those in the 2002 Census of Agriculture for the Delta region of Mississippi (USDA 2006b) and a 2005 survey of Mississippi cotton producers (Banerjee and Martin) .\nFrom the regression results of the CL model (Table 4) , both of the constants (ASC1 and ASC2) associated with the pack- Producers were asked to evaluateeach factor from I (very important) to 5 (very unimportant).

Reported cotton acreage ranged between 0 and 11,000 acres. This range was consistent with the 2002 U.S. Agricultural Census data, which revealed that 6890 of the Mississippi cotton acreage was on farms of 1,000 acres or more.\nage choices A and B, respectively, appear to coefficient on price is negative, as expected:\nhave negative signs, indicating that, on aver-increase in price of cottonseed lowers the age, respondents preferred \"Neither\" (Choice probability of purchase. The positive signs and C) to either of the two packages A and B. The statistical significance on technology coeffi- cients (herbicide-tolerant and stacked-gene varieties) and fiber quality (both medium and high) indicate the importance of these attributes to respondents. All coefficients here are positive, implying that these attributes increase utility of profit (have a positive marginal utility) to the producer. All !-ratios are significant at the 1% level of significance.\nUtilizing the variance-covariance matrix produced during the WTP estimation process, the Krinsky-Robb procedure was used to bootstrap 95% confidence intervals around the WTP estimates, as shown in Table 5 . The marginal WTP estimates from the CL also imply producer demand for the relevant attributes. The marginal WTP for the herbicide-tolerant seed versus the conventional variety is $66.11 per acre. Even though herbicide-tolerant cottonseed in the study area was less expensive in 2004 and 2005 ($26 and $31 per acre, respectively) , this could indicate the true WTP when factors such as convenience, protection from herbicide drift, and unwillingness to go back to the \"conventional\" ways of farming are considered. The marginal WTP for stacked-gene seed versus conventional seed is $86.71. Because stackedgene seed combines the properties of insecticide resistance along with herbicide tolerance, the marginal WTP for the stacked-gene variety is expected to be higher than the herbicidetolerant variety. Combining the results from these two varieties could provide more insight because, in order to get the \"package\" (yield, insect resistance, and herbicide tolerance), producers often must buy the stacked-gene seed. Thus, there is a compound effect of the stacked-gene variety relative t o just the herbicide-tolerant variety. If the cost of the Bt seed technology expenselfee ($32.00) is subtracted from $86.71, the herbicide tolerance portion ($86.71 -$32.00 = $54.71) becomes even less expensive than the WTP estimate ($66.1 1). Therefore, there is a positive marginal WTP for technology relative to conventional cottonseed, and this WTP increases with the level of technology.\nThe marginal WTP for lint yield is approximately $0.20 per pound. Given the cotton loan price of $0.52 per pound, production cost beyond the seed must be $0.32 per pound or less to induce the producer to pay $0.20 for each pound of additional yield. The marginal WTP for medium and high fiber qualities are approximately $38.08 and $62.1 1 per acre, respectively.' Thus, there is a positive marginal WTP for yield and quality.\nTo account for potential heterogeneity, an RPL model was estimated. The results obtained from this model are shown in Table 6 . The constant terms (ASCs) and variety dummies in this model were allowed to vary randomly in the population. In the model, the heterogeneity of these parameters was a function of farm labor and farm acres. The choice of random parameters was arbitrary, and these were selected to observe changes in only technology with respect to the stated variables (farm labor and acres). Holding other parameters constant allows examination of heterogeneity with respect to biotechnology. Price was also held constant to allow calculation of WTP. The overall effects of the RPL model are similar to those observed in the CL model, with all estimated parameter coefficients 'Interestingly, assuming a 1,000 lblacre yield, these marginal WTP values are approximately 60. 041 Ih and $0.0611h, respectively, which are close to the stated anticipated premiums for these qualities. having the same expected sign and statistical significance. Each of the signs on the heterogeneity estimated parameters shows how the relevant estimated preference parameter changes as the variable (farm labor or acres) changes. For example, the parameter Herbicide-Tolerunt: Farm Labor is negative (-0.0603). Thus, this parameter adjusts the \"mean\" of the herbicide-tolerant parameter downward with increases in farm labor. The \"mean\" of the herbicide-tolerant marginal utility of profit decreases as farm labor increases, implying a lower marginal WTP for herbicide-tolerant technology with more available farm labor. In fact, for each additional farm laborer, the average W T P for herbicide-tolerant seed decreases by $2.66/a~re.'~ Thus, farm labor and herbicide-tolerant biotechnology are substitute inputs. Similarly, the parameter Stacked-Gene:Farm L a b o r is negative (-0.0558). Thus, as farm labor increases by one unit, the mean WTP for stacked-gene technology decreases by $2.46/acre. This result further reinforces the conclusion that hiotechnology and farm labor are substitute inputs in cotton in the Mississippi Delta, similar to the macroeconomic effect of high-\"This value is determined by taking the value of the Herbicide-To1eranr:Fam Labor coefficient from Table 6 divided by the coeficient for price. The result is a change in marginal WTP with respect to changes in farm labor. yielding varieties of food grains under the Green Revolution in India in the 1960s.\nThe parameters Herbicide-Tolerant:Acres and Stacked-Gen.e:Acres are positive (0.0002 and 0.0003, respectively). Thus, each of these heterogeneity parameters enhances the \" mean\" of the herbicide-tolerant and stacked-gene parameters, respectively, and so enhances the WTP for biotechnology. From the producer's perspective, then, there are economies of size in biotechnology adoption so that biotechnology is not size-neutral, which supports Fernandez-Cornejo, Daberkow, and McBride's study on Bt and herbicide-tolerant corn."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This analysis used the choice-based conjoint technique to examine preferences for four choice attributes of cottonseed: price, yield, variety, and fiber quality. Mail surveys of agricultural producers in Mississippi were conducted to gather choice information. Random utility models were estimated, and estimates of the monetary value of attributes were derived from these marginal utility of profit estimates.\nThe marginal WTP approach with the use of a CL model revealed WTP for herbicidetolerant varieties of cottonseed relative to the conventional variety as $66.11 per acre, and WTP for stacked-gene (also relative to the conventional variety) as $86.71 per acre. Thus, technology had a positive WTP relative to the conventional variety of cottonseed, and WTP increased with the level of technology. The WTP for yield was positive, and approximately $0.20 per pound. Fiber quality also had a positive WTP, which increased as quality increased-$38.08 for medium and $62.11 for high-relative to the base (low) quality.\nFrom the RPL model, the heterogeneity of farm characteristics was examined. Preferences for cottonseed attributes exhibited significant heterogeneity within the population. While not surprising, these results indicate that this heterogeneity could have profound effects on the efficacy of agricultural policy design. Larger farms had a higher WTP for technology than smaller farms, and farms with more farm labor had a lower WTP for technology. Indirectly, these results provide evidence that, whereas on the one hand, adoption of cost-saving biotechnology provide economies of size, farm labor and genetic modification are substitute inputs in cotton production. Whether declines in farm labor availability are driving technology adoption or whether increases in technology adoption are leading to declines in farm labor demand is not determined here, but it is clear that these two inputs serve as direct substitutes. This result has implications for rural policy in that increased adoption of biotechnology in the farm sector is likely to be associated with decreases in farm labor demand. "}]
