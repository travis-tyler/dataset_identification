[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Post-operative delirium (POD) is the most common complication following major surgery in non-demented older (>65 y/o) patients. Patients experiencing POD show increased risk for future cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, conversely, patients with cognitive decline at surgery show increased risk for POD. Here, we demonstrate that a previously established panel of AD-driven MCI (ADMCI) autoantibody (aAB) biomarkers can be used to detect prodromal AD pre-surgically in individuals admitted into the hospital for hip fracture repair (HFR) surgery. Plasma from 39 STRIDE (STRIDE: A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients) HFR patients and sera from 25 age-and sex-matched non-demented and non-surgical controls were screened using human protein microarrays to measure expression of a panel of 44 previously identified MCI aAB biomarkers. The predictive classification accuracy of the aAB biomarker panel was evaluated using Random Forest (RF). The ADMCI aAB biomarkers successfully distinguished 21 STRIDE HFR patients (CDR = 0.5) from 25 matched nonsurgical controls with an overall accuracy of 91.3% (sensitivity = 95.2%; specificity = 88.0%). The ADMCI aAB panel also correctly identified six patients with preoperative CDR = 0 who later converted to CDR = 0.5 or >1 at one-year follow-up. Lastly, the majority of cognitively normal (CDR = 0) STRIDE HFR subjects that were positive for CSF AD biomarkers based on the A/T/N classification system were likewise classified as ADMCI aAB-positive using the biomarker panel.

A clear understanding of AD pathogenesis and the factors and/or conditions that trigger it remains elusive and controversial. Available treatments can only temporarily alleviate some symptoms but do not reverse or slow pathological progression [4] . It is now generally agreed that AD-related neuropathological changes can begin in the brain as early as 20 years before symptoms appear and can be evaluated for diagnosis and potential treatment [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . This delay in emergence of symptoms after the onset of pathology makes it difficult to identify AD patients at earlier, preclinical (or pre-symptomatic) and prodromal (mild cognitive impairment, MCI) disease stages, i.e., at times when disease-modifying treatments would likely be most effective and beneficial.\nCurrently, diagnosis of AD is mostly based on a combination of medical history, detailed physical, neurological and neuropsychological examinations and sometimes brain imaging, but earlier preclinical and prodromal stages are difficult to diagnose accurately using these methods [8, 11] . In recent years, a number of soluble components in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been identified that have potential as useful biomarkers for AD [12] . In CSF, amyloid-beta (A\u03b242), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and their relative ratios have been linked to different aspects of AD pathology [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . For example, low CSF A\u03b242 levels in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) correlate well with brain amyloidosis as detected by A\u03b2 PET imaging and is now considered to be a strong and reliable indicator of the presence of early ongoing AD pathology in individuals with prodromal AD (MCI) as well as a good predictor of rapid progression to full-blown AD [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Likewise, CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and total tau (t-tau), biomarkers of tau pathology and neurodegeneration or injury, respectively, have been used successfully together or in combination with A\u03b242 as positive indicators of existing AD pathology [18, 25] .\nDespite their high overall accuracy and direct linkage to AD pathology, a practical limitation of using CSF is the requirement for lumbar puncture, which is considered somewhat invasive and not without risk [16, 21, 22] . Because procurement of blood is much less invasive and associated with less risk, intense research efforts are currently underway worldwide to identify blood-based biomarkers, directly linked to AD pathology, aiming for an overall accuracy at least comparable to the more established CSF biomarkers [26] . Plasma proteins [27] [28] [29] , lipids [30] , A\u03b242 and tau [31, 32] as well as proteins and microRNAs enclosed within exosomes and lysosomal derivatives have all been showing promise as biomarkers for early detection of AD pathology [33, 34] Our previous studies using human protein microarrays have shown that aABs are abundant and ubiquitous in the blood, and that individual autoantibody profiles are influenced by age, gender and the presence or absence of disease [35] . We have also identified common changes in aAB profiles that appear to have utility as biomarkers for several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In a recent proof-ofconcept study, serum samples obtained from subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed using protein microarrays in an effort to identify aAB biomarkers associated with MCI due to underlying AD etiology. These MCI subjects were clinically well-characterized, including documentation of CSF A\u03b242, p-tau and t-tau levels consistent with the likely presence of existing, early-stage AD pathology. A panel of selected ADMCI aAB biomarkers derived from analysis of serum from these ADNI subjects was found to be capable of distinguishing ADNI MCI subjects from cognitively normal individuals as well as from patients with more advanced, mild-moderate AD and/or other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative diseases with high overall accuracy [37] .\nTo further explore the utility of the panel of the ADMCI aAB biomarkers derived from the analysis of ADNI subjects, we tested its accuracy using another cohort of patients participating in a randomized controlled trial (STRIDE: A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00590707) involving hip fracture repair (HFR). Previous studies on STRIDE HFR subjects have supported an association between AD pathology, gait disorders and frequent falls leading to hip fracture [41, 42] . This work has also shown that a large proportion of elderly HFR patients without dementia have abnormal CSF A\u03b242, t-tau and p-tau levels, indicating the likely presence of early-stage AD pathology [42] . In the present study, our goals were to determine (1) the utility of a previously established panel of blood-based ADMCI aAB biomarkers, derived from well-characterized ADNI subjects with amnestic MCI, for distinguishing STRIDE participants admitted into the hospital for HFR surgery with cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5) from age-and sex-matched non-demented controls, and (2) if there is a consistent relationship between measured levels of CSF biomarkers indicative of existing AD pathology and ADMCI aAB biomarkers in the blood of the same subjects."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "This study was approved by the Rowan University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Johns Hopkins University IRB which oversaw the STRIDE study."}, {"section_title": "Blood collection and processing", "text": "Serum and plasma samples studied were from a total of 64 subjects, STRIDE participants and non-demented controls obtained from Bioserve Biotechnologies, Ltd as described in detail below.

Classification cutoffs used here to define abnormal biomarker levels associated with underlying, ongoing AD pathology in the STRIDE cohort have been described previously [42] . Briefly, the optimal cutoff ratio of CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 which was closely correlated with abnormal A\u03b2 PET was determined previously to be \ufffd 0.8 (CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio x 10) [19] . CSF p-tau, the biomarker of tau pathology, was classified as normal if the level was \ufffd 60 pg/ml or abnormal if \ufffd 60 pg/ml. The CSF biomarker of neurodegeneration and neuronal injury, t-tau, was categorized as normal if levels were \ufffd 350 pg/ml or abnormal if \ufffd 350 pg/ml. The relationships between CSF biomarker levels, CDR scores and a designation of MCI+ or MCI-based on ADMCI aAB biomarkers was evaluated.\nIn individuals without dementia (CDR = 0 or 0.5), CSF biomarkers were further divided into categories according to the A/T/N classification system, where \"A\" refers to the value of an A\u03b2 biomarker,\"T\" the value of a tau biomarker, and \"N\" the value of a neurodegeneration biomarker [46] . Using this system, the CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio was classified as normal (A-) or abnormal (A+), p-tau as normal (T-) or abnormal (T+), and t-tau as normal (N-) or abnormal (N+) based on the cutoff values mentioned above. A/T/N classifications were also coupled to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria as described previously [47] . Fluorescence data were acquired by aligning the Genepix Array List onto the microarray using the Genepix Pro analysis software. The resulting Genepix results files were imported into Invitrogen's Prospector 5.2.3 microarray analysis software for analysis. The \"group characterization\" and \"two-group comparison\" features in the Immune Response Biomarker Profiling (IRBP) toolbox within Prospector enabled M-statistical analysis of differential aAB expression between comparison groups.

In this study of older individuals from the STRIDE cohort who underwent hip fracture repair requiring surgery, we previously found a high prevalence of ongoing AD pathology as evidenced by abnormal levels of CSF A\u03b242/40, total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in both cognitively normal (CDR = 0) and abnormal (CDR = 0.5 and >1.0) patients [42] . Using our panel of previously identified ADMCI aAB biomarkers, we sought to test the capability of these biomarkers to detect early AD-related neuropathology in the STRIDE cohort. Derived from studies carried out on ADNI subjects, this aAB panel has been used to distinguish cognitively normal individuals from patients with prodromal AD (MCI) due to the presence of ongoing, early stage AD-related neuropathology, as confirmed by measured levels of CSF biomarkers consistent with ongoing AD pathology [37] . The goals of the present study were to determine if a panel of previously identified ADMCI autoantibody biomarkers [37] could be utilized to distinguish STRIDE HFR participants with CDR = 0.5 from matched control subjects, and to test for any discernable relationship between CSF biomarkers of existing AD pathology and ADMCI biomarkers in the blood of the same subjects. We analyzed plasma samples from 39 HFR patients from the STRIDE cohort, as well as sera from 25 age-and sex-matched non-demented, non-surgical controls. The study data resulted in three main findings. First, we show that, in elderly HFR patients, the panel of 44 selected blood-based ADMCI aAB biomarkers can be used pre-surgically to detect the presence of early AD-related pathology in individuals presenting with cognitive impairment (as determine using CDR score) at the time of hospital admission with a high degree of accuracy. Second, these ADMCI aAB biomarkers are capable of identifying individual HFR patients who were cognitively normal (CDR = 0) at the time of surgery, but who later demonstrated accelerated post-surgical cognitive impairment and converted to either MCI (CDR = 0.5, n = 5) or AD (CDR\ufffd1, n = 1) at one year following surgery. Lastly, the panel of ADMCI aAB Detection of early-stage Alzheimer's pathology in elderly hip fracture repair patients biomarkers demonstrated exceptional agreement with the A/T/N classification system for CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242/40, t-tau and p-tau) by successfully identifying 13/14 cognitively normal HFR patients (CDR = 0) as MCI, that had A/T/N designations consistent with preclinical AD. This finding suggests that the presence of ADMCI aAB biomarkers in the blood is directly linked to ongoing AD-related pathology and thus may be useful for preclinical detection of AD. Taken together, these results also suggest that a large proportion of individuals with hip fracture may have underlying AD pathology, and that ADMCI aAB biomarkers are potentially more sensitive than the modified CDR assessment and substantially less invasive than CSF biomarkers in identifying individual patients that may need specialized care in semi-urgent settings. This study has several strengths. The first is that the panel of ADMCI aAB biomarkers used were derived from analysis of serum in a population of well-characterized individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). These individuals were diagnosed with MCI, shown to have a CDR = 0.5, and confirmed to have low CSF A\u03b242, which is highly suggestive of ongoing early AD pathology. Another strength is the availability of pre-surgical CSF AD biomarker data from the patients who underwent hip fracture repair, which enabled biomarker confirmation of the underlying disease process along with clinical characterization. Additionally, the availability of longitudinal follow-up data allowed the examination of the utility of ADMCI aAB biomarkers as a tool to predict cognitive trajectory after surgery. Using established CSF biomarker values, 20/21 of the STRIDE HFR CDR = 0.5 patients were classified as preclinical AD using the A/T/N system. This was subsequently confirmed using the panel of 44 ADMCI aAB biomarkers, which also identified 19 of the same patients as MCI. Finally, a significant strength of this study is the validation of the panel of ADMCI aAB biomarkers in a completely independent patient cohort. This specific panel of biomarkers was previously tested in a cohort of 25 ADNI MCI subjects vs. 25 matched controls with high overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity [37] . Here, we demonstrate comparable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the STRIDE subjects using 44 of the original 50 biomarkers from the panel.\nThis study also has several limitations, the foremost being the small sample size and clinical heterogeneity of the STRIDE HFR subject group. Intended as a \"proof of concept\" study, we acknowledge that although encouraging, our initial results warrant further studies in much larger and more diverse patient groups. Another limitation is that the determination of the CDR in the STRIDE subjects was largely informant based and not the formal process specified in the literature [42] . Due to the semi-urgent nature of traumatic hip fracture in an elderly population, a formal CDR determination is not feasible in this clinical setting. Another significant limitation introduced by the CSF biomarker assessment was that cutoff values for abnormal biomarkers were determined by population-based data, as well as previously published cutoff values. We acknowledge that the prevalence of abnormal biomarkers may vary depending on different laboratory assays and patient populations. Additional limitations include the divergent demographics of the Bioserve control population, which were 10 years younger on average, and also contained greater percentages of both female and Caucasian subjects when compared to the STRIDE cohort. Although an entirely age-matched control population would have been ideal, recent studies have demonstrated that significant proportions of age-matched individuals enrolled as controls in study groups such as ADNI displayed high baseline amounts of underlying AD pathology, based on comparative imaging data [50] . Due to the fact that a high percentage of subjects in the STRIDE cohort have demonstrated cognitive impairment consistent with early-stage AD or beyond, our use of a slightly younger control population helps to reduce the chance that these individuals will have underlying pre-symptomatic AD pathology, or if they do, less advanced pathology than their older STRIDE counterparts, as the incidence of AD rises substantially with each increasing decade of life [51] . In fact, we have found in our previous studies that \"spiking\" our elderly control groups with a small subset of samples from younger individuals increases classification accuracy using aAB biomarkers [36] . Lastly, the Bioserve control group also lacked CDR determinations as well as CSF biomarker assessments for comparison.\nIn conclusion, we report here a non-invasive, sensitive, and specific method to detect prodromal AD pre-surgically in individuals admitted into the hospital for hip fracture repair surgery. Early detection of AD-related pathology in this and other vulnerable patient populations has the potential to bring about improvements in peri-and postoperative patient care and management. In addition to early-stage detection, this panel of ADMCI aABs has also demonstrated the capability to identify individuals that were cognitively normal before surgery, but subsequently transitioned to MCI/AD within a year. Although preliminary, these results suggest the utility of blood-based aABs in preclinical detection of AD, perhaps years before the onset of clinical symptoms, thus paving the way for future therapies that could delay or halt disease progression altogether.\nSupporting information S1 Table.
