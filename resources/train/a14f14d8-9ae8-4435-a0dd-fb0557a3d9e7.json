ADNI is a large multicenter study with each center having its own copy of the phantom. The design of the phantom and analysis software are presented as results from predistribution systematics studies and results from field experience with the phantom at 58 enrolling ADNI sites over a 3 year period. The estimated coefficients of variation intrinsic to measurements of geometry in a single phantom are in the range of 3-5 parts in 10 4 . Phantom measurements accurately detect linear and nonlinear scaling in images. Gradient unwarping methods are readily assessed by phantom nonlinearity measurements. Phantom-based scaling correction reduces observed geometric drift in human images by one-third or more. Repair or replacement of phantoms between scans, however, is a confounding factor. The ADNI phantom can be used to assess both scanner performance and the validity of postprocessing image corrections in order to reduce systematic errors in human images. Reduced measurement errors should decrease measurement bias and increase statistical power for measurements of rates of change in the brain structure in AD treatment trials. Perhaps the greatest practical value of incorporating ADNI phantom measurements in a multisite study is to identify scanner errors through central monitoring. This approach has resulted in identification of system errors including sites misidentification of their own gradient hardware and the disabling of autoshim, and a miscalibrated laser alignment light. If undetected, these errors would have contributed to imprecision in quantitative metrics at over 25% of all enrolling ADNI sites."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease \u0351AD\u0352 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people. The pharmaceutical industry is developing disease modifying treatments with the hope of slowing the rate of neurodegeneration. Longitudinal measurements of brain structure change \u0351typically shrinkage due to neurodegeneration\u0352 have been used as a measure of the rate of AD progression. The statistical power to detect brain structure change, including slowing of progression due to effective treatment interventions is limited by measurement errors in addition to biological intrasubject variability. One of the goals of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative \u0351ADNI\u0352 is to develop improved methods for acquiring and processing MRI and PET data in order to reduce measurement error and thus improve statistical power to detect change in brain structures. A component of that development includes an MRI phantom for tracking and possibly correcting scanner performance.\nA natural history study of aging and dementia, ADNI, is jointly funded by the National Institutes of Health and industry via the Foundation for the NIH. The full study will run over five years, following approximately 800 subjects each for 24-36 months. Recruited at 58 clinical enrollment sites, ADNI subjects are scanned on 58 different 1.5 T scanners and 33 3 T scanners. In the ADNI MRI protocol, a phantom is scanned immediately after each subject scan. Each site has an identical copy of the phantom \u0351Phantom Laboratory, Salem, New York\u0352 designed for ADNI to measure linear and nonlinear spatial distortion, signal-to-noise ratio \u0351SNR\u0352, and image contrast. ADNI images \u0351including those of the phantom and human subjects\u0352 are publicly available to researchers via the worldwide web \u0351www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/\u0352.\nPrevious studies of phantom performance have been in limited environments, studying small numbers of phantoms and/or scanners over modest time intervals. The scale of ADNI requires that a fleet of phantoms perform accurately over years. Also, in multicenter trials the selection of enrollment sites is driven by the ability of sites to enroll adequate numbers of subjects that meet clinical inclusion criteria rather than availability of particular MR imaging equipment or access to physics support. Most subjects are scanned on clinical scanners, and locally determined clinical needs drive decisions regarding maintenance and upgrades.\nA key assumption when including phantom measurements in this study was that the phantom captures information about the scanner that is applicable to associated human images. Only if that assumption holds can the phantom be used to disentangle instrumental drifts from biological variations and pathological change. Here we assess the utility of phantom-based retrospective data correction for improving intrasubject image consistency.\nDesigned for scanner calibration, the ADNI phantom can be used both to track scanner changes and to verify that reconstruction operations such as off-line gradient warping corrections are correctly implemented. Phantom-based assessments include \u03511\u0352 geometrical uniformity, \u03512\u0352 SNR, and \u03513\u0352 CNR. This report will focus on the information about scan acquisition geometry obtained through ADNI phantom measurements.\nThe objectives of this paper are as follows:\n\u03511\u0352 to describe the methods used to extract scanner performance data from the phantom scans; \u03512\u0352 to report the sensitivity of the phantom to changes in scanner performance, calibration, and/or imaging parameters; \u03513\u0352 to document the variability of the ADNI phantom fleet at baseline; \u03514\u0352 to demonstrate the efficacy of the phantom for ensuring that scanner-dependent postprocessing reconstruction is correctly implemented; and \u03515\u0352 to describe longitudinal tracking information on scanners used in ADNI as well as the range of per-scanner summary statistics."}, {"section_title": "II.

The goal is to acquire both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI studies at multiple time points in 25% of the subjects.\nEmploying an MP-RAGE \u0351Ref. 22\u0352 sequence, 3 D T 1 -weighted structural images are the focus of the ADNI protocol 23 to measure rates of brain atrophy. Defined across selected systems from GE Healthcare, Philips Medical Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions with an eye toward minimizing cross-platform differences, the nominal TI/ TR/TE at 1.5 T for the ADNI MP-RAGE are 1000/2400/ minimum full \u03f35 ms. On systems with birdcage head coils, TR is increased to 3000 ms to compensate for reduced SNR. Platform-specific protocols were distributed digitally through the MRI vendors to minimize inconsistencies expected to arise from building the protocol manually on individual scanners. Detailed platform-specific lists of parameters are provided at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/.\nIn the ADNI data flow, each MP-RAGE scan undergoes 3D gradient unwarping correction during image preprocessing if applicable. Unlike these references, 1, 15, [19] [20] [21] the ADNI phantom is not used to correct nonlinearities.

The SNR sphere was not designed for precision spatial measurement and the observed spatial manufacturing variability is of the order of a millimeter. Thus, it is used as a rough anchor in finding other navigator spheres.\nSNR measurement in the phantom is carried out in three steps. The cluster is eroded by nine passes with \"center plus six nearest neighbors\" structuring element. A least-squares fit of a smooth quadratic function in 3D is made to the remaining voxels as a bias correction.

Normalized 2D cross correlation with a 1.5 cm circular template is calculated slice by slice. Correlation maxima in 2 cm thick shells with radii of 60 and 90 mm centered on the SNR sphere center are found. Subregions centered on the locations of the maxima are selected, segmented by Otsu's method, clusters found, and positions estimated. Given the positions of the 1.5 cm fiducial spheres and the center of the SNR sphere, a provisional linear coordinate transformation with three rotations, translations, and scalings providing nine degrees of freedom \u03519DOF\u0352 is created. The transformation maps sphere positions in a coordinate system local to the phantom to the image coordinate system. Analysis aborts unless both 1.5 cm spheres are found.\nUsing the provisional transformation, a list of 1.0 cm fiducial marker locations is transformed into the image coordinate system. Working from the center of the phantom outward, the 1.0 cm spheres are found. After three or more 1.0 cm spheres have been found, the provisional coordinate transformation is updated using the 1.5 cm sphere locations, the observed 1.0 cm sphere locations and excluding the SNR sphere location. The 1.0 cm sphere finding scheme is as follows.\n\u03511\u0352 A 3.0\u03eb 3.0\u03eb 3.0 cm 3 subregion of the image centered on the expected sphere location is extracted.

If the maximum correlation product occurs because both the individual maps were populated by negative correlations, then the search for this sphere is aborted. \u03515\u0352 A threshold is estimated which selects voxels occupying 80% of the volume of a 1.0 cm sphere. The subregion is thresholded and clusters of suprathreshold voxels are found. The threshold is lowered by 1% until a cluster is found which overlaps the correlation maximum and contains between 75% and 110% of the expected volume. If the threshold drops below 10% of the maximum intensity in the subimage, the search for this sphere is aborted. The inability to find individual spheres does not stop the search for others. \u03516\u0352 The final sphere center estimate is found as the intensityweighted average position of voxels in the sphere. \u03517\u0352 Dilation is performed on the voxel cluster to include the shell. The mean intensity of a two voxel thick band immediately outside the shell is taken as an estimate of local water background. Tracking the ratio of mean intrasphere intensity to background allows dim sphere detection.\nEarly production phantoms were found to develop leaks in the small inclusion leading to a loss of contrast. The inclusion of cross correlation in step \u03513\u0352 is to aid in the detection of inclusions which have leaked."}, {"section_title": "II.B.6.

Use of phantom measurements to correct linear scaling changes in human images", "text": "In order to assess the efficacy of phantom-based measurements to correct linear scaling changes in human images, we selected image pairs of subjects scanned serially in ADNI. Coregistration was performed using AIR 25 allowing rotation, translation, and scaling \u03519DOF\u0352 on pairs of images from the same subjects. Masks including the skull and its contents and excluding the neck were created for each case. The registration targets, each subject's skull and contents, were therefore spatially invariant over time. Unlike the brain itself, which does change over time, the skull does not. Thus, the anatomic target used for registration here gives an independent measure of change in the gradient scaling over time. No clinical criteria were used in selecting subjects and images used. Two versions of each image, with and without phantom-based scaling correction, were analyzed. From the uncorrected pairs of images sets of coregistration scalings were found. Independently, the phantom-corrected pairs were also coregistered generating another set of scaling parameters. If the phantom captures gradient calibration information which is also applicable to the companion human images, then the distribution of scaling parameters over many pairs of subject images is expected to be narrower and centered closer to unity for the phantom-corrected image pairs than for uncorrected pairs.

Hence bulges near the center of a distribution on an off-diagonal plot appear because the sampling is limited.

Acceptance testing was done on all phantoms used in ADNI to evaluate the correctness of assembly and to estimate the variability of construction. Qualitative assessment of analysis output plots to search for manufacturing problems was carried out on all phantoms. Loosely inserted threaded mounts were the most common error in early production units. Phantoms with construction problems were returned to the manufacturer for repair or replacement. Repaired units were reassessed before being accepted for use.\nAssessing construction variability over a period of months requires correction for potential drift of the scanner on which acceptance testing was done. A single phantom was selected as a master reference unit. The master phantom was scanned when any other phantom underwent acceptance testing and phantoms under test were normalized to the scanner performance estimated from the master phantom scan. Histograms of the ratios of observed test phantom scaling normalized to master phantom scaling are shown in Fig. 4 for the first 66 ADNI production phantoms. The coefficients of variation in the ratios are 3. consistent with the level of variability introduced by differences in positioning and precise machining. Variability perpendicular to the plates is three to four times larger than within-plate variability and also larger than the estimated measurement variability due to positioning. To maximize longitudinal stability, measurements should ideally be made using only one phantom.\nRelated to construction variability is the issue of manufacturing defects. Early production phantoms commonly had issues with leaking fiducial makers. Manufacturing and analysis software improvements have reduced both the incidence of leakage and the necessity to replace phantoms in which leaking spheres are found. The next most common occurrence necessitating replacement is when the detachment of the large 6 cm SNR sphere from its mounting post.

Also, the scans were acquired on 1.5 T systems from vendors 1 and 2 and each pair of images was collected on the same scanner with no phantom repair or replacement between scans.\nThe means and standard deviations of the scale factor values with and without phantom-based voxel size adjustment are shown in Table I . The mean values are all quite close to unity, indicating that for this fleet of scanners drift does not appear to be systematic. The standard deviations of the scale factor distributions are reduced with phantom-based voxel size adjustment. Without correction, the frequencyencoded axis has the most variability; with correction, the variabilities are more consistent across all axes.\nAs previously mentioned, the protocols initially distributed for 1.5 T systems from vendor 3 erroneously had autoshim disabled. Autoshim measurements yield a constant gradient offset in each of the three physical gradient axis directions. These offsets are only expected to affect spatial scaling the frequency-encoded direction for 3D volume scans, because the other two directions are phase encoded. The ADNI MP-RAGE scans are acquired in the sagittal plane, so that the frequency-encoded direction corresponds to the S / I direction. Summary statistics from 62 pairs of scans on 1.5 T systems from vendor 3 in which the phantom was not repaired or replaced between scans are included in FIG. 8 . Summary of scanner performance for more than 2200 phantom scans. A pooled-variance approach is used to estimate the stability of gradient performance factoring out discrete changes generally due to scanner recalibration. Symbols are plotted at the mean scale value over all values, and error bars indicate the square root of the pooled variance. System number is an arbitrary enumeration. R / L calibration appears less consistent across scanners for vendor 1 than for other vendors. The S / I per scanner error bars for vendor 3 are much larger than for other vendors and other directions. Scanners from vendor 2 are from two different models and the data are clustered by model in the S / I mean scale factors. Table I . R / L and A / P coregistration scale factor distributions are narrower than for vendors 1 and 2 \u0351the best case data in the previous paragraph\u0352. As expected the S / I distribution of coregistration scale factors is much broader than for other vendors.\nChanging the phantoms within the time series of imaging sessions introduces additional variability. Phantom construction varies most in the A / P direction and this variability appears in the pairwise scaling when different phantoms were used. From a set of 139 image pairs on ten scanners in which the phantom was replaced between scans, the R / L and S / I variability is essentially unchanged; while A / P variability is larger than with no correction. Moreover, the mean A / P scale factor is shifted after phantom replacement. Early production phantoms frequently had one or more leaking fiducial markers and initial analysis software versions failed in the presence of one or more undetected fiducial markers. The phantom vendor improved the fiducial marker manufacturing process, reducing the incidence of leaking markers. Additionally, the analysis was rewritten to better find dim fiducial markers and also to be tolerant absent markers. Currently phantoms are not replaced unless absolutely necessary.\nBecause roughly 25% of the ADNI subjects are scanned at 3 T \u0351in addition to 1.5 T\u0352, there are fewer pairs of images from 3 T scanners. Summary statistics are included in Table  I . Performance in the A / P and S / I directions are similar to that found for image pairs acquired at 1.5 T. The R / L variability is worse than at 1.5 T. One particular model of scanner is observed to drive the R / L variability \u0351SD= 0.0082\u0352 and when removed from the collection of data the R / L standard deviation for the remaining scanners is reduced to 0.0022, more consistent with 1.5 T data."}, {"section_title": "III.H. Use of phantom measurements to perform absolute scaling of human images across scanners", "text": "Although intrascanner stability is necessary for the success of ADNI, use of the phantom to potentially perform absolute scaling of human images across scanner is of interest too. In the ADNI protocol, each site uses one and only one scanner at each field strength. Thus, the only available cross-system data are also cross field and there is no ready way to disentangle changes related to field strength from changes related to the other system hardware and software. TABLE I. Summary statistics for the scale factors in each of the cardinal directions are shown under various experimental conditions. AS indicates that data were acquired with autoshim enabled; \"no AS\" indicates data from vendor 3 with autoshim errantly disabled in the distributed protocol. \"Matched phantoms\" indicates that each image pair contributing to the underlying distribution was corrected against the same phantom. All 3 T data were acquired with autoshim enabled. "}, {"section_title": "III.I. Verifying the correctness of gradient warping corrections", "text": "The necessity and availability of full 3D gradient warping correction varies by scanner vendor and model; required corrections range from none to full 3D correction done in postprocessing. Correction coefficients are gradient hardware model specific, and therefore, unwarping algorithms are independent of the image content. The approach neglects B 0 inhomogeneity effects. All scans in ADNI are corrected to the level equivalent to full 3D gradient warping correction. Representative measures after first-order polynomial correction for a range of scanners with correct and incorrect correction coefficients are shown in Table II . These are representative values and not intended to differentiate the various scanners \u0351no vendor-or model-identifying information is presented\u0352. Here the requirement is the phantom provides validation that corrections are properly applied. These values are two to four times larger than reported [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] after data-driven corrections were made. Detailed information about the gradient hardware may or may not be present \u0351and reliable\u0352 in the DICOM headers and incorrect gradient hardware was reported by five ADNI sites when surveyed at the start of the study. The phantom was essential in determining that the geometric corrections were being made properly. As discussed previously, the standard-deviation-of-residual radii provides a measure of image nonlinearity. Empirically, we found that with the correct gradient unwarping the scanners in ADNI had similar standard deviation of residual radii values. Using correction coefficients for the wrong gradient hardware results in distinctly larger values, which was the only way we were able to identify the five sites that had reported incorrect gradient hardware at the beginning of the study. Without the phantom-based system surveillance, incorrect unwarping would have been applied to all human images throughout the duration of the study at these five sites."}, {"section_title": "III.J. Detecting system errors with the ADNI phantom", "text": "To date, monitoring each MRI system in the ADNI study has resulted in identification of major system errors that can be grouped into three classes. \u03511\u0352 Five sites misreported their own gradient hardware, leading to incorrect 3D distortion correction. When these errors were detected by analysis of the phantom scan, the correct 3D distortion correction was applied. \u03512\u0352 One site's laser landmark system was misadjusted during an upgrade, leading to geometrical distortion which was detected in one of the off-diagonal scatter plots. The site was unaware of this problem which was uncovered by the phantom measurements. \u03513\u0352 An incorrect protocol parameter \u0351autoshim disabled\u0352 was initially distributed to nine sites.

Gone undetected \u0351and hence uncorrected\u0352, these problems would have contributed to imprecision in quantitative metrics at over 25% of all enrolling ADNI sites."}, {"section_title": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "ADNI is the first large multiyear multicenter MRI trial to employ a phantom scanned with each subject, providing time-locked estimates of scanner performance. The phantom analysis provides precise estimates of linear geometrical scale factors by which the scanner deviates from ideal and which are ascribed to gradient drift and/or miscalibration. The estimated coefficients of variation intrinsic to measurements in a single phantom are in the range of 3-5 parts in 10 4 and are driven largely by phantom positioning within the scanner.\nScanner tracking reveals that gradient stability is in many cases disrupted by recalibration, which is often associated with a system hardware or software upgrade. That is, recalibration induces discrete changes which are often larger than observed system drift over periods of months. On the small subset of systems where autoshimming was errantly disabled on the distributed 1.5 T protocols for one vendor, relatively large instability is observed in the frequency encoded \u0351S / I axis\u0352.\nIn addition to linear fidelity estimates, the analysis produces a summary statistic that captures the spatial nonlinearity in the images. These values are found to be useful in verifying that gradient unwarping corrections made in postprocessing are correctly implemented. With full 3D unwarping, scanners in ADNI perform similarly in this metric. Es- timates of residual nonlinearity for the \"gradwarp\" correction method used in ADNI are two to four times larger than datadriven approaches wherein the deformation field is estimated from phantom images. The distributions of linear scaling parameters for intrasubject coregistration were narrower after phantom-based voxel size adjustment. This result supports the underlying assumption in the ADNI approach that phantom measurements can accurately capture information about the scanner, which can be applied to correct human images acquired in the same scanning session. However, in situations where the assumptions underlying phantom-based scaling of human images were violated-systems with autoshim disabled and where the phantom was repaired or replaced within the time series-as might be expected, phantom-based scaling of human images was not effective and could introduce more error than simply not scaling the human images.\nBased on field experience to date, the greatest practical value of incorporating ADNI phantom measurements in a multisite study is to identify scanner errors through central monitoring. This approach has resulted in identification of three categories of major system errors. Had these gone undetected \u0351and hence uncorrected\u0352, these problems would have contributed to imprecision in quantitative metrics at over 25% of all enrolling ADNI sites.
