Increasing numbers of registered nurses (RNs) commuting away from rural communities for employment contributes to the rural population's challenges accessing healthcare.

However, the actual experiences of RNs living in rural communities who commute to larger communities for employment is absent in the extant literature. Purpose: This descriptive, phenomenological study explored the phenomenon of commuting away among RNs living in rural communities who commuted to larger communities for employment. Methods: Participants included currently licensed RNs, residing in rural communities with a critical access hospital, that had a population of less than 2,500, who commuted for employment in larger communities. Purposeful sampling with snowballing led to 16 RNs from two Midwestern states, providing rich variations in personal and professional experiences. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews.\nFindings: The core meaning, or essence, of the phenomenon of commuting away was found to be \"Commuting to achieve personal and professional goals while being a nurse in a rural community.\" Multifaceted reasons surfaced for RNs to commute for employment. Most noteworthy reasons for employment decisions included opportunities for specialized areas of nursing not available in rural healthcare settings, along with advancement opportunities. Additionally, all RNs in the study were found to appreciate feeling valued as a nurse by members of their rural communities.\nConclusion: The multi-faceted reasons for commuting away indicated that \"one size fits all\" plans for recruitment and retention efforts will not meet the needs of rural nurses, and neither will simply increasing rural nurse wages. Study results are relevant to policy development, nursing practice, nursing education, and future development, recruitment, and retention efforts of nurses serving rural populations."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "a currently licensed RN in one of three Midwestern states;\n2. a resident in a defined rural community (population < 2,500) with a Critical Access Hospital (CAH);\n3. an RN commuting away from his or her home community for employment in a non-rural setting (community with a population of 2,500 or more), and; 4. English speaking.\nAs the sampling process continued throughout the study, purposeful sampling strategies were used to ensure that the sample included a wide variety of experiences that would lead to a rich, full description of the varying aspects of the phenomenon. Variations were sought in relation to differing genders, ages, work experiences, work sites, years of experience, and levels of education.\nIn addition, participants who represented varying relationships with their rural community were also sought, including participants who were born and raised in the rural community versus those who recently moved into the rural community, or did so in the last 3-5 years; as well as participants who had always commuted for employment and those who had been previously employed within the rural community. And finally, variations were sought in community size to which the RNs commuted, including small rural areas, large rural areas, and urban areas, as classified by Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (USDA, 2014) . Communities with a population of less than 2,500 residents, in which a CAH was located, were identified within a tristate Midwest region of the United States. Lists of RNs were received from the Boards of Nursing within those states. Prospective study participants received a letter of invitation through the U.S. Postal Service. The prospective participants were able to respond via a form and addressed and stamped envelope, or via email. Participants were then contacted by phone and/or email to determine eligibility for the study, with the use of a screening tool.\nOnce eligibility was determined, a date and time was scheduled for an interview with the selected participants. Not all eligible participants were interviewed. Rather, only those participants adding to the variability of experiences were included in the study. To determine which participants were included, the population of each of the communities to which participants were commuting to and from were identified and considered, using the RUCA Classification system (USDA, 2014) , along with the 2010 U.S. Census data (as cited in Johansen, 2017) .\nAdditionally, each of these community's counties were classified according to the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) (USDA, 2013) to distinguish counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to metro areas. To ensure variability in the sample, participants were selected based on variations in the RUCA and RUCC codes of the communities where they were employed.\nRecruitment continued until there was good variability in the RUCA and RUCC codes, as well as variation in other factors that could influence differing experiences, and until the researcher was able to identify the essence of the phenomenon and its meaning.\nThe final sample included 16 participants. The RNs all held licenses within the tristate region, and one RN was licensed in more than one state. Varieties of settings were worked in, and the RN roles included staff nurses, advanced practice nurses, and nurse administrators. Practice areas also varied, with areas of specialization including homecare, hospice, medical-surgical units, Table 1 .

An interview guide was used to direct the interview with a set of primary questions that were asked of each RN. In keeping with a phenomenological approach, an open dialogue evolved during each interview and spontaneous questions were asked to obtain both depth and breadth of each RN's description of their experience.\nAll interviews were audio-recorded and ranged in length from 27 to 82 minutes with a mean of 50 minutes.

Schematic drawings were used as an analytical procedure to help understand the codes and clusters of meaning, and the relationships between them.

The essence of commuting away meant that RNs were motivated to commute to an employment setting outside of their rural, home community, in order to achieve personal and professional goals that could not be achieved in their home community. At the same time, they remained a nurse in that community, even if they were not practicing there. As a result of commuting away, they experienced different professional connections. Figure 1 displays the constituents that compose the essence of commuting away. Connections. This means that the connections to coworkers, patients, employers, and home communities was different in their current employment setting than it was (or would have been) in their rural, home communities. For some RNs, the change in these connections was viewed positively and even helped them meet their personal and professional goals, but for others, the different connections were challenging. The meanings of each of these constituents are described in the sections that follow."}, {"section_title": "Being a Nurse in a Rural Community", "text": "All RNs, regardless of whether or not they had worked in their rural, home community prior to commuting for employment, described both experiences and perceptions of what it meant to be a nurse in a rural community. A full description of this constituent has been described elsewhere (Johansen, 2018) . Being a Nurse in a Rural Community provided the context that the RNs 235 continued to live in, even though they were not working in that same home community. The RNs perceived that they continued to be respected and trusted within their home communities, because of their role as a nurse, and this was highly regarded by the participants. What it meant to be a nurse in a rural community was also shaped by their direct experiences and/or their perceptions of the demands of rural nursing practice. This included being \"a jack of trades,\" the need to provide care for neighbors, friends, and family members, a lack of boundaries between their personal and professional lives, and a high visibility because of being known as a nurse in their home communities. Feelings about these issues ranged from neutral to inconvenient and undesirable.\nThe former included feelings such as being viewed as a normal part of living in a rural community as a nurse. The latter feelings were sometimes contributing factors to the decision to commute to another community for employment."}, {"section_title": "Personal and Professional Goals", "text": "While Being a Nurse in a Rural Community, the RNs felt an inability to achieve some of their Personal and professional Goals within their rural communities. Wages, work hours, staffing patterns, benefit packages, job stability, and technology resources available at their current work were described as means to better meet some of their personal goals. Professional goals involved opportunities for professional growth, including opportunities for advancement and working in specialty practice areas. Pursuit of Personal and Professional Goals were the primary employment considerations that led to the RNs seeking employment outside of their rural, home communities.\nWages were a consideration as part of their personal goals as one participant explained: You get paid more but yet you've got to factor all that other stuff in because then are you just coming out even? So then does it really matter what that pay scale is because you have how much more in gas expense, which leads to more oil changes, which leads to more tires. 236 Some RNs reported receiving higher wages after they commuted for employment. However, other RNs reported receiving wages similar to home, or even lower wages. Thus, while the availability of higher wages outside of their rural community was one of the deciding factors for some of the RNs, it was not a deciding factor for all of them. While some received higher wages after they left their rural, home communities for employment, many RNs had to consider the additional costs of commuting.\nAnother personal goal among many RNs was the desire for work to interfere less with their personal lives. Increased flexibility of scheduled hours, fewer weekend and night shifts, and union regulation of hours were viewed as positive benefits in the larger healthcare settings. The job hours they offered were better than anything else I could have gotten anywhere else at that time in my life that I needed less hours.\nWork hours, together with staffing patterns experienced in larger healthcare settings, were appreciated by many RNs. Nurses described how in rural hospitals, there would be only one or two nurses on a shift, with ancillary staff, such as lab techs, only available when needed during evening, night, and weekend shifts. One RN shared: [In the rural hospital] at night, you get a four-vehicle accident with four victims coming and you have two nurses on, and those two nurses are doing your secretarial work, they're caring for the patients already there in the hospital and it's the middle of the night and now you've got to make all these phone calls to try and get people to come in. That would be way too stressful for me.\nIn rural healthcare settings, primary care providers were not on the premises 24 hours a day, and generally available on an on-call basis. Thus, high levels of responsibility for patient care fell to the nurse, and several were uncomfortable with the staffing patterns experienced, or perceived to exist, in rural healthcare settings. Increased availability, and use, of technology resources was considered a benefit for RNs seeking employment in larger healthcare settings. One RN described how less available technology in rural healthcare settings was \"like everything was backwards.\".\nLastly, some RNs feared a lack of financial stability in their rural, home hospital, and many described feelings of increased job stability in larger healthcare settings, because of the better financial stability of the institution. One RN shared: I would say there is more job security involved being at that organization. It's a [regional health system] and it's pretty well run. . . . They're financing it all. So I would say financially it's a very secure and stable security blanket, I guess is what I would call it. There's really no risk of them shutting the place or anything like that.\nOverall, having a consistent, secure source of income was an important personal goal for RNs.\nIn relation to professional goals, opportunities for advancement were often a motivating factor for the RNs to seek employment outside of their home communities. Advancement opportunities related to the ability to practice in specialty areas of nursing, such as maternity care, as well as possibilities to climb the professional ladder, were found when commuting for On the other hand, not all RNs shared the appreciation of specialty nursing opportunities, and these RNs appreciated and even missed the generalist role of the rural nurse. As one RN explained: Now there's so many minute specialties. That's great but you lose that basic skill set of being a nurse. I think people get lost . . . in larger communities, you have to be a specialty.\nIt was noted that specialized practice was available in their rural communities, but it was largely limited to gerontological nursing, and many were not interested in that type of specialization. Just because I'm commuting away from my community doesn't mean that the opportunities aren't there [at home]. They're there but in a different capacity.\nIn the end, RNs not only considered their experiences and perceptions of being a nurse in a rural community when making employment decisions, but they also considered their Personal and Professional Goals. Decisions to commute for work in larger communities were multifactorial, but the RNs determined that the overall opportunities and benefits of commuting outweighed those available to RNs in their rural, home communities."}, {"section_title": "Commuting", "text": "When RNs determined that some of their personal and professional goals could not be met while being employed in their home community, they chose to seek employment in another location, which required they commute for employment. The constituent of Commuting was defined as the act of driving to a larger community for the purpose of employment (this concept differed from, but was part of, the entire phenomenon of commuting away). The act of Commuting affected the RNs' personal and professional lives, and many challenges surfaced. A lack of alertness while driving was also a concern for RNs, with a sense that the lack of alertness spilled over into the patient care setting once the nurse arrived at work. Many of the RNs expressed appreciation of the downtime that they experienced as they drove to and from work, because this provided an opportunity for them to decompress and personally reflect upon their work before they got home.\nAs RNs faced the many challenges presented to them while Commuting, some of them indicated they would prefer to not commute. However, motivation to achieve their Personal and Professional Goals outweighed the challenges they faced as they commuted to work."}, {"section_title": "Different Professional Connections", "text": "As RNs commuted for employment in larger healthcare settings, they found their connections to patients, coworkers, employment facilities, and home communities to be different than those connections when they had practiced in a rural healthcare setting (for those nurses who had 242 previously practiced in their home community); or were different than what they perceived they would face if they were practicing in their rural, home community (for those who had never practiced there). Nurses found higher activity levels while working at larger healthcare facilities, along with greater numbers of patients to care for, in comparison to a rural healthcare setting. Such practice settings led some nurses to feel less connected to their patients, coworkers, and work environments, with connections feeling less personal, and more distant.\nThe experience of caring for patients in a rural, healthcare facility was different from the experiences found caring for patients in larger facilities. Nurses tended to not personally know their patients when they commuted for employment. For some RNs, this greater anonymity was appreciated, and was described positively as \"a distance\" from their patients. That's one relief.\n[ Additionally, this \"distance\" allowed the patients the opportunity to feel safer in disclosing sensitive information with the nurse, as one RN described: I think that I was able to approach patients differently as an outsider because I was not so close to their base. Confidentiality wasn't such an issue. They were more likely to open up and talk to me. The element of \"distance\" in the commuting away experience provided an anonymity of the patient that RNs found they appreciated.\nThe RNs also experienced different connections to their patients outside of the healthcare setting. Nurses generally found it less common to have personal-professional boundary violation issues, compared to what they experienced in their home communities. They were asked about While boundary issues were less common, the feeling of disconnection from patients when interacting outside the professional sphere was still expressed as a loss for some RNs. There were also changes in the connections RNs had with their coworkers. In the rural health care setting, the bond between coworkers was viewed as tighter. \"The relationship that you had with the rest of your staff, it was a tighter bond, because there were a smaller number of you, and you knew that you needed to be there for each other.\"\nAdditionally, the RNs noted that in practice in their rural, home community, a sense of family developed, with coworkers attending social events together, including special occasions for family members. In the smaller communities you went outside of your job and you went and had supper with them. You went out and your kids played ball together. This relationship did not exist with their coworkers at the employment to which they commuted.\nNurses had a greater sense of obligation to their rural coworkers and healthcare facilities as a result of these strong connections. In their rural, home communities, this strong connection also the RNs. In the current study, while some RNs did seek and attain employment with higher wages, others reported that their wages did not increase, and in some cases, their wages even decreased.\nThus, the assumption that wages are the driving force for why rural nurses leave their home communities for employment elsewhere, was not found to be true in this study for three Midwestern states; a finding that has been supported by a few earlier studies (Kovner, Brewer, Wu, Cheng, & Suzuki, 2006; Molanari, Jaiswal, & Hollinger-Forrest, 2011) .\nBeyond personal goals for wages and other employment benefits, the RNs also had a desire to meet professional goals. Professional development opportunities were valued, and RNs perceived a greater availability of these opportunities in larger healthcare settings. Stewart el al.\n(2011) researched factors that are predictive of retention issues for nurses in rural healthcare settings and found that desires for advancements in professional careers were predictive of nurses seeking other job opportunities. The findings from this current study support this. Nurses in the current study also sought specialized nursing practice opportunities outside of their rural, home communities, as well as means to advance their careers. Some RNs in this study perceived that the only specialty practice available in rural areas was gerontological nursing, and they specifically desired other specialty nursing opportunities. Some clinical areas of practice have been found to have more popularity than others, among nurses as a whole. Work environments that are considered dynamic, lifesaving, and highly technical have been found to be preferred, while opportunities to care for mentally ill, or older adult patients, being less desired (Wilkinson, Neville, Huntington & Watson, 2016) . Fewer opportunities for nurses to practice in specialty nursing positions in rural settings have created challenges in retaining nurses in rural healthcare settings (Stewart et al., 2011) . The perceived inability to meet some of their Personal and Professional Goals in their rural, home communities led these RNs to commute to employment some distance from their homes.\nCommuting for employment is not an uncommon practice among rural nurses. One study found that just over 10% of nurses living in primarily small towns and rural areas outside metropolitan areas traveled at least 50 minutes one way for employment (Rosenberg, Corcoran, Kovner, & Brewer, 2011) . The RNs in this study were somewhat under that average, as they commuted 30 miles one way, on average (although some did commute 50+ miles each way).\nIn the current study, RNs voiced appreciation for the downtime while Commuting, as it allowed them to decompress and spend time in self-reflection. However, in a study about mind wandering, monotonous driving was found to negatively impact a driver's performance, especially with the repeated task of driving the same route, unaccompanied, while the driver focused on reflections and inner thoughts that could lead to distracted driving (Berthi\u00e9 et al., 2015) . Such driving practices were found to influence driver safety and the potential for motor vehicle accidents. It is of concern that none of the RNs in the current study indicated any awareness of the personal safety risks associated with this kind of distraction while Commuting. There is a need to educate nurses who commute for employment about the dangers associated with distracted driving, in the form of a focus on self-reflection and decompression from their previous shift work experiences, and teach them about the importance of and strategies for mindful driving.\nAs a consequence of Commuting to employment outside their home communities, RNs felt less connected to their work settings, coworkers, and patients, and some reported having diminished feelings of obligation to their employers. This finding is supported by Medves, Edge, Bisonette, and Stansfield (2015) nurse's employment intentions found that intention to continue employment at a worksite was increased with a relationship that created a sense of dedication and commitment (Cowden & Cummings, 2012) . However, achieving work-life balance has been found to be important among nurses, with appreciation for the ability to feel free from work activities and feelings of obligation on their non-work days (Jamieson, Kirk, & Andrew, 2013) . Castaneda and Scanlan's (2014) literature review, examining job satisfaction among nurses, found that the social and professional relationships nurses experience in work settings were important to job satisfaction. In fact, social relationships were often a top predictor of nurse's satisfaction with their jobs. Rural employers can strive to foster relationships that nurture nurses' feelings of dedication and job satisfaction but should not align those feelings with feelings of obligation that can lead to dissatisfaction with employment.\nIn this current study, the RNs also felt more disconnected to their home communities after they experienced Commuting for employment. Nurses had fewer contacts with community members at home, as they spent less time in those communities. Richards, Farmer, and Selvaraj (2005) found similar experiences while researching the retention of healthcare workers from rural communities who commuted. In this current study, RNs had varying feelings about the loss of connections to their rural communities. Understanding these feelings is important to increase awareness of factors influencing employment decision making."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The current study has a number of limitations that need to be recognized. The sample included nurses from a small geographic area in the Midwest United States, and lacked racial diversity. Additionally, while all of the RNs were commuting away from their rural, home communities for employment, many were still working in other rural communities, whether small who only commute to urban employment settings are warranted to determine if the meaning of commuting away is consistent across populations of rural nurses."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "The findings from this study have implications for nursing practice in rural settings and educating nurses about rural employment. Results will inform rural healthcare employers about recruitment and retention strategies, as well as implications for future policy development and research."}, {"section_title": "Nursing Practice", "text": "The roles of rural RNs need to be acknowledged, recognizing the wide knowledge base and level of expertise needed to provide quality healthcare to rural residents. The public commonly does not understand the complexities and responsibilities of the profession of nursing (Brewer, Zayas, Kahn, & Sienkiewicz, 2006) . It is imperative that, among the profession of nursing, perceptions that rural nurses are less skilled, or less useful, must change to acknowledge their value as professional nurses. Rural nursing requires specialized knowledge and skills, and thus, should be considered a specialized practice. Perhaps if rural nurses were recognized for this specialized practice, among their peers and the public at large, they would feel less need to seek other types of specialization.\nOnline Journal of Rural Nursing and Health Care, 18(2) http://dx.doi.org/10.14574/ojrnhc.v18i2.540\n252"}, {"section_title": "Employers of Nurses in Rural Settings", "text": "The findings from this study can help inform the recruitment and retention efforts of rural healthcare facilities. The general assumption that wages are the primary driving force for rural nurses to seek employment in larger healthcare settings was not substantiated in this study. Rather, there were multiple and varied Personal and Professional Goals that were unmet by the employment options in the nurses' rural, home communities. Unique, individualized strategies for the recruitment and retention of nurses in rural healthcare settings should be developed to benefit not only employers of rural nurses, but also the rural population they serve. This current study found that RNs' goals, both personal and professional, were multifaceted. The one-size fits all strategy to recruit and retain nurses in rural healthcare settings will not be efficient or effective.\nEmployers of rural nurses need to recognize and support the diverse and complex roles required of their nurses. Assessing the comfort levels of nurses, presently employed or being recruited, with the expert generalist rural nurse role, along with the nurse's connections to patients and community members, could lead to the creation of individually tailored resources for these nurses. By understanding nurse's needs, comfort levels, and goals, individualized support systems and resources could benefit both the nurses as well as their patients. Mentorship programs based on the nurse's previous exposures to and comfort with rural nursing, along with orientation programs specifically focusing on the creative, and flexible, roles of rural nurses, can help meet the needs of nurses new to the rural healthcare environments.\nAlthough job satisfaction was not the focus of this study, the complexities of job satisfaction for nurses practicing in rural healthcare settings should be considered in relation to the findings. conditions, status at work, policies, supervision, and relationships at work (Herzberg, 1968) .\nSatisfaction and dissatisfaction are not opposites. Rather, the opposite of dissatisfaction would be \"no job dissatisfaction.\" Frequently, employment strategies focus on hygiene factors, which can lead to less dissatisfaction. However, Herzberg purports that less dissatisfaction is generally temporary, and does not mean there is job satisfaction. Motivating factors can create long-term satisfaction by creating a feeling of worth and fulfillment for employees (Herzberg, 1968) .\nThe Herzberg Motivational Hygiene Theory can explain some of factors that caused the nurses to seek employment outside of their home communities. Nurses sought work place motivators, such as advancement and growth opportunities, not available in their home communities, in order to achieve a higher level of job satisfaction. Hygiene factors were present in their desires for employment benefits and work conditions that they perceived as better than those available to them in their home communities, leading to less dissatisfaction once they commuted. Following Herzberg's theory, there were motivating factors that led to job satisfaction, helping explain why hygiene factors, such as wages, were not as notable in the employment decisions for all nurses. Hence, motivators need to be prioritized, but both motivators and hygiene factors need to be considered in recruitment and retention strategies for rural healthcare employers to create a balance of motivation and the prevention of dissatisfaction.\nProviding motivating factors for nurses to meet their desires for both advancement and specialization opportunities is key to the successful retention of rural nurses. With rural nurses wearing \"many hats,\" spreading out the \"many hats\" could create advancement positions for more nurses, increasing their motivation and satisfaction. Additionally, specialty knowledge that nurses bring with them from practices in larger healthcare settings could be acknowledged and integrated in the nurse's roles as rural specialty experts. These nurses could be called upon to utilize their expertise through telehealth mechanisms, or clinical opportunities. For example, perhaps a rural nurse expresses a desire for specialization in obstetrics (OB), but the rural hospital only infrequently does deliveries. These nurses could be offered an opportunity to receive a paid, mentored experience with a nurse at an OB unit of a more urban facility. That nurse could then return to their home community and be a designated OB nurse specialists who responds to and cares for newly admitted OB patients.\nStriving to decrease employee job dissatisfaction, employers need to be attentive to the benefits being offered to their employees. Even though wages were not found to be a key to all nurse's employment decisions, nurses do need to feel a sense of fairness and equity surrounding wage and benefit packages (Kovner et al., 2006) . Rural nurse desires to prevent work schedules from interfering with their personal lives needs to be a consideration. Flexible self-scheduling has been found to decrease nurse dissatisfaction with their jobs (Leineweber et al., 2016) . For healthcare facilities that do not currently have flexible scheduling options, such interventions may be an effective recruitment and retention strategy.\nConnections between nurses and their rural, home communities need to be considered by healthcare employers. Understanding the desires for some nurses to feel connected to their communities, with others desiring just the opposite, should lead to individualized employment strategies. For those nurses desiring to be connected to their communities, creating opportunities for the nurse to represent the healthcare facility in community projects may be beneficial. The uniqueness of connections between nurses and their coworkers needs to be considered, since rural nurses have been found to have deeper connections to their coworkers when working in rural healthcare settings (Scharff, 2013) . Even with the unique connections between nurses and their coworkers, the need for peer support surfaced in the current study, with a lack of emotional support available to the nurses inside and outside of their employment settings. Rural healthcare facilities need to incorporate a healthy work/life balance for their healthcare providers, creating feelings of dedication and commitment, rather than feelings of obligation that can lead to dissatisfaction. Creating informal peer support mentors, establishing formal end-of-shift debriefing sessions, and support hotlines could conceivably create an atmosphere of peer support.\nNurses in this study all experienced a sense of appreciation from feeling valued and respected by their rural community members. Given that recognition for accomplishments and work done well was valued, rural employers can capitalize on the rural communities' respect and trust for nurses in their communities, thereby increasing job satisfaction and potential for improved "}, {"section_title": "Nursing Education", "text": "The role academic institutions play in preparing nurses for future practice is instrumental in the future of the healthcare provided to rural populations. Previous research has found that exposures to clinical opportunities in rural settings are necessary to prepare nurses for future nursing practice in rural settings (Molanari et al., 2011) . Curricular content of nursing programs has been shown to influence the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of nurses. Simulation has been effective component of nursing curriculum in producing learning opportunities that address reallife situations (Norman, 2012 257 elevating the perceived status of rural nursing, and perhaps making it more attractive to new graduates who are seeking to \"specialize.\""}, {"section_title": "Policy Development", "text": "State and federal governmental efforts have historically aimed to improve the recruitment of rural healthcare providers. Loan repayment programs, and scholarships, were created to recruit healthcare providers to designated healthcare shortage areas, including rural areas. Even though financial incentives have historically been part of recruitment packages for some rural healthcare professionals, there is limited evidence that such programs create long-term success (Mbemba, Gagnon, Par\u00e9, & C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2013) . Following Herzberg's theory, recruitment and retention incentives should not only include financial incentives, but also motivating factors, such as professional growth and opportunities for advancement. With the inclusion of such strategies, an increased success with the recruitment and retention of rural nurses could be realized. National nurse credentialing agencies, such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center, should expand their credentialing policies to offer certification in rural nursing, as a nursing specialization."}, {"section_title": "Research", "text": "With limited research available specifically addressing rural nurse job satisfaction, further research is needed to understand factors that lead to rural nurse motivation, along with factors that dissatisfy, to create the most effective recruitment and retention strategies. The creation of a balance between strategies to empower motivation, and minimize dissatisfaction, could be guided by the development of an assessment tool which employers could use to assist in creating individualized strategies for rural nurse recruitment and retention strategies.\nTracking the current, and projected, commuter trends for rural nurses, such as previously possible with the NSSRN, would benefit rural healthcare facilities and the rural population they 258 serve by understanding how effective recruitment and retention strategies work. An important safety issue identified in this study was the possible distracted driving that may be occurring with rural nurses who commute, while they are engaged in self-reflection and decompression on their drive home. Additional research is needed to identify the prevalence of motor vehicle accidents among nurses who commute significant distances and examine the potential association between distracted driving because of decompression from work, and motor vehicle crashes. Some RNs in the current study also noted that they experienced a lack of alertness on the drive to their work setting, and that lack of alertness sometimes continued into their work. The potential exists for patient safety to be influenced by nurses who commute.
