[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Several metabolic perturbations have been noted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) including failures associated with cholesterol metabolism [1] [2] [3] which has been associated with AD in multiple lines of research including physiological and epidemiological studies. [3] [4] [5] Cholesterol is synthesized in liver and its clearance involves bile acid (BA) production by gut microbiome and human co-metabolism. Changes in microbial gut populations can profoundly alter BA profiles and signaling. Bile acids appear to play a role in the central nervous system. [6, 7] Recent work suggests microbial disturbances linked to BA profiles are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The gut microbiota are involved in immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways [10, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , have been shown to regulate microglial maturation and function, and may contribute to AD. [18, 19] Peripheral metabolic changes may influence central changes through the liver and gut-brain axis that includes commensal and pathogenic bacteria, through its interactions with the vagus nerve, changes in central nervous system functioning, the immune system [20, 21] , and hippocampal neurogenesis. [22] These signals are crucial for the regulation of energy, glucose homeostasis and inflammation. [23] The gut-brain biochemical axis of communication is just starting to be elucidated. Circulating BAs seem to provide an important mechanism for communication between the gut and the brain, and their alterations reflects gut dysbiosis.\nPrevious studies suggest that BAs are altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [24] , and in the preceding paper, we showed that increased levels of secondary cytotoxic BAs and their ratios to primary BAs were associated with AD and poor cognition. This supported the hypothesis that circulating BAs may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Research in AD animal models suggests a role for the gut microbiome in the development of amyloid-\u03b2 pathology [25] .\nHowever, little work has been done in humans to link peripheral metabolic changes in cholesterol to central biomarkers related to AD including amyloid-\u03b2 and tau accumulation, brain glucose metabolism, and structural atrophy. Therefore, we analyzed serum BA metabolites and their ratios from older adults with early stage AD or who were at risk for AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.\nWe hypothesized that serum BA levels and their relevant ratios would associate with biomarkers of AD pathophysiology including neuroimaging (MRI and PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The AD biomarkers were selected and defined consistent with the emergent NIA-Alzheimer's Association Research Framework (\"A/T/N\") for AD biomarkers that defines three general groups of biomarkers based on the nature of pathologic process that each measures (https://www.alz.org/aaic/_downloads/nia-aa-draft- 11-27-2017 .pdf ). [26, 27] Biomarkers of amyloid-\u03b2 plaque (\"A\") are CSF A\u03b21-42 and cortical amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation measured by Florbetapir PET, biomarkers of fibrillary tau (\"T\") are CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and cortical tau deposition measured by tau PET, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury (\"N\") are atrophy on MRI, glucose metabolism on FDG PET, and CSF total tau (t-tau)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study cohort", "text": "Serum samples and data analyzed in the present report were obtained from ADNI.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically link markers of the gut microbiome and liver function to AD-related structural and functional neuroimaging biomarkers as well as biomarkers of amyloid-\u03b2 and tau burden.\nThree core CSF biomarkers (A\u03b21-42, t-tau, and p-tau) reflect AD pathology and can be used to reliably diagnose AD and identify MCI, a prodromal stage of AD, with high diagnostic accuracy. [45, 46] Previous studies showed that AD patients have a substantial reduction in CSF A\u03b21-42 and a marked increase in levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau [47] [48] [49] [50] . We observed that higher levels of TDCA:CA, GDCA:CA, and GLCA:CDCA were associated with decreased levels of CSF A\u03b21-42 and higher levels of GCDCA, TLCA, and GLCA were associated with increased levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau.\nMRI is widely used to investigate structural changes in MCI and AD. [51] [52] [53] We observed lower levels of CA and higher levels of GCDCA, TMCA(a+b), GDCA, GLCA, GUDCA, TDCA, TLCA, DCA:CA, GDCA:CA, TDCA:CA, GDCA:DCA, GLCA:CDCA, and GCDCA:CDCA were associated with greater brain atrophy. Significant regional effects were observed particularly in the bilateral inferior parietal gyri cortices, hippocampi, and temporal lobes including the entorhinal cortex. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are affected early in AD, and the decrease in hippocampal volume accelerates as AD progresses. Significant thinning of the cortical surface reflects atrophy in the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes has been shown in MCI and AD. [51] [52] [53] Reduced cortical thickness in the temporal cortex as a measure of brain atrophy rate has shown promise in predicting MCI to AD progression. [51] Lower CA and higher TDCA, GDCA, GCDCA, GLCA, TLCA, DCA:CA, GDCA:CA, TDCA:CA, GDCA:DCA, GLCA:CDCA, and TLCA:CDCA levels were associated with reduced global glucose metabolism in brain. The significant regional effect on brain glucose metabolism was observed particularly in the bilateral hippocampi for GCDCA, in the temporal and parietal lobes for GLCA, TLCA, and GLCA/CDCA, and in a widespread pattern including the bilateral temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes for GDCA:CA and TDCA:CA. AD patients have shown significant glucose metabolism reduction in the temporal lobes, parietal lobes, and then the frontal lobes with increasing severity of AD. [54] [55] [56] The observed pattern of association between changes in brain structure and glucose metabolism as well as CSF biomarkers with specific BAs and ratios indicates a potential mechanistic connection between peripheral and central biochemical changes. Our results strongly suggest gut-liver-brain axis involvement in AD, neurodegeneration, and brain dysfunction. Both liver function and gut microbiome activity are impacted in AD, and these changes seem to occur at the earliest stages of disease. Despite this strong pattern of associations, the specific mechanism and causal directionality remains to be determined.\nWe hypothesized that altered gut microbiota play an important role. This is supported by several lines of research connecting the gut microbiota and AD pathology. Alterations in the gut microbiota and an increase in gut permeability may lead to dysfunction in the hippocampus [57, 58] and the development of insulin resistance, which correlates with AD pathogenesis. [59] [60] [61] It has been hypothesized that increased gut permeability allows bacteria-derived amyloids from the gastrointestinal tract to accumulate at the systemic and brain level [62] . This in turn could lead to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory microRNA-34a and as a consequence, downregulation of TREM2, leading to the accumulation of A\u03b242. [61, 62] Results from animal studies demonstrate that increased input of BAs significantly inhibits two of the major phyla in the human gut microbiome, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. [63] Bacterial taxonomic composition of fecal samples revealed differences in bacterial abundance including decreased Firicutes, increased Bacteroidetes, and decreased Bifidobacterium (phylum Actinobaceria) in the microbiome of AD patients relative to age-and sex-matched controls. Furthermore, these same differences in bacterial abundance correlated with CSF biomarkers including A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and p-tau/A\u03b242. Even in the age-and sex-matched controls (no dementia diagnosis), there was a similar relationship between the same bacteria that were either more or less abundant in AD and markers of tau and amyloid. [64] In another study, an increased abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (Escherichia/Shigella) and a decreased abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (Eubacterium rectale) were noted in cognitively impaired older adults with evidence of amyloid deposition on PET imaging compared to those who were amyloid negative. [65] These results lend further support to the link between gut microbiota and brain amyloidosis. Gut microbiota have been associated with the accumulation of amyloid plaques in a mouse model of AD. A transgenic AD mouse model generated under germ-free conditions had dramatic reductions in cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 pathology compared to control animals with normal intestinal microbiota. More intriguingly, colonization of germ-free AD mice with microbiota harvested from conventionally raised AD mice showed dramatic increases in A\u03b2 pathology. [25] Decreasing BA in the gut favors gram-negative members of the microbiome, leading to the production of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which elicits a strong immune response. Furthermore, overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria could promote insulin resistance. [57] Lipopolysaccharides concentrations are elevated in AD when compared to controls. [66, 67] In a mouse model of AD, peripheral inflammation induced through LPS resulted in significantly higher levels of A\u03b21-42 in the hippocampus and marked cognitive deficits [68] . Several studies have confirmed that increased inflammation as a result of LPS is associated with memory impairments. [69] [70] [71] It is thought that declines in memory are the result of the association between LPS-accumulation of A\u03b2 and neuronal cell death. [69] In contrast, increased BA in the gut favors gram-positive members of Firmictures, including bacteria that 7\u03b1-dehydroxylate host primary BAs into secondary toxic BAs. [72] [73] [74] The association between BA cytotoxicity and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is well documented. [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] Others have proposed that mitochondrial ROS production plays an important role in brain metabolic signaling. [80, 81] Some of the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction leads to neuronal degeneration in AD include ROS generation and activation of mitochondrial permeability transition [82, 83] , suggesting a crucial role for oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of AD. Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins has been linked to oxidation through the microtubule-associated protein kinase pathway. [84] In our analyses, three cytotoxic BAs (GCDCA, GLCA, and TLCA) correlated with higher biomarker levels of fibrillary tau and neurodegeneration/neuronal injury.\nHydrophobic BAs, like CDCA, are known to damage biological membranes [85] , whereas hydrophilic BAs, like UDCA and TUDC, are inhibitors of apoptosis via their ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes. [86, 87] Impairment of mitochondrial function is likely one of the vital ways in which BAs cause cellular dysfunctions [88] [89] [90] [91] . Decreased mitochondrial membrane potential has been associated with increasing concentrations of the bile acids, LCA, DCA, UDCA, CDCA, GCDC, and taurochenodeoxcholic (TCDC) acid.

For example, the population of the gut is affected by a plethora of factors including geography, lifetime immunological experience, and environmental factors, which could play important, yet currently unknown roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Experimental studies are needed to understand the mechanistic role of BA in the development of AD-related pathology as well as to disentangle cause and effect.
