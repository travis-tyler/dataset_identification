[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As of 2001, 40 percent of students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96 had attended more than one institution (table A). Over the course of the undergraduate education of 1999-2000 college graduates (first-time bachelor's degree recipients), a majority (59 percent) had attended more than one institution (figure 3). Even among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4-year institutions, about 47 percent had attended another institution at some point with or without transferring (table 8-A). Much of the research on students who attend multiple institutions has focused on those who make a permanent transition from one institution to another (Bradburn and Hurst 2001;McCormick 1997). For the most part, previous literature has not reported on the other ways in which students enroll in multiple institutions, including co-enrollment (i.e., attending more than one institution simultaneously, also called \"overlapping enrollment\" or \"dual enrollment\") and attending another institution without transferring from the first institution. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the extent to which undergraduates attend multiple institutions as well as the relationship between multiple institution attendance and persistence, attainment, and time to degree. Students who attended multiple institutions are the population of interest here. Subsets of this population will also be examined-specifically, those who: \u2022 Attended two or more institutions at one time (co-enrolled), \u2022 Transferred between institutions, or \u2022 Began at a 4-year institution and attended a 2-year institution at some point. This report focuses on both 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients and is organized by survey and beginning institution type. This analysis uses data from the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) and the 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01). BPS:96/01 is a longitudinal survey of students who first began their postsecondary education in 1995-96. The last follow-up survey was conducted in 2001, 6 years after students began their postsecondary education, by which time some students were no longer enrolled in postsecondary education, some had completed degrees or certificates, and some remained enrolled. B&B:2000/01 provides data on students who received a bachelor's degree in the 1999-2000 academic year, regardless of when they began their postsecondary education. Both studies used in this report are based on a representative sample of postsecondary education institutions in the United States and Puerto Rico and the students within those institutions. This analysis examines differences in student enrollment patterns using standard t-tests to determine statistical significance, and a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to detect differential changes by testing for interaction effects. Statistical significances for both tests are reported at p<0.05. Standard error tables are available online at http://nces.ed.gov/das/library/reports.asp.\nAmong all undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary education in 1999-2000, 6 percent attended more than one institution during the academic year. 1 Over the course of their undergraduate education, however, a majority (59 percent) of 1999-2000 college graduates (firsttime bachelor's degree recipients) had attended more than one institution. 2 The frequency of multiple institution attendance may be on the rise. Adelman (1999) and McCormick (2003) both documented an increase in students' rates of attendance in multiple institutions over the last two decades, and the Association of American Colleges and Universities (2002) cited changing enrollment patterns, including multiple institution attendance, as a particular challenge facing institutions in the 21st century. The types of multiple institution attendance may be changing as well. Although past studies on patterns of attendance in multiple institutions have often focused on transfer and, in particular, on students who enroll in public 2-year institutions with the intent to transfer to 4-year institutions and earn a bachelor's degree (Bradburn and Hurst 2001;Lee and Frank 1990;Palmer, Ludwig, and Stapleton 1994), anecdotal evidence suggests that students in 4-year institutions often take courses at nearby community colleges and other institutions as well (Gose 1995). Among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4-year institutions, about 47 percent had attended another institution with or without transferring. 3 This report examines the phenomenon of multiple institution attendance including three specific types of multiple attendance: transfer, co-enrollment, and attending a 2-year institution. There are a number of reasons why students might attend multiple institutions. In an article on \"double dippers\" (i.e., students who enroll in multiple institutions simultaneously), Gose (1995) presents several possible explanations: to take advantage of a more convenient schedule, smaller class sizes, and programs not offered at the student's home institution (e.g., remedial education, technical training, and job skills); to cut college costs by taking general education courses at a less expensive institution; or to take courses that students think will be easier at a different institution. Another study by de los Santos and Wright (1990) suggested that students who begin in 4-year institutions might attend other institutions so that they can fulfill their academic requirements and reduce the price of attending college. In a study of transfer behavior among postsecondary students, McCormick (1997) found that among students who began in 4year institutions, dissatisfaction with intellectual growth, teacher ability, institutional prestige, and social life, as well as the availability of and satisfaction with various student services were related to students' likelihood of transferring. Further, McCormick (2003) found that among students who entered 4-year institutions with a bachelor's degree goal, the probability of attending multiple institutions was higher for students with low first-year grades than other students, which indicates that academic difficulties may also motivate students to attend multiple institutions. One type of multiple institution attendance is associated with delayed degree completion: in McCormick's earlier study, students who began in 4-year institutions and transferred to another 4-year institution were less likely to have completed a bachelor's degree within 5 years than students who did not transfer. According to another study (Berkner, He, and Forrest Cataldi 2002), even when surveyed 6 years after entering college, roughly half (45-51 percent) of students who began in 4-year institutions in 1995-96 with a bachelor's degree goal and transferred to another 4-year institution had attained a bachelor's degree, compared with 72 percent of their counterparts who did not transfer. McCormick (2003) also noted differences in persistence and attainment outcomes by the type of multiple institution attendance. According to the findings of his study, 4-year beginning students who attended more than one institution but did not transfer were more likely to have attained a bachelor's degree within 5 years than their peers who attended only one institution. As mentioned previously, the study of students who attend multiple postsecondary institutions is not new. In his landmark study, Tinto (1987) examines the reasons students leave postsecondary education noting the income gap between those with and without a college degree. Multiple institution attendance may have economic consequences as well. Light and Strayer (2004) suggest that for two specific subgroups (4-year transfer students who ultimately attain bachelor's degrees and 2-year students who do not attain a degree) transferring was associated with higher eventual wages. The authors theorize that by transferring, these students enrolled in an institution that was a better match and got higher-paying jobs as a result. As mentioned previously, much of the research on students who attend multiple institutions has focused on those who make a permanent transition from one institution to another (Bradburn and Hurst 2001;Light and Strayer 2004;McCormick 1997). For the most part, previous literature has not reported on the other ways in which students enroll in multiple institutions, including overlapping enrollment (also called \"co-enrollment\" or \"dual enrollment\") and attending another institution without transferring from the first one. Because recent longitudinal studies conducted by NCES included questions about ways that students attend multiple institutions without transferring, this report examines this trend from a national perspective. Using the most recent data available, this report focuses on both 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients whose enrollment paths involved attending at least two institutions and aims to provide more detailed information on college attendance patterns than has been available from previous studies. By examining the enrollment histories of these students, their demographic characteristics, and their reasons for enrolling in other institutions, this report will provide an overview of the students who took this route as undergraduates, and will detail their educational outcomes by focusing on the persistence among beginning postsecondary students, attainment of both groups, and time to degree among college graduates."}, {"section_title": "Beginning Postsecondary Students", "text": "As of 2001, 40 percent of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students had attended more than one institution, including 32 percent who had transferred from one institution to another and 11 percent who had co-enrolled (table A). 1 Among beginning postsecondary students who had attended more than one institution, about onequarter had attended more than two institutions (table 1). Not surprisingly, students' attendance patterns differed according to the level and control of institution they first attended. Students who began in 2-year institutions were more likely than students who began in 4-year institutions to attend more than one institution or to transfer (table A  and table 2). For example, 47 percent of students who began in public 2-year institutions had attended more than one institution as of 2001, compared with 39 and 37 percent of students who began in public 4-year and private not-for-profit 4year institutions, respectively. No difference, however, could be detected between students who began in 2-year and in 4-year institutions in their likelihood of ever co-enrolling. Among students who began in 4-year institutions, those in public institutions were more likely than their private not-for-profit counterparts to transfer or ever attend public 2-year institutions. Twenty-seven percent of those who started in public 4-year institutions had transferred and one-fifth had enrolled in public 2-year institutions, compared with 24 and 14 percent, respectively, of students who began in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. No difference was detected between students in public and in private not-for-profit 4year institutions in the number of institutions they attended or their likelihood of co-enrolling. In general, among 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students, more traditional students, v such as younger students and those who attended full time, were more likely to attend multiple institutions than their older or part-time counterparts (tables 3-A and 3-B; tables 4-A and 4-B). Likewise, dependent students and those who did not delay their postsecondary enrollment were more likely to attend multiple institutions than their counterparts who were independent or who delayed their enrollment. For example, among students who began at 4-year institutions, 39 percent of dependent students had attended more than one institution as of 2001, compared with 27 percent of independent students. Conversely, students with more than one characteristic that placed them at risk of not completing postsecondary education were less likely than their counterparts with one or no such characteristics to attend multiple institutions. 2 However, these characteristics are also associated with students' likelihood of persisting in their postsecondary programs. The longer students persist, the more opportunity they have to attend more than one institution. Thus, to some extent, the association between these risk factors and multiple institution attendance may be due to the length of time students are enrolled. The association between dependency status and multiple institution attendance was particularly apparent among students in public 2-year institutions, also known as community colleges. That is, in public 2-year institutions, dependent students were more likely than independent students to attend more than one institution (58 vs. 27 percent; table 3-A). This may be due, in part, to the fact that dependent students were more likely to transfer to 4-year institutions to earn a bachelor's degree than their independent peers. 3 Similarly, independent students participate in programs leading to vocational certificates more often than dependent students (Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002). Because these programs tend to be of short duration (i.e., 1 year or less), students may have less opportunity or reason to transfer. In addition, independent students are more likely to attend part time, which is also associated with lower rates of multiple institution attendance. Independent students are also more likely to have families, careers, and other responsibilities that may influence their ability to move from school to school. In contrast, dependent students are more likely to enroll in community colleges with the intention of transferring to a 4-year institution and attaining a bachelor's degree. For 1995-96 postsecondary students beginning at 4-year institutions, multiple institution attendance was negatively related to degree attainment within 6 years. It appears, however, that for some students, multiple institution attendance may have only delayed attainment. For example, among students who began in 4-year institutions, those who attended more than one institution were less likely than students who attended only one institution to have attained any degree (55 vs. 71 percent); however, students attending more than one institution were more likely than those who attended one institution to still be enrolled in 2001 (25 vs. 8 percent) (figure A; table 4-C). About one-fifth of both groups were not enrolled and had not earned a degree. These results suggest that students who attended more than one institution may have needed more time to finish and that, given enough time, they may ultimately attain a degree. On the other hand, multiple institution attendance involving covi enrollment appeared to be positively related to persistence and attainment."}, {"section_title": "Relationship of Specific Variables to Persistence, Attainment, and Time to Degree", "text": "In order to take into account the interrelationship of factors associated with multiple institution attendance, a multivariate analysis was conducted. The analysis examined the relationship between multiple institution attendance patterns and 6-year persistence and attainment among beginning postsecondary students (table 5). The analysis included students who began their postsecondary studies in 1995-96 at 4-year institutions with a bachelor's degree goal and measured their likelihood of attaining a bachelor's degree or being enrolled in 4-year institutions 6 years later. It took into account beginning institution sector (i.e., public or private not-for-profit), types of multiple institution attendance, and several other variables associated with both multiple institution attendance and persistence, including income, GPA, and number of risk factors. After taking the covariation of these variables into account, the results still indicated that 6-year persistence was positively associated with co-enrolling and negatively associated with transferring and enrolling in public 2-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "While the previous section focused on firsttime beginners in postsecondary education, this section looks at students who attained bachelor's degrees in 1999-2000 regardless of when they vii began postsecondary education. The BPS survey included students who began postsecondary education in 1995-96 and, therefore, includes students who did not attain a degree as well as those who attained certificates, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees. B&B, however, looks retrospectively at those students who attained bachelor's degrees in 1999-2000, regardless of their path to that degree or the time required to attain it. Therefore, these two cohorts are not directly comparable. This section will focus on bachelor's degree recipients. An examination of the multiple institution attendance patterns of 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients revealed that a majority (59 percent) attended more than one institution during their undergraduate education, including 35 percent who transferred and 9 percent who coenrolled at some point (figure 4). 4 Among those who started at 4-year institutions, 37 percent had also attended 2-year institutions (table 8-A). Among bachelor's degree recipients, independent students, older students, and students with more persistence risk factors were more mobile during their postsecondary studies than dependent students, younger students, and students with fewer persistence risk factors (tables 7-A and 8-A). Although these findings appear to contradict the BPS findings, the populations are not comparable: unlike beginning postsecondary students-whose risk factors are identified when they first enroll-in the B&B study, most of college graduates' risk factors are determined when they acquire their bachelor's degree. Thus, over the course of their enrollment, college graduates may become independent and develop additional persistence risk factors such as becoming a parent. Furthermore, students who take longer to attain a degree have more opportunities to attend multiple institutions and may not be captured in the BPS study which only encompasses 6 years. Also, participants in the B&B study have all obtained a bachelor's degree-thus having overcome whatever persistence risk factors they may have at the time of the survey. When looking at specific persistence risk factors which measure characteristics of graduates when they began their postsecondary education, among college graduates who began at 4-year institutions, those who delayed entry into postsecondary education and those who worked full time during their first year enrolled were more likely than their counterparts who did not delay entry or work full time to attend multiple institutions (table 8-A). Consistent with the results found for beginning postsecondary students in BPS:96/01 in which multiple institution attendance was associated with slowed progress toward degree or certificate attainment, data from B&B:2000/01 indicated that attending more than one institution was associated with slowed progress toward the bachelor's degree (figure B). This may be related to the difficulty of transferring credits, different requirements at various institutions, or gaps in enrollment, or mitigating factors such as a move, job change, or change in family status. Other reasons or a combination of reasons may also influence progress toward the bachelor's degree for students who attend multiple institutions. Among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4year institutions, as the number of institutions attended increased, so did the average time to completion (tables 8-B and 8-C). Co-enrolling and transferring among bachelor's degree recipients viii who began in 4-year institutions also resulted in their taking more time to complete a degree. However, differences by sector for these types of attendance patterns were observed. In the B&B:2000/01 survey, college graduates were asked to report their main purpose for attending multiple institutions (table 6). As expected, those who began in public 2-year colleges were more likely than those who began in 4-year institutions to report transfer as their main purpose. That is, 63 percent of those who began in public 2-year colleges listed transfer as their main purpose for attending multiple institutions. However, about one-half of students who began in 4-year institutions (both public and private notfor-profit) also reported transfer as their main purpose. In addition, about one-third of bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4-year institutions said they enrolled in more than one institution to take additional classes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Attending more than one postsecondary institution during the course of undergraduate enrollment is a common practice.

As would be expected, students who began their postsecondary education in a community college were more likely to transfer than those who began in 4-year institutions, because community college students typically must transfer to earn a bachelor's degree. Nevertheless, about one-quarter of those students who started in 4-year institutions had transferred as of 2001, and for them, transfer was associated with lower persistence rates.

The results of the study clearly show that attending more than one institution is a common practice for undergraduates.

In addition, students who began in community colleges with intentions of earning a bachelor's degree, those with repeated multiple institution attendance (attending three or more institutions), and repeated transfers were less likely to attain a degree than their counterparts with fewer occurrences of multiple attendance. When taking risk status and other related variables into account, multivariate analyses of beginning postsecondary students who began their postsecondary education in a 4-year institution with a bachelor's degree goal indicated a negative association between transfer and persistence. That is, among these students, those who transferred were less likely than those who had not transferred to attain a degree or be enrolled in 4-year institutions 6 years after first enrolling in postsecondary education. As with transfer, beginning postsecondary students who began their postsecondary studies in a 4-year institution and who attended a community college at some time during their enrollment were less likely to persist for 6 years or attain a degree than their counterparts who had not attended a community college. In contrast, beginning students who had ever co-enrolled were more likely to persist or attain than those who had not.

Reasons may be related to the difficulty of transferring credits, different requirements at various institutions, or mitigating factors such as a move, job change, or change in family status.

The BPS survey includes students who left postsecondary education temporarily or permanently, students who attained various degrees (bachelor's, associate's, and vocational certificates), and students with no degree goal, such as those taking classes for professional development or personal enrichment. Students who attended multiple institutions are the population of interest here. Subsets of this population will also be examined-specifically, those who attended two or more institutions at one time (co-enrolled), transferred between institutions, or began at a 4-year institution and attended a public 2-year institution at some point. As of 2001, 40 percent of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students had attended more than one institution over the 6-year period (table 1). Of those students who attended more than one institution, about one-fifth (21 percent) had attended three institutions and 4 percent had attended four or more institutions. About one-third of the beginning postsecondary students had ever transferred (32 percent). In this section, a student was considered to have transferred if that student left one institution and enrolled in another institution for at least 4 months. Among those students who transferred, the majority (80 percent) had transferred just once, 18 percent had transferred twice, and 1 percent had transferred three times. About 1-in-10 beginning postsecondary students had ever co-enrolled. That is, 11 percent of beginning postsecondary students had overlapped enrollment at more than one institution for at least 1 month. Among students who had attended more than one institution, 27 percent had ever co-enrolled, and among students who had transferred, 20 percent had ever co-enrolled. As would be expected, patterns of multiple institution attendance varied according to where students first enrolled (table 2). For this reason, this report examines these patterns according to first institution level. Students who began in public 2-year institutions were more likely than students who began in 4-year institutions to attend more than one institution and to transfer. Forty-six percent of 1995-96 beginning public 2-year students had attended more than one institution as of 2001 and 40 percent had transferred, while 38 percent of beginning 4-year students had attended more than one institution and 26 percent had transferred. No difference, however, could be detected between these two groups of students in their likelihood of ever coenrolling. Among students who began in 4-year institutions, those in public institutions were more likely than their private not-for-profit counterparts to transfer or ever attend public 2-year institutions. Twenty-seven percent of those who started in public 4-year institutions had transferred and one-fifth had enrolled in public 2-year institutions, compared with 24 and 14 percent, respectively, of students who began in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. 6 No 6 The institutions students transfer to are often of interest as well. Berkner, He, and Forrest Cataldi (2002) show that 42 percent each of 4-year beginners in public and private not-for-profit institutions transferred to a public 4-year institution. However, The percentage of students who attended more than one institution is the sum of the percentages of students who attended two, three, or four or more institutions. 2 The percentage of students who transferred is the sum of the percentages of students who transferred once, twice, or three times.

While most of these students had transferred to 4-year institutions (roughly 61 percent), some had transferred laterally to other 2year institutions (32 percent), and some had transferred downward to less-than-2-year institutions (7 percent). 7 Eleven percent of beginning students in public 2-year institutions had co-enrolled during the course of their enrollment. Male students were more likely than their female peers to attend more than one institution, in particular, to attend three or more institutions. Fifty-one percent of male students who began in public 2-year institutions in 1995-96 had attended more than one institution and 16 percent had attended three or more institutions, compared with 43 and 8 percent, respectively, of female students. Males were also more likely to transfer (47 vs. 36 percent); however, no gender difference could be detected in their likelihood of co-enrolling. Certain characteristics that placed students at risk of not completing their postsecondary education, including delayed enrollment status, dependency, and age at postsecondary entry, were also related to beginning students' likelihood of attending multiple institutions. As the number of such persistence risk factors increased, the likelihood of attending more than one institution, coenrolling, or transferring decreased. For example, 68 percent of students with no risk factors and 2 Risk factors include delaying enrollment, not having a high school diploma, enrolling part time, being financially independent (typically students over 24), having dependents other than a spouse, being a single parent, and working full time while enrolled.

Thirteen percent co-enrolled, one-quarter (26 percent) transferred, and 18 percent had enrolled in public 2-year institutions. Among those who began in 4-year institutions, few differences could be detected by sex, except that men were more likely than women to have ever enrolled in public 2-year institutions (19 vs. 16 percent). For students with factors that placed them at risk of not completing their postsecondary education, patterns of multiple institution attendance generally resembled those of their peers who began in public 2-year institutions. Students with two or more risk factors were less likely than students with one risk factor to attend more than one institution (34 vs. 42 percent). They were also less likely to co-enroll (8 vs. 15 percent); however, no differences could be detected by number of risk factors in likelihood of transferring or attending a public 2-year institution. Dependent students who began at 4-year institutions were more likely than their independent counterparts to attend multiple institutions: 39 percent of dependent students attended more than one institution, compared with 27 percent of independent students.

For example, 26 percent of dependent students transferred, compared with 21 percent of independent students.

This pattern may be due in large part to the greater likelihood of dependent students transferring to a 4-year institution and independent students participating in programs leading to vocational certificates (Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002). Because vocational programs tend to be of short duration (i.e., 1 year or less), these students may have less opportunity or reason to transfer than dependent students. In addition, independent students are more likely to attend part time (Horn and Berktold 1998), which is also associated with lower rates of multiple institution attendance, and often have families, careers, and other responsibilities that can influence their ability to move from school to school. Among dependent students beginning in public 2-year institutions, family income 8 was associated with attending more than one institution: as income increased, so did the likelihood of attending more than one institution. Seventy-three percent of dependent students in the highest income quartile had attended more than one institution, compared with 53 percent of dependent students in the lowest quartile. In addition, dependent students in the highest income quartile were more likely than those in the middle-and low-income quartiles to transfer (69 percent vs. 47-48 percent). However, for these students, the likelihood of co-enrolling was not associated with income. Higher income levels, however, are also associated with increased persistence (Berkner, He, and Forrest Cataldi 2002), giving students more opportunity to attend more than one institution. An opposite pattern was observed for independent students: those with higher incomes were less likely to attend more than one institution and transfer. For example, 39 percent of independent students in the lowest income quartile attended more than one institution, while 23 percent of those in the highest quartile did so. Independent students with higher incomes were also more likely than their lower income independent counterparts to attend community colleges part time (63 vs. 18 percent), 9 and part-time attendance is associated with lower rates of multiple institution attendance (table 3-B)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Characteristics", "text": "Among 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who first enrolled in public 2-year institutions, those who did not work or who worked part time (less than 35 hours per week) during their first year enrolled were more likely than those who worked full time (35 hours or more) to attend more than one institution or transfer (table 3-B).

Likewise, no difference could be detected between students whose first-year grade point average (GPA) was lower than 2.25 and those who earned higher grades in their rates of attending more than one institution. 11 Not surprisingly, among students who began in public 2-year institutions who reported a degree expectation at their first institution, as degree expectation increased, so did the likelihood of attending more than one institution.

Twenty-three percent had attained a bachelor's degree within 6 years: 6 percent in 4 years or less and 17 percent in more than 4 years.

This delay in attainment may be related to several possible reasons-such as difficulty in transferring credits, different requirements at various institutions, or mitigating factors such as a move, job change, or family status change. Co-enrollment for these students, on the other hand, was positively related to bachelor's degree attainment and persistence.

Thirty-six percent had attained a bachelor's degree in 4 years or less, and an additional 26 percent had attained one in more than 4 years. While attending more than one institution was inversely related to attainment rates for students with a bachelor's degree goal (72 percent who attended only one institution had attained a bachelor's degree within 6 years vs. 46 percent of students who attended more than one institution), the same pattern was not detected for co-enrollment. Roughly two-thirds of students had attained a bachelor's degree within 6 years, whether or not they co-enrolled. Transferring, however, was negatively related to such attainment rates for students with a bachelor's degree goal: 72 percent of students with a bachelor's degree goal who never transferred had attained a bachelor's degree within 6 years, while 31 percent of those who transferred had. Among students who transferred, those who transferred once were more likely than those who transferred twice to complete a degree in 4 years or less (11 vs. 6 percent) but were no more likely to complete a degree within 6 years (roughly one-third of both groups). In summary, attending more than one institution, transferring, or enrolling in public 2-year institutions were negatively related to attainment for beginning postsecondary students in 4-year institutions. Although students who attended more than one institution had lower rates of attainment, once persistence was included no difference could be detected in rates for those who attended only one institution and those who attended more than one. So, for some of these students, multiple institution attendance is associated with delayed attainment and, given more time, they may eventually achieve their degree goal. Furthermore, among students who began at 4-year institutions, co-enrollment appeared to be positively related to their rates of persisting and attaining.\nStudents who begin in less-than-4-year institutions and later attain a bachelor's degree must attend a second institution in order to enroll in a bachelor's degree program. However, for these students, repeated multiple institution attendance (e.g., attending more than two institutions) can delay degree completion. Among 1999-2000 college graduates who began in public 2-year institutions, more than half took longer than 6 years to complete a bachelor's degree (table 7-B). The average time between initial enrollment in postsecondary education and bachelor's degree completion was about 9 years. Although all bachelor's degree recipients who began in public 2-year institutions attended at least two institutions, those who attended more than two institutions took more time to complete a bachelor's degree than those who attended just two institutions. For these students, as the number of institutions attended increased, so did the average time to completion.

Just over one-third (38 percent) of college graduates who began in public 4-year institutions earned a degree within 4 years, while the majority (65 percent) of students who began at private not-for-profit institutions did so (tables 8-B and 8-C). The average time between initial enrollment in postsecondary education and bachelor's degree completion was about 6 years for graduates who began at public 4-year institutions and about 5 years for graduates who began at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Because of this difference, the time between postsecondary entry and bachelor's degree attainment is reported separately for students who began in public 4-year institutions and those who began in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Nonetheless, students who attended more than one institution took longer to complete their degree than students who attended just one institution, regardless of the sector in which they began. Students who began in public institutions and remained at the same institution to earn a degree averaged about 5 years between initial enrollment and bachelor's degree attainment, while students who enrolled in two institutions took about 6 years, students who enrolled in three institutions took about 9 years, and students who enrolled in four or more institutions took an average of 12 years. Similarly, for private not-for-profit institutions, as the number of institutions attended increased, so did the average time to completion (4, 5, 7, and 12 years, respectively). Among bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4-year institutions, co-enrolling, transferring, and attending a 2-year institution at some point also corresponded to taking more time between postsecondary entry and degree completion.  10.9 36.7 7.6 \u2020 Not applicable. 1 A small percentage of cases contained inconsistent information indicating that some students who began in 4-year institutions transferred upward in their first transfer. 2 Only students who attended multiple institutions in order to transfer, take additional classes, or both were asked whether they attempted to transfer credits.

The dependent variable was a dichotomous outcome (yes/no) indicating "}, {"section_title": "No bachelor's degree", "text": "Students who began in 4-year institutions whether a student had either attained a formal credential or was enrolled in a 4-year institution. 14 Specifically, the analysis examined the relationship between types of multiple institution attendance and student persistence, taking into account the covariation of variables such as demographics, socioeconomic status, persistence risk factors, and academic performance. The main independent variables were the three types of multiple institution attendance: coenrollment, enrollment in public 2-year institutions, and transfer status. Based on their association with multiple institution attendance patterns and persistence and attainment rates, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, income, and number of risk factors were included in the model. Measures of academic success (grade point average in the first year enrolled) and enrollment continuity, which are associated with persistence and attainment, were also included. First institution sector was included in the model as well. The analysis included students who began in 4-year institutions with a bachelor's degree goal and measured their likelihood of attaining a bachelor's degree or being enrolled in 4-year institutions 6 years later. The results of the multivariate analysis are shown in table 5. The first column shows the unadjusted percentages, which are the percentages of students who had attained a bachelor's degree or were enrolled in 4-year institutions 6 years after initial enrollment in postsecondary education before controlling for the independent variables in the model. The comparison groups are shown in italics, and all statistically significant differences are designated with an asterisk. The second column displays least squares coefficients expressed as percentages. Least squares coefficients that achieve statistical significance (as denoted by an asterisk) represent the observed differences between the analysis group and the comparison group after controlling for the other independent variables in the model. For example, in table 5, the least squares coefficient for those who had co-enrolled is 12.70. Therefore, compared to students who did not co-enroll, about 13 percent more students who had co-enrolled might be expected to have attained a bachelor's degree or be enrolled in a 4-year institution 6 years after initially enrolling in postsecondary education upon controlling for the relationships among the other independent variables. The results of the multivariate analysis generally supported the results of the tabular analysis. The positive association between co-enrollment and persistence and attainment-which was apparent before controlling for covariation-remained, with students who had co-enrolled more likely to have persisted or attained than those who had not co-enrolled. Similarly, the negative relationship between persistence and attending public 2-year institutions or transferring 14 Although the DAS simplifies the process of conducting a linear regression analysis, it also limits the range of procedures that can be used. The least squares regression procedure used in this analysis is sometimes sufficient for binary outcomes (such as the outcome studied here). However, when the proportion of the sample participating in the outcome is very low or very high, logit or probit procedures are preferred. See appendix B for more details.

However, the unadjusted advantage in persistence and attainment of private not-for-profit beginners over public 4-year beginners disappeared once the covariation of student and enrollment characteristics were taken into account."}, {"section_title": "Table 5.-Percentage of 1995-96 beginning students in 4-year institutions with a bachelor's degree goal who", "text": "The positive relationships between numerous other independent variables included in the analysis on persistence and attainment that were evident in the tabular analysis remained as well. Specifically, students with high incomes, no risk factors, high grade point averages, and those who were continuously enrolled as undergraduates remained more likely to have attained bachelor's degrees or be enrolled 6 years after beginning than their peers with incomes in the middle or lower quartiles, one or more risk factor upon initial enrollment, those with grade point averages of 3.25 or less, and those who had more than one enrollment spell.

Those that are significant (i.e., that indicate a significant difference from the reference group's mean) are indicated by an asterisk. For example, the coefficient for those who co-enrolled during their undergraduate education is 12.80, which means that about 13 percent more students who co-enrolled would be expected to have earned a bachelor's degree or be enrolled at 4-year institutions compared to students who did not co-enroll. 4 Standard error of least squares coefficient, adjusted for design effect, multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix B "}, {"section_title": "Summary: Beginning Postsecondary Students", "text": "In general, among 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students, more traditional students, such as younger students and those who attended full time were more likely to attend multiple institutions than their older or part-time counterparts. Similarly, those with few factors that placed them at risk of leaving postsecondary education, such as those who did not delay their postsecondary enrollment, were more likely to attend multiple institutions than students with a greater number of persistence risk factors. However, many of these characteristics are also associated with students' likelihood of persisting in their postsecondary programs. The longer students persist, the more opportunity they have to attend more than one institution. Thus, to some extent, the association between these factors and multiple institution attendance may be due to the length of time students are enrolled. On the other hand, among students who began at 4year institutions with a bachelor's degree goal, even when students' risk status and continuity of enrollment were taken into account in a multivariate analysis, the negative association between either transferring or attending public 2-year institutions and persistence remained, as did the positive association between co-enrolling and persistence. Beginning postsecondary students in 4-year institutions who attended multiple institutions were less likely than their counterparts to attain a degree within 6 years. Given the association between attending multiple institutions and time to degree, it may be that those who attend more than one institution are simply taking longer to complete their postsecondary education and earn a degree. For example, among students who began at 4-year institutions, those who attended more than one institution were less likely than students who only attended one institution to have attained any degree (55 vs. 71 percent), but were more likely to still be enrolled anywhere in 2001 (25 vs. 8 percent). About one-fifth of both groups had left without a degree."}, {"section_title": "1999-2000 Bachelor's Degree Recipients Introduction", "text": "This section of the report focuses on bachelor's degree recipients, using data from the 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01). Students who attained their degrees in 1999-2000, regardless of when they first enrolled in postsecondary education, were included in the sample for this survey. Therefore, this student population differs substantially from that discussed in the previous section. That is, while the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) followed a cohort of students who began postsecondary education from the 1995-96 through the 2000-2001 academic year, the B&B survey focuses on a cohort of bachelor's degree recipients who graduated in 1999-2000. The BPS survey includes students who left postsecondary education temporarily or permanently, as well as students who attained various degrees or were still enrolled. B&B respondents, on the other hand, have all attained bachelor's degrees. Therefore, the two cohorts are not directly comparable in terms of their patterns of multiple institution attendance. B&B looks retrospectively at the enrollment histories of students who ultimately attained bachelor's degrees. Their paths to degree attainment vary widely, with some students taking many years and enrolling in several institutions along the way, and some earning their degrees at the institution at which they began their studies just a few years earlier. Students who attended multiple institutions are the population of interest here. Subsets of this population will also be examined-specifically, those who attended two or more institutions at one time (co-enrolled), transferred between institutions, or began at a 4-year institution and attended a 2-year institution at some point. The majority (59 percent) of 1999-2000 first-time bachelor's degree recipients attended more than one institution during the course of their undergraduate enrollment. Thirty-five percent attended two institutions, 16 percent attended three institutions, and 8 percent attended four or more institutions (figure 3). Figure 4 shows the types of multiple institution attendance: 9 percent had co-enrolled and 35 percent had transferred. In this section, co-enrollment was identified only if it occurred within the academic year and lasted for more than 1 month and students are considered to have transferred if they indicated that they had attended more than one  "}, {"section_title": "Percent", "text": "Total Public 2-year Public 4-year Private not-for-profit 4-year postsecondary institution before completing a bachelor's degree and did so in order to transfer between schools.

Because public 2-year institutions typically do not offer bachelor's degree programs, 100 percent of students who began in public 2-year institutions and later attained a bachelor's degree attended more than one institution. Of those, 70 percent identified transfer as their main purpose for attending more than one institution, and 12 percent co-enrolled. 15 Forty-eight percent of bachelor's degree recipients who began in public 4-year institutions attended more than one institution and 46 percent who began in private not-for-profit institutions did so.

Specifically, students were given the option of choosing one of the following reasons: transfer between schools, enroll for additional classes, enroll for an additional degree, transfer and take additional classes, or none of the above. The largest proportion reported transferring between schools as their main reason for attending more than one institution (table  6). As would be expected, those who began in public 2-year colleges were most likely to report wanting to transfer as their main purpose for enrolling in multiple institutions (63 percent), with an additional 7 percent reporting that they intended to both transfer and take additional classes. Fourteen percent of graduates who began in public 2-year institutions and attended more than one institution reported that they enrolled to take additional classes, and 7 percent enrolled for an additional degree. Surprisingly, about one-half of bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4-year institutions and who attended more than one institution also reported that their purpose for attending multiple institutions was to transfer. About one-third of these graduates reported attending multiple institutions in order to take additional classes, and an additional 5-7 percent 15 In some cases, students who began in public 2-year institutions attended 4-year institutions without transferring. In B&B:2000/01 students who indicated that they had attended more than one postsecondary institution before completing a bachelor's degree were asked why they chose to attend multiple institutions. Those who said they had attended multiple institutions in order to transfer between schools were considered to have met the student-identified definition of transfer used in the B&B section of this study. This question addressed all multiple institution attendance, so where students attended more than two institutions it is not possible to determine between which institutions the transfer occurred. Some students who began in 2year institutions and later attained a bachelor's degree did not identify transfer as their purpose for attending multiple institutions and, therefore, were not considered as having met this definition of transfer. reported that they enrolled to both transfer and take additional classes. This pattern was observed for students who began in both public and private not-for-profit institutions."}, {"section_title": "Student and Enrollment Characteristics", "text": "Among college graduates who began in public 2-year institutions, 60 percent attended two institutions, 28 percent attended three institutions, and 11 percent attended four or more institutions (table 7-A). Twelve percent of students had co-enrolled at some point, and more than two-thirds (70 percent) reported transferring as their main reason for attending more than one institution. That is, 30 percent of students who began in public 2-year institutions and later attained a bachelor's degree did not report that their purpose for attending two or more institutions was to transfer between schools and, therefore, were not considered to have transferred in this section of the report. Among graduates who began in public 2-year institutions, students who were financially dependent in 1999-2000 were less mobile than their independent peers. While 81 percent of dependent students who began in public 2-year institutions attended just two institutions, about one-half of independent students did so. The remaining independent students attended three institutions (33 percent) or four or more institutions (15 percent). Similarly, 82 percent of students with no persistence risk factors attended just two institutions, compared with 68 percent with one persistence risk factor and 54 percent with two or more risk factors. Students with two or more risk factors were more likely to have co-enrolled than students with no risk factors (14 vs. 7 percent). Few other differences could be detected among graduates by their student and enrollment characteristics, however. Where there appeared to be differences, often there were large standard errors. Furthermore, where differences were detected, they could be related to the length of enrollment. Students have cited various reasons for enrolling in multiple institutions, some of which are academic, such as changing majors or programs or poor academic performance, and some of which are nonacademic, such as a job change, moving out of the area, or a change in family responsibilities (Gose 1995). As the length of time a student remains enrolled increases, so do the chances of a change in circumstances that may influence their likelihood of attending multiple institutions. Similarly, as students remain enrolled for longer periods of time, their chances of having persistence risk factors, such as financial independence and full-time employment, increase. Because most persistence risk factors were measured at the time of bachelor's degree completion in B&B:2000/01 (as opposed to when they began, as in Type of multiple enrollment Attended more than one institution Students who began in public 2-year institutions BPS:96/01), the time that elapsed between their initial enrollment and degree attainment is related to the likelihood of having persistence risk factors.\nAmong 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who began in public or private not-forprofit 4-year institutions, 47 percent attended more than one institution: 28 percent attended two institutions, 13 percent attended three institutions, and 6 percent attended four or more institutions (table 8-A). One-quarter of these students transferred, more than one-third attended a 2-year institution, and 8 percent co-enrolled at some point before earning a bachelor's degree. No differences were detected between college graduates who began in public 4-year institutions and college graduates who began in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions in the rates of attending multiple institutions, co-enrolling, and transferring. However, those graduates who began in public institutions were more likely than their peers in private not-for-profit institutions to have ever attended 2-year institutions (40 vs. 32 percent). Bachelor's degree recipients who began in 4-year institutions and had more persistence risk factors were more mobile over the course of their studies than those with fewer risk factors. While 31 percent of students with no risk factors attended multiple institutions, about half of students with one risk factor and 69 percent of students with two or more risk factors had done so. It should be noted that most of the risk factors were assessed at the time of degree completion and over the course of their enrollment college graduates may become independent and develop additional risk factors such as becoming a parent. Furthermore, students who take longer to attain a degree have more opportunities to attend multiple institutions and develop risk factors. Examining specific risk factors revealed that college graduates who delayed enrollment between high school and college were more likely than those who did not delay to participate in each type of multiple institution attendance. For example, 13 percent of students who delayed postsecondary entry had co-enrolled, and 48 percent had attended 2-year institutions at some point, compared with 6 and 34 percent, respectively, of their counterparts who did not delay enrollment. Likewise, students who were financially independent from their parents or guardians were also more likely to have engaged in all forms of multiple institution attendance than their financially dependent peers. While 37 percent of dependent students had attended more than one institution before earning a bachelor's degree, the majority (68 percent) of independent students had done so. Students who worked full time during their first year of enrollment were more mobile than their counterparts who worked part time or did not work at all. Full-time employees were more likely not only to attend more than one institution, with 62 percent doing so compared with 33- (typically students over 24), having dependents other than a spouse, being a single parent, and working full time while enrolled.

Students whose primary reason for attending multiple institutions was to transfer took less time to complete their degree than students who had other reasons for attending multiple institutions (9 vs. 10 years). Among students who attended multiple institutions in order to transfer or take additional classes, no differences could be detected in average time to completion between those who attempted to transfer credits and those who did not.

Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data."}, {"section_title": "Item Response Rates", "text": "Weighted item response rates were calculated for all variables used in this report.

The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors 5 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B-1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 2, generated by the DAS.

In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors 5 None of the survey samples were based on simple random sampling procedures and, therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion.

Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, 6 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the formula: where r is the correlation between the two estimates. 7 This formula is used when comparing two percentages from a distribution that adds to 100. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used:  where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 8 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error, denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 selected for findings in this report indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced no more than one time out of twenty when there was no actual difference in the quantities in the underlying population. When we test hypotheses that show t values at the .05 level or smaller, we treat this finding as rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities. However, there are other cases when exercising additional caution is warranted. When there are significant results not indicated by any hypothesis being tested or when we test a large number of comparisons in a table, Type I errors cannot be ignored. For example, when making paired comparisons among different fields of study, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison."}, {"section_title": "Linear Trends", "text": "While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using Student's t statistic, some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories (in particular for persistence risk index and income), rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition total sum of squares into within-and betweengroup sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05. 9 Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. Means and Taylorized standard errors were calculated by the DAS. Unweighted sample sizes are not available from the DAS and were provided by NCES."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Commonality Analysis", "text": "Many of the independent variables included in the analyses in this report are related, and to some extent the pattern of differences displayed in the descriptive tables reflect a common variation. For example, when examining the degree attainment by multiple institution attendance patterns, some of the observed relationship may be due to differences in other factors related to attending multiple institutions, such as attendance intensity and persistence risk factors. However, if nested tables were used to present the influence of all related factors, cell sizes would become too small to find the significant differences in patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to include another level of variation, other methods must be used to take such variation into account. The method in this report uses multiple linear regression to adjust for the common variation among a list of independent variables. 10 This approach is sometimes referred to as commonality analysis 11 because it identifies lingering relationships after adjustment for common variation. This method is used simply to confirm statistically significant associations observed in the bivariate analysis while taking into account the interrelationship of the independent variables. The analysis is not based on a theoretical model or used to establish causal inferences and the regression model is not reduced. In other words, subsequent models were not run that removed nonsignificant independent variables. Significant coefficients reported in the regression tables indicate that when the variable is deleted from the model, it results in a non-zero change in Rsquared, which is the basis of the commonality analysis. In other words, a significant coefficient means that the independent variable has a relationship that is unique, or distinct from the independent variables' common relationship with other independent variables in the model. As discussed in the section \"Data Analysis System\" above, all analyses included in PEDAR reports must be based on the DAS, which is available to the public on-line (http://www.nces.ed.gov/DAS). Exclusively using the DAS in this way provides readers direct access to the findings and methods used in the report so that they may replicate or expand on the estimates presented. However, the DAS does not allow users access to the raw data, which limits the range of covariation procedures that can be used. Specifically, the DAS produces correlation matrices, which can be used as input in standard statistical packages to produce least squares regression models. This means that logit or probit procedures, which are more appropriate for dichotomous dependent variables, cannot be used. 12 However, empirical studies have shown that when the mean value of a dichotomous dependent variable falls between 0.25 and 0.75 (as it does in this analysis), regression and log-linear models are likely to produce similar results. 13 The independent variables analyzed in this study and subsequently included in the multivariate model were chosen based on the descriptive analysis rather than on a theoretical model. Before conducting the study, a detailed analysis plan was reviewed by a Technical Review Panel (TRP) of experts in the field of higher education research and additional independent variables requested by the TRP were considered for inclusion. The analysis plan listed all the independent variables to be included in the study. The TRP also reviewed the preliminary results as well as the first draft of this report. The analysis plan and subsequent report were modified based on TRP comments and criticism."}, {"section_title": "Missing Data and Adjusting for Complex Sample Design", "text": "The DAS computes the correlation matrix using pairwise missing values. In regression analysis, there are several common approaches to the problem of missing data. The two simplest approaches are pairwise deletion of missing data and listwise deletion of missing data. In pairwise deletion, each correlation is calculated using all of the cases for the two relevant variables. For example, suppose you have a regression analysis that uses variables X1, X2, and X3. The regression is based on the correlation matrix between X1, X2, and X3. In pairwise deletion, the correlation between X1 and X2 is based on the nonmissing cases for X1 and X2. Cases missing on either X1 or X2 would be excluded from the calculation of the correlation. In listwise deletion, the correlation between X1 and X2 would be based on the nonmissing values for X1, X2, and X3. That is, all of the cases with missing data on any of the three variables would be excluded from the analysis. The correlation matrix produced by the DAS can be used by most statistical software packages as the input data for least squares regression. The DAS provides either the SPSS or SAS code necessary to run least squares regression models. The DAS also provides additional information to incorporate the complex sample design into the statistical significance tests of the parameter estimates. Most statistical software packages assume simple random sampling when computing standard errors of parameter estimates. Because of the complex sampling design used for the survey, this assumption is incorrect. A better approximation of their standard errors is to multiply each standard error by the design effect associated with the dependent variable (DEFT), 14 where the DEFT is the ratio of the true standard error to the standard error computed under the assumption of simple random sampling. It is calculated by the DAS and displayed with the correlation matrix output."}, {"section_title": "Interpreting the Results", "text": "The least squares regression coefficients displayed in the regression tables are expressed as percentages. Significant coefficients represent the observed differences that remain between the analysis group (such as those who co-enrolled) and the comparison group (did not co-enroll) after controlling for the relationships of all the selected independent variables. For example, in table 5, the least squares coefficient for those who co-enrolled is 12.7. This means that compared to those who did not co-enroll, about 13 percent more of the group who co-enrolled would be expected to attain a degree or be enrolled in a 4-year institution, after controlling for the relationships among all the other independent variables."}]
