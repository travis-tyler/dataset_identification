[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In this chapter, I am using the newly designed survey of Business Research Development and Innovations (BRDIS) to establish several stylized facts regarding the distribution of R&D spending as well as innovation outcomes. Some of the findings are original to this paper thanks to the newly collected information from the BRDIS survey and I would like to highlight those here. Firstly, businesses with no reported R&D spending produce a fair number of innovations, measured both by patent filings (19% of total numbers of patents) and sales from new product introductions (16% of total sales generated from new products/services). These businesses are on average small in size and only rarely produce innovations (if we measure the impact of innovations by the sales of new products/services, their innovations are on average much smaller compared to the impact of innovations created by big corporations) 1 . However, a great many of these \"micro-innovators\" can still create huge benefits to society in aggregate, and therefore deserve careful studies. There 1 However, we cannot track the life value of these innovations made by small firms, as the more successful ones are more likely to be acquired by big firms later on and become more accessible to consumers with the help of branding/distributional advantage of big firms 1 are several hypotheses regarding why these \"innovators\" do not have any R&D spending. One possibility is that the reporting of R&D is mainly induced by incentives from R&D tax credit, these firms do not label certain qualified activities as R&D because of the high cost associated with claiming R&D tax credit. However, in other cases, these innovations may indeed come from different sources than organized R&D activities, such as repeated interaction with clients, or technological empowerment of equipment suppliers (which are most prevalent in service industries) (Hall and Jaffe, 2012). Another important fact identified in this thesis is the rising dominance of the service industry, not only in pure economic sense of sales and employment, but also in terms of innovations. In recent years, the service industry has become a major contributor to R&D spending (30% of worldwide R&D spending in 2011) and patenting activities (37% of total patent applications in 2011) 2 . The European Union has long recognized the growing importance of service innovations and established several initiatives to support the service sector innovations, especially in the \"knowledge intensive business services\" (Clusterset al., 2012). However, both academics and policy makers in the U.S. are clearly lagging behind, suggested by the paucity of serious investigations into service innovations. The traditional studies in innovations have focused on manufacturing firms, with organized R&D activities (measured by reported R&D spending), technological advancements, and product developments (measured by patenting activities) as its core features. However, the service industry encompasses a wide range of activities, which function very differently from the manufacturing industry, especially in terms of innovative behaviors. The second half of the chapter is therefore devoted to the identification of some common features of innovative behaviors in the service industry, both through literature review and through the analysis of service providers in the BRDIS Survey. Highlights of the discussions are as follows. A two-by-two classification of the service industry is introduced to study the general patterns of service innovation: business orientation vs. consumer orientation, and knowledge intensive vs. not knowledge intensive. The division is motivated by the fact that technology-driven consumer-facing services such as Internet companies may demonstrate more resemblance to high-tech manufacturing firms, for they are more product-focused, and also have centralized R&D activities in house (for sure they will also have distinctive features that needs to be taken into considerations). On the other hand, more business-oriented knowledge-intensive services, such as professional or technical consulting services, will have very different innovative dynamics. Since most of the services are tailored towards different business clients to suit their specific needs, centralized R&D activities do not make much sense. In addition, the nature of innovation for knowledge-intensive v.s. non-knowledgeintensive services varies significantly. Therefore, I have created the above classification to provide a basic framework to facilitate analysis. Analysis reveals that business-oriented services dominated the reported R&D spending and patent applications. Secondly, service companies attach very little importance to patent protections in terms of intellectual property protection, regardless of the classifications. Across different industries, trade secrets have received the highest ratings, followed by trademark and copyright. Thirdly, knowledge intensive industries are more likely to enter into formal research alliances with their customers or suppliers. Due to the inherent heterogeneity across different service industries, general studies like this can gain very limited insight into the innovative behaviors of diverse service providers. Depending on what specific research questions one asks, different classifications may be more applicable. For example, clustering algorithms based on co-location, labor mobility, and input-output relationships might be more suitable to study the impact of network effect or knowledge spillovers. Lastly, I would like to suggest some additional measurements that the Census should consider collecting in order to better understand the process of service innovations. In terms of the input of innovations, the current questionnaire follows the traditional manufacturing studies and focuses on R&D spending as the key inputs. Since organized R&D is not the only approach for innovation, the government should consider measures such as human capital development and training activities, as well as average educational attainments of various positions in addition to \"researchers\". Experience accumulation and professional development are crucial in such industries, as innovative ideas will probably frequently come from repeated interactions with clients. In addition, technological advancements from their suppliers may produce fundamental changes in how they deliver their services, and such incorporation of breakthrough technologies serves as another source for innovations in the service industry. Therefore, the Census should consider collecting investment into high-tech products and additional technological acquisitions as additional inputs into innovations. In terms of the measurement of innovative successes, as patents do not serve as a good proxy in the service industry, in addition to self-reported innovative successes (in BRDIS survey), one has to look into the profitability growth of the service providers, mergers and acquisitions by big companies due to innovative success, and the benefits enjoyed by their clients (such as productivity gain, cost savings, and the clients' own innovativeness) to understand the direct impact of these service innovations. This will give us a fuller picture of the impact of innovations and not rely only on self-reported sales for sole measurements. The rest of the chapter is as follows. Section 1.2 introduces the BRDIS Survey. Section 1.3 provides some general background of R&D histories and cross-country comparisons. Section 1.4 presents the stylized facts developed from the survey. Section 1.5 provides a detailed literature review in service industry innovations, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Section 1.6 presents additional analysis of the service industry in the BRDIS Survey. Section 1.7 concludes with some discussions."}, {"section_title": "The BRDIS Survey", "text": "In 2008, the National Science Foundation introduced a new survey called the Business Research Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) in accordance with the Census Bureau. It is the successor to the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD), which for more than 54 years has served as the primary source of R&D performed by the industries in the United States. As the name suggests, in addition to collecting information regarding R&D activities, the BRDIS draws extensively from the European Community Innovation Survey and introduces many questions that target firms' innovative behaviors. This upgrade was largely due to the increasing importance and changing landscape of innovation activities in the business sector (Wolfe), such as : \u2022 Business sector has surpassed the government to become the largest source of R&D funding; \u2022 R&D and innovation are increasingly performed in service industries and in small companies; \u2022 Firms increasingly leverage science and technology resources outside the firm and enter into strategic research alliances."}, {"section_title": "The Sampling Process", "text": "The BRDIS Survey is a representative survey that covers all domestic, non-farm, for-profit businesses with more than 5 employees (Foundation). The survey follows a stratified probability sampling design, which combines both simple random sampling and probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling within strata. More specifically, for companies with known positive R&D activity (either from previous years of SIRD or BRDIS data, from other IRS or Census surveys, or from public sources such as Compustat): [Capitalize NAICS?] \u2022 any firm with known R&D expenditure greater then $ X1 3 million will be selected with certainty; \u2022 if an industry 4 has less than X2 unselected companies, then all companies will be selected; \u2022 for firms with less then $ X1 million R&D, sample using PPS method with maximum weight of X3. For companies with known zero R&D spending, the following procedure is followed: \u2022 top Y1% firms in terms of payroll within each industry and firms that have claimed more than $ Y2 million R&D tax credit recently will be selected with certainty; \u2022 for firms that have claimed R&D tax credit between $ 0 and $ Y2 million, if the firm has payrolls more than $ Y3, then the firm will be selected with certainty. Otherwise a firm will be selected with Y4 probability; \u2022 among the rest of the firms, if a firm has at least one establishment in naics code 5417 (scientific research and development services), then the firm will be selected with certainty. Otherwise a firm will be selected with Y5 probability; Finally, for firms with unknown R&D spending: \u2022 top Z1 companies in terms of payroll within each industry, or top Z2 firms in industry 4541, or top Z3 firms in industry 5174 will be selected with certainty; \u2022 for firms that have claimed R&D tax credit between $ 0 and $ Z4 million, if the firm has payrolls more than $ Z5, then the firm will be selected with certainty. Otherwise a firm will be selected with Z6 probability; \u2022 top Z7 companies in terms of payroll in each state will be selected with certainty; \u2022 for the rest of the firms, if the firm is not in manufacturing industry, then a firm will be selected with Z8 probability; following procedure is used to assign a representative six-digit naics industry for the firm: first, exclude all unit with naics code 55 (management of enterprises) or naics code 5417 (scientific research and development services); secondly, aggregating all the payrolls to two-digit naics industries, and select the industry with the highest payroll; now restricting to establishment within the assigned two-digit naics industry, and follow the same procedure to select a dominant three-digit naics industry; repeat this process until a six-digit naics industry is selected. \u2022 for the rest of the firms in manufacturing industry, the survey uses a PPS (Probability Proportion to Size) Sampling algorithm. This sampling process yields a sample size of roughly 40,000 each year, out of which 10,000 are non-respondents. Therefore, we have approximately 30,000 valid observations each year. The analysis of this thesis uses the year between 2009 and 2012, since year 2008 is the first year of the new survey and the data are less reliable."}, {"section_title": "Measurements of Innovation", "text": "What is innovation? There does not seem to be a consensus in the literature. The narrowest definition may consider only technological inventions developed through scientific research, but the broadest definition may cover any combination of novel ideas. In the classical essay of The Theory of Economic Development, Schumpeter defined innovative activities as the following five broad categories (Joseph, 1934): \u2022 launching a new product or a new variant of the existing product; \u2022 applications of new methods of producing or selling a product; \u2022 opening a new market; \u2022 acquiring new sources of raw materials or intermediate products; \u2022 developing new industry structure such as the creation or destruction of a monopoly position. Other than the last one, which is a little controversial (since Anti-Trust regulations outlaw the deliberate creation of monopoly positions without any natural or technological barriers), after so many years, these definitions are still applicable to today's economy and capture the essence of innovative activities. However, before the introduction of the BRDIS survey, large-scale information that directly measures these distinctive aspects of innovation are simply non-existent. Scholars have traditionally used R&D spending as a measure of input of innovation. Later on, with the introduction of the NBER Patent Citation Project (Hall et al., 2001), a significant body of literature has grown to examine patent applications, grants, citations, knowledge spillover and geographic linkages, inventor mobility, patent litigations, and numerous other aspects of firm patenting behavior (for comprehensive reviews on these topics, please see Hall and Harhoff 2012; Lerner and Seru (2015); Hall and Lerner (2010)). We have gain a lot of insight into the patentable part of firm innovations through the empowerment of the NBER Patent Data. However, as Bronwyn Hall, one of the initiators of the NBER Patent Project, commented herself, both R&D and patents are insufficient measures of innovation (Hall, 2011). R&D spending has the benefit of sharing a comparable unit ($), and measures the resources and commitment each firm exerts. At the same time, it suffers from fact that it is only an input to innovation and there is no information regarding the success of innovation. On the other hand, a patent indicates at least a partial success of innovations, but the measure is quite noisy. There are a few core misalignments between patent measures and actual innovation outcomes. Firstly, besides patenting, firms are using a lot of other ways to protect their intellectual properties, trade secrets and lead time advantage being two equally prominent, if not more important forms compared to patents (Cohen et al., 2000). Secondly, the qualities of the patents have a huge variance, even though information about patent citation information can mitigate the problem to a certain degree. Moreover, the quality of one technological advancement doesn't necessarily translate to commercial success or consumer welfare improvement, and various other efforts including design, marketing, logistics would have to go into a profitable product launch, not to mention that the success is severely impacted by the competitive, regulatory, and macro environments of the firm. In addition, the nature of technological development has evolved and the innovative process have become increasingly cumulative and complex, and it is not rare to see hundreds or even thousands of patents going into a product, and these patents may be cross-licensed from other parties, making it into a complicated web of different innovations (Hall, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "The BRDIS Survey came at a time when understanding of comprehensive process of innovation has never been more crucial.

However, there is no single identifier that can link the Compustat firms to the BRDIS survey. I have taken the following procedure to identify a match between the two dataset: firstly, some Compustat firms report their Employer Identification Number (EIN), this can be trusted as a match. If no match is established, then a name matching algorithm is used to identify potential matches. 7 I manually inspect all potential matches from the name matching algorithm, and incorporate information of each company's industry and location to assure the accuracy of final matches."}, {"section_title": "General Background about R&D and Innovation", "text": "In this section, I draw on both public sources and the BRDIS survey to present some background regarding both R&D and Innovations in the United States. respectively.

In the early years, the federal government makes up for majority of the R&D funding, until in 1980 business sector R&D for the first time surpassed the federal government and since then has become the major funding source. The recent rapid growth in R&D spending has been driven mostly by the business sector. In year 2012, the business sector contributes 62.98 percent of the total funding, the federal government accounts for 29.8 percent, and the other nonprofit organizations such as private universities, research institutes, and foundations account for only 7.18 percent.

It is interesting to find that public firms account for less than 0.03% by firm count, but approximately 28% in sales and more than 67% in reported R&D spending. However, their share of patent applications, grants, and sales for new to market products/service are all significantly less than 68% 9 , even though by all these measures public firms are still dominating the playing field of innovation.

Firstly, R&D spending are highly concentrated, top 100 firms in R&D spending account for more than 55 percent of total R&D spending in the country. What is more, these firms only comprises of a little more than 6 percent in total sales and 4 percent in total employment. The majority of the firms have no R&D spending at all. Zero R&D firms account for more than 73 percent of sales and more than 76 percent of employment among non-farm for-profit businesses in the United States. We can apply the same exercise to ranks of absolute sales and the results can be found in 1.4. We can see that sales concentration is much lower compared to R&D spending. The top 100 firms ranked by sales only account for 18 percent of total sales. They also account for approximately 25 percent in total R&D expenditures, suggesting big firms tend spend more in R&D compared to smaller firms."}, {"section_title": "Zero R&D Firms Still Create Innovations", "text": "Another rather surprising observations that we get from Table 1.3 is that even though some firms report zero R&D spending, they still generate innovations, as manifested in their patent filings and new product introduction. As highlighted in Table 1.3, zero R&D spenders create in total approximately 19.50 percent of patent applications, and approximately 16 percent of new product sales. It then becomes a mystery that how this is possible. There are  Notes: All observations are weighted by the sample weightStandard deviations across the years are reported in parenthesis. several hypothesis. Firstly, most people record R&D spending for the purpose of claiming R&D tax credit. For small and medium sized firms, the application process might be too cumbersome to justify the tax savings, as most of the firms do not have enough income or profit to benefit from the tax deductions. In addition, firms may fear that claiming for R&D tax credit could trigger higher risk of IRS audits. If this is the case, then these zero R&D firms are not much different from the ones with positive R&D spending. However, another more interesting potential explanation is that these innovations are indeed not created through the traditionally understood centralized in-house R&D activities, but as a side-product during the process of production, through repeated interactions with clients, or through collaboration with outside consultant such as universities and research institute. This co-production process of innovation might be particularly relevant for service industries. We will examine the this more closely later. Yet another possibility is that these firms invest in machinery, computer systems, or services that incorporates a lot of the innovations from upstream industries, and was therefore enabled to produce innovations (better quality products or products with new features) without themselves investing in R&D spending (Hall and Jaffe, 2012). More generally, we see that the output measures of innovation is less concentrated compared to R&D spending. As we see in the last chapter, the top 100 R&D spenders account for 55% of R&D spending, but they only account for 40% of patent granted. If we additionally look at sales from new to market products, the percentage drops to even lower at 28%. These evidence suggest that a lot more other factors go into the actual introduction of new products, and R&D spending is only one of them. We need to more investigation about the innovative process within each corporation to explain the differences. (Hall and Jaffe, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Mega-innovators and Micro-innovators", "text": "In order to understand more about firms that spend little on R&D but still generate innovations, I created the following Table ?? to understand the average R&D spending and innovation measures within each R&D rank bucket. The top 100 firms on average spend an astonishing $1.8 billion each year on research and development. We call this group \"mega-innovators\". Patent applications and issuance average 476 and 365 each year. More than 62% of these firms claim that they have introduced a new product into the market in the last three years, and more than 40% of these firms claim that they have introduced a new service into the market. On average, 9 % of their sales are from these new product introductions. For zero R&D firms, we can see that they are much smaller in size. On average, the employment is only 38 people, and they apply for 0.02 patent each year 10 . Similarly, only 3.4% of the firms introduced a new product in the past three-year period. New service introduction is slightly higher at 6.2%, probably due to the fact this group has a higher number of service firms. Sales from new product/service introduction is only $55,000 on average, accounting for 0.9% of total sales. I call these small but (maybe only sporadically) innovative firms \"micro-innovators\". The nature of \"micro-innovators\" differ greatly from the \"maga-innovators\", in terms of scale, complexity, technological advancement, and almost all other aspects of innovation. This is posing a great challenge for the informational value of a dummy question such as \"whether you have introduced any new product/service innovation in the past three years\", for the base of comparisons cannot be more different. Therefore, we prefer a more quantitative assessment, such as percentage of sales from new product/service introduction, and absolute level of sales from new product introduction (calculated by multiplying sales with the percentage of sales), for they carry more information regarding the intensity and prevalence of the innovation. To be clear, I am not dismissing the importance of innovation created by these microinnovators, to the opposite , I am trying to highlight their existence, their distinctive nature, and their importance in the aggregate level. Even though each of these individual investors may be small and only create innovations sporadically, in aggregate, they account for 1/6 of the new product/service sales. We currently know very little about this group of Notes: All observations are weighted by the sample weightStandard deviations across the years are reported in parenthesis. All variables with dollar valuations are in thousands, the rest are in its natural unit. firms. What innovations are they creating? How are they created? How are they financing the creation process? Is there any impediment that can be addressed by policies? What are the social impacts of these innovations? These are all important questions that needs to be addressed to provide some contextual understanding of this mysterious group of \"micro-innovators\"."}, {"section_title": "Breakdown by Broad Industry Categories", "text": "The economic literature of innovations have mostly focused on innovations of manufacturing firms. In the past few decades, with the development of personal computer and the Internet, service providers such as software development companies and Internet companies have grown to be important players in the innovation space. Moreover, a lot of the companies outsourced their manufacturing practices outside of United States, and labeled themselves as wholesalers or retailers that focus on product design and domestic sales channels. The economy as a whole has more and more migrated its talents and resources into the service industry. As a matter of fact, the whole concept of industry classification was based on the economic realities of the industrial age, which was dominated by the manufacturing firms at the time. However, the current economic conditions have changed so much, with the production and service sides of the business co-integrating and hard-to-separate, a mechanical dichotomy to assign a firm as either a manufacturing or a service firm (and the hierarchical industry classifications associated with it) is much less suitable 11 . That being said, we are still going to follow the NAICS Industry Classifications provided in the survey and assess the relative contribution of manufacturing firms and service firms in the economy. Please see Table 1.6 for results. Service industry accounts for 90% of firm counts. However, service establishments are on average smaller in size, so their contribution to total sales is lower at 73.4 %. Manufacturing industry comprises only 17.6 percent of the total sales, but its R&D spending is much higher at 43%. Service industries are responsible for more than 54 percent of R&D spending, approximately 56 percent of patent applications, grants, and sales from new product/service introductions. The above results are direct results from the BRDIS micro data and use the original NAICS code. One problem of such industry assignment is that certain global manufacturing firms may have their R&D and sales team only in the U.S. and outsource most of their production activities to outside the U.S., therefore they are labeled as \"wholesalers\"/\"retailers\"/\"professional service providers\", while a global account would suggest them as manufacturing firms. The Census took effort to trace down these differences and the publication suggests a lower contribution from the service industry to R&D at 30% and patent application at 37%. However, since service companies' innovation activities cannot be solely measured by R&D and patenting activities, we expect that in reality this percentage is much greater. Therefore, a manufacturer-dominated analysis framework for innovations in the economy does not square with the economic realities, and we need to investigate more into the specificities of the service industries. For the rest of this thesis, I will use the BRDIS data to provide some initial insights into service innovations. "}, {"section_title": "Service Innovations: Literature Review and Discussion", "text": "As we have demonstrated in the previous chapter, the service industry has grown to dominate both aggregate economic activities as well as innovative activities in United States. Given its growing importance, it is therefore quite surprising to find the paucity of academic \"Service innovation can be defined as a new or considerably changed service concept, client interaction channel, service delivery system or technological concept that individually, but most likely in combination, leads to one or more renewed service functions that are new to the firm and do change the service/good offered on the market and do require structurally new technological, human or organizational capabilities of the service organization.\" This differs significantly with the technology-centric or product-centric view of the manufacturing innovations."}, {"section_title": "Distinctive Nature of the Service Industry and Service Innovations", "text": "One distinctive feature of service from manufacturing activities is that the production and consumption of the service experience happen simultaneously. In traditional manufacturing industries, the production and consumption are both temporally and spatially separated, which gives the manufacturing much more independence and freedom in the process of product design and manufacturing. However, many service activities require active involvement of the client/customer/user in the production/consumption process. This interactive nature dictates that service innovation cannot be solely driven by the service providers, instead, cooperation and feedback from the client are going to be crucial. I have listed several key distinctions in the following: \u2022 Form of innovation is different. Manufacturing innovation is more tangible and technological in nature, and most of the time falls into product or process innovations. Service innovations, on the other hand, are more intangible improvement in the service experiences. \u2022 We can break down the service industry by whether they are serving business/institutions or individuals. If the service is consumer-facing (such as Google search/online ticketing), then to some extent it is more similar to consumer-facing manufacturers, in the sense that the service product is more or less homogenous for different end consumers 12 and consumers' involvements are somewhat passive, therefore the service provider can engage in centralized/organized innovation process and achieve scalability. On the other hand, if the service is serving business customers, since each customer is a substantial part of the revenue stream, the service provider has to engage the client a great deal and most of the time tailor the service specifically to the needs of individual clients. If this is the case, then centralized/organized innovation activities such as research labs may be less suitable, and the innovation may happen more spontaneously and scatter through the daily engagements with clients. In addition, these innovations may be serving only a specific set of clients and therefore less scalable 13 . \u2022 Another source of innovation in the service industry (in addition to client-inspired innovation) comes from technological improvement in the network computers and communications technologies (Hall and Jaffe, 2012 (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006). The fundamental difficulty to measure the input and output of innovations in the service sectors also poses a challenge for the policy makers who want to encourage the innovations in the ever-growing important sector of the economy. Traditional R&D tax credit and R&D grants were developed from a manufacturing perspective, and majority of the service firms find it very difficult to qualify for the tax subsidies. One may want to look at the European policy initiatives for a reference."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge Intensive Service Activities", "text": "The definition \"service industry\" is very broad and encompasses all types of functional forms ranging from trades that have existed for thousands of years without much transformation in its primary form (such as housekeeping and barber shops), to newly developed services empowered by latest technologies that require highly skilled human capital (such as research consulting and online portals for various activities). The growth potential and the spillover to the rest part of the economy also vary dramatically across service industries. Therefore, to add some structure to the analysis and to focus attention of policy support, many researchers and policy agencies have advocated for the definition of \"knowledge-intensive business services\". As early as in 1996, Ian Miles and Nikos Kastrinos have issued a comprehensive report highlighting the importance of \"knowledge intensive business services\" (Miles et al., 1995). The authors portray the \"knowledge intensive business services\" as \"relying heavily on professional knowledge; either are themselves primary sources of information and knowledge (reports, training consultancy etc.); or use their knowledge to produce intermediary services for their clients' production processes (e.g. communication and computer services); and are of competitive importance and supplied primarily to business.\" The report systematically investigated the function provided by these sectors and paid special attention to the innovative value. In the end, the authors gave several policy recommendations to speed up the development in the knowledge-intensive business services sector, including setting up industry standards and platforms, improving external communication and networking among different service providers, among others. The European Union have since adopted many suggestions in the report and have made great advancements in policy supports for the service industry. In 2012, the EU issued a brochure called \"The Smart Guide to Service Innovation\" (Clusters et al., 2012). In it, the EU gives local governments detailed guidelines including various support mechanisms covering the aspects of financing, design, innovation coaching, and clinics, and a lot more. I have not encountered any academic studies evaluating these support mechanisms and therefore the efficacy of these government initiatives remains unknown. However, it is to be recommended for the U.S. and other countries to follow EU's lead and pay more attention to the general research of the service sector."}, {"section_title": "Intellectual Property Protections in the Service Industry", "text": "Brownyn Hall in Hall (2011) did a great review of the recent literature on innovation and productivities. She commented that patent protections \"pertain primarily to technological innovation\" and therefore are more suitable to protecting and measuring innovation in manufacturing firms rather than in other areas such as services. Service industry in general does not utilize patent protections much, with the exception of the recent development in the software and business method categories. In 1980s, the patentability of software was still questionable, and few companies applied for software patents. In 1982, the Federal Circuit (a new court) was created by the U.S. Congress to hear patent cases, and the court had since made several important decisions that established the patentability of software inventions. According to Somaya and Graham (2006), by early 1990s, software patents have become the industry norm. Bessen and Hunt (2007) studied the trends in software patenting right after the changes to the law. They found that originally very few software patents (fewer than 5%) were held by software companies; computer hardware and electronics firms held most of those, which reflect the low intensity to patent in service industries. Bessen (2011)  afterwards. However, academic institutions' filing in this area has remained scarce, and a careful study of the financial patents at the time reveals that the firms did not provide sufficient reference to the original academic papers that developed those ideas. \u2022 Patents' prevalence and usefulness vary tremendously across industries 16 ; \u2022 Patents are considered by most firms as a rather inefficient mechanism to protect their inventions. Instead, informal protection mechanisms are preferred, especially lead time (Arundel, 2001;Hall et al., 2013). \u2022 Firms tend to treat different protection mechanisms as complementary to each other-together they cover different aspects of the innovation and provide a stronger web of defense. Despite the importance of trademarks and trade secrets in intellectual property protec- 15 For detailed notes of different features of these protection mechanisms, please see Appendix A.1 tions, due to data availability and measurement issues, the economic literature has primarily focussed on patents, especially utility patents (please refer to Hall and Harhoff (2012) for a comprehensive review). In the remainder of the section, I will highlight several studies on intellectual property protections in the service industry. In usp (2012), the USPTO leverages on its dataset of patent and trademark registrations and releases a report on different sector's intensity in intellectual property protections 17 . Another important contribution of Somaya and Graham (2006) is that they developed a dataset for copyright and trademarks from court litigations and provide useful additions to the Innovation Surveys such as BRDIS and the European Community Innovation Survey 19 . However, we should keep in mind that litigation is rare and only the highest value copyright/trademark appear in litigations. In sum, the following table 1.7 lists the mostly adopted methods to account for innovations in the literature as well as their advantages and shortcomings. 18 The paper gives an example of HiddenMind Technology, Inc., a mobile-workforce software company, which registered for a trademark to protect its ActiveUniverse\u00c2 R brand name (SN: 75907093 in 2000), filed a patent of the associated product idea (PN: 6442565 granted in 2002), and also enjoyed copyright protection for the software source-code. 19 Both serve as the main source of data for utilization of other intellectual right protections We don't know how representative this particular group of high-dispute intellectual properties is and therefore these may be more relevant for investigations related to the law system and its impact"}, {"section_title": "Self-reported measures of innovations from surveys", "text": "Have a better categorization of the nature of different innovations, product, service, processes, and etc. Large underlying heterogeneity in terms of the value and impacts of innovations of the same kind The measurement is subject to market conditions.

Therefore, examinations on the formation of research alliances (who to form research alliances with), the contract design (how to best incentivize innovations), control right assignment (who makes critical decisions during the process, and who obtains the final property right of the innovative outcomes) are all critical questions to answer, and a potential area for economic theories to shed light on the practices in the service industry. However, despite the theoretical and practical importance of the topic, economic investigations on the topic are quite limited 20 , perhaps due to the difficulty of obtaining the contract and the final outcome of research alliances and to quantify different aspects of the contractual agreement. Lerner and Merges (1998) demonstrated great advancement into both fronts-even though not situated in the service sector per se, it serves as a great example which penetrates through empirical complexities, abstracts quantifiable measures of the key features from wordy contractual arrangements, and uses theoretical inspirations to provide guidance towards hypothesis formation. More specifically, the work uses data from the research alliance contracts between early stage biotech firms and established pharmaceutical/biotech firms and empirically tested the predictions from Aghion and Tirole (1994). Statistical analysis concludes that the allocation of control rights to R&D firms increases with the firms' financial resources, as predicted by Aghion and Tirole (1994). However, the relationship between control rights and the stage of the project is more ambiguous 21 . Sampson (2007) analyzes 430 R&D alliances in the telecommunications equipment industry 22 and finds an inverted-U relationship between the innovation performance of 20 Management scholars have investigated the topic more 21 Aghion and Tirole (1994) suggests that researcher's effort matters more in the earlier stage of the project, and therefore control rights should be allocated to the researcher more frequently in early stage collaborations. However, empirical results do not bear the same observations R&D alliances and technological diversity between the alliance parties. That is to say, parties with moderate levels of technological diversity are the best for alliance performances, as differing expertise creates complementarity, and at the same time not so disparate expertise improves the absorptive capabilities. In addition, the paper also finds that joint ventures improve performances compared to a bilateral research agreement. However, the service industries' research alliance may or may not resemble the findings in the manufacturing industries. In fact, much is to be learned even about the basic facts about such activities. In the following sectors, I am going to rely on the BRDIS survey to provide some preliminary contexts about research alliance in the service sector."}, {"section_title": "Service Industry Innovations: What Can We Learn From BRDIS", "text": "In this sector, I am going to provide some preliminary information about service industry innovations from the BRDIS survey. Hopefully it will serve as a starting point and provide some insights for further investigations. Service sectors include the following main industries 23 : \u2022 Information Services \u2022 Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate Activities The relative share of these industries in 2011 in the whole service sector can be found in Table 1.8. The NSF public data uses a slightly different classification system from the ones to measure the outcome of innovative activities listed in this paper, so we do not have information separately for the wholesale and retail industry or education sector 24 . Information services have grown tremendously during the past two decades and account for more than 30% of total sales of all services, thanks to the technological advancement in network computers and Internet. Financial services are also huge in this country, accounting for almost 1/3 of total service sales, due to the central role Wall Street plays in the world financial market. Professional, technological, and technical services also have quite impressive presence at 15%. If we look at the R&D contributions of different sectors, the landscape is much different. As expected, information technology and professional, scientific, and technical services dominate the R&D performance in the service sector. However, observational evidences suggest that many financial innovations are occurring in the financial sector (especially before the financial crisis), and the fact that financial sectors contribute to only 4.30 percent of the total R&D performances may indicate that they do not consider certain product development activities as R&D. Note: The information from this table comes from Statistical Publications of the 2011 BRDIS Survey by NSF. The survey uses a slightly different classification system from the ones listed in this paper, so we do not provide information separately for the wholesale and retail industry or education sector. In addition, we have looked at the percentage of firms reporting various types of innovations in the past three years. The results are listed in Table 1.9. There is indeed quite some heterogeneity in the propensity to innovate across different service functions. Informational services seem to be the most innovative sector, with more than 16 and 21 percent of the firms claiming to have introduced either a product or a service innovation. Its introduction of internal logistics and supportive innovations (such as inventory, accounting) has topped 11 percent as well. Professional, scientific, and technical services also prove to be quite innovative in terms of introducing new services. On the other hand, the more traditional sectors of finance, healthcare, and other services (including wholesale and retail) are much less innovative on average. Note: The information from this table comes from Statistical Publications of the 2011 BRDIS Survey by NSF. The survey uses a slightly different classification system from the ones listed in this paper, so we do not list information separately for the wholesale and retail industry or education sector."}, {"section_title": "A Two-by-two Categorization of the Service Industry", "text": "In order to add some structure to the wide-ranging functions provided by the service industries, I have introduced a two-by-two classification system into the analysis. The first dimension is with respect to the clientele served by the service sector, namely, businessfacing or consumer-facing. The introduction of this dimension is due to the consideration of different scalability, interactiveness, and customization involved in the the service process. The second dimension is with respect to knowledge intensity of different industries, as the literature has emphasized the importance in knowledge-intensive industries' role in creating/facilitating innovations."}, {"section_title": "Defining Business-facing vs. Consumer-facing Services", "text": "In order to assign whether a certain industry is mostly serving business clients or end consumers, I have used the Input-Output Table published   Notes: All observations are weighted by the sample weight. In Table 1.10, I have showed the percentage of business-oriented services of various measures in different broadly-defined industries. Several observations stand out. Firstly, professional, scientific, and technical services are almost 100 percent business-oriented, as expected. Secondly, for information services, even though most of the sales and employment are from business-oriented sub-industries, most reported (organized) R&D activities are by consumer-oriented sub-industries. However, if we look at the amount of sales that comes from new to market products, business services are again dominating the field, which is indicative of the prevalence of unorganized innovations happening in business-oriented informational services. In financial services and wholesale/retail trade, the pattern is exactly opposite, where the majority of R&D and patent activities concentrated in business-oriented services."}, {"section_title": "Defining Knowledge-Intensive Services", "text": "The second dimension of the categorization is knowledge-intensive services. Instead of following the example of the EU tradition by assigning broad industries to knowledgeintensive services, I recognize the significant heterogeneities within the broad industry definitions, and again take a data-informative approach. I used the IPUMS CPS data 26 which provides educational and industry information for a representative sample of the U.S. labor force and calculated the average educational attainment in each five-or six-digit NAICS service industry 27 (King et al., 2010). The educational information is again independent of the BRDIS dataset and is later on merged with the BRDIS. I assign a 6-digit industry to be knowledge-intensive if its average educational attainment is above the 75th percentile of sample weighted educational attainment (including the manufacturing industry) 28 .

To better investigate how the categorization along the two dimensions affect firms' innovations, I have conducted a regression analysis of various measures of innovation input and output on business orientation, knowledge intensity, and the interaction between the two dummies. In addition, firm level controls including sales, employment, age, industry (3-digit NAICS), and year dummies are all included in the regression. 30 . The results in Table 1.13 in general agree with our observations in  "}, {"section_title": "Intellectual Property Protection", "text": "In the above section of literature review, we have found that the service industries' usage of patent is pretty low in European countries. In the BRDIS survey, there is a section devoting to the importance of different intellectual property protection mechanisms. The firms are asked to rate each mechanism as very important (coded as 1 in the analysis), somewhat important (coded as 0.5 in the analysis), and not important (coded as 0 in the analysis). The following table 1.14 shows the average rating of different mechanisms across industries. The findings are consistent with the previous literature (Cohen et al., 2000;Hall et al., 2014). Firstly, intellectual property protection in general is not considered very important for the service industry. Among all industries, informational services give the highest ratings for intellectual protection. But even for information services, only 6% of the firms consider utility patents as an important mechanism to protect intellectual property, and only 22% of the firm consider trade secrets important. Secondly, utility patents are considered the least important mechanism of intellectual property protection among all service industries. The percentage of firms considering patents as important mechanisms are 6% in informational services, 5% in professional, scientific, and technical services, and even lower for the rest of the industries. However, trademark, copyrights, and trade secrets receive higher ratings, especially for informational services. Notes: All observations are weighted by the sample weight. We would also want to understand how business-orientation and knowledge intensity affect firms' attention to intellectual property protection. Table ?? gives the result from a regression analysis. The interaction between business-orientation and knowledge intensity stands out to be significant for utility patents, trademark, and copyrights. In addition, bigger firms (measured by employment) are strong predictors for firms' attention to intellectual property protection, and firm age is negatively correlated with intellectual properties. "}, {"section_title": "Research Alliances and Technology Transfer", "text": "In this section, we are going to use the BRDIS data to understand the prevalence of research alliances and technology transfers in the service sector. In Table 1.16, I have tabulated the average percentage of firms that reported engagement in any research alliance or technological transfer activities. The first three columns are regarding research alliances. \"Customer\" means entering into a research alliance with one's customers; \"vendor\" means entering into a research alliance with ones' suppliers/vendors; and \"competitor\" means entering into a research alliance with ones competitors. The first thing to notice is that there are very few firms that indeed enter into such research alliances -informational services and professional, scientific, and technical services are the top two industries, but for informational services industries, only 0.028% of the firms in the industry enter into an alliance with its customers. In addition, service providers are more likely to enter into research alliances with one's customers or suppliers compared to one's competitors. This is probably due to the interactive nature of the service industry and the fact that services are very much customized. The next three columns look at firms' activities in technology transfers. \"Transfer Out IP\" means transferring intellectual property (IP) to others not owned by your company through participation in technical assistance or \"know how\" agreements. \"Receive IP\" means receiving IP from others not owned by your company through participation in technical assistance or \"know how\" agreements. \"Cross License\" means participating in cross-licensing agreements\u00e2\"agreements in which two or more parties grant a license to each other for the use of the subject matter claimed in one or more of the patents owned by each party. Compared to entering into research alliances, firms are more likely to directly engage in technology transfers. 1.1% of the informational services, and 1.7% of the professional, scientific, and technical services have transferred out IP to others (presumably to their clients). At the same time, a similar percentage of these services receives IP from others. It would be interesting to know who are the counterparts in the technology transfers as this information can help us map the transmission of knowledge across the economy. For example, if service providers receive know-how transfers from their vendors, especially vendors in the ICT industry, then it is likely that these technologies help with their internal innovations and also get transferred to their clients. Or alternatively, if service providers receive know-how transfers from their clients, then it may indicate that the service providers would need to first internalize the differences in technological expertise with their clients, and then can provide useful services from their shared knowledge base. In addition, we have also tested the correlation between business orientation and knowl- edge intensity with research alliance activities. In Table 1.17, we have found that the firm size again is the key determinant for engagement in research alliances. In addition, firms that are knowledge intensive are more likely to be engaged in research alliance with both their customers and there vendors, or engage in cross-licensing agreements. In sum, in this section, we have examined some basic facts about service sector innovations in the U.S. Information services and professional, scientific, and technical services are two sectors that contributed the most to reported R&D spending, patent filings, as well as introductions of new products and services. We have also introduced the categorization of business orientation and knowledge intensities. Business orientation is correlated with higher R&D spending and patent filings. Knowledge intensive industries are more likely to have entered into research alliances with their upstream suppliers and downstream customers or enter into cross-licensing agreement. Industries that are both business-oriented and knowledge intensive attached higher importance to intellectual property protection. However, the information that could be gain by this survey is very limited, as the service industry spans so many functions with intricately-connected webs of service providers and service clients. It would be interesting to understand the research alliances and technological transfers in a network structure, and understand how innovations from the service providers, or from the service providers' providers, affect the clientele served by the service providers. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This chapter uses the newly collected survey of Business Research Development and Innovations (BRDIS) and establishes several stylized facts regarding the distribution of R&D spending as well as innovation outcomes, highlighting the facts that businesses with very little reported R&D spending also produce a fair amount of innovations, measured both by patent filings as well as sales from new product introductions. In addition, the service industry has surpassed the manufacturing industry in contributions to total R&D spending and patenting activities. However, simply relying on patent applications may be under-estimating the amount of innovation generated in the service sector, since patent protections are not considered a particular important way to protect intellectual properties (due to the fact that the whole patent system was designed in a manufacturing-dominated mindset). These indeed pose a great challenge to the study of service innovations, as traditional measures for both the input and output of innovations haven proven invalid for the case of the service sector. Another important challenge is the amount of heterogeneity in service functions, level of interactions between service providers and clients, and the extent of customization of the service experience. This makes creating standardized measurements across industries very difficult, and implies that industry-specific analysis may be the most appropriate 31 . Another fruitful area of future research is to map out the input-output linkages of individuals firms in a network setting, and empirically trace the paths of innovation creation and its adoption. Service firms serve as hubs that connect many other business entities, and much knowledge and experience get accumulated within service firms. This gives service firms great power and opportunity for new knowledge discoveries, and they can in turn sell this knowledge back through the clientele networks. Being able to study the small ecosystem built around one/several service companies is going to give us a tremendous amount of insight into the micro-structures that facilitate knowledge transfers and spillovers. Lastly, I would like to suggest the BRDIS survey to add the following questions to better understand the innovative processes of service firms. For input into innovations: \u2022 Educational attainments for non-researchers; \u2022 Spending on human capital development; \u2022 Investment in high-tech supplies; For additional measures of innovative success: \u2022 Firm profitability; \u2022 Long-term sales revenue from innovative product introductions; \u2022 Merger and acquisition into big firms; The Relationship between 53 patent grants, past values of Tobin's q (a measure for investors' evaluation for a company's growth opportunity) 3 are still powerful predictors of both the intensity 4 and the scale 5 of innovations . This result provides powerful support for: 1) the informational value of the stock price, since it incorporates information beyond observable characteristics and codified investment into innovations (such as R&D stock and patenting activities) and correctly predicts the innovative successes in the future; 2) the validity and informational value of new innovation measures of BRDIS, since they also contain information that cannot be explained solely by R&D stocks and patenting activities. The form of this exercise is different from the ones conducted in the influential paper by Hall and coauthors (Hall et al., 2005) or in a recent study by Kogan and coauthors (Kogan et al., 2012), because the innovation measures in BRDIS are ex-post measures of materialized innovation successes. Hall et al. (2005) and Kogan et al. (2012) propose ex-ante measures of anticipated innovative successes and use the fact that these measures predict Tobin's q (which is exactly the opposite from our study) to test these measures' validities. However, instead of contradicting their research methodologies and results, our study serves as a nice complement to the literature of market value of innovations, providing validation from an ex-post perspective. Further analysis of the matched dataset also reveals that firms with higher level of innovation intensities also experienced positive growth in labor productivities and enjoyed higher profit margins, even after controlling for R&D spending and patent grant information. However, the BRDIS measures of innovations are not predictive of the current level of Tobin's q or the current level of capital expenditures. These results help to highlight the ex-post nature of the BRDIS innovation measures (which is one important distinction from traditional innovation measures): they can very precisely assess the materialized successes of innovative ventures, but do not contain enough information regarding the timing of the ideation stage (all we know is that these productions were introduced in the past three 3 Tobin's q is empirically measured as the ratio between the market value of a corporation to the book value of a corporation 4 percentage of sales from new-to-market products/services 5 sales from new-to-market products/services 54 years, but resources have already been invested in the past to introduce these products) or the anticipated success at the time of ideation/patent filing. In fact, the materialized return of innovation may differ considerably from the anticipated value of innovation in the early stage, since rational expectations rarely hold in such situations (there is a considerable amount of empirical evidence for the optimism of inventors, especially in start-up firms). However, ex-ante measures are needed to analyze how firms plan for resources in order to carry a product into the market in anticipation of a great (or a moderate) success. For these two reasons, I do not suggest using the BRDIS measures to study questions where ex-ante expectations of innovation returns are needed. The second exercise uses the matched sample between BRDIS and ASM to study how innovation affects the productivity of manufacturing firms. Our result is broadly in line with the studies reviewed in Hall (2011). Dummy variables of innovations are not positively correlated with productivity growth 6 . However, the intensity measures of innovation significantly predict growth in TFP (Total Factor Productivity), and the result is robust to different measures of TFP. These results support the above conclusion that intensity measures of innovation provide a lot of valuable information. However, the dummy variables can be sometime misleading, as any level of innovation would be coded with the same dummy variable of 1, without providing any signal of the innovation's significance.\nThere are several suggestions/advice to researchers who would like to use the BRDIS data This paper tries to empirically test the impact of credit constraints on corporate investment behaviors, the premise that underlies the Fed policy responses. Starting Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1987), there has been a large literature studying the relationship between credit constraints and corporate investment decisions. Following Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1987), a great many of studies have used firms' investment sensitivities to cash flows as proxies for external capital constraints. However, RAJAN (1998) challenges the validity of such proxies, and scholars were forced to find other more credible measurements for credit constraints. In a recent paper by Campello et al. (2010), the authors directly surveyed the Chief Financial Officers of multinational companies and used self-reported credit constraints to study the impact of the financial crisis, but such a measure may suffer from perspective biases. Instead, inspired by Chodorow-Reich (2014), this paper focuses on the syndicated loan market and uses lenders' pre-crisis deposit-to-liability ratios, involvement in trading and real estate activities, as well as exposure to Lehman Brothers in pre-crisis syndications to generate relatively exogenous variations in credit supply during the peak of the crisis. Since firms tend to borrow from their previous lenders, one can use the pre-crisis linkage between firms and lenders to generate firm-specific credit shocks. This measure has the benefit of being reasonably exogenous and therefore we can more confidently draw causal impacts from the analysis. The decision to focus on the syndicated loan markets has two reasons. Firstly, according The majority of the analysis uses the matched sample between the syndicated loan market and the publicly listed firms. These firms are much larger compared to an average firm in the syndicated loan sample. The findings are as follows. Firstly, basic regressions fail to uncover any statistically significant relationship between investment growth (total investment and capital expenditures, but not R&D spending) and credit constraints once instrumental methods are applied. However, if I include the interaction between credit constraint and firm liquidity reserves, I find that firms with higher cash reserves are less responsive to credit constraints compared to firms with low cash reserves. If I instead divide up the sample by its absolute cash reserves level, I find that firms with cash reserves below median are highly responsive to credit shocks. However, firms with cash reserve above median do not demonstrate any sensitivity. Lastly, I find that the impacts of credit constraints are long lasting, even though the magnitudes dissipate over time. This finding is in line with several previous studies, as they find that cash holdings are especially valuable when firms face external credit constraints, by enabling firms to invest in value-enhancing projects that would otherwise be bypassed (Denis and Sibilkov, 2009;Duchin et al., 2010). One thing to notice in the above result is that only total investments 2 and capital expenditures demonstrate sensitivities to credit constraints. R&D spending remains insensitive the whole time. There are several explanations for this result. Firstly, R&D spending has very high adjustment costs, therefore firms tend to minimize disruptions to R&D spending (Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994;Bloom, 2007). Moreover, firms do not depend heavily upon external credit financing to support their R&D activities, due to information asymmetries and agency problems Hall and Lerner (2010). Therefore, disruptions of external credit supply do not affect the firms in our sample much. Lastly, the firms in this current exercise are public companies and have better access to external finance in general. Smaller private firms might be more sensitive to credit constraints. Using the matched sample of BRDIS/SIRD Survey Data with information from the syndicated loan market (approximately 600 firms, of which 1/4 are private firms), I have found that private firms recovered more slowly if they were credit constrained (in year 2010), while the public firms did not demonstrate similar responsiveness. However, neither public firms' nor the private firms' R&D was sensitive to credit constraints during the peak of the recession in year 2009. This result is suggestive of the fact that R&D by smaller firms with no access to bond or equity markets may be indeed affected by the credit constraints in the financial crisis. 2 Defined as the sum of capital expenditures and R&D spending\nThis paper tries to empirically identify whether credit constraints during the [2008][2009] financial crisis affect firms' investment behaviors, and whether firms' internal capital positions and institutional shareholding interact with external financing conditions to shape firms' financial planning. The findings suggest that internal capital conditions are critical to predict firms' sensitivity to external credit shocks. More specifically, firms with high cash reserves did not demonstrate any sensitivities for credit constraints, but credit constraint does adversely impact firms' capital expenditure if there's little liquidity buffer. Moreover, there is no evidence that institutional ownership helps to mitigate the credit shock at the peak of the recession, but higher institutional ownership seems to have sped up the investment expansions during the recovery phase for credit-constrained firms. One thing to notice in the above result is that only total investments and capital expenditures demonstrate sensitivities to credit constraints. R&D spending remains insensitive the whole time. There are several explanations for this result. Firstly, R&D spending has very high adjustment costs, therefore firms tend to minimize disruptions to R&D spending. Secondly, firms do not depend heavily upon external credit financing to support their R&D activities, due to information asymmetries and agency problems. Therefore, disruptions of external credit supply do not affect the firms in our sample much. Lastly, the firms in this current exercise are public companies and have better access to external finance in general. Smaller private firms might be more sensitive to credit constraints. Moreover, we find that patent applications in 2009 responded to credit constraints, but this applies only to firms that do not report any R&D spending and also lacked cash reserves. Even though we know very little about how these firms invest in resources and generate patents in the first place, this finding suggests that either patent filing process takes some financing support or patent generation is associated with activities that rely on external finances. Moreover, analysis using the BRDIS sample suggests that public firms and private firms respond to the credit constraints differently, especially during the recovery phase. There might be several channels at work: internal capital accumulations, difficulty to get additional loans due to information asymmetry, or worsening investment opportunities. A more rigorous analysis would require getting more information regarding the firms' financial situations and demand conditions. indicate the source of the goods and to distinguish them from the goods of others.

Over time, with the official reporting of R&D in financial reports and the introduction of the NBER Patent project, R&D spending and patent applications (sometimes citation weighted) have emerged to be the most popular candidates to proxy for firms' innovativeness. In an influential paper Hall et al. (2005), Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg performed a hedonic regression of Tobin's q 7 , a widely-used index of stock market's valuation for intangible assets, on R&D intensity (R&D to asset ratio), patent to R&D ratio, and citation to patent ratio. They found that all three terms are economically and statistically significant, suggesting that these measures carry different aspects of information for firms innovativeness. Moreover, they have separated the predicted vs. unpredicted parts of patent citations and found that unpredicted citations are strongly correlated with Tobin's q. Therefore, they concluded that market valuation is indeed forward-looking. In a recent paper Kogan et al. (2012), the authors took the above argument further and used stock market's reaction around the days that a patent was granted to construct new measures for patent values. They aggregated patent announcement reactions within a year to construct firm and industry level market valuations for innovations. The authors found that this new measure is predictive of both labor and capital productivity growth at the firm level. In addition, firms respond to valuable patent grants by expanding their investment and raising more financing. However, competitors' innovations negatively affect firms' investment and financing. The authors also found similar patterns across industries, but the evidence is much weaker compared to within industry reallocation. This paper differs from the above-cited papers in the sense that the previous papers are constructing measures for innovations that are ex-ante or predictive of future success of innovations, but the BRDIS data have self-reported measures of citations that are ex-post and materialized. So instead of looking at whether/how market valuation (Tobin's q) is responsive to patent grant, we are going to test the forward-lookingness of stock market valuations from a different angle. That is, we are going to test whether past Tobin's q is predictive of future success of innovations at the firm level. We are also going to test firm-level responses to innovations, such as investment, productivity, and profit margin. Nonetheless, the ex-post nature of our measurements dictates that certain exercises make more sense than others. Please see the later section for a detailed discussion."}, {"section_title": "Innovation and Productivity", "text": "In Hall (2011), the author provided a literature review on the recent evidence of the relationship and productivity. The European Unions have conducted BRDIS-like surveys for many years (in fact the U.S. BRDIS survey is modeled after the OECD Community Innovation Survey). A lot of economists in Europe have used the Community Innovation Survey to study the productivity response to various types of innovation. Hall (2011) listed more than 20 studies that mostly assessed productivity in the manufacturing sector (since it is readily defined) in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, etc. Across almost all studies, firms' productivities are positively correlated to the intensity measures of innovation (percentage of sales from new products/services). However, the results of different innovation dummies are mixed. More than half of the studies show that product innovations have positive and significant impact on productivity growth, but very few studies show similar impacts for process innovations. Hall therefore concluded that the percentage measures of innovation provide more valuable information of firms' innovative activities compared to dummy variables. Indeed, the dummy variables can be quite misleading, since there are substantial underlying differences in innovations, and equating an innovation such as Tesla's Model-S electric vehicle or the Google Search Engine to an introduction of a new restaurant menu can be very problematic. However, the intensity measurements are for product/service innovations only, and we are lacking a more precise measurement (such as cost savings) to explore the variability of process innovations."}, {"section_title": "The Innovative Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General Timeline for Innovations", "text": "The following Figure 2.1 presents a simplified timeline for a typical technological innovation. The process starts from an ideation stage. After initial assessment, a company may decide to invest more resources to further test and develop the idea. During the process of research and development, some firms may file for patents or copyrights to protect the intellectual property. However, successful patenting activities do not necessarily lead to better innovative outcomes. In fact, before the technology gets incorporated into a new or improved product and goes to market, a lot of additional effort has to take place, including capital investment to upgrade production processes, design and marketing activities to promote user awareness and accessibility, etc. In the end, the firm introduces new or improved products/services to the market and we can measure the sales from these introductions. R&D expenditures and patenting activities are the most popular choices that the literatures use to proxy for firms' innovative activities. However, as noted above, R&D only partially accounts for the resources put into the innovation, and even though patenting activity is a fairly good proxy for the technological importance of the underlying innovation, it cannot entirely capture the financial return to innovations.

It is a dummy variable. \u2022 perc_new_market : Percentage of total sales from new or significantly improved goods and services introduced during the past three years that were new to one of the firm's markets (no other competitors in the market have introduced similar products before). \u2022 perc_new_firm: Percentage of total sales from new or significantly improved goods and services introduced during the past three years that were new to the firm (competitors may or may not have introduced similar products before). \u2022 perc_new_market and perc_new_firm capture the intensity of firms' innovativeness. \u2022 sales_new_market: Log level of sales from new or significantly improved goods and services introduced during the past three years that were new to one of the firm's markets (no other competitors in the market have introduced similar products before). \u2022 sales_new_firm: Log level of sales from new or significantly improved goods and services introduced during the past three years that were new to the firm (Competitors may or may not have introduced similar products before). \u2022 sales_new_market and sales_new_firm capture monetary returns of innovations. They are scale measures of firms' innovativeness. There are several measures from Compustat that we would like to investigate. \u2022 Tobin's q : It is defined as the ratio between the market value to the book value of a publicly-listed company. The ratio captures the stock market's valuation of a firm's growth potential, of which innovation is clearly an important integral part. \u2022 Profit margin: It is defined as the ratio of net income to total revenue. \u2022 Capital Expenditure: It is the physical investment that a corporation makes. \u2022 Labor Productivity: It is defined as the ratio between revenue and total employment. Compared to total factor productivity, this measurement is more suited for cross-sector (especially for non-manufacturing firms) comparisons. In addition, I am controlling for several key explanatory variables, but they are quite self-explanatory. However, there are two things that are worth explaining: firstly, for R&D expenditures, I am using a cumulative stock of past 10 years' R&D with a 15 % yearly depreciation rate. Due to fact that the BRDIS questionnaire asked for innovation generated in the past 3 years, when I include a lagged variable, a three-year lag is used. If a contemporary control is used, then I am using the average over the past three years (including the current year) 10 ."}, {"section_title": "Summary Statistics", "text": "Before going into the regression result, we would like to present some summary statistics.

Therefore, I have decided to exclude inovab as a measurement of innovation in all the regressions that follow.

Table ?? reports the result of the exercise. We see that even after controlling for R&D stock, recent R&D spending, as well as patent grant information, the predictive power of Tobin's q is still significant. Throughout all specifications, lagged value of Tobin's q stands out to be highly positive and significant at the 1% level. Patent grants stay positive and significant throughout as well, but recent level of R&D spending show up significantly only when dependent variables are scale measures of innovation. In addition, I have broken down the firms by manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, or by hightech and non-hightech industries, and conducted the same regressions on these subgroups (I am presenting the results only for perc_new_market and sales_new_market for simplicity).

More specifically, I have merged the BRDIS data with the Annual Survey of Manufacturers and test how innovation is associated with TFP growth in the manufacturing sector in the United States. "}, {"section_title": "Annual Survey of Manufacturing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "How to Measure TFP", "text": "Total factor productivity has been of central interest to economists for decades, for it is the key driver of long-term economic growth (Solow, 1957). If we look at a production function: Alternative, we can write the function in log terms: Here, Q measures the real output, C measures capital stock used for production, L measures the labor input, and M measures the material input. The residual A ( or a in log-terms) is called total factor productivity, which incorporates all information including the management efficiency, technological advancement, and all other factors that can explain the rate of turning inputs into outputs. There are several ways to measure TFP. If we assume that the factor markets are perfectly competitive 17 , then one can use the share of different factor's cost in total production cost to estimate the coefficient in front of each factor. This gives one set of estimate for the residuals. Haltiwanger and coauthors applied this method to the ASM and provided an establishment level estimate of TFP 18 (Foster et al., 2014). This method is very convenient and therefore is most favored by statistical agencies. However, the assumption of perfect factor market is unlikely to be true, and therefore the TFP measures can served only as a reference. Alternatively, we can perform a regression and empirically estimate the coefficient of the different factors. It avoids the problem of unrealistic assumption posed before, but at the same time suffered from another problem-simultaneity. This is because the factors are not randomly assigned but active choices by the firms, and therefore firms who experienced a positive demand/productivity shock may choose to a higher level of labor and materials and also sell more products. This will lead to upward bias to the estimate of the most variable factors (that adjusted quickly to external shocks, such as labor and materials). Various methods have been developed to solve this problem, and in this paper we are going to adopt a structural estimation by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). The authors extended the work by Olley and Pakes (1996) and used inputs like materials and electricity usage as proxies for productivity shocks and therefore corrected for the bias introduced by OLS regressions. Levinsohn and Petrin show in the paper that their estimate is significantly different from the OLS regression and the OLS regressions have higher coefficients for labor and lower coefficients for capital compared to the structurally estimated coefficients. In this paper, I am using the 2005 -2010 data from ASM and Economic Census to estimate the production function at the 6-digit NAICS level 19 . I am using the same input and output measures (the ones deflated by Haltiwnager and coauthors), for they have done 17 Which is probably a very bold assumption. a fairly careful adjustment to get the value of real input and output. Also, this provides an opportunity for comparisons. However, there is one issue that even the structural estimation adopted here cannot resolve, that is, the productivity measures include individual firms' pricing power, and do not simply measure real output productivity. It is because we do not have individual prices for different products, and therefore can use only industry-level price deflators. However, some firms enjoy quite a lot of pricing power and the revenue productivity that we calculate would include this \"price premium\". This is a universal problem causes by lack of information and not specific to our studies. On the other hand, it may not be such a bad thing, because pricing power caused by increasing demand is also a positive influence of innovations (in fact, patent protections granted monopoly right to firms in order to incentivize innovations). What we are going to test is therefore a combination of pure productivity gain and increasing pricing power due to product differentiation. Before going to the regression analysis, I would like to first provide some general information (Table 2.10) regarding the two different measures of TFP in the matched sample (at the establishment level). Firstly, the means of two TFP measures are very close, but TFP estimated from the structural estimation has a much higher variance. Secondly, since most of the matched observations are big firms 20 , the average innovation rates measured by the dummies are really high. More than 50% of the firms have introduced a product innovation over the past three years, and more than 40% of the firms have introduced a process innovation. On the other hand, the intensity measures have many more variations. In addition, I have also tested the relationship between two measures of TFP. More specifically, I regressed the Levinsohn-Petrin TFP measure on the Haltiwanger TFP measures (using the full matched samples between 2005 and 2010), controlling for industry-fixed effect and year-fixed effects 21 . The results are shown in the following table 2.11. We see that after controlling for industry-fixed effects, the two measures have a much higher correlation, and the R Square of the regression is more than 0.97, meaning that within-industry rank orders are quite similar for the two measures. Since all of our regression analyses are going to control for industry dummies, we can use both TFP measures to provide a robustness check against each other."}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "Our regression frame is very similar to the ones in 2.4.6 to test whether innovation measures are influencing the growth in labor productivities among publicly listed firms. However, there is one complication-TFP is measured at the establishment level and often a firm has several establishments in different subindustries. Since TFP is calculated one industry at a time, it is hard to aggregate TFP measures across different industries, as the average base levels of TFP for different industries are very different. Therefore, I decided to perform the regression at the establishment level, weight each establishment by its real shipment value, and cluster the coefficients at the firm level. This way, we will be able to control for cross-industry heterogeneities by including industry-fixed effects. The final specification is as follows: industry-fixed effect. In addition, year-fixed effects are also included. Table 2.12 uses the tfp measure by Haltiwanger and dummy variables of innovation between year 2008 and 2009. We found that after controlling for firm-level R&D and patenting information (both have positive and significant coefficients), none of the dummy variables are positively associated with improvement in productivities. In fact, the dummy variable for product innovations even shows up with a negative coefficient. If we change the dependent variable to the Levinsohn-Petrin tfp measure (Table 2.13), we have very similar findings. This conclusion is not surprising, given that European and Latin American studies found similar results. Again, rather than concluding innovation does not affect productivity, we should instead reflect on whether using dummy variables to study innovations' impact on productivities is reasonable. In the next set of exercises, we instead use the intensity/scale measures of innovations.   This means that successful innovations (product/service introductions) are indeed associated with productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. The growth may come from two sources: new product introductions increase the demand for a firm's product and give the firm more pricing power; alternatively, these new product/services may be also more efficient to produce, so real output productivities increase as well. Since the TFP measure here is indeed a total revenue factor productivity, both quantity and price growth (or a combination of the two) are reflected in the productivity growth that we currently measure. There is one thing to notice though. The innovation measures included in this exercise are only with regard to the product/service innovations, and do not include any measures of the process/logistics/support innovations, as no variable measures for these innovations are currently available. As these activities may produce powerful boost to productivity growth, collecting better measurements of these type of innovations are going to be crucial.

Similar to our previous findings, firms with low liquidity buffers produced fewer patents when hit with credit constraints, and the effect is mostly concentrated on firms who reported zero R&D spending but have filed for patent applications 3 . I do not have a clear explanation for why this is case, as we do not understand the innovative processes of these zero R&D spenders much. This interesting finding therefore serves as a nice invitation for future research on the companies with no organized R&D activities but still producing innovations.

Later in the summer, BNP Paribas blocked withdrawal from three investment funds due to inability to value the subprime assets. However, even thought the subprime debacle triggered the crisis, the causes of the crisis were deep-rooted and multifold. As the President of the Federal Reserve put it, \"The developments in the U.S. mortgage market were only one aspect of a much larger and more encompassing credit boom whose impact transcended the mortgage market to affect many other forms of credit. Aspects of this broader credit boom included widespread declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending oversight by investors and rating agencies, increased reliance on complex and opaque credit instruments that proved fragile under stress, and unusually low compensation for risk-taking.\" (Bernanke, 2009) The financial crisis has also led to a deep economic recession that was unseen since "}, {"section_title": "The Syndicated Loan Market", "text": "A syndicated loan is one that is extended by a group of lenders, including both traditional commercial banks, as well as other financial investors such as investment banks, institutional investors, and hedge funds. Usually one or two lenders (mostly commercial and investment banks) serve as \"lead bank\" (sometimes also called \"arranger\" or \"agent\") and perform various tasks including origination, structuring, and administrative tasks. The \"lead banks\" charge a service fee and usually take a larger percentage of the loan. Other investors (\"participants\") participate in the syndication and provide a smaller percentage of the overall lending. The syndicated loan market first came into place in the United States during the mid-1980s to help finance large leverage buyout deals, and has since then grown to a tremendous market for banks to diversify risks involved in corporate lending and to provide access to non-traditional commercial lenders. The loans can be fixed term loans, credit lines, or a hybrid structure of both. Interest rates can be either fixed or floating on a benchmark rate (such as LIBOR). In loans in the range of $ 10,000-99,000 have only 12.1% extended through syndication; however, for loans above $ 10,000,000, more than 79.2% are syndicated. Therefore, syndication is more prevalent among big banks and big firms. The syndicated loan market also went through a great disruption during the 2008 crisis.

Reductions in consumer demand, declining profits, and tight credit constraints all contribute to the significant drop in corporate investment. In this paper, I consider firms' research and development spending as investment in intellectual property and therefore part of the whole investment portfolio. Figure 3.5 graphs the total R&D spending by publicly listed firms in the United States. We see that R&D spending picked up speed in 2006, and was then hit by an abrupt drop in year 2009 of roughly 11%. R&D spending is much less volatile compared to capital expenditures, so a drop of this magnitude is very rare. However, the recovery is also much speedier compared to capital expenditures, and the turnaround took only a year. The national account also provides information on aggregate private non-residential investments into intellectual property products 6 . We do observe a slowdown in growth rate in 2009 and 2010, but the interruption is rather minimal. However, this is a retroactive revision of the previous national account so we need to take the result with caution. Alternatively, we can look at BRDIS' publications 7 . Domestic R&D funded by businesses dropped by 3.3% from 2008 to 2009, and an additional 1.5% in 2010The fact that R&D spending decreases more moderately in the aggregate data compared to public firms is somewhat puzzling, as one should expect that public firms would have less volatility in R&D spending compared to smaller and private firms. There are several possibilities on why this is the case: Firstly, Compustat uses fiscal years, while BRDIS uses calendar years, and the ends of reporting periods might be different. Secondly, firms may choose to report all of the R&D drop in one year instead of spreading the bad news over time. Lastly, since 2008 is the year of new BRDIS survey introductions, there was lower a response rate compared to other years, and the data may be a little bit problematic. ."}, {"section_title": "Patenting Behaviors", "text": "In addition to R&D spending, we would also like to have some additional measure of innovation output.

Since then, various studies have introduced different causes of capital market imperfections into the model to test for theoretical implications (such as information asymmetry (Myers and Majluf, 1984) and agency problems (Jensen and Meckling, 1976)). Market imperfections will lead to higher costs of external capital compared to internal capital, and therefore result in a suboptimal level of valueenhancing investments. Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1987) is an influential study, and in the paper the authors first proposed the usage of investment sensitivities to cash flow as an evidence of credit constraints. A huge literature has since followed, either replicating their results in other countries, or using firms' cash flow sensitivities as proxies for credit constraints to asses different policies' or institutions' impacts on alleviating/exacerbating the situations of market imperfection (for example, Hoshi et al. (1991)). However, Kaplan and Zingales (1997) challenges Fazzari et al. (1987) by showing evidence that cash flow sensitivities are not credible measures for the severity of credit constraints. Indeed, they have shown that less credit constrained firms (by their own classification) actually demonstrate higher cash flow sensitivities. Our paper avoids the complication of finding credible proxies for credit constraints by using exogenous shocks coming from the banking sector and instead focuses on internal finance's influence on alleviating credit constraints. The relationship between internal finance and corporate investment has long been studied by corporate finance scholars. In Himmelberg and Petersen (1994), the authors use a panel of 194 small firms in the high-tech industry and find an important role of internal finance in explaining both R&D and physical investment in these firms. Exploiting the panel data structure and controlling for firm fixed effects, the authors found that the elasticity of R&D to internal finance is less than half of the elasticity of physical investment, suggesting the high adjustment cost of R&D spending. Using a 3SLS identification strategy, Denis and Sibilkov (2009) suggests that greater cash holdings are associated with higher levels of investment for constrained firms (with high hedging needs) and that the association between investment and value is stronger for constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. That is to say, for constrained firms, higher cash holdings allow them to undertake value-enhancing investment projects that would otherwise be impossible. Another study by Brown and Petersen (2011) found that firms more likely to face financing frictions rely extensively on cash holdings to smooth out R&D. These studies have inspired this paper to look into the channel of internal finance and study how it interacts with credit constraints to affect corporate investment strategies."}, {"section_title": "Credit Constrains and the Impact During the Crisis", "text": "The massive write down of toxic assets such as Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS) and Asset-backed Securities (ABX) threatened the solvency of financial institutions and created mounting fears and risk aversions in almost all credit markets. Bank loans and short-term commercial paper financing came to a halt. Policy makers took unprecedented measures to combat the credit freeze, arguing that the shutdown of the credit markets would create dreadful consequences on the health of businesses. However, the fact that lending dropped significantly during the early days of the crisis cannot serve as a direct evidence of credit constraints for businesses, as firms may demand less credit after adjusting down their short-term outlook of the economy and reduce funding needs in the short-term. Yet, since this recession did not come from the corporate sector or the corporate loan market, it is hard to imagine that demand-side stories can explain the dramatic drop in credit originations, and liquidity shocks due to the instability of financial institutions had to play a role. The crisis indeed provides us with a great opportunity to identify exogenous shocks to firms' credit supply with little supply-side contamination, and makes possible empirically testing the effect of credit constraint on firm behaviors. In Campello et al. (2010), the authors surveyed 1050 Chief Financial Officers around the world (in U.S., Europe, and Asia) to directly assess the credit constraints faced by these firms and how credit constraints affected their financial planning for investment, technology spending, and employment. The authors used a matching method and empirically established that firms with reported financial constraint planned deeper cuts for capital expenditures, technology spending, and employment compared to firms that were less constrained. In addition, firms reported that they burned more cash and drew down more pre-arranged credit lines during the crisis when facing credit constraints. However, when both internal and external sources of funds were depleted, credit-constrained firms were forced to bypass attractive investment opportunities. This paper provides us with a lot of insights into the decision making of corporations and becomes highly influential. However, one caveat of the paper is that these credit constraints are self-reported and may reflect the perceptions of credit constraint 8 instead of actual financial conditions. Another problem is that these constraints may be endogenous in the sense that firms with worse performances may face worse constraint, and deeper cuts of investment and employment may be the results of these unobserved firm characteristics rather than financial constraints. Duchin et al. (2010) serves as another example that looks at the impact of financial crisis on firms' investment behavior. The authors adopted a difference-in-difference framework and categorized firms according to their cash reserve holdings or net short-term debt up to four years prior to the crisis (to avoid endogeneity concerns). Their results suggest that the decline in corporate investment is greatest for firms that have low cash reserves or high net short-term debt, especially during the first year of the recession in 2008. However, the paper focuses on the firms' internal financial conditions and does not test explicitly its interaction with external financial market. Chodorow-Reich (2014) conducted a more rigorous causal analysis on the impact of external credit constraints on firms' employment decisions. The author matched the syndicated loan data with firm level unemployment information from the Longitudinal Business Database and found that credit constraint had a significant impact on employment, but the impact was concentrated on small and medium firms or firms with high information asymmetry (firms with no access to bond or equity market). This paper provides strong evidence for the existence of relationship banking, namely, firms tend to borrow from banks with whom they have previously established relationships, especially during crisis times. If these banks were hit with a liquidity crisis from outside of the corporate loan market and forced to reduce their credit supply, firms that relied upon these banks would have a hard time getting credit. This is exactly what happened during the crisis: some of the lenders in the syndicated loan market suffered from big losses from trading activities or real estate investment. They were forced to write down big losses and suffered big hits in the capital base. For deposit taking institutions, deposit served as a buffer against the charge offs and helped to stabilize credit supplies. Both Ivashina and Sharfstein (2010) and Cornett et al. (2011) suggest that deposit financing is a strong factor that explains the cross-sectional variations in bank lending. In addition, banks that had syndicated portfolios with Lehman Brothers as the lead lender may experience an aggressive draw down of credit lines (short-term creditor's run on the bank, a modern type of \"bank run\") and therefore have an unexpected credit shock Ivashina and Sharfstein (2010). Chodorow-Reich 2014uses these relatively exogenous shocks in bank credit supply to create variation in firms' credit constraints and study their relationship with firms' employment decisions. In this paper, I would like to leverage the identification strategies from Chodorow-Reich (2014) to generate exogenous changes in the credit constraint of firms and look at firms' investment responses. This will give us a more credible causal interpretation instead of purely relying on matching estimators. What is more, I would like to test empirically the interaction between internal capital conditions and external credit constraint, namely, whether the presence of liquidity buffers helps to mitigate the impact of external credit shocks on investment."}, {"section_title": "Capital Expenditure and R&D Spending as Corporate Investment: Similarities and Differences", "text": "The previous studies on corporate investment all focus on capital expenditure exclusively. Starting 2013, the National Account started to record firms' R&D spending as another form of investment 9 , investment on intellectual properties, and included the item under the category of non-residential private investment. The following graph 3.8 shows the share of intellectual property investment over total private nonresidential investment. As the U.S. economy transforms itself to a more knowledge-based economy, the share of investment that is knowledge-focused has grown from 22% in 1990 to more than 30% in recent years. Research and development is no longer a rare luxury that belongs only to most prestigeous 1%. Instead, more and more companies have adopted the concept and incorporated it as an organic integral factor in their investment strategies, not so much different from investing into plants and equipments. Intellectual property investment is a recent addition to the national account, and it records firms' R&D spending as investment into intellectual properties, which falls under the category of the non-residential investment. This figure plots the share of intellectual property investment in total non-residential investment in the national account, which has been retroactively adjusted. Alternatively, if we restrict the sample to public companies who have positive R&D spending, the percentage is even higher (Figure 3.9). In 2014, 45% of all corporate investment goes into Research and Development for these knowledge-intensive firms, which means their investments into intellectual properties are roughly on par with investments into physical capitals. This again justifies our treatment of considering both capital expenditure and R&D spending as components of total corporate investment. Both capital expenditures and R&D spending are investments that companies undertake in order to generate future profits. However, there are several key differences between these two types of investment that may have important implications for their financial planning (especially under crisis time). Firstly, in terms of investment horizon, capital expenditure tends to be more short-term compared to R&D spending. Secondly, in terms of the investment risk, investment into physical properties is considered to have more predictable returns compared to intellectual properties. In addition, tangible assets such as property, plants, and equipment (PP&E) have a relatively efficient market for resale and therefore serve as better collateral. Even though there is some evidence that R&D intensive firms now put up patents as collateral to obtain financing (Mann, 2013), it is hard to assess the resale value of patents absent a well-functioning market for intellectual properties. In addition, a lot of intellectual properties remain in the form of trade secrets and undisclosed; the pledgeability of intellectual properties as collateral is still very limited. Lastly, the problem of information asymmetry of R&D investment between firm and financiers is much more severe for intellectual property investment compared to physical asset investment, which causes the credit providers to demand a premium. These factors all suggest that credit should be a more suitable way to finance capital expenditures rather than R&D. There exists a pecking order of financing options for R&D finance: internal capital (retained earnings), equity financing, and lastly credit financing (Hall and Lerner, 2010). Another difference between capital expenditure and R&D spending is with regard to their adjustment cost. (Bloom, 2007). The adjustment costs for capital expenditure are typically assumed to be direct changes to the stock. In contrast, since majority of the R&D spending is for the wages and salary of R&D scientists, and for a lot of the intellectual properties are trade secrets and firm-specific skills of these scientists, firing and retraining researchers are much costly. So the adjustment costs for R&D spending should take the form in the changes of R&D spending (changes in the flow measures of the intellectual property stock). We should expect that R&D spending should have lower variation compared to capital expenditures (which manifests itself in the comparison between Figures 3.3 and 3.5). I would like to empirically test whether these distinctive characteristics of capital expenditure and R&D spending have different implications for their sensitivity to shocks coming from the syndicated loan market, contingent on firms' liquidity status or other financing opportunities. All the above factors suggested that capital expenditures should be more responsive to credit constraint compared to R&D spending, especially for firms with low liquidity reserve or no other financing options such as the equity market."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Investors and Corporate Investment Behaviors", "text": "In Bushee (1998), the author categorized the institutional investors into dedicated institutional investors (such as pension fund and university endowment) and transient investors (investors that engage in high turnover and momentum trading), and found that the two groups exert different impacts on firms' investment decisions.

The first one follows Ivashina and Sharfstein (2010) to construct bank's exposure to Lehman Brothers -percentage of a bank's syndication portfolio that had Lehman Brothers as a lead lender before the crisis. This is a good instrument because firms who borrowed from a pre-crisis syndicate led by Lehman Brothers would rely on other lenders in the syndicate to supply the agreed-upon credit 12 . This serves as an exogenous liquidity shock to banks who syndicated with Lehman Brothers before the crisis, as some of their liquidity got tied up by old loans so they would have less capacity to originate new ones. The second set of instruments captures the health of bank balance sheets that are not directly related to loan syndications. The measures include the ratio of deposits to liabilities, trading account losses, and real estate charge-offs. If banks have higher deposit-to-liabilities ratios, they would have had more buffers to absorb external shocks and therefore been able to provide more liquidity during the crisis 13 . Trading account losses due to exposure to toxic assets and real estate charge-offs ate into banks' capital bases and caused a reduction in credit supply during the crisis. These balance sheet items have no obvious relationship with banks' loan syndication operations, and can be considered as rather exogenous shifters to banks' credit availabilities. 14 .

Secondly, in aggregate, capital expenditure is more volatile compared to R&D expenditures. Capital expenditure on average drops roughly 34.7% between 2008 and 2009, and it takes two years of recovery for it to return to the pre-crisis level 23 .

As we can see, all the OLS regressions indicate that credit availability is highly significant for both total investment as well as capital expenditures. However, after instrumentation, the coefficient of DL i,s is no longer significant for these two regressions 32 In addition to credit availability, we see that higher cash reserves before the crisis lead to higher total investment, higher Tobin's Q (which suggests better investment potential for a firm) also leads to higher growth, and investment growth is contrarian, namely, higher pre-crisis growth leads to more significant reductions in corporate investment during the crisis.

In Brown and Petersen (2011), the authors established that firms with larger cash holdings use their cash reserves to smooth out R&D spending over time. Therefore, in this specification, I added the interaction of cash holdings with firm credit availabilities (DL i,s \u21e4 log c h2007) to investigate whether firms with more cash buffers were less affected by the loan supply shock. The results are shown in 3.9,3.10, and 3.11. After adding the interaction, in the total investment regressions, after instrumentation, one finds that both DL i,s and DL i,s \u21e4 log c h2007 are significant with the expected signs for all specifications other than the one with exposure to Lehman Brothers as the sole instrument. However, if we break down the regression by 31 In the actual implementation of the fixed-effect analysis, I am using within estimators where I differenced out the mean of each regressor at the 3-digit SIC level, and perform regressions without the dummy variables. This is because in Cameron and Miller (2013), the authors suggest that when controlling for fixed effects in clustering analysis, if least-square dummy variables (LSDV) are used, then one will be overstating the degree of freedom for the analysis and lead to an inflated standard error. As of a robustness check, I have also done the regression with dummy variables and the results are still robust.   "}, {"section_title": "Breakdown by Level of Cash Reserves", "text": "To test the robustness of the result, instead of adding an interaction term in the original regression, I also break down the sample according to the absolute level of cash holdings and perform the basic specifications on both samples. The results can be found in ?? and ??. For firms with cash reserves below average, we see that the coefficients for DL i,s are positive and significant for both total investment and capital expenditures and for both OLS and the majority of the IV regressions. Numerically speaking, a coefficient of 1.357 means that one standard deviation drop in credit availability translates to roughly 11% drop in the growth rate of total investment growth in 2008 -2009, roughly 1/5 of the standard deviation in the growth rate. For firms with cash reserves above average, however, the coefficients for DL i,s are no longer positive and significant after instrumentation. This confirms our above observation that there is indeed heterogenous treatment effect -only firms with low internal capital demonstrate sensitivity towards external capital shocks. In contrast to the fact that capital expenditures are highly responsive to credit constraints for firms with low liquidity buffers, R&D spending remains irresponsive to credit constraints throughout all the above specifications. There are several possibilities for why this is the case. Firstly, R&D spending has very high adjustment costs, therefore firms tend to minimize disruptions to R&D spending (Hall and Lerner, 2010). Moreover, as suggested by Hall and Lerner (2010), due to the problems of information asymmetry and the uncertainties of R&D return schedule, firms do not rely upon external credits as the primary financing source for R&D activities. In addition, the firms in our sample are public companies and have better access to external finance in general. Smaller private firms might be more sensitive to credit constraints (we are going to test this hypothesis using the matched Dealscan -BRDIS sample).   The results from the regression for year 2009 can be seen in Table 3.15. Even when the coefficients mostly carry the expected signs, the IV regressions suggest the significant is not very robust (once we include the full set of IVs, the significance drops). Therefore, there is no convincing evidence that institutional investors have any significant impact in the short term. However, if we change the dependent variable to be growth between 2008 and 2010, then the interaction with institutional shareholding becomes significant, and the results are robust to most choices of instruments ( Table ??). The absolute values of coefficients are also bigger compared to the first regression. As the year of 2010 started the recovery from the recession, the result means that credit constraints during the crisis affect the speed of the recovery, and having institutional investors help to mitigate this influence and speed up the recoveries. The regression in year 2011 (( Table ??) suggest that the impact is still observable in 2011. The mechanism through which institutional investors exert impact on total investment levels of the firm is less clear. There are several possibilities. Institutional investors may outright provide loans / loan guarantees to counter the impact of credit supply shock. 33 Data on institutional shareholding of stocks come from Thomson-Reuters Institutional Holdings (13F), and since the investor type classification in the dataset has been proven wrong after 1999, I am using shareholdings from what Bushee (2001)'s classifies as \"dedicated investors\" for analysis. The other two classifications in Bushee (2001) are \"quasi Indexer\" and \"transient investors\".   what we found is purely due to selection in the sense that institutional investors chose to invest in firms that are resilient to adverse financial or economic conditions and recover fast from the recessions. Further investigations are needed to identify which story is more likely."}, {"section_title": "Patent Applications", "text": "In the previous sections, we have found evidence that credit constraints caused reductions in total corporate investments in the short term, especially among cash-constrained firms. However, R&D spending (input into innovation activities) did not seem to be correlated with credit shocks in the matched sample. In this section, we would like to analyze whether the reduction in credit also causes reductions in patenting behavior. Out of the 1681 observations in the matched Dealscan-Compustat sample, 823 firms turn out to have at least one patent application between 2006 and 2009. To my surprise, 303 out of the 823 firms do not report any R&D spending. The following Table 3.18 provides the distribution of patent applications and granted patent applications in years 2008 and 2009 for both positive R&D and zero R&D firms. For the number of patent applications, we found that firms with positive R&D apply for a lot more patents compared to the firms with zero reported R&D. In addition, for firms with positive R&D, patent applications in year 2009 has dropped by a lot on average, while there is no significant change in average patent applications for zero R&D firms. The patterns for granted applications are very similar. To test the hypothesis, we have collected data on patent applications and approved patent applications filed in year 2009 and matched these patents with the regression sample using string match. In the following regression, I have restricted the sample to firms that have ever filed for a patent between 2006 and 2009. The resulted sample has 823 observations 34 . Since many of the firms have zero application in a given year, instead of using growth Here, y refers to application or granted applications. The set of control variables X i include the lagged dependent variables log(y i,t 1 ), log(y i,t 2 ), previous year's R&D spending log(rd i,t 1 ), and other controls included in the previous regressions 36 . Table 3.19 shows that with no interactions, patent applications is not responsive to credit constraints. Lagged applications, previous R&D spending, and Tobin's Q all have a lot of explanatory power. However, once we add the interaction with cash reserves, we have 35 lg_apply t = log(apply t + 1) 36 Other controls include Tobin's Q, q2007; cash reserves at the end of 2007, lg_ch2007; whether the firm has a syndicated loan due during the crisis, crisis_due; the size of the firm, lg_sale2007; dummy variables for whether the last syndication is a credit line, creditline, or a term loan, termloan; dummy variable whether the last syndication has multiple lead lenders (which may indicate for better transparency of the firm), multi_lead; whether the firm has access to the bond market, bond_access; whether the firm is listed on three big exchanges, bigex; dummy variables for zero R&D spending, rd_zero. found that the interaction is again negative and significant. Alternatively, instead of using patent applications, I have also applied the same regressions to patent applications that are later on granted by USPTO (which has better quality guarantees). The above results still hold (see Table 3.21. This is somewhat surprising, since we did not find that R&D spending responded to credit constraints. In addition, I have separated the sample by firms with positive R&D spending and zero R&D spending. Table 3.23 shows the results from analysis. For firms with positive R&D spending, there is no obvious relationship between patent applications, credit constraints, or interaction between credit constraints and cash reserves. However, for firms with zero R&D spending, there is some evidence that firms are responding to cash constraints and cash reserves helped to alleviate the sensitivity. This contrast is more obvious for granted patent applications (see Table 3.23 ). The results presented in this section are very preliminary and should be taken with caution, for we are using a number of applications rather than any citation-weighted patent applications, so there is no adjustment for patent qualities. In addition, we do not know much about the firms who filed for patents but do not report any R&D spending. Are they not considering their innovative activities as R&D? Or do they acquire innovations from third parties and then file for patents? More analysis is needed to understand the internal resource allocation and operations of these inventor companies that do not report R&D spending.

However, these firms are naturally more immune to disruptions in credit supply since they have access to the equity market, and being a public firm also reduces information asymmetry and helps with fund raising through the bond market or individual bank loans. One would imagine that the problem of credit constraints becomes more severe and causes more distress in private firms. In order to test this hypothesis, I have also matched the Dealscan data with the BRDIS dataset, and was able to obtain approximately 600 matches 38 , with roughly 1/4 private firms 39 .
