[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For many individuals, how satisfied they are with current employment is an important factor when deciding to stay in a job. High job satisfaction is generally associated with higher job productivity and less job turnover. Having higher worker productivity and less job turnover are generally associated as being beneficial to businesses and the economy as a whole. We are also in a time where the demographic of the job market is changing. Baby Boomers are starting to retire and Millennials and later generations are starting to enter the job market/are going to be entering the job market. Going to college is becoming more and more common in the later generations than it was for Baby Boomers or earlier generations. With more people attending college, only having a Bachelor's degree doesn't guarantee a well-paying job after graduation. A higher college degree is becoming more common in order to be considered a good candidate when applying for jobs. The question is whether or not people should get a PhD in the same or in a different field as their undergraduate degree. Broader training from switching field for their PhD could open up more job opportunities after graduate school which would increase the probability of having a job an individual enjoys. At the same time, having narrow training by having a PhD and bachelor's degree in the same field could lead to a person having a job where they are doing a specific task and not a lot of unrelated work which could also lead to higher job satisfaction. It is unclear as to whether narrower or broader training would be more beneficial when applying to jobs and overall life time happiness in the work force. This paper examines the effect of changing fields of study between a bachelor's (BA) degree and a PhD degree on job satisfaction for those received their PhD in Science, Engineering, and Health (SEH) fields. More specifically, I consider the following question: \"How does changing field of study between an individual's bachelor's degree and PhD degree affect their job satisfaction?\". I allow the effect of switching fields of study to differ for switches between STEM fields, between non-STEM fields, and across STEM and non-STEM fields. I use data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The SDR is a fixed panel survey design that collects data on doctorate recipients in SEH fields . I use the public use files for this survey for the years 2017, 2015, 2013, 2010, 2008, 2006, and 2003 interested in the effect of changing fields of study between an individual's bachelor's degree(s) and their PhD degree, I compare people between people who did switch their field of study between their bachelor's degree and their PhD degree to those who did not switch their field of study. Job satisfaction and the determinants of job satisfaction has been extensively studied for PhD holders. Previous literature found that college quality is negatively related to job satisfaction (Liu et al., 2017). Further studies have found that higher levels of job mismatching correlate with lower levels of job satisfaction (Bender and Heywood, 2006a). For these studies, field of study is considered, but only the field of study for a person's PhD degree is considered. Additionally, previous literature has looked at the effect that changing majors at the undergraduate level. However, there is a gap in the literature that explores the academic determinants of job satisfaction for PhD holders prior to them receiving their PhD. This paper looks to fill that gap by examining the effect changing field of study between an undergraduate degree and a PhD has on job satisfaction in order to better understand the impact that academic history has on job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Existing Literature", "text": "Job satisfaction and choice of major have been examined before in many different ways. Prior research has used college major for purposes of job mismatching to explain job satisfaction. Research has also looked at characteristics of colleges to determine job satisfaction, but there lacks evidence that specifically looks at the effect of changing fields of study between an undergraduate degree and a PhD degree has on job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Job Mismatching", "text": "Researchers have examined the effect of job mismatching has on job satisfaction and other variables that are correlated with job satisfaction. Job mismatching occurs when there is a disconnect between an individual's job and their background. This means that the skills and information needed for an individual's job don't align with their educational background, skills/abilities, or needs. Bender and Heywood (2006a) examine the effect of mismatch on earnings, job satisfaction, and job turnover. They found that job mismatch is associated with lower wages, lower job satisfaction, and higher job turnover (Bender and Heywood, 2006a). Robst (2007) examined the effect job mismatch has on wage earnings for different college majors . He found that job mismatch is correlated to lower wage earnings, but that the extent of the lower wage earning depends on the choice of college major (Robst, 2007). Xu finds that having an occupation closely related to an individual's college major is closely related to a better income profile and greater job satisfaction (Xu, 2017). I am using the same survey Bender and Heywood use, but I use the survey from multiple years and they only use one year. They run an analysis where job satisfaction is a dependent variable; however, I am using a different independent variable that will be used to explain job satisfaction. Bender and Heywood only consider the field of study for an individual's PhD degree (Bender and Heywood, 2006a), while I consider the field of study for an individual's bachelor's degree and PhD degree. Xu also looks at the effect of job matching has on job satisfactions, but looks at how well a person's job matches their educational background and skills, and finds that the degree of job matching is positively correlated with job satisfaction (Xu, 2017). Both studies only look at job mismatch for one degree, but I consider the field of study for an individual's bachelor's degree and PhD degree and do not control for the sector an individual works in. My analysis will provide analysis on a different, potential determinant of job satisfaction which will contribute to the overall understanding of job satisfaction. Robst (2007) looks at job mismatch and how it affects wage earnings. Because wage earnings are generally thought of as being positively correlated with job satisfaction, he is indirectly examining the effect of job mismatch on job satisfaction. I directly look at job satisfaction and I consider a different independent variable while holding wage earnings constant. Robst considers job mismatch for those who have at least a bachelor's degree and does not differentiate between the degrees. I consider both a person's field of study for their bachelor's degree and their PhD degree. I also hold wage earnings constant in order to directly look at job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "College Quality", "text": "Liu, Thomas, and Zhang (2017) examine the effect of quality of college on job satisfaction for recent college graduates . Their results suggest that after controlling for earnings, college quality is negatively related to job satisfaction. This paper also looks at job satisfaction as it related to monetary rewards and still finds a negative relationship (Liu et al., 2017). My analysis will also consider different aspects of job satisfaction and control for income, but I focus on field of study instead of college quality. My research will explain job satisfaction using a different explanatory variable which provides a better insight into the determinants of job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Job Satisfaction for Academics", "text": "Previous research regarding job satisfaction for individuals working in academic fields. Hagedorn focuses on how different life stages impact job satisfaction and finds that those who are in the \"late career\" stage of life have higher job satisfaction on average (Hagedorn, 2000) . Extending off Hagedorn's findings, Bender and Heywood compare the job satisfaction for those working in academia to those not working in academia and find those with academic tenure report higher job satisfaction than those non-academics (Bender and Heywood, 2006b). Hagedorn focuses on job satisfaction for those holding positions in academia and focuses on how personal characteristics like marital status impact job satisfaction. My paper differs from Hagedorn's because I examine job satisfaction for those working in academia and those not working in academia. I also control for marital status and other variables Hagedorn uses as main independent variables. My analysis will provide a different angle on job satisfaction for both academics and non-academics. Bender and Heywood extend Hagedorn's work by examining those working in academia and those not working in academia for those with SEH PhD degrees. While I use the same survey for my analysis regarding job satisfaction like Bender and Heywood, I focus on the effect of changing field of study. They compare job satisfaction for two main different groups of PhD holders: those in academia and those not in academia (Bender and Heywood, 2006b). I control for job sector and include more categories than just academia and non-academia in order to account for the relationship they found, but focus on a different independent variable that could impact job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Changing Fields of Study for Master's Programs", "text": "In 2016, Altonji, Arcidiacono, and Maurel investigated the returns to higher education for those who received a Master's degree. Using data from the 2013 American Community Survey, they compare the earning differentials of different combinations of undergraduate fields of study and graduate degree fields of study. For their analysis they included main effects of undergraduate degree as well as interaction terms between undergraduate field of study and graduate field of study. They find that the income for those who earn a Master's degree outside of education increases more than 1 to 1 with the relative return to the undergraduate major (Altonji et al., 2016). This paper is very similar to what I am doing because it looks directly at the effect of changing fields of study between degrees. While I will use similar methods and interaction terms, my paper differs because I am looking at a different dependent variable. They look at the changes in income and I look at the effect changing fields of study has on job satisfaction. My paper also differs to this one because I consider those who received a PhD degree and not just a Master's degree. The relationship Altonji, Arcidiacono, and Maurel found may differ for those who received a PhD instead of just a master's degree."}, {"section_title": "A Case in Spain", "text": "A study conducted by Escardibul and Afcha is very similar to the analysis that I am doing, but their focus was on PhD holders in Spain. Escardibul and Afcha examined the effect changing field of study has on different aspects relating to job satisfaction. Their analysis looks at how six categories of individual characteristics affects two different categories of job satisfaction and they didn't find any significant results (Escardibul and Afcha, 2017). My research is more detailed and focuses on how changing fields of study impacts ten different aspects of job satisfaction separately instead of in categories. My research also focuses on this relationship for those who received their PhD in the United States where Escardibul and Afcha's paper looks at the determinants of job satisfaction for those who received their PhD in Spain."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SDR", "text": "The data used in the project is the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) conducted by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSEC) within the National Science Foundation. The SDR provides data on individuals who hold doctorate degrees in science, engineering, and health fields (SEH) from a United States (U.S) academic institution. In addition to holding a doctorate degree in a SEH field from a U.S academic institution, an individual must be less than 75 years of age and they must not be institutionalized or terminally ill at the time of survey in order to be considered. This survey is biennial and is a fixed panel design in which each year the survey was conducted, individuals who were included in the previous survey and met the survey eligibility requirements were included in the survey and a new sample of people were added each year the survey was conducted. Due to the nature of the survey design, I will be using the survey from the following years: 2017, 2015, 2013, 2010, 2008, 2006, and 2003 where the unit of observation is an individual year. The target population for survey changed slightly for between years of the survey. Prior to 2010, the survey didn't include those residing outside the U.S. Starting in 2010, the SDR included SEH doctorates residing outside the United States. I am not concerned with these changes in target population in this analysis because the key variables I am interested in for this study (overall job satisfaction and field of study for an individual's degrees) are variables that are present in all of the survey years. These variables also don't change between years, meaning that issues regarding consistency with the values of the variables. The purpose of the SDR is to provides data on the educational and occupational achievements and history as well as information on the career development for PhD holders in a SEH field (NSF, 2019). This includes data regarding field of study for each degree an individual has. The SDR provides data on job characteristics including income and job satisfaction. I use this data because it provides the information I need to construct my independent variable and my dependent variable. It also contains data on the variables I will control for including job sector, marital status, and income/salary. By using this data source, I will not need to append data from different sources and I will be able to construct the variables I need from the data provided in this survey. Because this survey is given to everyone who is eligible regardless of employment status, I will need to limit the sample in order to properly run my analysis."}, {"section_title": "Analysis Sample Construction", "text": "I restrict the sample to individuals who have valid responses for field of study for their Bachelor's degree and to those who have valid response for their major group field of study for their PhD degree.

For analysis regarding overall satisfaction, the sample will also be restricted to individuals who have valid responses for overall job satisfaction (i.e. those who didn't skip the question). For the other nine measures of job satisfaction, I restrict my sample to the survey years where information on the nine measures was gathered and only consider people who a response for overall job satisfaction and a response for the type of job satisfaction I am running the given regression on."}, {"section_title": "Fields of Study", "text": "For the main independent variable, the key variables from the survey that will be used are the major groups of field of study for a person's bachelor's and PhD.

As a result, STEM will be holding a degree in one of the following groups: computer and mathematical sciences, life/earth sciences, physical sciences, or science and engineering related fields."}, {"section_title": "Defining Variables", "text": "There will be five different independent variables that will be used for two different regressions in this paper: (1) to denote whether or not an individual switched field of study between their BA degree and their PhD degree, (2) to denote whether or not an individual switched from a non-STEM bachelor's degree field to a STEM PhD degree field, (3) to be used to denote whether or not an individual switched from a STEM field to a non-STEM field, (4) to denote whether a person switched from a STEM field to a different STEM field, and (5) to denote if an individual switched from a non-STEM field to a different non-STEM field. Each of these variables will be a binary variable that takes the value 1 if the statement is true for a given individual and 0 if the statement is false for an individual. For the two sets of regressions, the y variables will be satisfaction for the following ten types of satisfaction: \u2022 Overall job satisfaction In the survey, each of the ten variables is an ordinal variable that take on the following values: (1) for very satisfied, (2) for somewhat satisfied, (3) for somewhat dissatisfied, and (4) for very dissatisfied. For each of the ten types of job satisfaction, I define an individual being dissatisfied as having survey response of a three or four and being satisfied as having a survey response of a one or two. Each y variable will be binary variable where 0 represents an individual being dissatisfied and 1 represents an individual being satisfied."}, {"section_title": "Controls", "text": "In addition to the independent variables, there exist other factors that could be correlated with job satisfaction. For this reason, I include a set of controls broken into the following categories: demographic controls, job sector controls, and field of study controls for both bachelor's degrees and PhD degrees. For my analysis I am also controlling for gender. Males and females have different experiences in the work place. At the same time males and females tend to gravitate to different fields of study, as a result the effect switching field of study has on job satisfaction may differ between males and females. For this reason, I control for gender in my analysis to better isolate the effect of switching field of study. There are three different job sectors I am controlling for: business/industry, education institutions, and government. I control for job sector because different job sectors could have an overall lower or higher amount of reported job satisfaction than others due factors like working environment, and not controlling for this could bias my results. In addition to job sector controls, I also control for income and for how related an individual's job is to their PhD. field degree. I control for income because income is often cited as having an impact on job satisfaction. Without holding income constant it would be unclear as to whether or not the relationship is from changing fields of study or from level of income. I control for bachelor's degree field of study and PhD field of study. I control for bachelor's degree field of study because the change in job satisfaction caused from switching field of study could be related to the field of study they started in. At the same time there could be PhD fields that tend to report higher job satisfaction than others. I control for these in order to better isolate the effect switching majors has on job satisfaction.   Figure 1 shows the percentage of people that switched into that PhD field, illustrating that computer science and math, social sciences, and S&E related fields are the three most common fields people switched to. For those with a PhD in an S&E related field and switched field of study, 22.21% of them have a BA in some kind of life science field. Table 3 shows the average overall job satisfaction for each combination of BA field of study and PhD field of study as well as the average job satisfaction for PhD field of study. In this table lower numbers indicate higher levels of job satisfaction and higher numbers indicate lower levels of job satisfaction. The diagonal of this table up to the S&E related fields represents the individual who didn't change their field of study. This table shows that for some PhD fields like computer science and math as well as life sciences, the highest average job satisfaction is for individuals who have their BA degree in the same field. Based on Table 3 having a BA degree in a different field tends to be associated with lower average job satisfaction, but that it doesn't hold true for all PhD fields. For the social sciences PhD field, those who have a BA degree in a computer science and math field have the same average job satisfaction as those who have their BA degree and PhD in a social science field, and that those who hold a BA degree in a S&E Related field or an Other field actually have a higher average job satisfaction.  "}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "For the following regressions, I use the following vectors to represent the control variables I am using: J S := a vector for controlling for job sector for an individual Z := a vector of individual demographic controls BA := a vector controlling for an individual's field of study for their Bachelor's degree. P hD := a vector controlling for an individual's field of study for their PhD degree. For P hD and BA, the Life Science field of study category will be omitted from the vectors in order to avoid perfect multicollinearity. I also define switching to a field in B is having a bachelor's degree in field A and then receiving a PhD degree in field B where field A and field B aren't the same. The first set of regressions will consider whether or not an individual changed field of study between their Bachelor's degree and PhD degree regardless of what field they changed it to (denoted as x 1it ). The equation for this set of regressions is given by: For the above equation 1, y it is the job satisfaction for an individual in survey year t for each of the ten measures of job satisfaction. Each y it is binary as defined above. As a result each \u03b2 coefficient, \u03b1, \u03c4 , and \u03bb coefficient in equation (1) will be interpreted as a probability. In this equation x 1it represents whether or not a given individual changes their field of study between their bachelor's and PhD for each year the survey taken. For each type of job satisfaction, \u03b2 1 is interpreted as the following: switching field of study increases/decreases the probability of having job satisfaction by \u03b2 1 . I control for the survey year for the fields of study in order to account for the possibility a person went back and received another PhD in a field that is different than their first one. For each of the fields of study, the \u03b2's are interpreted as: having a PhD degree in increases/decreases the probability of having job satisfaction by the corresponding \u03b2 compared to those who have a PhD degree in a non-S&E field. The second regression will consider the field people changed into. More specifically I look the effect that changing field of study has on job satisfaction for those who went from a STEM to a non-STEM field (x 2it ), whose who went from a non-STEM to a STEM field (x 3it ) , and those who went from a non-STEM field to a different non-STEM field (x 4it ). To avoid multicollinearity, individuals that switched from a STEM field to a different STEM field will be omitted. (2) will only be used for overall job satisfaction. As in equation 1, y it is the job satisfaction for an individual in survey year t for each type of job satisfaction. Each y it is defined in the same way and each \u03b2, \u03b1, \u03bb, and \u03c4 coefficient will be interpreted as a probability as before. For equation 2, the coefficients on x 2it , x 3it , and x 4it will be interpreted as changes in the probability of having job satisfaction. In equation 1and 2, \u03b5 it and \u03b3 t where \u03b5 it is the standard error for an individual i at time t. Because I am using data from multiple years of the survey, I include a time fixed effect \u03b3 t . I include \u03b3 t to account for things that could affect job satisfaction for everyone in the survey for that given year. These things could include the unemployment rate for a given year or other unobservable factor that could impact job satisfaction. Extending off the regressions described above, I also run regression equation 1where the standard errors are clustered by individual reference ID numbers due to the fixed panel design of the survey. I cluster for reference ID of individuals to control for individual fixed effects like rating tendencies. I also conduct an ordered logit regression model for the four the response options for job satisfaction in originally in the SDR. In addition I also conduct regressions adding in interaction terms with switching field of study."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "First, I examine the effect of switching field to any field has on overall job satisfaction with different sets of controls. I find that the effect of switching field of study has on job satisfaction is negative and statistically significant for all the sets of controls. Column (1) of Table 4 is the result of the regression without controlling for job relatedness to PhD or salary, Column (2) only adds in controls for job relatedness to PhD, and Column (3) only adds in controls for salary. As displayed in Table 4, adding in salary increases the effect switching field of study to any field has on overall job satisfaction. Column (4) of this table adds in controls for both salary and job relatedness to PhD. For the remainder of my analysis I use the same controls as I do in Column (4) because the change in the observed effect of job satisfaction only changes by 0.003 and the results remain significant at the same level. Using the controls in Column (4), switching field of study to any field, on average decreases the probability of having overall job satisfaction by 0.62 percentage points while holding everything else constant. This result indicates that narrower training is more beneficial to people when thinking about job satisfaction post job satisfaction. This result doesn't consider the field people switched into which could have a different effect. After examining the effect of switching field of study has on job satisfaction regardless of field of study, I then break down switching field of study into five different groups with one excluded, and then run the same analysis on overall job satisfaction. The results of this analysis are described in Table 5. Column 1of We see that on average, switching field of study to a STEM field decreases the probability of having overall job satisfaction by 1.30 percentage points and decreases by 1.37 percentage points for those who switched to a different non-STEM field compared to those who switched to a different STEM field. This suggests that compared to having training in only STEM fields, it is more beneficial for people with a non-STEM bachelor's degree to have both STEM and non-STEM training opposed to having only non-STEM training. The results for switching to a non-STEM field is not statistically significant meaning that it is possible that switching fields to a non-STEM field could have no impact on the probability of having job satisfaction compared to those who switched to a different STEM field. Tables 4 and 5 only consider the effect of switching field of study on overall job satisfaction. The SDR also measures the level of satisfaction for nine other common aspects of jobs. Because the effect of switching field could be different for different job characteristics, I examine the effect of switching fields of study has on the other nine measures of job satisfaction. For this I only consider whether a person switched fields regardless of what they switched to and the results are provided in Table 6. Column (1) of Table 6 is the same regression conducted in Column of Table 4 and is included for purposes of comparison. I find that switching fields of study between an individual's BA and PhD degree has a negative effect on the probability of an individual being satisfied for all the measures of job satisfaction. These effects are statistically significant for all measures except for satisfaction with job's level of independence and satisfaction with job's contribution to society. These results suggest that switching field decreases the probability of being satisfied with aspects of jobs most individuals consider when accepting a job offer. Switching field of study having a negative impact on the satisfaction of the other nine job aspects further, we would expect effect on overall job satisfaction would also be negative, which is what we see. These results further validate the result that switching field of study has a negative effect on overall job satisfaction. I further examine the effect of switching field study to any field for each of the different bachelor's degree field of studies because this effect could be different depending on the field their bachelor's degree is in. The results of these regressions are described in Table 7. The effect of switching field of study on overall job satisfaction is only statistically significant for the following bachelor's degree fields: computer science and math, life sciences, social sciences, science and engineering related, and for a couple of PhD fields for the category of other. For the last column for Table 7, the variable switched is omitted because everyone that has a bachelor's degree in the other field category had to switch fields of study. For each of the BA field regressions, the same PhD field is omitted because it is perfectly collinear with the variable switching to any field. For those who have a bachelor's degree in computer science, switching fields of study increases the probability of having job satisfaction by 2.0 percentage points on average and by 10.57 percentage points on average for those who have a bachelor's degree in a science/engineering related field. For those with a bachelor's degree in a physical science field and social science field, the probability of having job satisfaction decreases on average by 5.72 percentage points and 2.26 percentage points on average respectively. these results suggest that having broader training is less beneficial if a person holds bachelor's degree in a life or social science field and is more beneficial if a person hold a bachelor's degree in a comp sci. and math field or in a physical science field. Extending off the OLS regressions, I conduct an ordered logit regression model as well as two other OLS regressions controlling for individual fixed effects and including interaction terms presented in Table   8. In Table 8, Column (1) provides the result for the ordered logit model, Column (2) provides the results with individual fixed effects, and Column (3) provides the results with the interaction terms between job relatedness to PhD and switched to any field. The levels of job satisfaction with their corresponding numeric values are: (1) Very satisfied, (2) somewhat satisfied, (3) somewhat dissatisfied, and (4) very dissatisfied. These results are consistent in my previous analysis. Those who switched their field of study are 1.08 times more likely to report being very dissatisfied than any of the other categories of satisfaction, compared to those who did not switch fields, holding all else constant. For the regression with individual fixed effects, only the survey years before 2017 were used because the 2017 survey doesn't provide the unique individual ID 's. After including individual fixed effects, the effect switching fields to any field has on the probability of having job satisfaction is no longer significant. This indicates that there may be specific individual factors that affect job satisfaction and are correlated with switching field of study that create an omitted variable bias without fixed effects. In order to investigate how switching fields of study impacts job satisfaction, I include interaction terms between the switched to any field variable with the salary variables and the job relatedness to PhD variables. Including salary interaction terms, didn't change the significance of my results and I didn't find that the effect of switching field of study was different for different salary levels. However, I did find that the effect of switching field of study had different effects on job satisfaction depending on job relatedness to PhD. Based on these results for those with a bachelor's degree in a life or social science degree, having a broader set of training is worse for them in terms of having job satisfaction, and suggests that it would be better for them to receive a PhD in the same field. I found that for individuals that have a job closely related to their PhD, switching field of study increased the average probability of having job satisfaction by 1.42 percentage points more and by 1.22 percentage points for those who have a job that is somewhat related to their PhD compared to those who have a job that isn't related to their PhD."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Checks", "text": "For all of my analyses, I do not control for marital status of individuals due to the number of observations being reduced by almost half. After conducting the same set of analyses including marital status, the observed effect of switching fields of study differed by 0.001 and the results remained significant at the same level as running the analyses without controlling for marital status and conclude that my results are robust. Starting in 2010 the SDR expanded the sample to include SEH doctorates residing outside of the United States. After running analysis with and without controlling for whether or not an individual was residing in the United States, the results were still significant at the same level and only differed by 0.00001 and conclude that my results are roust without controlling for this.       0.0405 0.0023 0.0291 (pseudo-R 2 ) robust standard errors are listed in parentheses *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 My results show a negative relationship between switching field of study and job satisfaction, indicating that PhD holders who have their bachelor's degree in the same field as their PhD are better off than PhD holders who have their bachelor's degree is a field that is different than their PhD field. This relationship is statistically significant for seven of the ten different measures of job satisfaction used in this analysis. There isn't statistically significant evidence that switching field of study impacts job satisfaction when adding in individual fixed effects. My results don't align with results Altonji, Arciadiacono, and Maurel found in 2016. While they find positive return for those who hold a Master's degree and a bachelor's degree in a different field (Altonji et al., 2016), I find the opposite. This could be because individuals who hold PhD's and those who hold Master's degrees are different and have different reasons for switching fields. Another possible reason for this difference is that I only have data for those who have a PhD in a SEH field. If I had data on individuals who hold in a non-SEH field, I may have found a different result. A limitation for my analysis is that my Data is only from people who have a PhD degree in a field that the NCSEC considers to be a SEH field and only for those who received a degree in the United States. For this reason, the results can't be generalized to the entire population of those who hold a PhD degree. The effect of switching field of study could be different for those who don't have a PhD degree in an SEH field. My results might also underestimate the effect that switching field of study has on job satisfaction. I don't have data on the field of study for one bachelor's degree. It is very likely that people could have received more than one bachelor's degrees that are in different fields, and only pursues one PhD. It is possible that when answering the survey they reported their BA field for the field they didn't receive their PhD in. This means that in my analysis I consider them as switching fields, but in reality, they didn't switch fields. Another limitation to my analysis is that the information provided in the public use files for the SDR is not the same for the survey years used in this data. For this reason I was unable to control for some of the variable I would have wanted to like how long an individual has had the job they did at the time of the survey. It could be true that those who stay in a job longer are less likely to be satisfied than those who have had their jobs for a shorter time. Not including this control could have made my results more negative than if I had controlled for this. I also don't control for how much long people waited to pursue a PhD after receiving their bachelor's degree.
