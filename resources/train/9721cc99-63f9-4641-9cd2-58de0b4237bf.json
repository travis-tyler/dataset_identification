[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between fasting proinsulin (PI) and age in general population and to determine whether there are differences regarding this association in obese and non-obese persons. Methods. A random population-based sample (n=656) of Romanians (26-80 years) living in Bucharest, Romania was studied; 432 persons had diabetes and they were not analyzed in this paper. Circulating levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), fasting plasma proinsulin (FPP), fasting plasma C-peptide, HbA1c, lipid profile, creatinine, urea were measured. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA-B, and Quicki index were also calculated. Results. For all participants proinsulin was the highest in the third quartile of the age group (59-67 years), with a median proinsulin of 5.8 pmol/L. Subsequently, proinsulin increased with age, from 2.6 pmol/L for participants aged 20-51 years, to 4.7 pmol/L for participants aged 51-59 years; proinsulin levels decreased in the upper quartile 4.8 pmol/L for those aged over 67 years. In sex-specific analyses, proinsulin increased with age for both men and women, except for those in the upper quartile. The prevalence of the obesity was 30.4% (n=68); obesity prevalence did not increase with age (p=0.26). Fasting proinsulin levels significantly increased with body mass index (BMI) category from lean (n=67, 2.9 pmol/L) to overweight (n=89, 4.5 pmol/L) and obese (n=69, 6.63 pmol/L) (p<0.0001).\nOur study has demonstrated a close association between age and elevated proinsulin and proinsulin/insulin ratio in general population."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Aging is associated with important changes in metabolism and body composition [ 1 ]. Between 20 and 70 years of age, there is a progressive decrease of fatfree mass (mainly muscle) of about 40% and an increase of the fat mass. There is a relatively greater decrease in peripheral fat-free mass compared to central fat-free mass. After the age of 70 years, fat-free mass and fat mass decrease in parallel. Fat distribution changes with age so there is an increase in visceral fat, which is more pronounced in women than in men. Also, there is an increasing intramuscular (in the skeletal muscle) and intrahepatic fat deposition. Increased intramuscular and intrahepatic fat contributes to impaired insulin action through locally released adipokines and fat-free fatty acids. Increased pancreatic fat with declining \u03b2-cell function also plays a role. [ 2 ] Proinsulin is a prohormone with low metabolic activity compared with mature insulin. In humans, insulin and proinsulin concentrations are significantly correlated with birth weight [ 3 ] and with various body measures including weight, head circumference [ 4 ] .\nThe prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus increases with age [5] . Insulin release is reported to diminish with increasing age [6] .\nThis decrease in insulin release could involve a reduction in islet mass, but could also be caused by a functional impairment of the beta cells with ageing. A decline in post-challenge insulin levels with advancing age has been observed in population studies [7] . Although this finding could reflect \u03b2-cell failure in ageing, it might also be due to alterations in diet or gastric emptying, or even to an enhancement in insulin sensitivity in older age. Although proinsulin levels increase together with insulin concentrations in insulin resistance [8] , a raised ratio of proinsulin to insulin, due to a disproportionate release of proinsulin from \u03b2-cell, is considered an early marker of islet dysfunction [ 9] . In a cross-sectional study, Troms\u00f8 Study, a decline in random casual concentrations of insulin across increasing age groups in men, but not in women was observed [ 10 ] .\nThe objective of this study was to assess the relationship between fasting plasma proinsulin (FPP) and age in general population and to determine whether the association is different in obese and non-obese persons."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population and sampling methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "Cross-sectional population-based screening campaign whose main objective was the screening for diabetes."}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Patient recruitment took place in NovemberDecember 2011 in Bucharest, Romania.

Fasting insulin levels have been reported to increase [16] or not to change [17] with age in cross-sectional studies. There were no statistically significant changes in FPI in our study. In elderly persons, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [18] and the Hoorn Study [19] reported a lower post-challenge insulin response. Hyperproinsulinaemia relative to insulin [20] indicates impaired proinsulin processing, which is an early abnormality of beta cell function. Proinsulin concentrations relative to insulin are increased in both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [21] and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [22] . Longitudinal data in older persons with IGT also indicate that the proinsulinto insulin ratio is a marker for progression to diabetes [23] .\nFasting proinsulin levels significantly increased with BMI category from lean (n=67, 2.9 pmol/L) to overweight (n=89, 4.5 pmol/L) and obese (n=69, 6.63 pmol/L) in our study but the ratio of proinsulin to insulin fasting levels did not differ significantly with BMI. The group with the highest FP quartiles showed a higher prevalence of obesity. Obesity in most subjects with T2DM [ 24 ] seems to be also involved in the occurrence of hyperproinsulinemia. Univariate results from previous papers have indicated that proinsulin concentrations were elevated in obese subjects [25-27] and proinsulin was positively correlated with BMI and WHR [28, 29] . Similarly, in our study, in univariate analysis, fasting proinsulin level correlated both in women and in men with weight, BMI, and waist circumference.\nHyperinsulinemia and hyperproinsulinemia in obese patiets can be explained as a reflecting compensatory hyperfunction of \u03b2-cells in the presence of presumable insulin resistance due to obesity. Normal glucose tolerance in these obese subjects would be interpreted as the result of physiological hyperfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells to overcome insulin resistance.\nIt seemed that absolute and relative hyperproinsulinemia in elderly subjects was caused by \u03b2-cell dysfunction in processing proinsulin to insulin, since there was no evidence of \u03b2-cell hypersecretion and/or altered clearance of insulin and C-peptide. It has also been reported that insulin is metabolized mainly in the liver and C-peptide and proinsulin are degraded in the kidney. The possibility of clearance changes of peptides may exist in old age. It seems unlikely, however, that the results are attributable only to altered clearance of proinsulin and not of insulin or C-peptide in elderly people [30, 31] .\nBecause the fraction of total metabolic clearance accomplished by the kidneys is greater for proinsulin than for insulin [32] , an age-related decline in renal function could conceivably have led to increased proinsulin concentrations relative to insulin, as we observed with advancing age. Advanced renal damage may also in itself affect glucose metabolism and both may cause insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion [33] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, in sex-specific analyses, proinsulin increased with advancing age for both men and women, except those in the upper age quartile. This paper reinforces the observation of elevated proinsulin concentrations among subjects with obesity."}]
