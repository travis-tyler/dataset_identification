[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We aimed to set up a robust multi-centre clinical fMRI and neuropsychological platform to investigate the neuropharmacology of brain processes relevant to addiction -reward, impulsivity and emotional reactivity. Here we provide an overview of the fMRI battery, carried out across three centres, characterizing neuronal response to the tasks, along with exploring inter-centre differences in healthy participants. Experimental design: Three fMRI tasks were used: monetary incentive delay to probe reward sensitivity, go/no-go to probe impulsivity and an evocative images task to probe emotional reactivity. A coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was carried out for the reward and impulsivity tasks to help establish region of interest (ROI) placement. A group of healthy participants was recruited from across three centres (total n=43) to investigate inter-centre differences. Principle observations: The pattern of response observed for each of the three tasks was consistent with previous studies using similar paradigms. At the whole brain level, significant differences were not observed between centres for any task.\nIn developing this platform we successfully integrated neuroimaging data from three centres, adapted validated tasks and applied whole brain and ROI approaches to explore and demonstrate their consistency across centres."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Addiction is a major global health problem, with illicit drug and alcohol use disorders contributing to approximately 20% of the burden from mental health disorders (Whiteford et al., 2013) . Of concern is the lack of effective interventions for these disorders, whilst the prevalence of alcohol, opioid and cocaine addiction is increasing (Lingford-Hughes et al., 2012; Whiteford et al., 2013) . The growing knowledge about the brain mechanisms underpinning addiction offers an important opportunity to develop new treatments. Studying the neurobiology of addiction can be challenging due to its common relapsing-remitting clinical course. To address this, a collaboration between Imperial College London, the University of Cambridge and the University of Manchester (ICCAM; http://www.bbmh.manchester.ac.uk/ICCAM/) was formed under a Medical Research Council (MRC) addiction initiative to maximize the existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical infrastructure and expertise available in the UK. Establishment of a platform is necessary to provide sufficient throughput to rapidly evaluate potential pharmacological The ICCAM platform study: An experimental medicine platform for evaluating new drugs for relapse prevention in addiction. Part B: fMRI description treatments in addiction to allow us the best chance of meeting this area of significant unmet need. Here, the term 'platform' refers to the concept of applying a framework of experimentation (i.e. the functional MRI (fMRI) tasks and associated measures) and analysis that can be applied under different conditions and on different groups to accelerate efforts to identify effective treatments for challenging diseases (Berry et al., 2015) .\nThe rationale for the cognitive processes and neuropharmacology as well as the clinical population studied in the ICCAM platform have been described in detail elsewhere (Paterson et al., 2015) . Briefly, the aim was to develop a neuroimaging platform to assess candidate brain pathways underpinning addiction and relapse using appropriate fMRI tasks, and assessing their modulation by different pharmacological challenges (antagonists of Dopamine Receptor D3 (DRD3), \u00b5-opioid receptors and Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors) in alcohol, heroin and cocaine addiction. Here we describe the establishment of fMRI tasks in the three centres in healthy volunteers and investigate their properties. Results from the ICCAM platform with regard to brain responses to the tasks in addicts and modulation to pharmacological challenges will be reported elsewhere.\nIn addiction, common themes implicated in relapse involve difficulties with reward or motivation and impulse control, as well as stress-related emotional reactivity. There is a considerable body of evidence from neuroimaging studies that a dysregulated reward/motivation system in addiction as well as deficits in inhibitory control, poor decision making (Loree et al., 2014; Noel et al., 2013) and stress (Koob and Kreek, 2007; Sinha and Li, 2007) contribute to relapse. We therefore selected established fMRI tasks designed to elucidate the neural responses associated with these processes -reward/motivation, impulse control and emotional reactivity.\nFor reward, we chose the widely used monetary incentive delay task since it provides a measure of reward sensitivity with robust increases in striatal activity evident in healthy volunteers (Knutson et al., 2001) . Striatal activity has been shown to be reduced in alcohol dependence (Wrase et al., 2007b) , and in stimulant use related to treatment status (Bustamante et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2011; Schouw et al., 2013) . Furthermore, ventral striatal activation in response to the task is sensitive to pharmacological modulation by amphetamines (Knutson et al., 2004) , olanzapine and catecholamine depletion (Hasler et al., 2009) .\nFor impulsivity, we chose the go/no-go task since it provides a measure of inhibitory control mediated by prefrontal-striatal circuits (Garavan et al., 2002 (Garavan et al., , 2003 . Neural responses during go/ no-go have been shown to be altered in cocaine users (Connolly et al., 2012; Kaufman et al., 2003) and opiate addiction (Forman et al., 2004) , and to be modulated by certain dopaminergic gene variants in heavy drinkers (Filbey et al., 2012) .\nTo explore stress we exploited the associated emotional dysregulation, since amygdalar response is robustly observed and altered in a range of neuroimaging studies of addicts (Asensio et al., 2010; Gilman and Hommer, 2008; Li and Sinha, 2008) . Therefore, in common with others, we used an evocative images task to assess emotional reactivity to contrasting aversive images with neutral images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) library. Photographs containing scenes of animate and inanimate objects or scenes were displayed in a block design, with each block containing either neutral or distressing images of an injurious or threatening nature. In addition, due to studying addiction to different substances and therefore potentially variable cue-reactivity, images had no explicit alcohol/drug content. Due to time constraints within the imaging session, positive images were not included. Similar tasks have been shown to elicit amygdala responses and have been employed to demonstrate enhanced responses in alcohol dependence (Gilman and Hommer, 2008) that were decreased by an NK1 receptor antagonist (George et al., 2008) . Whilst salient cues are strong triggers for relapse, we did not include such a task due to concerns about determining and optimizing salience for each participant, ensuring salience was equal across different substances, and habituation over five sessions. We also had to consider the time constraints of our imaging sessions which were developed to be tolerable for participants such that they would perform adequately.\nIn order to define a priori where responses were expected in the brain for each task, we carried out a coordinate-based metaanalysis of neuroimaging data using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) (Eickhoff et al., 2009 Turkeltaub et al., 2002 Turkeltaub et al., , 2012 . Such an approach overcomes potential bias of choosing regions of interest (ROIs) based on an investigator's knowledge of where a task has been found to modulate activity in their previous work. For instance, several studies have used these methods to establish locations of consistent response to reward (Bartra et al., 2013; Keuken et al., 2014) , impulsivity (Criaud and Boulinguez, 2013; Simmonds et al., 2008) and emotional reactivity (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009) . However, there is much variation in the specifics of fMRI tasks, even amongst those considered as 'standard', with meta-analyses often using relatively broad inclusion criteria. These have the advantage of increased statistical power at the expense of reduced specificity. Here we seek to establish not only the general neural correlates of the paradigms under investigation, but also those elicited by the specific versions of each task as they were implemented.\nWhilst the advantages of multi-centre study designs are numerous and well-rehearsed (Paterson et al., 2015) , the involvement of multiple acquisition centres introduces new factors that require appropriate consideration during subsequent analysis. In particular, the overall variance is inflated by a between-centre factor, and there is potential for bias should a sub-set of centres have significantly greater statistical power than the others.\nIn this paper, therefore, we detail both the specific versions of the tasks used in the platform fMRI study, along with their modelling, sufficiently to enable replication. Following this, and taking each task in turn, we establish their characteristics before investigating inter-centre differences."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

These were recruited from healthy volunteer databases, via multimedia advertising including fliers, posters, social media, local newspapers, websites, homepages and via word of mouth.\nFrom this group of 68 a subgroup of 43 (n=15, 15 and 13 from London, Cambridge and Manchester, respectively) were chosen so that each centre had a similar distribution of gender and age. This group of 43 healthy individuals was used for both the task characterization and inter-centre variability investigations. Although not reported in this work, the majority of these participants took part in further imaging sessions in the main ICCAM study, beyond these baseline sessions.\nfMRI task protocols E-Prime 2.0 RC (version 2.0.8.90) was used to run all tasks. Tasks were adapted such that two runs of each (along with resting state and preliminaries) could be achieved within a one hour period.\nA summary of the groupings and participant information is given in Table 1 . No differences were found between centres for age, sex, or handedness, consistent with the matching process.\nEach of the three tasks -monetary incentive delay, go/no-go and evocative images -will be fully covered in turn, with each broken down into its meta-analysis/ROI definition, task characterization, and inter-centre differences."}, {"section_title": "Monetary incentive delay task", "text": "The monetary incentive delay task, designed to probe reward sensitivity, was modified from Knutson et al. (2001) . Participants could win or lose money depending upon how quickly they reacted to a target stimulus. The task contained win, lose and neutral trials. For the win trials, participants could win \u00a30.50 if they responded quickly enough; for the lose trials, participants lost \u00a30.50 if they did not respond quickly enough; and for the neutral trials participants neither won nor lost money. During each run, 216 volumes were collected, for a run length of 7 min 12 s.\nThis task used an event related design, though with long miniblocks (i.e. several TRs (repetition time) in length), carried out in two runs (for a combined length of 14 min 24 s). Each run contained 18 win trials, 18 neutral trials, and six lose trials. In total, the task contained 36 win trials, 36 neutral trials and 12 lose trials. The task was set to obtain approximately 66% accuracy for the win trials. Furthermore, the task was designed to give an approximate winnings total of \u00a310 (a perfect, though unlikely, result would result in winnings of \u00a318).\nParticipants were informed as to what trial they were about to perform via 'cues' that appeared on the screen for one second. Following the cues, there was an anticipation period (i.e. a blank black screen) before the target stimulus was presented. The duration of the anticipation period was randomly selected as 2, 3 or 4 s (with equal numbers of each period for each trial type). The anticipation period was immediately followed by the presentation of the target stimulus. The duration of the target stimulus differed depending upon the accuracy of participants.\nThe starting duration for the win and neutral trials was 280 milliseconds (ms) for both runs (i.e. the time allowed for a participant to press the button after the stimulus was displayed). For the individualized algorithm, if a participant responded in time for the target stimulus, the target duration dropped by 10 ms (until the floor duration of 150 ms was reached). If a participant missed a trial, the target duration increased by 10 ms (until the ceiling duration of 300 ms was reached). The duration of each of the target symbols for each trial (win, neutral, lose) was contingent upon the participant's accuracy for the same trial type only -that is, win trial accuracy only affected stimulus duration of subsequent win trials, and not neutral or loss trials. Participants were informed if they were successful immediately (always 0.5 s after target presentation) after each trial, together with a display of their total winnings, which was shown for 2 s. For each trial type the interval between the end of this information/winnings display, and the onset of the next cue were 2.4, 3.4, or 4.4 s, with equal numbers of each period across trial types.\nThe starting duration for the loss trials was 240 ms for both runs. A reduced loss starting duration was chosen as we required participants to lose in order to increase the incentive salience of reward trials. A fixation cross was displayed for 12 s at the beginning of each run.\nNine explanatory variables were used for modelling the task itself. These were the three different general conditions -reward, neutral or loss -with each of these having three potential phases -anticipation, successful outcome or unsuccessful outcome. 'Anticipation' was modelled as a block beginning at the cue (an arrow or line) onset and ending at the trial (a star) onset (these blocks lasting between approximately 3 s and 5 s -that is, the combined time of the cue and blank screen before the star). 'Outcome' was modelled as an immediately abutting block beginning at the trial (a star) onset and ending two seconds later. A high-pass filter cut-off of periods above 50 s was applied to both the data and the model. The contrast further explored in this work is that of 'reward anticipation' compared with 'neutral anticipation', with 'reward anticipation' being expected to show greater BOLD response (Knutson et al., 2001) ."}, {"section_title": "Go/no-go task", "text": "The go/no-go task, designed to probe impulsivity, was modified from Garavan et al.

Participants were presented with an alternating series of letter Xs and letter Ys and asked to 'respond as quickly as possible' to the appearance of each letter presented ('go' trial), except when the alternating sequence was broken by the appearance of a letter the same as that presented previously ('no-go' trial). During each run, 131 volumes were collected, for a run length of 4 min 22 s. This task used an event related design and was carried out in two runs. Each run contained 250 trials. 220 of these were 'go' trials where participants had to respond, and 30 of these trials were 'no-go' trials where the participant had to withhold a response (i.e. when the letter was the same as the previous letter). On average there was one 'no-go' trial every 8 s (range: 4-14 s).\nEach letter was presented on the screen for 900 ms and was followed by a 100 ms inter-stimulus interval consisting of a blank screen. A fixation cross was displayed for 12 s at the beginning of each run.\nTwo explanatory variables were used for modelling the task itself, one for 'successful no-go' and the other for 'unsuccessful no-go'. These were modelled against an implicit baseline of 'go'. Both 'successful no-go' and 'unsuccessful no-go' were modelled as events lasting 0.1 s. A high-pass filter cut-off of periods above 120 s was applied to both the data and the model.

During each run, 196 volumes were collected, for a run length of 6 min 32 s.\nThe task used a block design and was carried out in two runs. Each run contained four blocks of aversive images and four blocks of neutral images. Each block contained six images and each block was separated by a rest period to prevent carry-over effects. Images in each block were presented in a pseudorandomized order. The second run of the task contained the same images as the first run, but presented in a different order. Due to possible habituation effects, different images were presented at each session.\nEach block was 32.4 s (six images of 5 s duration followed by a 400 ms inter-stimulus interval).

Thus, the ROI for the evocative images task was made up of two 5 mm radius spheres centred at the MNI coordinates (\u00b122 mm, -4 mm, -12 mm) so as to be robustly in the grey matter of the amygdala as defined functionally by the clusters reported in a previously published ALE meta-analysis of amygdala responsivity (Costafreda et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "MRI data acquisition", "text": "All centres operated MRI machines with a main magnetic field of 3 tesla (T).

Across three tasks investigating reward sensitivity, inhibitory control and emotional reactivity, we have examined their characteristics, and inter-centre differences for behavioural, whole brain and ROI measures. This study raised a number of issues, which we now discuss in turn. Importantly our three tasks resulted in the expected pattern of brain responses consistent with existing evidence. Thus the monetary incentive delay task resulted in responses in regions such as the visual cortex, striatum, prefrontal and insula cortices consistent with previous studies (Knutson et al., 2001) . The influence of variations in the task on the patterns of brain responses have been described elsewhere (Hommer et al., 2011; Limbrick-Oldfield et al., 2013) . Though many people use the monetary incentive delay task, most adapt it to some extent so that it is no longer a standardized task. For instance, the ICCAM version of the monetary incentive delay task prioritized imaging 'anticipation of reward' since this primary contrast has been found altered in addiction and is of relevance to relapse. Therefore we were less interested in brain responses to loss or outcomes.\nThe pattern of brain response elicited by our monetary incentive delay task was consistent with that derived from the metaanalysis. Many fMRI studies of the monetary incentive delay task used spatially constrained approaches -that is, analyses performed within ROIs of varying size, focused on striatal regions. Out of the 17 studies used here, 11 were not 'whole brain' analyses. Indeed, in the original fMRI monetary incentive delay study (Knutson et al., 2001) , a limited acquisition of coronal slices was Figure 5 . The contrast of aversive images with neutral images in the evocative images task in the combined group (n=43), controlling for centre, age, and sex. Images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z>3.1 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p<0.05. The slices shown were chosen such that all three intersect with the left side of the ROI used later in this work. The greyed out portion shows areas outside common coverage. Figure 4 .

The slices shown were chosen such that all three intersect with the left side of the ROI used later in this work. The greyed out portion shows areas outside common coverage.\nused, limiting coverage to a block including the striatum, and our own coverage is itself limited, as can be seen throughout the figures (such as Figure 2 ). By comparison, of the 12 go/no-go studies included in the meta-analysis, none used such a spatially constrained approach.\nThe responses to the go/no-go task in inferior frontal gyrus, striatum, insula and thalamus were consistent with previous studies (Luijten et al., 2014; Steele et al., 2013) . Our meta-analysis of similar go/no-go tasks resulted in a striatal ROI, though this was more dorsal than the one derived from the meta-analysis of the monetary incentive delay task. This association between ventral striatum associated with reward processing and dorsal striatum with habit or compulsive behaviours, and the importance of frontocorticostriatal loops in inhibitory control, have been well documented (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Koob and Volkow, 2010) .\nAlthough there is often a focus on the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) when discussing go/no-go tasks, this did not emerge in our ALE meta-analysis (which closely follow the results presented in the task characterization here). IFG response was observed in our task, though was weaker than insular or striatal responses. This might be explained by the 'simple' design task used here (and thus the strict criteria in our meta-analysis), while the majority of those in the literature used more complex designs (Criaud and Boulinguez, 2013) . In the extensive ALE meta-analysis performed by Criaud and Boulinguez (2013) examining several facets of fMRI go/no-go tasks, it is also suggested that typical no-go activity is mostly driven by attention, not inhibition, though this is still a current topic of debate (Aron et al., 2014) .\nBoth the go/no-go and monetary incentive delay task resulted in robust responses in the insula, particularly anterior insula. This brain region has been shown to be involved in self-regulation and reward seeking, as well as in emotional awareness, through integrating sensory information into cognitive, affective and physiological processes, along with being part of a task general network (Gu et al., 2013; Menon and Uddin, 2010; Nelson et al., 2010) . With regard to addiction, the insula appears also to be involved with critical functions such as craving, and the landmark description that damage to its structure substantially increased the likelihood of smoking cessation (Garavan, 2010; Naqvi and Bechara, 2009 ).\nThe evocative images task produced a robust response in the dorsal amygdala, along with inferior portions of the globus pallidus, with the highest response near the amygdala overlapping with the predetermined amygdala ROI. Such a pattern is consistent with previous studies using an evocative task or one that requires emotional processing (Costafreda et al., 2008; Sergerie et al., 2008) . We were particularly interested in demonstrating a robust response in the amygdala, since dysregulation in this region is implicated in relapse vulnerability in addiction, in particular those involving stress (Koob et al., 2014) .\nEven though this comparison between centres did not utilize a travelling participants design, such as those of Friedman et al. (2008) , Gee et al. (2015) and Suckling et al. (2012) , it demonstrates that different groups of participants at different centres produce markedly similar patterns of response to the tasks in our ICCAM platform. Recent explorations of both functional and structural neuroimages acquired from multiple centres have unequivocally demonstrated high levels of within-and between-centre reliability, as well as small between-centre variances relative to the total variance (Gee et al., 2015; Suckling et al., 2012) .\nHowever, the lack of significant whole brain differences in the participants examined here does not necessarily imply that with larger groupings and different patient populations there would not be differences observed.\nAlthough much effort was made to run the study in as similar a manner possible at each centre, there were inevitably slight differences between the experimental set-ups which may have driven differences. In the monetary incentive delay task a lower accuracy led to slightly less money being won by the Manchester group, though brain response wasn't observed to be different. In the evocative images task a centre difference was found in the amygdala ROI ( Supplementary Table 8 ) and was driven by the Manchester group (at the whole brain level, no significant differences were observed). One factor may have been the means by which images were projected, which was almost identical in London and Cambridge but differed in Manchester, where images were projected in a different manner, creating a less bright and so possibly less salient image, creating a smaller difference in activity between the aversive and neutral images.\nAlthough in this analysis we have explored differences between centres, in the patient study itself participants were recruited so that there would be a roughly equal proportion of cases to controls at each centre. Centre was used as a covariate in the characterization of the tasks. Thus, although small differences were observed in the monetary incentive delay task behavioural results, and the evocative images task neuroimaging results, these may be regarded as effects of centre (which is used as a covariate in all analyses)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We have demonstrated here the establishment of an fMRI platform involving three different tasks, repeated at multiple sessions and at three different centres.
