[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A growing economics literature establishes a causal link between in utero shocks and health and human capital in adulthood. Most studies rely on extreme negative shocks such as famine and pandemics. We are the first to examine the impact of a positive and policy-driven change in economic resources available in utero and during childhood. In particular, we focus on the introduction of a key element of the U.S. safety net, the Food Stamp Program, which was rolled out across counties in the U.S. between 1961 and 1975. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to assemble unique data linking family background and county of residence in early childhood to adult health and economic outcomes. The identification comes from variation across counties and over birth cohorts in exposure to the food stamp program. Our findings indicate that the food stamp program has effects decades after initial exposure. Specifically, access to food stamps in childhood leads to a significant reduction in the incidence of \"metabolic syndrome\" (obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes) and, for women, an increase in economic self-sufficiency. Overall, our results suggest substantial internal and external benefits of the safety net that have not previously been quantified."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is substantial evidence on the strong intergenerational correlations in health and income. As documented by Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson (2002) , health and economic disparities unfold early in life. There is less evidence, however, on causal mechanisms behind this gap. The \"early origins\" literature offers some guidance toward the causal relationships underlying intergenerational correlations. However, whether public policy may be able to benefit by accessing these \"early origins\" linkages remains to be been established.\nIn this paper, we evaluate whether increasing resources available in utero and during childhood improves later-life health and economic outcomes. In particular, we focus on the introduction of a key element of the U.S. safety net, the Food Stamp Program (FSP). The FSP was rolled out at a county by county basis between 1962 and 1975, providing low-income families vouchers that could be used at grocery stores to purchase food. Economic theory and prior empirical evidence suggest that these vouchers were treated the same as cash income (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009 ). Thus, we can utilize the FSP rollout as an identification strategy for increases in resource availability early in life. Our analysis builds on previous research finding a positive \"first stage\" effect of FSP rollout on contemporaneous health, as measured in natality data by birth weight (Almond, Schanzenbach 2011, Currie and Moretti 2008) . The program rollout design links the paper to a growing literature evaluating the introduction of other Great Society programs."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Our analysis also makes an important contribution to the economics literature that relates resources in utero and during childhood to economic and health outcomes in adulthood.\nPrevious design-based observational studies have generally looked at extreme, negative events including famines, natural disaster, or disease outbreaks (see Currie 2009, Almond and Currie 2011a , b for recent reviews). A point of departure in our analysis is to evaluate the impact of a positive and policy-driven event; one that is manifested by an increase in family resources available in utero and during childhood. This income variation may be relevant for a larger population than those touched by extreme events. Nevertheless, it is a relatively open question whether a moderate increase in resources exerts corresponding long-term effects, or whether these linkages are restricted to extreme events.\nThe Food Stamp program, recently renamed Supplemental Assistance for Needy Families or SNAP, is the fundamental safety net in the U.S. Importantly, it is the only public assistance program that is available to all income eligible families (other programs limit eligibility to particular groups such as female headed households, children, the disabled or the elderly). It is currently the largest U.S. cash or near cash means tested transfer program with spending in 2011 of 70 billion dollars compared to 31 billion for TANF and 59 billion for the federal EITC. Interestingly, in contrast to the rest of the U.S. safety net, the FSP is a federal program and exhibits little variation across states (Currie 2003) . It also has remained largely intact in the presence of dramatic reforms to other parts of the safety net (Bitler and Hoynes 2010) . This lack of variation across states and over time presents significant challenges for evaluating the impacts of the FSP (Currie 2003) .\nOur main results are for a sample of adults born between 1956 and 1981 who grew up in disadvantaged families (their parent had less than a high school education). We refer to this as the \"high impact sample.\" We employ a difference-in-difference model where the treatment varies by county of birth and birth cohort, and we include controls for county and year of birth and interview fixed effects, state linear time trends, and county-year of birth controls. We also estimate a triple difference model that extends beyond the low education sample and uses variation across subgroups with varying propensities of being affected by food stamps (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009) . Our main treatment variable is the share of time between conception and age 5 that a food stamp program was available in the individual's county of birth. We estimate impacts on weight, height, general health status, disability, the incidence of many conditions and diseases (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, etc.), health behaviors (smoking, drinking), as well as education, earnings, income, and program participation. Because of the many outcome variables, we follow Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and Anderson (2008) estimate summary standardized indices that aggregate information over multiple treatments.\nWe find that access to the FSP in utero and in early childhood leads to a large and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of \"metabolic syndrome\" (obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes) as well as an increase in reporting to be in good health. We also find for women, but not men, that access to food stamps in early childhood leads to an increase in economic self-sufficiency. Our results are robust to adding a rich set of county controls (possible confounders) and event study models further support the validity of the research design.\nOur results not only make a contribution by establishing a link between expanding resources in childhood and long run health outcomes, but we also can speak to the \"program evaluation\" of FSP. Presumably, the FSP passes a cost-benefit criterion based on the contemporaneous or \"real time\" benefits (nutrition, anti-poverty) . Given that empirical evidence on \"early origins\" is relatively recent, the long-term benefits of such longstanding programs were neither considered nor expected. An additional contribution of our work is, therefore, to explore the possibility of internal and external benefits of the safety net that have not previously been quantified. This raises the possibility that policies targeting early childhood may be suboptimally small. In other words, the FSP generates larger private and social benefits when taking into account the \"multiplier effect\" on later-life outcomes.\nThe remainder of our paper is as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the economic literature on long term effects of early life interventions. In Section 3 we summarize the biological science literature in order to provide guidance for which health impacts are expected to be impacted by the FSP treatment. In Section 4 we provide the background on the FSP and in Section 5 we describe our data. In Section 6 we present our empirical model and Section 7 our results. We conclude in Section 8."}, {"section_title": "Background and Prior Research", "text": "That in utero and early childhood events can have important vestigial effects has been documented for a wide range of later-life outcomes, including health status, test scores, education attainment, wages, and mortality. Observational studies have leveraged short, extreme events experienced in utero as identification strategies (see reviews by Currie 2009 and Almond and Currie 2011a,b) . Examples include famine (Painter et al. 2005, Susser and Lin 1992) , disease (Almond 2006 , Barreca 2010 , and radiation (Almond et al. 2009) . A natural question is how generalizable such linkages are, and in particular whether more routine childhood experiences may also shape health and economic outcomes during adulthood. To date, there has been relatively little research that combines the strength of design-based identification strategies for causal inference with more commonplace treatments/exposures. Those that are amenable to policy are rarer still.\nThe shortage of previous work stems from the challenge of marrying identification strategies for program evaluation to: a) policies that affect children at a young age and b) policies that can be mapped to data on later-life outcomes in adulthood. Thus, whether \"early origins\" are more of an empirical curiosity or a general policy avenue remains largely unknown.\nA relatively large literature considers the effect of income on health. Much of this literature is concerned with the short-term effects of income changes experienced in adulthood, and there are few studies that considering the long-term effect of early-life income changes. Van Den Berg, Lindeboom and Portrait (2006) compare Dutch mortality rates among those born during economic downturns to those born during expansions. Those born during expansions lived substantially longer, which they argue is not due to changes in cohort composition or other potential confounders. Banerjee et al. (2010) consider the a 19 th century blight of French vineyards that created a region by birth cohort varying shock to production and hence income.\nThey find this led to shorter heights in adulthood but no impact on mortality.\nA second strand of research has considered the long-term effect of specific, wellidentified programs. Among these studies, the closest is Ludwig and Miller (2007) , who consider the long-term effect of Head Start program. Their approach uses application assistance provided to poor counties as an instrument for Head Start Program operation, and finds the program reduced childhood mortality rates in affected counties. Furthermore, Ludwig and Miller find that educational attainment is also higher due to Head Start exposure. Chetty et al. (2011) and Dynarski, Hyman and Schanzenbach (2011) find persistent effects of class-size reductions on educational attainment and initial labor market outcomes. Reyes (2007) and Nilsson (2009) consider the effect of early childhood lead exposure on later life outcomes, and Glied and Neidell (2010) evaluate the long-term impacts of water fluoridation. 4 Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder (2012) consider the long-term human capital effect of early childhood health, as proxied by local post-neonatal mortality rates. They find that improved health for young black children during the late 1960s and early 1970s yielded substantially increased NAEP and AFQT test scores during the 1980s. Building on Almond, Chay, Greenstone (2007) , they argue that improved access to hospitals following the Civil Rights Act and Medicare-induced desegregation of hospitals drove the reduction in post-neonatal mortality rates for blacks that subsequently yielded higher test scores. Likewise, more specific medical interventions in the early postnatal period have been found to exert long-term effects, including surfactant and related treatments for very low birth weight infants (Bharadwaj, Loken, and Nielson, 2012) and breastfeedingencouragement by hospital nurses following delivery (Fritzsimmons and Vera-Hernandez 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of Early Nutrition and Expected Effects of the FSP", "text": "Causal mechanisms by which early childhood events affect later-life are best understood for nutrition. This section reviews specific mechanisms by which early malnutrition can impair development with long-term consequences. 4 Duncan, Ziol-Guest, and Kalil (2010) use the PSID to examine the impact of income during childhood on later life economic and health outcomes. Importantly, they explore how income during different stages of childhood (early life, later childhood, etc) affects outcomes and they explore income's nonlinear impacts. This is an observational design, however, and it is unclear whether they have recovered causal income channels.\nAlthough FSP was clearly a nutrition program, because most recipients received a Food Stamp Benefit below their normal food expenditures, the program is better understood as an income transfer (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009 ). However, because recipients were by definition poor, a large portion of their FSP benefit was spent on food. Further, at the time FSP was introduced, hunger and nutritional deficiencies were not uncommon among Americans. For example, a survey of low income families in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia in 1968-1970 found that 15 percent of whites and 37 percent of blacks had low hemoglobin levels as well as relatively high rates of deficiencies in vitamin C, riboflavin and protein (Eisinger 1998 ). The 1968 CBS documentary \"Hunger in America\" raised national awareness of the problem and possibly influenced the policy debate on the FSP (Berry 1984) . Here, by briefly summarizing the linkages between early life nutrition and later life outcomes, we provide predictions about outcomes that may be altered by our FSP treatment.\nSome linkages between early life nutrition and later life outcomes are fairly intuitive. For example, severely undernourished children may suffer from anemia and listlessness. This may reduce their ability to invest in learning during childhood and may harm their long-run earnings and other outcomes. Poor early life nutrition may also directly harm long-run outcomes through altering the body's developmental trajectory. There is an emerging scientific consensus that describes critical periods of development during early life that \"program\" the body's long-term survival outcomes (Barker, 1992; Gluckman and Hanson 2004) . During development, the fetus (and post-natally the child) may take cues from the current environment to predict the type of environment it is expected to face in the long run and in some cases adapts its formation to better thrive in the expected environment (Gluckman and Hanson 2004) . A problem arises, however, when the predicted later environment and the actual later environment are substantially different.\nFor example, if nutrients are scarce during the pre-(or early post-natal) period, the developing body therefore predicts that the future will also be nutritionally deprived. The body may then invoke (difficult-to-reverse) biological mechanisms to adapt to the predicted future environment.\nFor example, the metabolic system may adapt in a manner that will allow the individual to survive in an environment with chronic food shortages. This pattern is termed the \"thrifty phenotype\" and is sometimes referred to as the Barker hypothesis. The \"problem\" arises if in fact there is not a long-run food shortage, and nutrition is plentiful. In that case, the early-life metabolic adaptations are a bad match to the actual environment and will increase the likelihood that the individual develops a \"metabolic disorder,\" which is the clustered association between high blood pressure (hypertension), type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. The negative consequences do not usually appear until after reproductive age, which is preferable to the species from an evolutionary perspective (Barker 1992) . Note that both pre-and post-natal nutrition can drive this programming.\nLasting impacts of nutrient deprivation in both the pre-and post-natal period have been found on both long-term health and economic outcomes. Much of the experimental work on nutritional programming has been conducted on rats. In McCance (1962) , the researchers experimentally manipulated how much breast milk was available to baby rats during their normal 21-day suckling period. At the end of the experiment, the treatment group (who were fed less than normal) were smaller than the control group (who were fed normally). Subsequently, both groups were fed normally, and the treatment group quickly caught up to normal size. In the longer-run, however, they found that the (former) treatment rats became more obese than the control group even though they were fed the same, normal amount. This set off a number of follow-up studies. In one, the researchers found that if they manipulated the food intake for a different (later) 21-day period, there were no long-run effects. This suggests there is a \"critical period\" in the early post-natal period during which programming continues to occur."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Some of the strongest research on humans comes from studies of the Dutch Hunger Winter. In World War II, the Nazis imposed strict rationing of food during their occupation of the Netherlands over the 7 month period between November 1944 and April 1945. As a result, the previously well-nourished society experienced an abrupt, severe restriction in available calories. Average caloric intake fell almost overnight from about 1800 calories per day to between 400 and 800. Upon liberation, the food supply returned to normal levels almost instantaneously. Because of the abrupt and severe nature of the period of malnutrition, it is possible to isolate the impact of malnutrition that occurred at different points during development. Painter et al. (2005) find that children had lower birth weight if exposed to famine in the third trimester. Further, when the cohort that was exposed to malnutrition in utero hit middle age, they were more likely to be obese, and had higher incidence of heart disease, lower self-reported health status, and worse mental health (Painter et al. 2005, Susser and Lin 1992) . Almond and Mazumder (2011) consider the effect of nutrition timing during pregnancy on later-life outcomes, focusing on the Ramadan fast as an identification strategy. They find that children born with in utero exposure to the Ramadan fast experienced large increases in disability in adulthood. Because fasting during Ramadan is confined to daylight hours, the nutritional treatment is relatively mild compared to famine episodes. \"Net nutrition\" can also be compromised by infectious disease (Bozzoli, Deaton, and Quintana-Domeque 2009) , which can increase energy expenditure and reduce consumption and absorption of nutrients. Thus, previous 5 Findings from animal models may need to be interpreted with additional caution if the timing of birth occurs at different stages of development. 6 In a parallel manner, our earlier work (Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011) finds that children have higher birth weight if exposed to food stamps in the third trimester.\nwell-identified findings on the long-term effect of the postnatal health environment (esp. Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder 2012) may also include nutrition as a portion of the underlying mechanism.\nTo summarize, the literature has found that lack of nutrition in early life leads to higher incidence of metabolic syndrome. These impacts have occurred both when the nutritional shock occurred in utero and when it occurred in the period shortly after birth. Importantly, the long-run health outcomes have been found even in cases in which birth weight itself was not affected.\nThus the impacts of in utero shocks do not necessarily directly map into birth weight and evaluating the long term impacts requires the analysis of a many-decade past change, such as we do in this paper.\nIn our setting, we examine a policy-driven increase in resources to a population that had previously experienced chronic low levels of nutrition. Therefore, we expect that individuals who were exposed to the FSP program in early life will be less likely to have mis-adapted to the future environment. As a result, we expect to find that these cohorts experience lower incidence of metabolic syndrome -as measured by high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes -in adult life. We also expect to find better human capital outcomes, as measured by education, earnings, income and the like. Because the literature is unclear about the exact timing of post-natal damage, we will explore alternative specifications for the timing of FSP exposure."}, {"section_title": "Introduction of the Food Stamp Program", "text": "Today, food stamp benefits are the fundamental safety net in the U.S., being the only public assistance program that is available to all family types (most programs are targeted on female headed households, children, or the elderly). Eligibility requires satisfying income and asset tests and benefits can be used to purchase most grocery store food goods. A family's benefit is equal to the difference between the federally defined maximum benefit level for a given family size and the amount that the family is deemed to be able to afford to pay for food on its own according to the benefits formula (essentially 30 percent of cash income, less some deductions). In earlier work (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009), we documented that larger counties with a greater fraction of the population that was urban, black, or low income indeed implemented the FSP earlier (i.e. consistent with the historical accounts). 9 Nevertheless, we found that the county characteristics explain very little of the variation in adoption dates. This is consistent with the characterization of funding limits controlling the movement of counties off the waiting list to start up their FSP (Berry 1984) . We view the weakness of this model fit as a strength when it comes to our identification approach in that much of the variation in the implementation of FSP appears to be idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in order to control for possible differences in trends across counties that are spuriously correlated with the county treatment effect, all of our regressions include interactions of these 1960 pre-treatment county characteristics with time trends as in Acemoglu et al. (2004) and Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) ."}, {"section_title": "The roots of today's Food", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Given the county rollout of the FSP, our analysis requires data with information on adult health and economic outcomes as well as county of birth for cohorts that were impacted by the FSP introduction (1963) (1964) (1965) (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) at birth or during early childhood. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) which began in 1968 with a sample of approximately 5,000 households, and subsequently followed and interviewed all members and descendants. The original sample comprises two subsamples: a nationally representative sample of 3,000 households and the \"Survey of Economic Opportunity subsample\" including 1,900 low-income and minority households selected from an existing sample. To adjust for this nonrandom composition, we conduct all analysis using the PSID weights.\n9 For more detail, see Table 1 in Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009). Since the beginning of the survey, the PSID has collected detailed information on economic and demographic outcomes. We use those data to generate adult economic outcomes such as educational attainment, employment, earnings, family income, and poverty. Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, the PSID also began regularly collecting information on health outcomes.\nWe use self-reported general health status (reported on a 5 point scale: excellent, very good, etc.) and disability (physical or nervous condition that limits the type or amount of work), both of which have been asked of heads and wives each year beginning in 1984. In addition, the PSID reports height and weight (hence we can construct obesity 10 and height stunting 11 ), and information on whether a doctor has diagnosed the respondent with specific health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack and heart disease."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "These data are also collected for all heads and wives and have been available since 1999, when the survey became biennial.

We limit the sample to persons age 18 and above for the health outcomes and age 25 and over for the economic outcomes (to facilitate completed education).

About 69 percent of the full sample and 60 percent of the high impact (parent low education) sample report to be in excellent or very good health. About 10 percent report a work disability and less than 5 percent 16 The AHA data provides annual data that allows for us to measure county variables for the first five years of life for all birth cohorts (the \"Hospitals: Guide Issue\" publication goes back to 1948). We collapse the hospital level data to county-year and then convert to per capita measures using historical county population data. We then prepare a simple average over the first five years of life. We thank Amy Finkelstein and Martin Gaynor for the pre-1976 data, Jean Roth of the NBER for the 1976 and on data, and Martha Bailey and Andrew Goodman-Bacon for providing code to clean the data. 17 The REIS data is available for 1959 and 1962 and then annually beginning in 1965. We construct three measures for real per capita transfers that can be consistently measured throughout this period: cash public assistance benefits (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Supplemental Security Income and General Assistance), medical spending (Medicare and military health care), and cash retirement and disability payments (OASI, DI, other).

In our base case models we measure the share of months between conception and age 5 that food stamps is available in the adult's birth county.\nBecause counties adopted FSP at different times, we compare those with or without FSP access in early childhood by virtue of their county and date of birth.

Economic self-sufficiency includes seven measures: high school graduate, employed, not poor, not on TANF, not on food stamps, earnings, and family income."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "The validity of our design depends on the exogeneity of the introduction of the FSP across counties. We address this in two ways. First, following Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) we control for trends in the observable determinants of FSP adoption by including interactions between characteristics of the county of birth and linear trends in year of birth (CB60 c *b).\nFurther, this period of FSP introduction took place during a period of tremendous expansion in cash and noncash transfer programs as part of the War on Poverty and Great Society. To explore these possible confounders, we directly control for several characteristics of county of birth (community health centers, hospitals and hospital beds per capita, and non-FSP government transfers per capita), measured as averages over the first five years of life.\nThe basic identification strategy underpinning equation (1) is different from previous design-based studies in the fetal origins literature and other papers in the \"rollout\" literature.\nTypically, natural experiments induced by famines, disease outbreaks, etc., are episodic: they turn on and then turn off. In contrast, once the FSP starts operating in a given county, it keeps operating and does not \"turn off\". An analysis of short-term impacts of the policy, such as maternal exposure and impacts on birth weight (as in Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011) leads to a 0/1 treatment variable for \"FSP introduction\". However, in the current setting, we have a much longer period of potential exposure (through childhood). This restricts the set of cohort comparisons that can be made. For example, we will never observe a birth cohort exposed in early childhood (e.g., up to age five), but without exposure in later childhood (after age 5).\nInstead, comparisons are \"from above\": we observe cohorts with the addition of exposure prior to age five, but this comes on top of exposure at older ages. So, comparisons are inherently about additional FSP exposure earlier in childhood, conditional on \"already\" having it later in childhood. To illustrate the variation we have, Figure 3 shows average FSP exposure by birth cohort for three measures of food stamp availability: in utero, share of months between birth and age 5, and share of months between 6 and age 18."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "High Impact Sample", "text": "We begin with our \"high impact\" sample, adults born between 1956 and 1981 that grew up in disadvantaged families (their parent had less than a high school education).

The \"metabolic syndrome index\" is the equal weighted average of the z-score of five dichotomous variables: obese, diabetic, high blood pressure, heart disease and heart attack. This, and all subsequent specifications, include individual demographics, family background controls, and fixed effects for year of birth, year of interview, county, state linear trends (in cohort), and 1960 county characteristics linear trends (in cohort). The effect of access to food stamps in childhood on metabolic syndrome, as shown in column 1, is -0.294 and is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The magnitude of the coefficient implies that increasing the share from 0 to 1 (from no exposure to full exposure in utero to age 5) reduces metabolic syndrome by 0.3 standard deviations.\nThe remaining columns of Table 2 show the regressions for the individual components of metabolic syndrome index. While individually only obesity reaches statistical significance, each of the point estimates indicate an improvement in adult health with the food stamp treatment in childhood.\nThe estimates in Table 2 are intent-to-treat estimates, averaging across persons with higher and lower likelihoods of being affected by food stamps."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Of course, the food stamp participation rate is not 100 percent, even in this high impact sample. We estimate that for families where heads have less than a high school degree, about a quarter participate in food stamps at some point in their child's life. Thus to convert these estimates to the treatment on the treated, one should divide the treatment effects by 0.24.\n23 Table 3 presents estimates for other health outcomes for the high impact sample. Column 1 presents results for being in \"good health\" defined as one if the individual reports being in excellent or very good health (as opposed to good, fair or poor health). The coefficient is 0.11 which implies that going to full exposure between conception and age 5 leads to an 11 percentage point increase compared to a mean of 59 percent, though this is not statistically significant. Column 2 presents estimates for a work limiting disability and while the coefficient is negative (e.g. an improvement as expected) it is very small and statistically insignificant."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "The third column indicates that access to the food stamp program leads to a reduction in the risk of stunting (below the 5 th percentile of the nationally-normed distribution of height)."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "The final two columns of the table present results for health behaviors-dichotomous variables for whether the person ever smoked and whether they drink (at all).

The first column presents estimates for the \"economic self-sufficiency index.\" This is an equal 23 It is the participation rate of the sample individuals at birth and in early life that is relevant, rather than their contemporaneous (adult) participation rate. To calculate the 0.24 FSP participation rate, we calculate the share of families with children who ever report receiving food stamps (in the period when they have children in the household). We limit the sample to 1978 and later, after the FSP has been rolled out in all counties. 24 Note that the sample size for health status and disability are substantially larger than those in Table 2 because these questions have been included in the survey since 1984. 25 Table 3 shows that the mean of the stunting measure is below 0.05 which is consistent with the results in XX finding that the height measures in the PSID are somewhat higher other health surveys. The qualitative results are the same if we define stunting as below the 10 th percentile.\nweighted average of seven items where, for each, the variables are converted (if needed) such that an increase in the outcome represents a better outcome.

The remainder of the columns provides the estimates for the individual components of the economic self-sufficiency index. All coefficients with the exception of employment status suggest that exposure to food stamps leads to an improvement in economic well-being: increases in education, earnings, and income and a reduction in poverty and participation in public assistance programs. However, only the coefficient on educational attainment reaches statistical significance.\nInterestingly, the interpretation of the coefficient on adult food stamp receipt (column 4\nof Table 4 ) is potentially more complicated than the biological theories discussed above.\nObservational data shows a relatively strong degree of intergenerational transmission of \"welfare use\" (Bane and Ellwood 1994) . Obtaining causal estimates for intergeneration transmission is difficult, however, given the strong persistence in other factors associated with economic success. In any case, the intergeneration transmission story would imply a positive effect of exposure to food stamps in early life on adult participation in the program. While the results here are not conclusive given the lack of precision in the estimate, the point estimate (positive on not participating in food stamps) suggests that on net the biological story dominates.\nIn Table 5 we present the main results in the high impact sample by gender of the adult."}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "We find quite striking evidence that the effects for economic self-sufficiency is large and statistically significant for women, compared to the smaller and insignificant results for men.

The estimates for the effect of food stamps on metabolic syndrome are significant for both groups, but larger for men than for women. The larger effects for men are consistent with the biological evidence that males are more subject to harm in utero than females (Almond and Currie 2011a)."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "Interestingly, the gender differences in self-reported health status show a different pattern, with significant positive effects concentrated among women. In interpreting these gender differences, it is important to point out that there is no evidence of pre-natal exposure to food stamps on live births or infant mortality overall or by gender (Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011); such an effect, if present, suggests selective mortality which would cloud the interpretation of these results."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "Identification in the model comes from variation in food stamp rollout across counties and birth cohorts. Importantly, the food stamp program was expanded in the midst of the Great Society, a time when many health and human capital programs were expanding across the U.S.\n27 Table 5 shows that we have more women in our sample than men. This is a result of the fact that our sample includes individuals in survey years when they are a head or spouse and is consistent with the analysis in Andreski et al. (2009) . 28 Males tend to suffer higher mortality rates in response to adverse events than females In addition to higher mortality, males could also exhibit larger long-term effects if males suffer a more pronounced (unobserved) health shock than females in response to the same event (e.g. Food Stamps). 29 Aside from biological factors, it is possible that post-natal treatment differs between girls and boys, and that this might change with food stamp treatment. Interestingly, Lhila and Simon (2008) find that families with girls are more likely to take up the WIC nutrition program post-natally.\nMuch of that policy variation resulted from state rather than county implementation. However, in Table 6 , we examine the sensitivity of our core health and economics outcomes, to adding controls for county programs and resources available between ages 0 and 5. The first three columns examine metabolic syndrome, where the first column repeats the main estimates from Table 2 , column 1. In the second column we add controls for access to health care resources (hospitals per capita, hospital beds per capita, presence of community health centers). In the third column we add controls for real per capita government transfers."}, {"section_title": "30", "text": "We then repeat the three specifications for the economic self-sufficiency index in columns 4 to 6. The table shows that our results are highly robust to adding these controls.\nAn additional test for the validity of the design is to estimate the model by limiting the sample to those who are unlikely to have been impacted by the program. In Table 7 , we employ this placebo test and limit to only those individuals from families with high levels of head's education (more than a high school education). These results show small, imprecise and generally wrong-signed impacts for both health and economic outcomes. This adds support to our approach.\nThe results so far show that in the high impact sample, we find that childhood exposure to the food stamp program leads to robust and significant improvement in metabolic syndrome (obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes) for adult men and women. We also find that childhood exposure to the safety net improves economic outcomes for adult women, but not for men."}, {"section_title": "Full Sample Triple Difference", "text": "30 The number of observations declines when we add the county controls for government per capita transfers. This is because the REIS data begins in 1959 and we therefore have to drop all observations with a year of birth 1958 or earlier.\nIn choosing our preferred sample for this analysis, we face a tradeoff between sample size (using the full sample of adults) and targeting (using the smaller high impact sample). To build on the findings for the high impact sample, here we use the full sample of adults in our PSID sample, but use a triple-difference specification that accounts for different probabilities of being affected by food stamps. In particular, we augment model (1) above and estimate:\nTo capture the varying risks of being treated we multiply the FSP treatment by a group level food stamp participation rate (Bleakley 2007, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009) . The group food stamp participation rate P g is defined for 12 groups using education (<12, 12, >12), race (white, nonwhite), and marital status (married, not married) based on the family background of the adult.\nWe calculate the participation rate in the same fashion as discussed above (to convert intent-totreat to treatment-on-treated). In addition to the variables in the model (1), we add a main effect for food stamp treatment, fixed effects for each group g \uf06d , and (although not shown in (2)), interactions of g P with demographics, year of birth and interview fixed effects, and 1960 county characteristic trends. The coefficient on the main effect for food stamp treatment,\uf06a , represents the impact for a participation rate of zero; therefore we expect this coefficient to be zero. In this triple difference model, the maintained assumption is that there are no differential trends for high participation versus low participation groups within early versus late implementing counties.\nResults for this specification are presented in Table 8 . Note that the main treatment variable, FS Share IU-5, is interacted with the participation rate and therefore the coefficient represents the impact of FSP exposure on health and economic outcome for someone who takes up the program. Thus, these are treatment-on-the-treated estimates and should be compared to the inflated estimates in the high impact sample.\nThe results in Table 8 show that full exposure to food stamps through age 5 leads to a 0.4 standard deviation reduction in metabolic syndrome and a 30 percentage point increase in reporting good health. Economic self-sufficiency is improved, but not significantly. The magnitudes are similar but somewhat smaller than the comparable results for the high impact sample. Further, as expected the main effect on food stamp exposure (effect implied for a group with a participation rate of 0) is very small and insignificant."}, {"section_title": "Does the Timing of Treatment Matter?", "text": "All the results thus far measure food stamp treatment as the share of time between conception and age 5 that food stamps is in place in your county of birth. There are two reasons to explore alternative specifications for exposure to the food stamps rollout. First, as discussed above, the nature of our treatment is such that the policy turns on and does not turn off.\nTherefore, when a child is treated in early life (e.g. age 0-5) they are also treated in later childhood. Our estimates, therefore, may be reflecting more exposure than previously considered which is important for interpreting the magnitudes of the effects. Second, the biological and economic literature is not clear on when exposure to the safety net matters. Thus exploring alternative specifications for food stamp exposure can provide new evidence on this important issue. For this and the remainder of the results we return to the high impact sample.\nTo explore the timing of food stamp exposure more systematically, and to evaluate the validity of the research design, we also estimate an event study model. In particular, these estimates allow us to explore non-parametrically the relationship between age at initial rollout and adult outcomes. In addition, we can use these results to rule out the presence of pre-(or post-) trends that could lead to spurious findings. Specifically, we allow for the impact of FSP We estimate a version of model (1) where the main FSP effect (FSP cb ) is replaced with a series of dummies for whether the program was first implemented 5 or more years prior to birth, 4 or 3 years prior to birth, 2 or 1 year prior to birth, at birth or at age 1, at age 2 or 3, age 4 or 5, and so on up to age 12 or later."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "We present results for metabolic syndrome index in Figure 4 .\nNote that these are the reverse of a typical event study graph, in that negative \"event time\" is the case where a person was fully treated (food stamps was in place in their county prior to birth).\nFurther, treatment (exposure to the program) increases as we move from the right (treated in later life) to the left (treated in early life).\nWhile we do not have a strong prediction about the precise shape of the treatment effects, our hypothesis is that the impact of the FSP treatment should decline as age at initial exposure increases. Or to state the reverse, the younger the initial age of exposure the larger the (cumulative) effect of the FSP. If exposure in later childhood does not matter, then the event study coefficients should be flat on the right end of the graph (suggesting no \"pre-trend\").\nEventually, once we hit the point in early childhood when exposure matters, a movement left (towards earlier initial exposure) should reduce the metabolic syndrome index. Eventually, the event study should be flat once exposure is \"complete\" (exposure is prior to conception or an event time of -1 or before).\nThe results in Figure 4 are highly consistent with these predictions and quite encouraging for our research design. They show that the largest effects of the food stamp treatment (in this 31 The omitted coefficient is for exposure at age 10-11, so all results are relative to exposure at that age.\ncase a reduction in metabolic syndrome is good and so a beneficial effect is represented by a negative impact) are to those who are treated in utero and early childhood. The improvement in health is steepest with additional exposure between conception and age 4 or 5. The results suggest that the adult health impacts of the FSP are minimal if the child is exposed after age 5. It is notable that for negative event time (fully exposed) the line is flat (and similarly that it is flat across older ages)-this is an important result that can rule out that our estimates are identified by cohort trends within counties. Table 9 explores the issue of timing in the regression setting. Column 1 repeats the base specification for metabolic syndrome, from Table 2 column 1. In the second column, we add a second exposure variable for the share of months between age 6 and 18 that the adult was exposed to food stamps. Consistent with the results in Figure 4 , the 6-18 coefficient is small and statistically insignificant; and its addition does not change the magnitude of the coefficient on the early child exposure. In the third column, we include a dummy for whether food stamps was available when the adult was in utero (specifically, we look whether the program is in place at conception). The biological and economic literature predicts that we should see benefits to exposure in utero. The estimate on in utero exposure is -0.11, implying that exposure in utero reduces metabolic syndrome. These results are not conclusive (the p-value is 0.13) and, along with the basic trends illustrated in Figure 1 , suggest that we don't have the power to separately identify the in utero and share of childhood impacts. The remaining three columns repeat these specifications for economic self-sufficiency. The results in column 5 suggest that food stamp exposure in both early and later childhood is beneficial to adult economic outcomes. This is consistent with a story where by children with better nutrition gain more from school which translates into higher economic self-sufficiency. The basic patterns-effects on metabolic syndrome result from pre-and early post-natal exposure whereas the effects on economic selfsufficiency result from childhood exposure-are an important result from the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we present new evidence that expanding resources in utero and in early childhood can lead to significant improvement in adult health. In particular, we use the rollout of the most important cash or near cash safety net in the U.S., the food stamp program. We find that access to food stamps in utero and in early childhood leads to significant reductions in metabolic syndrome conditions (obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes) in adulthood and, for women, increases in economic self-sufficiency (increases in educational attainment, earnings, income, and decreases in welfare participation). Further, we provide new evidence on when exposure to additional resources matters-the gains are large an increasing with exposure to age 5. Beyond that point the additional resources do not translate into improved adult health outcomes. These results pass several robustness tests including controlling for other county-year of birth controls for the Great Society period, a placebo test, and event study models.\nGiven the near-cash nature of food stamp vouchers (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009) , the exact biological mechanisms that lead to the long run improvement in health and human capital is not clear. The availability of food stamps leads to more food consumption Schanzenbach 2009, Currie 2003) and thus one clear channel is through an increase in nutrition in the critical in utero and early life period. Additionally, recent work suggests that additional income can lead to reductions in cortisol in mothers, reducing biological harm due to persistent stress (Aizer, Stroud, and Buka, 2009, Evans and Garthwaite 2011) .\nBecause \"long-term impacts can only be estimated for cohorts treated a long time ago,\" an intrinsic challenge is how to \"generalize estimates of long-term effects to current policies\" (Ludwig and Miller, 2007) . Some have argued birth weight is a relatively good proxy for the long-term effect of early life health conditions (Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2007) . If birth weight was a \"sufficient statistic\" for early life exposure, this would facilitate more timely evaluations of shocks and treatments. However, evidence from Dutch famine suggests otherwise: the cohort showing the largest birth weight decrease was exposed to famine later in pregnancy, while the larger long-term morbidity effects appear for the cohort exposed to famine earlier in pregnancy (Painter et al. 2005) . Similarly, Kelly (2009) Moreover, our analysis finds effects for food stamp exposure through early childhood.\nThus, although in previous work we found that the FSP increased birth weight (Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011), the evidence presented here show that it is unlikely this is the only or primary mechanism by which food stamps affects long run outcomes. 1956 1958 1960 1962 1964 1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 FSP age 0-5 Notes: The figure plots coefficients from an event-study analysis.
