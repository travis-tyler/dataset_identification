Continue tracking the reasons for nonresponse every year, until the response rate reaches 85 percent. Impact: Additional nonresponse data will enable NASS to statistically determine if particular nonresponse reasons are state specific, regional and/or national. This will also provide information needed to assess and target those aspects of the data collection process (questionnaire design, survey promotion, data collection, etc\u2026.) requiring improvement.\nFollow up (by office staff) with field enumerator supervisors to prevent any instances of questionnaires not being completed due to an unmanageable workload. Impact: Potential to improve overall response rates which equates to improved estimates. iv 6. Follow up with the operators of agricultural operations providing reasons for refusing to participate in the JAS such as: \"The respondent feels that surveys and reports hurt the farmer more than help,\" \"I will have nothing to do with the Government,\" \"Mentions a specific grievance with the FO or NASS (other than confidentiality),\" and \"Does not believe in statistics, so will not complete an interview.\" Recommend State Directors directly contact these operators via site visit, telephone, and/or mail to discuss the operator's feelings on these matters and to explain the importance of NASS estimates and publications.

NASS conducts hundreds of surveys annually for the purpose of making estimates on crops and livestock, exploring production practices, and identifying economic trends. The June Area Survey (JAS) is an annual survey that provides information on U.S. crops, livestock, grain storage capacity, and number, type, and size of farms. The JAS sample is comprised of designated land areas (segments). A typical segment is about one square mile --equivalent to 640 acres. Each segment is outlined on an aerial photo and provided to NASS field interviewers (enumerators). Field enumerators visit these segments, locate and interview the operator(s) of any land found to have agricultural activity, and record all agricultural activity associated with the operator on a paper questionnaire. A separate paper questionnaire is completed for each agricultural operation operating any land within the segment."}, {"section_title": "Problem: Response Rates for the June Area Survey Are Declining", "text": "Over time, the JAS' response rate has been gradually decreasing by about half a percentage point a year. In 1996, the national response rate was 87.9 percent. By 2007, the response rate had dropped to 81.7 percent. See Tables 11 and 12 in Section 10 for historic U.S. response rates. If this trend continues, the JAS' national response rate will fall below 80 percent within three to four years. Once below 80 percent, a nonresponse bias study will be required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). During this study, the June Area Survey's response rate fell to 80.2 percent, further emphasizing the importance of nonresponse reduction efforts and making the timeliness and importance of the study critical. There are three types of survey nonresponse: 1) refusals, 2) inaccessibles, and 3) incompletes. Refusals are operators who are not willing to respond or participate in the survey. Inaccessibles occur when field enumerators are unable to contact or reach the operators for data collection. A questionnaire is considered incomplete if at least one of the questions is not answered. Overall, survey nonresponse negatively impacts the resulting survey estimates, increases survey costs and data collection time, and significantly complicates the data editing and summarization processes. Nonresponse also increases the potential for biasing the estimates in a way that can not be easily assessed or accounted for."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Research", "text": "Focal points of recent nonresponse research have included the 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase III in Louisiana (Gerling, Tran, & Earp, 2008) and a test study on five states participating in the 2007 June Area Survey (Gerling, Tran, & Earp, 2008).

For inaccessibles, the field enumerator was to document why the operator could not be contacted. 3.) For incompletes, the field enumerator would record why the operator did not answer specific questions. 4.) In all three cases, field enumerators were instructed to review a supplemental handout listing various nonresponse reasons, each of which had a corresponding code number.

For inaccessibles, the field enumerators were instructed to code the reasons for the nonresponse on the questionnaires. The reasons for questionnaires being coded inaccessible are shown in Table 4. There were 376 questionnaires recorded as inaccessible for which the field enumerators failed to record a reason. These reports were removed from the analysis. An additional 1,544 reports were cited as \"Inaccessible but no reason provided.\" This reason may be valid for refusals but not for inaccessibles. For these instances to occur, the field enumerators failed to record the reason why they could not contact the operator. This provides additional support for the earlier recommendation of the statisticians overseeing the survey to emphasize the importance of collecting and recording reasons for questionnaires being recorded as inaccessible. Excluding \"Inaccessible, but no reason given,\" the number one reason for questionnaires being coded as inaccessible was \"Tried several times; but could not reach anyone for an appointment.\" In all, 173 instances (five percent of all inaccessibles) were coded inaccessible because the field enumerator's heavy workload prevented contacting these operators.

These field offices' Directors, Deputies and/or statisticians overseeing the survey were contacted. The Kentucky Field Office believes that keeping field enumerator workloads at or under 10 segments each is very important. Pre-screening of probable non-agricultural segments and new segments is also conducted ahead of time, although no interviews take place until the official data collection start date. Low turnover of field enumerator staff is also beneficial. Training is conducted by a mix of field enumerator supervisors, office staff, and sometimes a guest speaker. Field enumerator supervisors also work with new field enumerators before the workshop so that the survey is not completely new when training commences. The Mississippi Field Office runs a competition among the various field enumerator supervisors and their enumerator staffs. A small prize is given out to the group having the overall best response rate. If an enumerator encounters a refusal, a different enumerator is sent out to try to obtain a completed report. The office typically does not conduct any pre-survey work, believing that the element of surprise obtains better results. Also, a field enumerator is given the same segments/land area to enumerate from year to year. Several of the enumerators also have an agricultural background and have collected data for NASS for many years. More survey work is allocated to those with the best productivity. The Mississippi Field Office feels that having a positive attitude and knowing agriculture and the questionnaire makes the difference. West Virginia's enumerators are very similar to Mississippi's. However, West Virginia holds mini-training workshops and relies primarily on the field enumerator supervisors to instruct the field enumerator staff. They also practice ways to greet a respondent, how to start off an interview and just simply how to be likeable. Also, a personalized thank-you note is sent thanking the operator for his/her participation. The Pennsylvania Field Office tries to have a field enumerator cover the same operations/land areas from year to year. They feel that this creates a rapport that stimulates participation. The field training is conducted differently by having each enumerator complete a mocked segment at the workshop. The supervisory field enumerators are the primary instructors with field office staff providing assistance and additional feedback. This replaces the standard (classroom style) training method of reviewing each section of the questionnaire, with office staff being the primary instructors. The Florida Field Office feels that the first of two primary reasons for a turnaround in their response rates is the availability of an on-line database of Florida land owners. This is openly available and provides the field enumerator with a good contact to start with. The second is the use of Info USA's telephone number finder called Powerfinder. The Florida Field Office staff feels that this software provides a more current telephone number than what is on the list frame. Florida only has a small number of segments (100). This is viewed as a negative in that it's especially crucial that each segment is completed since those that are estimated could have a large negative impact on the estimates. On the upside, this small number provides for more easily manageable workloads, while still providing the six supervisory field enumerators with enough work to do a thorough job. These supervisory field enumerators are generally 50+ years of age and have an agricultural background. Supervisory field enumerators attend a one day training workshop by office staff. They then take what they learned and train their own field enumerators. Based on this information, the authors suggest that field offices below the 80 percent threshold reach out to their fellow field offices having a good response rate and try to implement techniques that are working in those high response rate states. Also, at the next NASS Management Conference, consider having a session conducted by those field offices with high response rates to share what they are doing to maintain/improve their response rates."}, {"section_title": "FIRE UP RESPONSE", "text": "Fire Up Response is a training course developed by NASS for training field enumerators on how to handle potential nonresponse situations.

Therefore, the authors recommend updating, formalizing, and implementing the Fire Up Response training in those states with lower response rates and measure whether the training has any effect on them."}, {"section_title": "LESSONS LEARNED", "text": "For future nonresponse studies, the statistician overseeing the survey needs to re-emphasize to the field enumerators the importance of collecting reasons for the nonresponse.

Implementation of the recommendations will not completely solve the deterioration of response rates; however, it is a step in the right direction. The recommendations proposed are also not limited to the JAS but can be implemented on NASS' 400 other surveys where practical. During the writing of this report, response rates for the 2009 June Area Survey were published. The overall response rate improved 1.8 percentage points to 82.0 percent, with the majority of improvement in the area of inacccessibles. This upswing in response rates may be due, at least in part, to this research project causing a greater awareness of nonresponse and the importance of improving response rates. Also, requiring the field enumerators to write the reason for a questionnaire being marked as inaccessible might have given the field enumerators more incentive to complete those interviews that required a little more work than normal to complete. In the future, the Research and Development Division will continue to work with field offices and NASS' Survey Administration Branch in studying nonresponse to effectively increase future response rates.      --\"I do not like surveys / I do not do surveys.\" 9 6.1 \"I just did a survey for someone else.\" 1 0.7 The respondent feels that surveys and reports hurt the farmer more than help."}, {"section_title": "--", "text": "Does not want to report due to legal / financial problems.        interview.\nThe operator called the office after reviewing the presurvey letter, and asked not to be contacted further.\nKnown refusal, no contact attempted. 5 9.8 Would not keep appointments. --Wants to be paid for interview time. --Does not believe in statistics, so will not complete an interview. --\"I just did a different survey for your office.\" 2 3.9 Does not think the information is kept confidential. --Violent / threatening refusal. --Feels the survey items are too complex -too much recollection is involved. --\"I do not like surveys / I do not do surveys.\" 2 3.9 Mentions a specific grievance with the FO or NASS (other than confidentiality). --Does not want to talk about farming --Spouse / secretary /etc. will not let the enumerator see the operator. --\"I will have nothing to do with the Government.\" 2 3.9 \"My farm is too small to count / too small to be representative\". --Quitting farming --Does not want to report due to legal / financial problems. --\"You contact me too often\" 1 2.0 I did this survey before, but not again. --Out of business now, will not answer for previous year. --Will do other surveys, but not financial surveys. --Family illness / death. 1 2.0 \"I just did a survey for someone else.\" -- Figures for the previous year were not typical.\nQuestionnaire was not sent to the field to avoid jeopardizing cooperation on other surveys. --  Contact attempted, but respondent refuses on all surveys, and refused this one.\nThe respondent feels the operation's records are inadequate to complete the interview. -- The operator called the office after reviewing the presurvey letter, and asked not to be contacted further. \nThe respondent feels that surveys and reports hurt the farmer more than help. --\"My farm is too small to count / too small to be representative\".\nThe operator called the office after reviewing the presurvey letter, and asked not to be contacted further.  \nThe respondent feels that surveys and reports hurt the farmer more than help. --\"My farm is too small to count / too small to be representative\".
