[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Rivers deliver an annual average of 1.25 Sv (1 Sv= ) of freshwater to the ocean (Durack, 2015). These inputs, however, have much larger impacts on oceanic dynamics than would be guessed based on their volume flux alone. Riverine freshwater lowers surface salinity and introduces stratification that can reduce mixed layer thickness, modify currents, and influence air-sea interaction. Coles et. al. (2013) show that the Amazon River freshwater has pathways into the western tropical and subtropical gyres of the North Atlantic. In the Bay of Bengal, the summer monsoon induced riverine discharge can inhibit the air-sea heat exchange by decreasing the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) to build a barrier layer (Vinayachandran, et al., 2002). Such impacts on ocean salinities and stratification depend on how riverine freshwater initially enters the ocean (Hordoir, et al., 2008). In nature, estuaries transform river inputs before they enter the ocean. Tides and other processes (e.g. winds) generate shear-driven mixing and internal wave breaking entrains saltwater into the fresher layer (Dyer, 1998). This mixing and entrainment drives an estuarine exchange flow (or gravitational circulation) that draws saltwater into estuaries; the saltwater ultimately exits along with riverine freshwater as a mixed (non-zero salinity) outflow to the coastal ocean (e.g. MacCready and Geyer, 2010). Estuaries and their mixing processes have spatial scales below that which can be explicitly represented in Earth system models (ESMs) with horizontal resolutions typically 100 km or coarser. This study develops and applies an Estuary Box Model (EBM) to represent estuarine processes in ESMs. It provides a physically-based method for introducing riverine freshwater to the model ocean without significantly increasing computational time."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "In ESMs the riverine discharge is usually introduced into the ocean component with zero salinity; implicitly neglecting any estuary mixing or exchange. In addition, instead of applying the freshwater inflow as a horizontal flux entering through the coastal boundary, the riverine freshwater is often applied to the ocean surface as a vertical flux of \"augmented precipitation\" over a specified ocean region (often hundreds of kilometers wide) surrounding the actual river mouth (Griffies, et al., 2005 andTseng, et al., 2016). Some models such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) employ the virtual salt flux (VSF) formulation that handles river inputs (and precipitation) by removing salt from the ocean surface instead of adding freshwater volume. The VSF for rivers is calculated by multiplying the freshwater volume flux with a reference salinity that is usually taken as a global constant (e.g. 34.7 PSU in the CESM) in order to assure global salt conservation. Yin, et al. (2010), and Tseng, et al. (2016) show the limitations of the global reference salinity and use a local reference salinity instead. These studies also distribute the riverine freshwater vertically over several layers or enhance horizontal mixing at river mouths to diffuse the freshwater horizontally. The Tseng, et al. (2016) sensitivity study shows that ocean model results strongly depend on the river input methods and finds that CESM can be run successfully without the large spreading regions typically used. All these methods omit the important natural physical processes that fresh riverine runoff will be pre-mixed with saltier oceanic water within estuaries, rather than discharged into ocean with zero salinity. Garvine and Whitney (2006) made a first attempt to parameterize the estuarine mixing processes for climate models. They built an estuary box model based on the potential energy anomaly concept introduced by Simpson et. al. (1990) and compared results to observations for the Delaware Bay. Rice et. al. (2008) added a two-layer formulation to this box model. Hordoir, et. al. (2008) implemented a shelf box model based on the idea of potential energy anomaly (in NEMO, Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) that reproduced the coastal overturning on the Mekong shelf for both upwelling-and downwelling-favorable winds. Herzfeld (2015) developed a numerical method to introduce the riverine freshwater input and include upper and lower layer exchange by considering estuary salt wedge adjustment that is most appropriate for highly stratified estuaries with weak tides and/or strong river discharge. MacCready and Geyer (2010) summarize up-to-date estuarine mixing parameterizations in their review paper. Their review provides the theoretical basis and parameterizations that support the development of the new EBM that represents the essential influence of estuarine exchange flow. In this study we focus on the formulation of a new EBM and its calibration and validation against observations for a well-observed estuary systemthe Columbia River. We additionally demonstrate the practicality of its application in ESMs, and make an initial assessment of its impact in a global simulation with the CESM. A more thorough analysis of impacts on the global climate, the sensitivity to parameter choices within the EBM, and broader comparisons with observations will be addressed in subsequent studies."}, {"section_title": "Estuary Box Model development", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Configuration", "text": "The EBM is a two-layer rectangular box with constant width (W), constant total depth (H), and time-varying length (L) ( Figure 1). Each layer has a constant thickness (h and H-h for the lower and upper layers, respectively) and a vertically uniform (but horizontally varying) salinity and density; thus, the estuary model water column is vertically piecewise constant. The salinity and density are allowed to vary horizontally to better represent horizontal gradients in salinities at the mouth boundary; the domain including the EBM and connecting ocean model has a horizontally piecewise continuous salinity solution. L is the landward extent of the lower-layer saltwater intrusion that adjusts to forcing conditions; this estuary length adjustment allows for simplifications later and better represents estuarine dynamics (MacCready and Geyer, 2010).

Oceanic saltwater flows into the EBM through the mouth lower layer ( ); note that is negative. Tidal pumping (e.g. MacCready, 2007) can drive a net horizontal salt flux into the mouth upper layer. The tidal pumping results from differences in salt advection during flood and ebb, which can be modeled as a diffusive flux in subtidal analysis (averaged over tidal variations).

The comparison data are the ROMS results for 2005.

For the estuarine outflow salinity (Figure 4 a), EBM has a RMSE of 3.11, r 2 of 0.54 and bias of -1.33 PSU. The agreement can be increased by changing the mixing coefficients to find the best-fit EBM solution for ROMS, but this was not done as the coefficients already are set based on observations. The EBM includes the spring-neap cycles of the outflow salinity, although their amplitudes are smaller than in ROMS. In general, the lower-layer inflow salinity has much smaller variations than the upperlayer outflow salinity which has considerable variability associated with tides and river discharge. A couple of shelf freshening events in March and May cause drops of EBM outflow salinity that are not shown in the ROMS simulation. The mismatch is attributed to the EBM steady state salt balance that does not allow for a delayed and smoothed response to sudden forcing changes seen in nature (MacCready, 1999) (MacCready, 2007 and the ROMS results. This is not a major limitation in ESMs since periods of interest are usually seasonal to multi-decadal variability and estuary response generally occurs over shorter time scales. The outflow volume fluxes from EBM matches well with ROMS results (Figure 4 b (Figure 4 c and d). It indicates that the EBM works well for long-period or low-frequency forcing. As the high frequency forcing is filtered out, estuaries tend to achieve a quasi-steady-state balance that is well represented by EBM steady-state dynamics. Thus, the EBM can work well in the ESMs even though it neglects the short-term estuary adjustment."}, {"section_title": "Applying the EBM globally", "text": "One challenge to implementing the EBM in an ESM is specifying parameters for all estuaries globally. The Dai and Trenberth (2002) dataset shows that the 20 largest rivers (the global top 20) contribute to over 60% of total global riverine freshwater runoff into the oceans. The Amazon River alone accounts for almost 25% of total global discharge. Many of the largest rivers have been well studied, therefore observational data and/or regional simulations exist to calibrate EBM mixing parameters and set box geometry. The Columbia River is a good example that has both observational and simulation data. Smaller rivers in the dataset have smaller individual contributions on freshwater discharge, but their summation is significant globally and their individual inputs are important locally. Many of these rivers do not have enough data to calibrate EBM parameters. A short path to get the EBM working for these rivers is to find a universal relationship between riverine forcing and estuarine response. Hansen and Rattray (1966) developed the stratification-circulation diagram to quantitatively classify estuaries. They found that scaled stratification (the top-to-bottom salinity difference divided by the sectional mean) in the estuary depends on the densimetric Froude number . In general, the stratification increases with rising Froude number. The EBM can be parameterized for the rivers outside of global top 20 in an ESM, so that their outflow salinities (and mouth stratification) follow this general trend. The original scaled stratification is modified to for application at the EBM mouth. Geyer (2010) applied observations from 13 estuaries ( Figure 5), and shows that the bulk stratification rises with increasing densimetric Froude number. Geyer (2010) includes two scalings to predict stratification, but they overestimate stratification for estuaries with high densimetric Froude numbers and do not asymptote to the completely stratified limit. The EBM is set up with a uniform box frame with H=10 m and h=5 m. The mixing parameters of the EBM are then optimized to get the smallest RMSE for all with observation points on Figure 5. The width scales out of the solution when expressed in terms of the densimetric Froude number; consequently, the width does not need to be specified. One EBM run includes tidal pumping with and the other neglects tidal pumping by setting to zero. The EBM solutions follow the general trend of the observations. EBM solutions with or without tidal pumping both converge and asymptote to complete stratification at high flow conditions with larger riverine densimetric Froude numbers. In the lower Froude number region, the EBM with tidal pumping has less stratification, because the tidal pumping helps to increase the estuarine outflow salinity. These results encourage the global application of the EBM and indicate that even the solution without tidal pumping works well. They provide a basis for generic EBM parameters that can be applied even if there is not enough information to set estuary-specific values."}, {"section_title": "EBM test in global climate model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CESM and EBM settings", "text": "The EBM is implemented and tested in the ocean component POP2 of the CESM version 1.1.1 with nominal 1\u02da horizontal resolution. POP2 has 60 vertical z-levels with 10 m resolution in the first levels and is stretched to 250 m resolution for the deepest ocean. For the runs discussed here, the ocean and sea-ice components are active, while the atmospheric component and river freshwater input are decoupled and prescribed with the 1948-2007 COREII forcing (Large and Yeager, 2009;Griffies et al, 2009). The model is run for 60 years (one cycle of the forcing), and the climatological averages of the last 30 years' results are used for evaluations. The EBM parameters are specified individually for each of the global top 20 rivers ( Table 2). The total depth (H) is either picked from literature or calculated from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) data set (IOC, et al., 2003) as the root mean square depth in the selected estuary area. The width (W) of the box at its mouth is either from literature or measured from the Google Earth Pro v.7.1.2.2041 with its Line Ruler tool. If there is more than one channel connecting to the ocean, the box width is taken as the combined width of the channels. The lower-layer thickness is taken as half the total depth for all rivers. The mixing parameters ( and ) of the EBM for top 20 rivers are individually optimized to match the observed outflow salinity with MATLAB function \"fminsearch\" (Lagarias, et al., 1998) in offline integrations. The 60-year-averaged monthly discharge of each individual river is taken from the Dai and Trenberth (2002) database. The annual mean of Mean High Water (MHW) level is regenerated from the Regional and Local Tidal Solutions of the OSU Tidal Data Inversion (Egbert & Erofeeva, 2002), literature studies, or NOAA buoys. Finally, the optimized mixing parameters are found by minimizing the RMSE between the calculated annual mean outflow salinity and comparison data from published observations or regional numerical studies. The studies used to determine the mixing parameters are listed in Table 2. For other rivers, outside of the top 20, the default EBM has a common depth of 10 m and the mouth width of 2 km. The mixing parameters are from the generic fit described in the previous section ( Figure 5). The contribution of tidal pumping in the default EBM is neglected. Three test cases (VSFEBM, VSFROF, and VSFSPRD, where \"VSF\" indicates the virtual salt flux coupling method) are used to illustrate the effects of estuary exchange in POP2. The EBM is implemented in the VSFEBM case for all rivers in POP2. The VSFROF is a comparison case in which the EBM exchange circulation is not implemented and the same runoff (\"ROF\") is applied, so only riverine freshwater convergence term ( ) is included (Eqn. 21). The layer thicknesses for coupling with CESM are (spanning the top two grid levels) and (spanning the next two grid levels) ( "}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of CESM results", "text": "The sea surface salinity (SSS) of the VSFEBM case and differences from other cases are shown in Figure 6. Fresh regions are evident near all major river mouths. There are large differences between the VSFEBM and VSFSPRD cases that exceed 1 PSU in many areas near major rivers (the SSS difference even exceeds 7 PSU near the Amazon River mouth) (Figure 7). VSFEBM and VSFROF are fresher than VSFSPRD adjacent to river mouths because runoff from each river is focused at one point. Introducing river inputs over large spreading regions in VSFSPRD is one reason VSFEBM and VSFROF are saltier at most other points offshore of major rivers. Also the offshore SSS is higher in VSFEBM and VSFROF because of the direct effects of vertically distributing the river inputs over a thicker layer (instead of immediately at the surface), and riverine freshwater VSF differences due to the local (instead of global) reference salinity. SSS at river mouths are further increased in VSFEBM due to the upwelling of saltier waters via estuary exchange flow VSF convergence (Eqn. 21). Indirect effects arise from coastal stratification and circulation changes as well as advection by ocean currents that transports salinity differences to remote areas (especially in the North Atlantic and Arctic) (Tseng, et al., 2016). Comparison between VSFEBM and VSFROF isolates the effects of introducing estuary exchange. VSFEBM is saltier at river runoff points because of the vertical salt flux imposed by EBM. VSFEBM is also (approximately 0.1 PSU) saltier in many coastal regions. There are, however, several regions where SSS is lower in VSFEBM; remote freshening (< 0.05 PSU) spreads into the North Atlantic that is linked to the St. Lawrence and the Amazon. The freshening relative to VSFROF is counterintuitive and is linked to secondary effects resulting from modifications to stratification, ocean currents, and the local reference salinities (that evolve differently in the two cases) used in the riverine freshwater VSF calculation. Similar freshening occurs for the Changjiang, Bay of Bengal, and Kara Sea ( Figure 6). Overall, the CESM case comparison indicates significant local, regional, and even global sensitivity to including estuarine dynamics. The Columbia and Amazon Rivers provide examples of model sensitivity to the treatment of river inputs. The SSS is freshest close to the coast near both rivers (Figure 7). As mentioned, VSFEBM is fresher than VSFSPRD and saltier than VSFROF at the focused runoff points. For the Columbia, these same differences extend along the coast. Farther away from the coast, VSFEBM is saltier than VSFSPRD for both river regions due to the horizontal spreading of runoff in VSFSPRD and other factors mentioned above. The differences between VSFEBM and VSFROF in the Columbia show the anticipated higher SSS originating from the exchange flow VSF convergence imposed by estuary circulation. Near the Amazon, VSFEBM has lower salinities than VSFROF due to the secondary effects described above; the influence of the Amazon contributes to differences throughout the North Atlantic. Salinity stratification near the river mouth changes among cases (Figure 8). VSFEBM is less stratified than VSFROF and removes the problematic near-bottom salinity overshoot (>45 PSU) near the Amazon and other large rivers that otherwise occurs for focused river inputs. The salinity overshooting is also found by Tseng, et al. (2016) in the sensitivity tests of the riverine freshwater input approaches. In this previous study, the salinity over-and under-shooting occur at river mouths with large runoff and intensify as the horizontal spreading area for riverine freshwater inputs is decreased. The estuary exchange flow imposed by the EBM avoids large salinity numerical artifacts without having to impose arbitrarily large horizontal spreading regions as in VSFSPRD. The modeled salinity profiles are further compared with salinity climatology from high resolution (0.25-degree) World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA) (Zweng, et al., 2013); the nearestneighbor point to the corresponding POP grid cell are used. The spatial filtering in WOA (Zweng, et al., 2013) tends to create a positive salinity bias in the coastal ocean, especially in the regions close to the riverine freshwater sources, because typically higher offshore salinities contribute to the filtered coastal salinity values. The native World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD) salinities also are averaged within each POP T-grid cell to avoid the influence of spatial filtering. The model vertical salinity profiles at Columbia River mouth are plotted against corresponding WOA and WOD profiles (Figure 8 a). None of model results agree with climatologies through the entire water column, but VSFSPRD surface salinities are closer to the spatially filtered WOA and the other cases are closer to WOD. There are no WOD data available for the Amazon River mouth T-grid cell and the WOA has a surface salinity (at z=0) without any subsurface data; therefore no profile comparison can be made. The sensitivity analysis in this paper has focused on long-term mean salinity fields, but seasonal cycles also are important. The seasonal SSS cycle (represented as monthly averages over the 30year analysis period) at Columbia, Amazon, Brahmaputra and St. Lawrence river mouths are plotted for the three CESM testing runs (Figure 9). For all four rivers, there are clear seasonal cycles that vary among the runs. The VSFSPRD case has higher salinities because the river inputs are spread over large areas (as previously described) and a seasonal cycle that can be larger (e.g. Amazon), smaller (e.g. Columbia and Brahmaputra), or similar (e.g. St. Lawrence) to the other cases. It is counterintuitive that the Amazon cycle is largest in the VSFSPRD case, but the contributing factors include no vertical spreading of the strong river runoff, changes related to the reference salinity for VSF calculation, and interactions with the ambient ocean currents. In all four rivers, the VSFEBM case has higher SSS than the VSFROF case due to the vertical salt flux imposed by estuarine exchange flows (as previously described), but the seasonal cycles are quite similar. The Brahmaputra River is discharged into the Bay of Bengal where the SSS varies strongly with monsoon seasonal wind. High-resolution ROMS results in Jana, et al. 2015 The modeled annual SSS cycles at the four river mouths discussed above are also compared with WOA and WOD climatologies in the single T-grid cell (Figure 9). For the Columbia, the SSS cycle for VSFSPRD is closer to WOA then other two cases, but all cases have much smaller SSS cycle amplitude than WOD (with a different timing). There are no WOD data available within the T-cell adjacent to the Amazon mouth, and the nearest WOA grid does not have subsurface salinity to make fair comparisons with POP SSS at 5m. At the Brahmaputra River mouth, VSFSPRD is closest to WOA though the WOA amplitude is somewhat larger. The other runs are closer to the large salinity range indicated by WOD with its spiky oscillation of SSS during February to May and low salinity in October. At St. Lawrence River lower estuarine mouth, all runs are considerably fresher than the WOA and WOD salinities (VSFSPRD has the smallest different and VSFROF has the largest difference). It is worth noting that some of the SSS mismatch can be attributed to a mismatch between model runoff location and the natural riverine freshwater distribution (e.g. Saucier et al., 2003). Overall, the comparisons among model results and climatology are not conclusive. There is a tendency for VSFSPRD and WOA to be closer to each other, but this is likely because the spreading of river inputs in the model and the spatial filtering radius in WOA both smooth the sharpness of the riverine freshwater fronts near the river mouths and increase coastal salinities. VSFROF and VSFEBM have the capacity to include the lower salinities and larger annual cycles indicated by WOD, but it is hard to distinguish which run is better by these comparisons alone. It is also worth noting that differences between the WOA and WOD are at least as large as the differences among model runs. This suggests a need for an improved global climatology that pays particular attention to coastal salinities. Though the model-climatology comparisons are inconclusive, the VSFEBM configuration includes estuarine processes and therefore more of the physics governing river inputs to the ocean."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Adding the estuarine exchange flows in POP2 also has impacts on the climate process beyond the costal oceans. It is shown that SSS decreases in North Atlantic and increases in the Pacific, Indian, South Atlantic, and Southern Oceans, although the change is smaller than in coastal regions (Figure 6 c). Ongoing testing (not shown here) suggests that including the EBM in the fully-coupled CESM may reduce ice formation in the Labrador Sea and can alter the Indian Ocean Dipole. In the current study, the EBM is only applied to salinity, but it will be useful to extend the approach to temperature and biogeochemical tracers in the future. Including nutrient upwelling by estuary exchange flow, for instance, likely will have significant impacts on primary productivity in global climate models in some coastal regions and perhaps farther offshore. It would be best to also include parameterizations that represent the nonconservative biogeochemical transformations within estuaries. The EBM is designed for the specific needs of the coarse horizontal resolution climate ocean models with computational constraints. The EBM is physically-based and represents many of the essential estuarine processes. As mentioned in the introduction, Herzfeld (2015) developed a method that continuously adjusts to the landward propagation of an oceanic salt wedge into the estuary and then enforces zero net salt flux through the mouth and a net volume flux equaling river discharge. This solution does increase the salinity of the upper-layer flow from the estuary to the ocean, however it typically will have weaker exchange, be more stratified, and have a fresher upper-layer than the EBM solution since it does not include estuarine tidal mixing, a critically important factor in driving estuary exchange. It is worth mentioning that MacCready (2011) discusses an alternative approach to calculate estuarine exchange flow by using isohaline coordinates that could be incorporated into ocean models. It is important to note that highresolution hydrodynamic models of estuaries are able to better represent individual estuaries by including more complex geometries, flow-topography interactions (e.g. sills), wind-forced circulation, and other non-steady dynamics. Consequently, coupling hydrodynamic estuarine models within ESMs will provide a more complete representation of estuarine influences on the global ocean. The computational burden, however, would be far larger than the negligble calculation times for the EBM. In future studies, it will be worthwhile to compare results for the different strategies of representing estuarine processes in ESMs."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The The EBM is applied globally in POP2 for a CESM (sea-ice-ocean-only) run and compared to an otherwise identical case without estuary processes and a case with settings typical of prior studies. Comparisons indicate strong sensitivity to the treatment of rivers in CESM; there are significant local, regional, and remote effects. The EBM now is included as an option in CESM version 2. A future paper will compare CESM to an appropriate observational coastal climatology and explore dynamical changes introduced by rivers. same as the water that left the estuary during the preceding ebb. The net effect over a tidal cycle is oceanic water near the estuarine mouth is pumped into the estuary and some freshwater is ejected to the coastal ocean ( Figure A1). Tidal pumping drives a tidally-averaged salt mass (and salinity) flux and PE flux into estuary; it acts as a horizontal diffusive flux in the subtidal balances. MacCready (2004) parameterizes the horizontal diffusivity at mouth of the estuaries based on the tidal pumping concept. The EBM development also is parameterized by following this idea and the flood entrainment region is generalized to a semi-ellipse that accommodates both narrow mouths (previously considered) and wider mouths relative to the tidal excursion ( Figure A1). The tidal pumping derivation begins with specifying the jet-like water mass lost during ebb: . The water mass gained during flooding is: , where is the tidal excursion (specified below) and is the nonoverlapping area between the ebb jet and flood inflow zone. For simplicity, it is assumed that the oceanic inflow water (from the non-overlapping part of the flood inflow) has the same density as the water through the lower layer mouth. Note that the tidal exchange volume is the same for flood and ebb. The net mass change in one tidal cycle is: , with . The coefficient is the ratio of the nonoverlapping volume (of oceanic water) to the total ebb/flood exchange volume. The tidal excursion ( ) is defined in terms of the tidal current amplitude ( ) of the linear sinusoidal tidal wave with tidal period (Eqn. A1); is the distance water moves out from the estuary on ebb."}, {"section_title": "Eqn.
