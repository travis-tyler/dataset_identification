However, evidence on the association between SUA and arterial stiffness in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between SUA and arterial stiffness in PD patients.\nThe patients who performed vascular profiler test from January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2016, and with SUA values were enrolled. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by brachialankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). The relationship between SUA and baPWV was tested by multiple linear regression models. Results: Of 645 PD patients, mean SUA was 6.80 (\u00b11.29) mg/dL, mean baPWV was 1713 (\u00b1505) cm/s. In fully adjusted linear regression models, higher SUA was significantly associated with higher baPWV in young [standardized coefficients (\u03b2), 0.085; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.013 to 0.130; P=0.02] but not in elderly (\u03b2, -0.194; 95% CI, -0.774 to 0.093; P=0.1) PD patients. In gender-stratified models of young patients, there was a significant association between SUA and baPWV in male (\u03b2, 0.115; 95% CI, 0.015 to 0.182; P=0.02) but not in female. Male in the highest gender-specific SUA quartile had a higher baPWV than those in the lowest quartile (\u03b2, 0.132; 95% CI, 0.011 to 0.209; P=0.03). This gender difference was reversed when selecting male patients with lower SUA levels (quartile 1 and 2) and female patients with higher SUA levels (quartile 3 and 4). Conclusion: SUA was positively associated with baPWV in young PD patients, and this association was significant in males but not in females, which is possibly explained by the higher SUA level in males than in females."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Serum uric acid (SUA) is a well-known marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1] , which is the leading cause of death in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients [2] . Previous study from our PD center demonstrated that elevated SUA level was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in male but not female PD patients [3] . However, the underlying mechanisms linking SUA to cardiovascular mortality in PD patients remain uncertain.\nArterial stiffness is an indicator of distensibility and compliance of the vessels, and is more pronounced in dialysis patients compared with the general population [4] . Previous studies have reported that arterial stiffness was an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcome and number of hospitalizations for CVD in PD patients [5, 6] . Some scholars proposed that arterial stiffness could be one of the possible mechanisms by which hyperuricemia increases the risk of CVD through a pathway that involves changes in vascular elastic properties, hypertension and organ damage [7] . Many studies have investigated the relationship between SUA and arterial stiffness in various populations with inconsistent findings, including positive association [8] , gender-based association [9] or without association [10] . Nonetheless, this relationship has not been reported in PD patients.\nIn the review of previous studies, the relationship between SUA and arterial stiffness showed significant gender-specific differences [11] [12] [13] . We hypothesized that SUA is positively associated with arterial stiffness in PD patients, and this association is different between genders. Therefore, we conducted this cross-sectional study to evaluate the relationship between SUA and arterial stiffness, as measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), in prevalent PD patients, and gender-related differences were further tested."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "All continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients who underwent vascular profiler test at the PD center of The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China from January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2016 were included. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age \u2265 18 years at the time of vascular profiler test; survival for at least 90 days from the first PD therapy. Exclusion criteria: insertion of the PD catheter in other hospitals; transfer from permanent hemodialysis (\u2265 3 months) or failed renal transplantation; lack of SUA value.

Measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) was calculated from 24-h urine collections and indexed for the body surface area. CVD was defined as a history of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular event, and peripheral vascular disease [14] . The comorbidity score was determined according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index [15] . The values of baPWV were measured by a noninvasive automatic vascular profiler device BP-203RPE III (Omron, Japan) as our previously described [16] . The baPWV was calculated according to the following formula: baPWV=(La-Lb)/Tba, where La was the length from the suprasternal notch to the ankle, Lb was the length from the suprasternal notch to the brachium, and Tba was the time interval between the initial increase in brachial and ankle waveforms. The average value of bilateral baPWV values was used for analysis. Heart rate and blood pressure were also obtained by the same device. The average values of blood pressure of bilateral arms were used for analysis."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "The results of patient characteristics were expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables, and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables not normally distributed. The associations between SUA and baPWV in PD patients were examined by multiple linear regression models. Variables with P<0.05 in the univariate analysis were picked into multivariate adjusted model according to following principles: referring to previous literature, presenting clinical relevance, and avoiding multicollinearity. Thus, the final fully adjusted variables included age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, CVD, PD vintage, residual urine volume, heart rate, systolic pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum albumin, total cholesterol, intact parathyroid hormone, and uric acid-lowering agent use. To further assess the different associations with baPWV at different SUA levels, quartiles of SUA were also built using the lowest SUA quartile as the reference group. The results were expressed as standardized coefficient (\u03b2) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). All analyses in the present study were conducted using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient Characteristics", "text": "A total of 645 prevalent CAPD patients were eligible for present study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig. 1 ). The mean (\u00b1SD) age was 46.6\u00b113.8 years, 89.0% of patients were younger than 65 years, 56.6% of patients were men, 15.7% of patients were diabetic. The primary cause of end-stage renal disease was chronic glomerulonephritis (68.5%), the median PD vintage was 32 months (interquartile range 11 to 58 months). The mean (\u00b1SD) SUA was 6.80\u00b11.29 mg/dL, the mean baPWV value was 1713 cm/s (Table 1 ). All patients in our study received CAPD treatment. Conventional PD solutions (Dianeal 1.5%, 2.5% or 4.25% dextrose; Baxter Healthcare, Guangzhou, China), Y sets, and twin bag systems were used in all PD patients. Physiologic calcium peritoneal dialysate (Ca 2+ concentration = 1.25 mmol/L) was prescribed to all patients in our PD center. As expected, men had significantly higher SUA levels than women (6.95\u00b11.32 mg/dL versus 6.59\u00b11.24 mg/dL, P<0.001). While, there was no significant difference between genders in baPWV values (1715\u00b1505 cm/s versus 1710\u00b1505 cm/s, P=0.9).\nAssociation of SUA with baPWV At first, we tested the relationship between SUA and baPWV in total, male, and female patients, respectively. The results indicated that the association between SUA and baPWV was not significant in these patients (Table 2) . Since age is a strong determinant of (Table 3) .\nTo further dissect the association between SUA and baPWV, we stratified young patients in quartiles or gender-specific quartiles of SUA. In total or male young patients, a significant association between the highest quartile of SUA and baPWV was found in fully adjusted models (\u03b2, 0.086; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.142; P=0.04; \u03b2, 0.132; 95% CI, 0.011 to 0.209; P=0.03, respectively). In contract, the association between SUA and baPWV was not significant in female young patients (Table 3) . To evaluate whether the higher SUA level in male compared with female could explain this gender-specific difference, a sensitivity analyses were performed. According to a previous study higher SUA was associated with greater increase in carotid-femoral PWV in men but not women; this association was lost when men with SUA\u2265 6.2 mg/dL were not included [13] , accordingly genderspecific association between SUA and baPWV in our study might be changed by selecting male patients with lower SUA levels and female patients with higher SUA levels. We selected a sample in young PD patients including male in the SUA quartile 1 and 2 (SUA<6.88 mg/dL) and female in the SUA quartile 3 and 4 (SUA\u22656.50 mg/dL). This sample included 164 men and 123 women, with women having significantly higher SUA levels than men (7.58\u00b10.93 mg/dL versus 6.03\u00b10.69 mg/dL, P<0.001). In fully adjusted models, the association between SUA and baPWV became not statistically significant in men (\u03b2, 0.072; 95% CI, -0.068 to 0.241; P=0.3) but became statistically significant in women (\u03b2, 0.202; 95% CI, 0.064 to 0.371; P=0.006). "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the present cross-sectional study, we uncovered a significant and positive association between SUA and baPWV in young PD patients. Moreover, this association was significant in males but not in females, which possibly explained by the higher SUA level in males than in females.\nBoth elevated SUA level and increased arterial stiffness are common and are associated with adverse CVD outcome in PD patients [3, 5, 6] . Many previous studies have investigated the association of SUA with arterial stiffness with inconsistent results [18] . However, this association has not been reported in PD patients. In the present study, we found a positive association between SUA and baPWV in young PD patients. In line with our results, Mehta et al. reported that SUA was significantly associated with carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) in a younger Caucasian population, utilizing data from participants of the Generation 3 Framingham cohort [19] . However, another study analyzed the data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and found that higher SUA was associated with greater increase in cfPWV in community-dwelling elderly individuals [13] . Another study also reported that SUA was independently and positively associated with baPWV in elderly Chinese with metabolic syndrome components [20] . These different results may be explained by the following reasons.\n(1) Small sample size of elderly patients. Unlike above mentioned studies focused on elderly population, only 71 (11.0%) patients in present study were older than 65 years. (2) Effect of comorbidity. The study population of previous studies was relatively healthy and had no great comorbidity. However, in our study, elderly patients were more likely to be diabetic (35.2% versus 13.2%, P<0.001) and had higher proportion of CVD history (66.2% versus 39.7%, P<0.001). These comorbidities are associated with arterial stiffness and may weaken the association between SUA and baPWV. Furthermore, in the analysis of young PD patients, our data indicated that the association of SUA Table 3 . Gender-specific association of SUA with baPWV in young PD patients.\na Adjusted age, gender, BMI, diabetes, CVD, PD vintage, residual urine volume, heart rate, systolic pressure, HsCRP, serum albumin, total cholesterol, iPTH, and uric acid-lowering agent use. Abbreviations: 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; SUA, serum uric acid with baPWV was significant in male but not in female. Many previous studies have displayed this gender-related different association with inconsistent results, which might be related with study design and study population [11-13, 21, 22] . The gender-specific effect of SUA on baPWV we reported here might be due to the higher SUA levels in males. In fact, when we selected a sample of men with lower SUA levels, the significance of the association with baPWV was lost. Thus, it seems that there is a threshold effect for SUA on baPWV, and males cross that threshold more frequently than females. Besides, the duration of exposure to elevated SUA levels may be different between male and female, as SUA levels are generally lower before the menopause [23] . Estrogen is known to promote excretion of uric acid. Previous studies showed that lower SUA levels in female were due to the effect of estrogens on the postsecretory tubular reabsorption of uric acid [24, 25] . The possible mechanisms by which SUA accelerated arterial stiffness have been proposed as follows. First, uric acid stimulates inflammatory pathways by nuclear factor-\u03baB, Notch-1, and chemoattractant protein 1 signals [26, 27] . Second, uric acid increases production of reactive oxygen species and decreases the bioavailability of nitric oxide in vascular endothelial cells and induces endothelial dysfunction [27, 28] . Third, uric acid activates the local renin-angiotensin system [29] . Forth, uric acid may disturb the natural turnover of non-cross-linked soluble elastin, an important contributor of vascular stiffness [30] . In addition, SUA may interact with conventional and dialysis-specific risk factors in end-stage renal disease patients to promote arterial stiffness progression [31, 32] .\nThere are several advantages in the present study. This study is the first to reveal the association between SUA and arterial stiffness in PD patients. Recognized confounders for SUA and baPWV in the general population and dialysis patients were factored into multivariate linear regression models. However, we are also aware of limitations of this study. First, its cross-sectional design of the study did not allow us to determine a causal relationship. Second, the potential factors associated with SUA and baPWV were not fully investigated. Therefore, the effect of residual confounding cannot be eliminated completely. Third, the sample size of elderly patient in our study is small, so the association between SUA and baPWV in elderly PD patients needs further confirmation. Fourth, we used baPWV as an indicator of arterial stiffness. Generally, cfPWV is recognized as a \"gold standard\" for evaluating arterial stiffness. However, measurement of cfPWV is operator dependent and time consuming [33] . Alternatively, baPWV is a simple method, just requiring placement of blood pressure cuffs on arm and ankle, and has good reproducibility. It has been showed that baPWV was strongly related with cfPWV and exhibited similar extent of associations with CVD risk factors and clinical events, when compared with cfPWV [34, 35] . Finally, our study participants were all Chinese so our results may not apply to other ethnic groups."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our data indicated that higher SUA levels was significantly associated with increased baPWV in young PD patients, and this association was restricted to men. This result provides some insight into the mechanism linking SUA to mortality especially CVD mortality in PD patients. Further clinical trials are warranted to test weather lowering SUA levels would be beneficial to prevent arterial stiffness and subsequently CVD outcome."}]
