[{"section_title": "Summary", "text": "\u2022 In 2012, farm households reported receiving a total of $1.8 billion in lease and royalty income from energy production activities, making up about 1% of farm household total income. \u2022 Payments are highly concentrated, primarily on large farms and in the South and Midwest. \u2022 Though relatively few farms have energy lease and royalty income (3 percent), it can be an important source of income, particularly for older farmers; for farmers over 65 who receive royalty income, it is the largest single source of income."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Since 2000, U.S. energy production of oil, natural gas, and renewables has increased by 23 percent (US Energy Information Administration 2014), thanks largely to new technologies allowing extraction of gas and petroleum from shale deposits. Over the next 25 years, production of the three is projected to grow by 40 percent, with natural gas growing by over 50 percent. 1 [Insert map of shale play here] In 2011 the USDA began surveying farmers about income received from royalties or leases associated with energy production (e.g. natural gas, oil, and wind turbines). This study presents the results of the 2012 Agricultural Resources Management Survey (ARMS) from the USDA and is the first comprehensive look at income to farm households from energy leases and royalties. \u2022 In 2012, 3.3 percent of the 2 million farm households reported receiving any oil, gas, or wind (OGW) lease or royalty income, for a total of $1.8 billion. \u2022 Conditional on receiving lease or royalty income, the average annual payment was $27,456 (the median was $3,700)."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The ARMS data are cross-sectional and based on interviews with farm operators designed to solicit information about production practices, costs of production, business finances, and operator and household characteristics. We use Costs and Returns Report data, which collect financial information on the farm business and the operator's household. Royalty income includes royalties from oil, gas or wind. Royalty revenue is included in farm income."}, {"section_title": "Production profile of farms receiving royalties", "text": "\u2022 Farms receiving royalty income are larger than farms without royalty income as measured by average gross value of sales, acreage, and farm income and farm wealth. Farm size is correlated with geographic location as farm sizes in western and southern states with relatively more oil/gas are larger. \u2022 Nearly half of the farms receiving royalties specialized in beef cattle (48 percent). The next largest group was field crop specialists (20.4 percent). Farms with royalty income also had a significantly higher farm net worth ($1,560,978) than those who did not receive royalties. \u2022 More farms with royalty income receive government payments and the average payment is higher. This may be related to location, as a greater percentage of farms with royalty income specialize in major field crops. However, the difference in percentage of farms specializing in beef production is even greater among those receiving royalty payments and this would be expected to contribute to lower average government payments. \u2022 For farms with royalty income, nearly two-thirds of the principal operators indicate their major occupation is farm or ranch work (64%), with 25% noting work other than farming/ranching and 10.5% currently not in the work force. \u2022 A greater percentage of operators age 65 and older than younger operators have royalty income.

If we look at concentration of payments among those who receive payments: \u2022 3% of farms receive 50% of all royalty payments \u2022 23% of farms receive 90% of all royalty payments \u2022 Half of all royalty income goes to farms receiving at least $200,000 in lease and royalty payments Lease and royalty income in the top ten active-well states \u2022 Two-thirds of farm households that received royalty payments were located in the 10 states with the greatest number of active oil or gas wells, and they accounted for 83% of total royalty payments. \u2022 About 6% of farms located in the Top Ten active-well states received royalty income, double the percentage nationally, for a total of $1.5 billion for 2012 (See map 1). \u2022 Conditional on receiving royalty income, the average royalty was $35,015. Total farm household income averaged $159,937 (median $77,125). \u2022 The average size of a farm receiving royalty income was 960 operated acres (median 304), far larger than the average farm in the U.S. \u2022 Receipt of royalty income was more likely to accrue to older farmers (61 years old on average). In fact, in these states, 40% of farms receiving OGW royalties were 65 years old or older. \u2022 The farms receiving royalty payments tend to be wealthier than other farms, with an average household net worth of over $2 million. \u2022 The majority of the farms are in the South (51%), primarily Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas."}, {"section_title": "The impact of oil, gas or wind lease and royalty income on household wellbeing", "text": "In the farm sector overall, royalty receipt is not a large source of income.

However, due to limitations of the data we do not know this. We only know what they reported as income in the survey year, which could include proceeds from ongoing production or a one-time payment made at the initiation of the lease (bonus payment), or both. \u2022 Nevertheless, among those who receive royalty income, it can be an important source, particularly for older farmers."}]
