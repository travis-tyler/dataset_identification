[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Despite the increasing availability in brain health related data, clinically translatable methods to predict the conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still lacking. Although MCI typically precedes AD, only a fraction of 20-40% of MCI individuals will progress to dementia within 3 years following the initial diagnosis. As currently available and emerging therapies likely have the greatest impact when provided at the earliest disease stage, the prompt identification of subjects at high risk for conversion to full AD is of great importance in the fight against this disease. In this work, we propose a highly predictive machine learning algorithm, based only on non-invasively and easily in-the-clinic collectable predictors, to identify MCI subjects at risk for conversion to full AD.\nThe algorithm was developed using the open dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), employing a sample of 550 MCI subjects whose diagnostic follow-up is available for at least 3 years after the baseline assessment. A restricted set of information regarding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, neuropsychological test scores was used as predictors and several different supervised machine learning algorithms were developed and ensembled in final algorithm. A site-independent stratified train/test split protocol was used to provide an estimate of the generalized performance of the algorithm.\nThe final algorithm demonstrated an AUROC of 0.88, sensitivity of 77.7%, and a specificity of 79.9% on excluded test data. The specificity of the algorithm was 40.2% for 100% sensitivity.\nThe algorithm we developed achieved sound and high prognostic performance to predict AD conversion using easily clinically derived information that makes the algorithm easy to be translated into practice. This indicates beneficial application to improve recruitment in clinical trials and to more selectively prescribe new and newly emerging early interventions to high AD risk patients.\nKeywords Alzheimer's disease \u00b7 clinical prediction rule \u00b7 machine learning \u00b7 mild cognitive impairment \u00b7 personalized medicine \u00b7 precision medicine \u00b7 neuropsychological tests 1"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment and general disability. The progression of AD comprises a long, unnoticed preclinical stage, followed by a prodromal stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) that leads to severe dementia and eventually death [1] . While no disease-modifying treatment is currently available for AD, a large number of drugs are in development and encouraging early-stage results from clinical trials provide for the first time a concrete hope that one or more therapies may become available in a few years [2] . As the progression of the neuropathology in AD starts years in advance before clinical symptoms of the disease become apparent and progressive neurodegeneration has irreversibly damaged the brain, emerging treatments will likely have the greatest effect when provided at the earliest disease stages. Thus, the prompt identification of subjects at high risk for conversion to AD is of great importance.\nThe ability to identify declining individuals at the prodromal AD stage provides a critical time window for early clinical management, treatment & care planning and design of clinical drug trials [3] . Precise identification and early treatment of at risk subjects would stand to improve outcomes of clinical trials and reduce healthcare costs in clinical practice. However, simulations also suggest that the health care system is not prepared to handle the potentially high volume of patients who would be eligible for treatment [2] .\nMCI represents (currently) the earliest clinically detectable stage of progression towards AD or other dementias. To determine whether MCI symptoms are due to an AD pathology requires the use of blood testing, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, in addition to careful medical evaluation of medical history, neuropsychological testing, and a physical and neurological examination. The cognitive decline in MCI is abnormal given an individual's age and education level, but does not interfere with daily activities, and thus does not meet criteria for AD. However, only 20-40% of individuals will progress to AD within three years, with a lower rate of conversion reported in epidemiologic samples than in clinical ones [4, 5] Currently, there are no means to provide patients diagnosed with MCI with an early prognosis for conversion to full AD. While changes in several biomarkers prior to developing AD have been reported, no single biomarker appears to adequately predict the conversion from MCI to AD with an acceptable level of accuracy. As such, there is increasing evidence that the use of a combination of biomarkers can best predict the conversion to AD [3, [6] [7] [8] [9] .\nIn the current age of big data and artificial intelligence technologies, considerable effort has been dedicated in developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the conversion to AD in subjects with MCI using different combinations of AD biomarkers with varying accuracy [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] (see [19, 20] for a recent review of the most performing algorithms presented in the scientific literature so far). Many studies focused on predicting the conversion of AD in MCI patients, combine different types of data including brain imaging, 2 CSF biomarkers, genotyping, demographic and clinical information, and cognitive performance.\nHowever, while combining different biomarkers improves model accuracy, there is a lack of consistency regarding a specific combined AD prediction model and translation into practice is still lacking. One possible reason for this is that current algorithms generally rely on expensive and/or invasive predictors, such as brain imaging or CSF biomarkers. As such, these studies only serve the purpose of a proof-of-concept, without being further tested in independent and clinical samples.\nThe current study aimed to develop a clinically translatable machine learning algorithm to predict the conversion to full AD in subjects with MCI within a 3-year period, based on fast, easy, and cost-effective predictors. Our hypothesis was that high predictive accuracy could be obtained using a machine learning model with simple and non-invasive predictors. We used data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ ) with a particular consideration for socio-demographic and clinical information, and neuropsychological test scores rather than using complex, invasive, and expensive imaging or CSF predictors. 3 "}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. It contains data of a large number of cognitive normal, MCI, and AD subjects recruited in over 50 different centers in US and Canada with follow-up assessments performed every 6 months.\nFor this study, we used a subset of the ADNI dataset called ADNIMERGE that includes a reduced selection of more commonly used variables (i.e. demographic, clinical exam total scores, MRI and PET variables).

The rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient together with other informants (e.g., family members). Sum of Boxes score was used in the current analyses (CDRSB). The score of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) [23] , an a informant-based clinician-administered questionnaire which assess the functional daily-living impairment in dementia, was also used in the analyses.\n\u2022 Neuropsychological tests : MMSE [24] is a 30-point questionnaire that is used measuring cognitive impairment. All MCI subjects has a score of 24 of more at baseline. The Cognitive Subscale Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) [25] is made of 11 tasks that include both subject-completed tests and observer-based assessments, assessing the memory, language, and praxis domains. The result is a global final score ranging from 0 to 70, based on the sum of the scores of the single tasks (ADAS11). Beyond the ADAS11 score, the ADNI study included also an additional test of delayed word recall and a number cancellation or maze task, which are further summed to have a new total score that ranges from 0 to 85 (ADAS13). In addition, the score of the task 4 (Word Recognition, ADASQ4) was included in the ADNIMERGE dataset. All these three ADAS scores were initially considered as predictors in the analyses.

In order to accomplish a division in 5 folds which satisfies all these criteria, 10000 different subsets were generated by progressively adding all subjects from a randomly chosen recruiting site, until the included cases ranged between 19% and 21% of the entire sample. Then, only those subsets whose percentage of cAD ranged between 35.52% and 36.12% were retained, which was satisfied in 567 (5,67%) out of the generated subsets.

The entire process took around 4 hours of computation (on a Linux server with 2.20GHz Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 CPUs), and successfully found a single combination of five subsets that satisfied all the desired criteria ( Table 2 ).\nAll the missing value imputation, feature transformation and selection procedures, model training with cross-validation, and ensembling of different algorithms predictions described in the following paragraphs were performed in five distinct repetitions (named A-E) of the analyses, each time using the cases included in four of the five subsets and blindly to the remaining subset that were used as a test subset. The same missing value imputation, feature transformation and selection applied during training in the other four subsets were applied to the test subset.

Moreover, three feature subsets were additionally created based on different selection strategies in order to include only those that are the most informative. A filtering procedure was applied to create reduced sets of features based on their bivariate statistical association (p < .05) with the outcome using independent sample t-test for continuous predictors and Fisher's exact test for both dichotomous and one-hot encoded polytomous features (feature subset 2). Two cross-validated recursive feature elimination procedures (also known as \"wrapper\" procedures) with Logistic Regression (LR, feature subset 3) and Random Forest (RF, feature subset 4) [29] were also applied. In particular, the latter strategy was chosen because it has previously proved to be efficacious in selecting a relevant feature subset [19] .\nTwo groups of features correlated above the 0.75 threshold were identified, respectively the three ADAS scores (ADAS11, ADAS13, ADASQ4) and two of the RAVLT scores (RAVLT-F, RAVLT-PF).

In order to optimize such hyper-parameters for each ML techniques used in this study, each model was trained with 50 random hyper-parameter configurations, and 50 further configurations were progressively estimated with a Bayesian optimization approach. Instead of a random generation, Bayesian optimization aims to estimate which is the hyper-parameter configuration that would maximize the performance of the algorithm starting from the 7 previously attempted ones, based on the assumption that it exists a relationship between the various hyper-parameter values and the performance achieved by the algorithm. Bayesian optimization is expected to be able to identify better hyper-parameter configurations, and in a reduced number of attempts, compared to trying to generate them at random. Estimation was performed with Gaussian Processes, as implemented in the Scikit-Optimized library ( https://scikit-optimize.github.io/ ).\nThe Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) was used as performance metric to be maximized. All the ML algorithms developed in this study output a continuous prediction score (range: 0-1; the closer to 1 the higher the predicted risk of conversion for that subject) and the AUROC value can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected cAD subject will receive a higher output score than a randomly selected NC subject.

This would allow timely planning of early interventions for such individuals. Further, our algorithm can be employed as a tool during the recruitment of MCI subjects for clinical trials which aim to investigate innovative treatments of AD. The opportunity to recruit only subjects at true risk of future conversion to AD -who most likely show the earliest brain changes underlying AD pathology -will drastically reduce the costs to run such clinical trials and result in improved outcomes.\nIn contrast with many of the previous machine-learning approaches that have been previously presented, our algorithm aimed to achieve good predictive performance based only on a reduced set of sociodemographic characteristics, clinical information, and neuropsychological tests scores. It does not rely on information coming from procedures that are currently still expensive, invasive or not widespread available in many clinical settings, such as neuroimaging techniques, lumbar puncture, and genetic testing.\nTo develop the algorithm, we used data of 550 MCI subjects recruited in the ADNI study, and we applied a subdivision of the initial dataset in five mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, stratified test data subsets, in which the algorithm was iteratively tested after being trained in the remaining four subsets. This approach contributed to achieve an unbiased estimate of the predictive performance of our algorithm when it is applied to cases which were not used during the development phase of the algorithm. Moreover, we also ensured that the subsamples used to develop the algorithm contained subjects recruited from distinct sites than those from which subjects used for testing were recruited. This procedure was established in order to obtain results which represent an estimate of the expected performance, also when the algorithm is applied in distinct clinical centers. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that was tested ensuring independence between the train and test sets regarding the sites where the subjects were recruited from.\nEven using such a rigid testing protocol, the algorithm demonstrated a high predictive performance, showing a test AUROC of 0.88, and a test sensitivity and specificity of 77.7% and 79.9% respectively, when the algorithm was optimized during its development to achieve the best possible balanced accuracy. Of particular interest is the achievement of 40.2% specificity with a positive predictive value of 48.3% for 100% sensitivity, and a specificity and positive predictive value of 53% for 95% sensitivity. These results support the utility of our algorithm especially as a potential screening tool, i.e. an algorithm that can provide a marginal number of false negative predictions at the cost of a higher number of false positives. Thus, our algorithm would turn out to be particularly useful in case another more 16 accurate, and especially more sensitive tool will become available, however which requires additional expensive or invasive-to-collect information. In such case, our algorithm can be used as a first step to significantly reduce the number of subjects which require examination using more precise, yet less easily applicable procedures at a later stage. Considering an expected conversion rate of 20%-40% from MCI to AD in three years, the expected percentage of subjects confidently predicted as non-converters would be estimated 32%-24% subsequently, leaving only the remaining 68%-76% of subjects with the necessity of further investigations.\nMaking a proper comparison of our algorithm with all others previously published is not a trivial task, especially considering the different and reduced level of independent validation most of these algorithms have undergone so far.\nIn some studies, algorithms which used as predictive information some type of functional brain imaging, such as PET and fMRI, and/or CSF investigations demonstrated particularly high cross-validated performance, with AUROCs close to 0.95 [17, 18] . A recent study presented an algorithm based on regional information from a single amyloid PET scan which demonstrated a test performance of an AUROC of 0.91 and an unbalanced accuracy of 0.84 in the ADNI sample for a prediction of conversion in 2 years [42] , thus showing a higher predictive performance than what was achieved by our algorithm.\nIn addition, some studies which used only structural MRI also demonstrated high cross-validated (i.e. [17, 18] : AUROC = 0.932; balanced accuracy = 0.886) and nested cross-validated performance ( [43] : sensitivity = 85%; specificity = 84.78%). Similarly, high cross-validated results were found by other studies who combined structural MRI with clinical and neuropsychological information (i.e. [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ): AUROC = 0.902; balanced accuracy = 80.5%) In addition, a recent study [44] presented a highly performing deep learning algorithm (AUROC = 0.925; accuracy = 86%; sensitivity = 87.5%; specificity = 85%) and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only available study using structural MRI in which a a proper testing of the algorithm was performed. Some particularly promising cross-validated results were also found in some studies which considered also APOE genotyping, together with EEG, ( [45] : AUROC = 0.97; sensitivity = 96.7%; specificity = 86%) or blood biomarkers [7, 10, 16] : balanced accuracy = 92.5%). Thus, the use of brain imaging, CSF, and/or other biomarkers as predictive information may have, to some degree, resulted in a better predictive performance compared to our algorithm, which did not use any of these types of information.\nWhile the results of the previous studies indicate that neuroimaging biomarkers hold great promise for predicting conversion to AD, the performance increase gained by including biomarker information is questioned and much debated [14, 46, 47] . Instead, neuropsychological measures of cognitive functioning are possibly equally excellent predictors of progression to dementia. For example, in a study by Fleisher and colleagues, common cognitive tests provide better predictive accuracy than imaging measures for predicting progression to AD in subject with moderate stages of amnestic MCI [47] , and in another study by Clark and colleagues, models developed using only socio-demographic 17 information, clinical information and neuropsychological test scores (focusing on verbal fluency scores) resulted in an AUROC score of 0.87 and a balanced accuracy of 0.84, while including brain imaging did not significantly improve this performance (AUROC = 0.81, accuracy = 0.83) [14] .\nMoreover, the cost of the standard procedure in the clinical process of diagnosing AD (which entails the clinical consultation, including the patient's administrative admission, anamnesis, physical examination, neuropsychological testing, test evaluation and diagnosis conference & physician letter) is relatively low at an estimated 110 \u20ac (US$115) on average, while the use of additional advanced technical procedures, such as blood sampling, CT, MRI, PET & CSF procedures, which are required following deficits in neuropsychological test results and is dependent on the patient's suspected diagnosis of MCI, AD or other dementia types (which is increasingly associated with higher frequencies of using cost-intensive imaging & CSF procedures), drives costs up to 649 \u20ac (US$676) in case of an AD diagnosis according to a study in a German memory clinic [48] . In this regards, the use of advanced technological procedures, rather than clinical consultation and neuropsychological testing, is driving costs in the diagnostic process and as such, will also increase the costs of predictive algorithms based on information of imaging, blood sampling or CSF procedures compared to those algorithms that rely only on sociodemographic, clinical, and neuropsychological predictive information, like the one we present in this study.\nAdditionally, our algorithm demonstrated similar predictive performance compared to other top-performing algorithms based only on sociodemographic, clinical, and neuropsychological predictive information. For example, in a first study by Clark and colleagues, they used only a simple cross-validation protocol to investigate the performance of their algorithm to make prediction of conversion at 1 year or more (AUROC = 0.88, balanced accuracy = 0.84) [13] , while in another study they used a more sound nested cross-validation protocol to investigate the predictive performance of their algorithm at 4 years (AUROC = 0.87, balanced accuracy = 0.79) [14] .\nAltogether, our results originate from a proper testing protocol and represent a better unbiased estimate of the generalized performance of the algorithm. Only a very small number of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD were subjected to a proper testing protocol, rather than only a cross-validation protocol, which limits the soundness of the evidence of their predictive performance. As such, apart from [42, 44] , all the previously mentioned results may be optimistically biased estimates of the generalized performance of such algorithms as a proper testing protocol was not applied.\nWe previously presented another machine learning algorithm that performs a prediction of conversion to AD in MCI subjects [19, 20] . However, the algorithm described here has distinct characteristics and can be considered at a more advanced stage of validation. First, the current algorithm does not require any neuroimaging information, while our previous method relied on a clinicians' rating of the atrophy in three brain structures, evaluated by observing standardized images coming from a structural magnetic resonance. Structural magnetic resonance is widespread also in clinical settings nowadays, it is less expensive than 18 other neuroimaging evaluation such as functional magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography, and the use of a clinician-administered visual scale allows to bypass the obstacles related to the non-automatic calibration of data coming from different magnetic resonance scanners. Nevertheless, the fact that our new algorithm does not necessitate any magnetic resonance evaluation makes its use even more easily translatable in practice, and less expensive. Moreover, even though our former algorithm showed higher cross-validated performance (AUROC = 0.91, sensitivity = 86.7% and specificity = 87.4% at the best balanced accuracy) [19] ), a solid testing of its performance is still lacking and, at the moment, only a preliminary evidence via a transfer learning approach is available [20] . Instead, the protocol applied in the current study provides a better and sounder evaluation of the actual predictive performance of this new algorithm.\nBeyond testing the algorithm's predictive accuracy, we also aimed to provide a first indication of the importance of the variables used as predictors. The opportunity to provide an explanation of how the model works and performs its prediction is crucial to foster its application in clinical practice [49] . However, given the architectural complexity of the algorithm we developed, this is not a straightforward task. Several different approaches have been proposed, all of them providing different, and only a partial explanation of an algorithm's functioning [50] . Thus, we decided to leave complex and more extensive investigations to a future study which will be fully dedicated to this goal. Instead, we simply investigated the predictive role of each predictor individually, which can evidence the amount of predictive information carried by each predictor. However, it does not allow to identify potential interactions among multiple predictors that could have been modeled by the algorithm and that can relevantly contribute to its high predictive performance.\nIn line with the evidence in our previous study [19] , sociodemographic characteristics seem not to be particularly relevant in discriminating cAD and NC MCI subjects. Furthermore, in both studies, age was the sole of these characteristics showing a significant, even if very limited, predictive power. Also, sociodemographic characteristics resulted to be the most often discarded features by the feature selection strategies we applied in our study, once again suggesting their poor predictive relevance.\nInstead, the clinical scale scores, the subtype of MCI, and the neuropsychological test scores resulted markedly predictive. Their test AUROC ranged from 0.658 to 0.809, and even the least predictive of them had a 95% CI higher than 0.6. The evidence of their predictive importance was expected. These features measure core elements of the progressive decline leading to a full manifestation of AD, such as the memory and other cognitive functions deterioration, and the consequent functional impairment.\nMoreover, the first principal component of the three ADAS scores, which resulted in the most individually important predictor, demonstrated a test AUROC significantly lower than the one achieved by the entire algorithm. The results of our, as well as other previous studies, had already showed that machine learning algorithms can effectively be used to combine these individual pieces of information, providing a better identification of cAD among MCI subjects than what it would be possible using each of them singularly [13, 14, 19, 20, 46] . 19 Our study has some limitations that should be taken into account and that will be addressed in the future stages of our research. First, even if we iteratively ensured that the subjects used for testing were always recruited in different sites than those used in the development of the algorithm, it is important to note that all the ADNI recruiting sites were located in the USA or Canada. Even if this can be considered an important step forward towards the demonstration of the generalized performance of the proposed algorithm, still these sites may not be completely representative of the entire population of centers in which the algorithm may aspire to be used. Our aim was to develop an algorithm that may be applied also beyond US and Canada centers only, and perhaps also clinical centers without any research inclinations. MCI subjects referring to these extended range of centers might have peculiar characteristics and the algorithm might show reduced predictive accuracy when applied to them. In order to at least partially address this potential bias, we plan to first test and then re-optimize our algorithm using further datasets coming from the several international replications of the North American ADNI ( https://www.alz.org/research/for_researchers/partnerships/wwadni ). In addition, inclusion and exclusion criteria may have excluded from ADNI, and in turn from our analyses, some MCI subjects with peculiar characteristics, e.g. MCI subjects with high level of depression or currently taking some of the medications that excluded for admission to the study. Once again, the algorithm might show reduced predictive accuracy when applied to them and further testing in a less selected sample should be performed before a safe use of the algorithm can be guaranteed with these peculiar MCI subjects.\nFurthermore, our final algorithm is based on an ensemble of several lower-level machine learning algorithms, including some that use the entire initial set of predictors as feature set. Thus, all predictors currently remain necessary to be assessed, even if some of them may contribute poorly or even not at all to the prediction. Although the ensembling approach we used may have effectively prevented that such irrelevant predictors decreased the algorithm accuracy, a further reduction of the amount of information necessary to be assessed and used by the algorithm would permit to reduce the costs associated with its application.\nFinally, our algorithm currently operates three-year predictions in subjects that already manifest MCI. As the new arriving treatments are expected to be the more effective the earlier they will be started, algorithms that can perform accurate predictions at even earlier stages of deterioration than MCI, and in a longer time frame, will be of particular relevance. A preliminary attempt has already been done in our previous study [19] , employing also a sample of subjects with Pre-mild Cognitive Impairment [51] , as well as in other previous studies which developed algorithm that aimed to make predictions for period longer than three years [10, 14] . Future steps in our research will take into account this necessity, exploring the opportunity of making predictions at longer time periods and in earlier-stage subjects. 20 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We developed an algorithm to predict three-year conversion to AD in MCI subjects, based on a weighted rank average ensemble of several supervised machine learning algorithms. It demonstrated high predictive accuracy when tested via a sound train/test split protocol, exhibiting especially good predictive performance when the algorithm was optimized as a screening tool. Predictions are performed using only a restricted set of sociodemographic characteristics, clinical information, and neuropsychological test scores, which makes its application of easy translation into clinical practice, as well as useful in improving the recruitment of MCI subjects at true risk of conversion to AD in clinical trials. Further tests and optimizations will follow this study in order to provide additional evidence of its accuracy in generalized application, and to improve its cost-effectiveness."}]
