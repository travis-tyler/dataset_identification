Of particular interest is whether non-citizens trained in the United States have displaced citizens from jobs in science and engineering (S&E). Using a novel adaptation of the shift-share technique, we find that citizen S&E doctorates have fewer jobs in S&E and fewer academic jobs than would be expected for two reasons: the citizen doctoral population has experienced slower growth than the non-citizen doctoral population and citizen S&E doctorates have been displaced.\nWhether the displacement observed was a voluntary response of citizens to better opportunities elsewhere or an involuntary response indicative of having been pushed out by foreign talent remains to be determined."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "There has been a dramatic increase in the number of doctoral scientists and engineers who have come from abroad to study and work in the United States. Not surprisingly, America's \"dependency on foreign scientists\" (Stossel, 1999) has been a cause of national concern in recent years. The on-going debate on the number of temporary high-tech (H-1B) visas to be issued each year is clearly one manifestation of this concern.\n1 Moreover, the events of September 11, 2001 further heightened the nation's concern and have resulted in a series of proposals to greatly regulate or restrict the number of foreign students from countries the State Department considers sponsors of terrorism (Stephan et al., 2002) .\nHow large has the inflow of foreign talent been? As Table 1 indicates, over the period , the number of U.S."}, {"section_title": "-trained doctoral scientists and engineers living in the United", "text": "States who were citizens (either native-born or naturalized) at the time their degree was awarded increased almost three-fold; those who were non-citizens increased eight-fold. Thus while fewer than one in ten U.S. doctoral-trained scientists living in the U.S. in the early 1970s were noncitizens at the time their degree was awarded, by 1997 more than one in five were non-citizens."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "The citizen-non-citizen growth differential has been most striking in the mathematical/computer sciences followed by engineering and earth/environmental sciences ( Figure 1 ). In the first instance, the number of citizens grew almost three-fold while the number of non-citizens grew thirteen-fold; in the latter two, citizen growth was more than two-fold while non-citizen growth was more than nine-fold.\nWhat are the consequences of this heavy inflow of foreign talent for U.S. science? Are immigrant 3 scientists and engineers a source of strength and vitality, contributing disproportionately to U.S. science? Are immigrants a threat in the workplace, lowering real wages, increasing unemployment and ultimately discouraging native talent from pursuing scientific careers? There are no simple answers to these questions. In fact, the immigration debate resembles a \"welfare\" problem, much like free trade, where the gains to society as a whole have to be weighed against the losses incurred by specific groups (Smith and Edmonston, 1997, p. 146) .\nWhat is known thus far? 4 In a study of more than 4,700 scientists and engineers making \"exceptional\" contributions to science and engineering (S&E) in the United States, Levin and Stephan (1999) address the vitality question, providing strong evidence that the answer is \"yes.\"\nThey find that, with but one exception, the proportion foreign born among exceptional contributors is always significantly higher than expected given the proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the scientific labor force. Thus they conclude that the United States has benefited from the inflow of foreign talent.\nAlthough there is a \"widespread perception that 'immigrant hordes' have an adverse effect on the employment opportunities of U.S. citizens\" (Borjas, 1994 (Borjas, , p. 1667 , the question of how immigrants affect employment outcomes in S&E remains to be determined. In terms of jobs, the evidence is sketchy, consisting of anecdotal reports and selected data implying that in some fields immigrants \"take\" coveted positions away from U.S. citizens in science, especially in academe. For example, the American Mathematical Society reported: \"Immigrants won 40% of the 720 mathematics jobs available last year (1995) . . . and helped boost the unemployment rate into double digits among newly minted math Ph.D.s\" (Phillips, 1996, p. A2) . The National\nResearch Council recently noted a growing \"imbalance between the number of life-science Ph.D.s being produced and the availability of positions that permit them to become independent investigators,\" a situation exacerbated by the \"influx of foreign-citizen Ph.D. candidates together with the increase in foreign-trained Ph.D.s who have sought postdoctoral training in the U.S.\"\n(1998, p. 4)."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "There is some evidence that real wages may have been adversely affected by the heavy inflow of foreign talent. Espenshade et al. (2001) "}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "It is not obvious how to measure displacement short of specifying a multi-equation econometric model that attempts to capture the complexity of the labor market for scientists and engineers. Such an exercise, however, is fraught with difficulty. 7 Rather than abandon the question, we undertake an alternative approach based on a \"gedanken\" or thought-experiment designed to address, albeit imprecisely, what we believe to be the right question.\nGedanken experiments are powerful (precisely) because they make explicit the alternatives being compared. The professional imperatives of many disciplines, including economics, lead to a preference for precise answers to the wrong questions over imprecise answers to the right questions (Pollak, 1998, p. 6) .\nWe compare the actual changes in employment for U.S.-citizen (non-citizen) S&E doctorates in different sectors of the economy with a counterfactual --the changes that would have occurred had their employment in each sector grown at the overall growth rate for all S&E doctorates together, regardless of citizenship. This approach acknowledges the fact that the growth in U.S.-trained S&E doctorates has been fostered both directly and indirectly by a variety of policies, including changes in immigration laws and the widespread availability of funds supporting graduate and postdoctoral study in science. The counterfactual makes explicit the assumption that in the absence of these policies the United States could have implemented a different set of policies that would have elicited an equal amount of growth from citizens alone.\nWhether this is the \"correct\" counterfactual is, of course, subject to debate. But many believe\nthat \"the United States should be able, if it so chose as a matter of social policy, to meet its needs for scientists from within its own population, especially by harnessing the talents of underrepresented minorities and women\" (Bouvier and Martin, 1995, p. 3)."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "We adapt a technique originally developed in the regional science literature, known as shift-share, to implement the thought-experiment. (See, for example, Dunn, 1960; EstebanMarquillas, 1972; Gordon, Hackett and Mulkey, 1980; Andrikopoulos, Brox, and Carvalho, 1990; Kiel, 1992; Grobar, 1996) . Although, several shortcomings of the \"classic\" shift-share methodology have surfaced over the years, and alternative formulations have been suggested, with careful application it remains a valuable tool for examining changes over time (Loveridge and Selting, 1998) . Indeed, in recent years, shift-share has been applied to a broad set of policy issues including disease death rates (Hoppes, 1997) , migration (Ishikawa, 1992) , occupational sex composition (Smith, 1991) , insurance (Halperin and Mabry, 1980) , productivity growth (Haynes & Dinc, 1997) and regional crime growth (Blair and Mabry, 1980) . and b ij = employment for citizenship group i in sector j during the base period, r oo = the overall growth rate for all S&E doctorates, r io = the growth rate for citizenship group i, and r ij = the growth rate for citizenship group i in sector j.\nThus, we compare the actual employment growth of a specific \"citizenship\" group (citizen or non-citizen) in a specific \"sector\" (e.g. academe, industry) --G ij --with a predicted measure of employment growth, as determined by the counterfactual --O ij . The resulting differential is divided into two components: the minting effect, M ij , , and the competitive effect, C ij . The minting effect is the employment change citizens (non-citizens) experienced in a particular sector due to the differential in growth rates between its doctoral recipients and all doctoral recipients. By definition, it must sum to zero for the two citizenship groups. The competitive effect is the difference between the actual change in employment for each group in each sector and the employment growth that would have occurred had each group grown at its overall growth rate. By analogy, as in the case of international trade, competitive effects across sectors for a particular group (citizen or non-citizen) must sum to zero.\nSince C ij captures the differential rate at which jobs in various sectors of the economy have grown for each citizenship group, after accounting for the overall growth in the number of doctoral recipients and the differential minting effects observed, we define displacement as the difference between citizen and non-citizen competitive effects. Thus, for example, suppose we observe that employment growth for citizens in academe is smaller than predicted by the counterfactual. This may have occurred for two reasons: the citizen share of S&E doctorates may have declined (the minting effect); citizens may have experienced slower employment growth in academe than in other sectors such as industry (the competitive effect). To determine whether citizens did less well compared to their non-citizen counterparts in academe --whether displacement has occurred--we subtract the non-citizen competitive effect from the citizen competitive effect (both measured in percentage terms to adjust for relative size differences).\nWhile the term \"displacement\" has a negative connotation in the sense that non-citizens may have forced citizens out of desirable positions in academe, causality is not implied. Indeed, citizens may be more likely than their non-citizen counterparts to opt for better employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "Although the decomposition into a minting effect and a competitive effect is based on an accounting identity, from a public policy standpoint these are powerful distinctions to make since the prescriptions for remedy differ. We study the degree to which displacement, as we have defined it, has occurred during the period 1973-1997. We define S&E doctorates to include individuals educated in engineering, the mathematical sciences, computer and information sciences, physics and astronomy, chemistry, earth, environmental and marine sciences, agricultural sciences (excluding agricultural economics), medical sciences, and the biological sciences. The sample is limited to those who have met the following criteria: respondent is located in the U.S. at the time of the survey, respondent earned a U.S. doctorate in S&E, and the respondent's age is 65 or less.\nObservations with missing information on employment status, citizenship or birth year are excluded. Sample observations are weighted to adjust for different initial probabilities of sample selection and subsequent non-response. 11 The database is initially divided into four, six-year year intervals (1973-1979, 1979-1985, 1985-1991, and 1991-1997) . Then each component in the decomposition for each time period is summed over the four periods so that a single number captures the \"dynamic\" nature of employment growth for the entire 1973-1997 period. 12 The analysis is performed for all S&E fields combined as well as by major subfield. A critical point, however, is that the competitive disadvantage for citizen S&E doctorates was not only absolutely larger, but also relatively larger than that faced by non-citizens. For citizen S&E doctorates, the competitive disadvantage was 8.5 percent [12,466/147,277] , where the denominator is the total change in citizen S&E doctorates. For non-citizens, the competitive disadvantage was but 1.3 percent [-544/41,564] , where the denominator is the total change in non-citizen S&E doctorates. In other words, after controlling for overall growth and minting effects, both non-citizen and citizen shares' of employment in the S&E sector fell, but the effect was considerably larger for citizens. 15 Thus, using the terminology introduced earlier, the displacement of citizens from the sector IN S&E for all fields combined was 7.2 percent [8.5%-1.3%]. Looking next at displacement from the ACADEME IN S&E subsector, we see that both citizens and their non-citizen counterparts have been at a competitive disadvantage. Thus, not only have both groups, more often than not, experienced a scarcity of jobs in the IN S&E sector relative to jobs in the OUT S&E and OTHER sectors, but also both groups have experienced competitive losses in academic appointments within the S&E sector. The competitive effect for citizens, however, is generally more negative. As a result, displacement of citizen doctorates from ACADEME IN S&E for all fields combined is -4.2 percent, but the results vary widely by field. In the mathematical/computer sciences, the displacement is -18.6 percent. By contrast, citizen doctorates in earth/environmental sciences and chemistry did relatively better than their non-citizen counterparts in the academic sector."}, {"section_title": "DEMONSTRATION OF THE DECOMPOSITION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISPLACEMENT FROM IN S&E AND ACADEME IN S&E, 1973-1991", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "DISPLACEMENT FROM ACADEME, 1973-1997 Table 4 extends the analysis to 1997, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of this study. As noted earlier, due to a substantial revision in the SDR, the analysis is conducted for the broad sectors ACADEME, NONACADEME and OTHER, without making the distinction between being employed in or out of S&E. Because most S&E doctorates with academic appointments are employed in fields of S&E, we expect the findings for the new sector ACADEME over the period 1973-1991 to be similar to those observed in Table 3 , where academe was restricted to appointments within the S&E sector. Table 4 (columns 1-3) documents that this is the case.\nA key finding of Table 4 is evidence of increased displacement from academe since 1991 for citizen doctorate-holders in all fields except the mathematical/computer sciences where the rate of displacement, although still extremely high, has declined. Even in the earth/environmental sciences and chemistry, where citizens had smaller employment losses in academe compared to the other sectors than did their non-citizen counterparts from 1973-1991, the picture changed during the 1990s. The competitive position of non-citizens dramatically improved in both fields, while that of citizens improved slightly in the earth/environmental sciences and deteriorated further in chemistry, leading to the conclusion that citizens have now been displaced from academe in these two fields in recent years as well."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE", "text": "In this last section we estimate a model of the difference in growth rates (r ij -r io ) that determine the competitive effects used to measure displacement from academe. Of particular interest is whether there is a statistically significant difference in this measure by citizenship group, and whether the sign and significance of this relationship has changed over time. Such a finding would lend further support to our analysis of displacement presented above. For this estimation, we define DIF to be the difference between r ij, the growth rate for citizenship group i in sector j (academe) and r io , the overall growth rate for citizenship group i. DIF is calculated for Tables 3 and 4 ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The decompositions performed highlight the fact that citizen S&E doctorates have fewer jobs in S&E and fewer academic jobs because non-citizens displace them and because the citizen doctoral population has experienced slower growth than the non-citizen doctoral population.\nIndeed, almost 60% of the shortfall in positions held by citizen doctorates within S&E over the period 1973-1991 can be attributed to this differential minting effect. This suggests that if the U.S. were to foster policies designed to increase the number of citizens choosing careers in S&E a sizeable portion of the differential would be remedied. Examples of such policies are increased emphasis on S&E in K-12 school curricula and scholarships targeted to students choosing S&E majors in college. Special efforts could also be directed to increasing the numbers of minorities and, in some fields where they are underrepresented, women, in S&E studies.\nThe minting effect is not the entire story. The analysis indicates that a significant number of citizen doctorate-holders in S&E have been displaced by non-citizens who have received their doctoral training in the United States. This is not because non-citizens were immune to competitive effects that led to shortfalls in employment in the sectors IN S&E and ACADEME during this period. In fact, as we have seen, citizens and in most cases non-citizens have experienced employment shortfalls in these sectors. But citizens generally had larger employment shortfalls than their non-citizen counterparts and, by our definition, have been displaced. Earth/environmental sciences and chemistry were the only exceptions where the employment shortfalls of citizens were somewhat smaller than that of non-citizens in the (relatively) declining academic sector during the period 1973-1991. For the longer period, the findings are unequivocal: the employment shortfalls experienced by citizen doctorates in academe were larger than those of their non-citizen counterparts.\nThe analysis cannot determine, however, whether displaced citizens were, on balance, pushed out by the heavy inflow of foreign talent or pulled out by the lure of better opportunities elsewhere in the economy. That is, we do not know whether the displacement that we observe is involuntary or voluntary. One finding, in particular, does suggest that an element of pull may be involved, at least in certain fields. The finding that displacement from academe is greatest for S&E doctorates trained in the mathematical/computer sciences is suggestive of pull, given the high salaries that industry pays in these fields as well as the high salaries some of these individuals can command outside of S&E (National Science Board, 2000, p. 3-19) . Notably, the information technology sector expanded considerably during the period investigated in this study.\nEarlier work by Levin and Stephan (1999) and Stephan and Levin (2001) suggested that in the global competition for intellectual capital, the United States has been a winner. There are costs, however, associated with winning. The present study suggests that some of these costs are borne by those U.S. citizens trained in S&E who may have been involuntarily displaced from positions in science by the heavy inflow of foreign talent. Other costs are borne by U.S. citizens who are discouraged from choosing careers in S&E because of the flow of talent from abroad.\nFurthermore, despite international flows of scientific knowledge, nations that are a source of the brain drain clearly pay a price when their talented scientists and engineers locate permanently in the U.S."}, {"section_title": "NOTES", "text": "1 See, for example, Finn, 1995; Glanz, 1996; Matloff, 1988; Teitelbaum, 1996; and Phillips, 1996 .

In this Appendix we discuss this version of shift-share in the context of the broader shift-share literature (for an excellent review, see Loveridge and Selting (1988) ).\nOver the years, researchers have offered several critiques and modifications of the classic shift-share technique. For example, Esteban-Marquillas (1972), among others, has pointed to the lack of independence between the industry-mix and competitive effects. This has led to the development of various homothetic models of shift-share. There is not consensus, however, that using homothetic employment rather than actual employment in computing the competitive effect is actually beneficial. Keil (1992) , for example, points to the \"great danger\" (p. 482) of using this approach when the regional industrial structure gravely differs from the national industrial structure. And, Loveridge and Selting find that the homethetic models \"clearly do not solve the very problem they purport to eliminate (p. 54.)\" In our preliminary work, we found that the classical competitive effect and the homothetic competitive effect were very similar and thus opted for the simpler classical technique.\nIn another vein, Richardson (1978) , observed that classic shift-share focuses on employment change between two points in time, but ignores events between these time points.\nThis is particularly problematic if a long time horizon is considered and/or there is a substantial change in employment, particularly in the industrial mix of employment. As a solution, Barff and Knight (1988) advocated \"dynamic\" shift-share analysis, in which the decomposition is done on an annual basis and then the annual figures for each of the three shift-share components are summed. In the present study, we use a simpler dynamic variant in which the decomposition is done for each six-year interval and these interval changes are then summed.\nSeveral other concerns about classic shift-share have also been voiced. Among these is the concern that the shift-share results may be sensitive to the degree of industrial disaggregation. In our work, since there are just two well-defined industries -citizen and noncitizen S&E doctorates -the appropriate level of disaggregation is not an issue. Furthermore, there has also been some discussion that the results may differ according to the degree of regional disaggregation. While this is generally true, as noted by Dunn (1980) , such differences may usefully inform the analysis, rather than detract from it. This we believe is the case here, where we gain a greater understanding of what has happened in S&E by sub-dividing this \"region\" into Academe, Industry, and Other.\nFinally, a general concern with all shift-share work is that it is lacking theoretical substance. While Loverdige and Selting (1998) point out that there has been only limited success in building a theoretical basis for shift-share using neoclassical microeconomics and location theory, nevertheless they conclude that\nThe continuing use of shift-share seems to suggest its theoretical limitations may be outweighed by the information it supplies about regional economies. Given the growth in use of purely empirical models in other areas of economics, this aspect of shift-share is perhaps less of an issue than it appeared to be twenty years ago (p. 40)."}]
