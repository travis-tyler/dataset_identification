[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent unrest at college campuses across the United States has put renewed focus on the issue of faculty diversity. Student organizations at numerous universities have issued demands of administrators that call for a more explicit focus on recruiting disadvantaged minority and female faculty. For example, The Legion of Black Collegians at the University of Missouri has demanded an increase in the percentage of black faculty and staff campus-wide to 10 percent by 2017-18. Similarly-spirited demands have been made by groups at many universities, including \"Who's Teaching Us?\" at Stanford University, \"Liberate MSU\" at Michigan State University, and \"The Irate 8\" at the University of Cincinnati, among others. Although it is straightforward to obtain aggregate data on faculty representation at universities (e.g., from a source like the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), contemporary policy discussions would benefit from more detailed information. For example, it would be useful to know how faculty diversity compares across fields, and whether universities are behaving in a way consistent with placing independent value on a faculty member's contribution to workforce diversity. To inform these questions, we use new data to examine racial/ethnic and gender diversity, and wage gaps, at 40 selective public universities. Our data cover faculty in six academic departments that we selected to be inclusive of STEM and non-STEM fieldsbiology, chemistry, economics, educational leadership and policy, English, and sociologyand are taken from the 2015-16 academic year. Our analysis of faculty representation overall reveals anticipated results: black, Hispanic, and female faculty are underrepresented relative to their U.S. population shares; while Asian, white, and male faculty are overrepresented. 1 When we break our results out by field, the underrepresentation of black, Hispanic, and female faculty is shown to be driven predominantly by underrepresentation in STEM fields (biology, chemistry, and economics). 2 In non-STEM fields (educational leadership and policy, English, and sociology) the degree of underrepresentation of black, Hispanic and female faculty declines substantially, and in some cases these groups are not underrepresented at all. 3 Patterns of race/ethnicity and gender representation by field in our faculty data generally align with analogous representation patterns in field-specific PhD production data. We also examine faculty representation by rank. Comparing assistant professors to their senior colleagues provides insight into the future of faculty diversity. Our findings suggest that a more diverse workforce is building in higher education. Assistant professors are less likely to be white and more likely to be Asian and Hispanic, and less likely to be male, than associate and full professors. Evidence of increasing diversity among junior faculty is apparent in all of the fields we study, and particularly in STEM (also see Nelson and Brammer, 2010). The exception is for black facultywhile the representation of black faculty in non-STEM fields is improving modestly, in 2 We classify economics as a STEM field, as in Nelson and Brammer (2010). Although the classification of economics may not seem as obvious as the other fields, economics is a mathematically-oriented field and empirically it has more in common with STEM than non-STEM fields in terms of student and faculty composition. For example, Arcidiacono and Koedel (2014) find that incoming economics majors are similar to other STEM entrants in terms of pre-entry qualifications. In addition, Butcher, McEwan, and Weerapana (2014) and Koedel (2011) document that the grade distributions in economics courses align with grade distributions in other STEM fields and differ from grade distributions in non-STEM fields. Data from the 2016 Science and Engineering Indicators report published by the National Science Foundation (National Science Board, 2016) also show that enrollment patterns in economics share key features with other STEM fields that are not shared by non-STEM fields, most notably a sharp increase in foreign-student enrollment and a decline in the proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded to women (see Chapter 2 in particular). Ceci et al. (2014) also illustrate the similarity of economics with other STEM fields. 3 We were surprised that a direct comparison of faculty representation in STEM and non-STEM fields is unavailable in the modern academic literature. The most recent comparable information we found is from Glover, Parsad, and Zimbler (2002), who document faculty representation across departments using survey data from the 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF). Several other studies provide related information but do not directly compare STEM/non-STEM faculty representation. For example, Nelson and Brammer (2010) document STEM representation in the top-100 departments in 15 STEM disciplines, but do not collect non-STEM data. Freeman (1977) documents the within-race shares of black and white faculty across fields, but not cross-race shares within fields (Freeman's data are also over 40 years old). STEM fields black faculty are just as underrepresented among junior faculty as they are among senior faculty. Finally, we document and decompose faculty wage gaps by race/ethnicity and gender. Unconditionally, black and Hispanic faculty have significantly lower annual earnings than white faculty, and to a lesser extent Asian faculty. Our decompositions indicate that three observable factors can entirely explain racial/ethnic wage gaps: academic field, work experience, and research productivity. These same three factors account for a large fraction of the gender wage gap as well; however, unlike with the racial/ethnic gaps, they do not fully explain wage differences by gender. In a concluding section we briefly discuss the policy implications of our study. A simple takeaway is that STEM and non-STEM fields exhibit very different diversity conditions, which merits consideration in the design of policies to increase faculty diversity. Our wage decompositions identify the key factors that account for differences in faculty wages across racial/ethnic and gender groups, which can be used to guide policies aimed at mitigating these differences. Finally, our analysis of wages give no indication of a wage premium for faculty who contribute to workforce diversity. This result is inconsistent with a model in which a faculty member's contribution to diversity is valued as an independent contributor to productivity, although it could also reflect a lack of wage flexibility along race and gender lines afforded to universities even in the presence of an explicit valuation on diversity."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Our sample consists of faculty from 40 selective public universities ranked highly by the 2016 U.S. News and World Report, as listed in Appendix A. 4 We collected data from faculty rosters as published on department websites at the sampled universities during the 2015-16 academic year. The data were collected manually, and as such it was not feasible to include all faculty at all 40 universities. Instead, we used a sampling strategy focusing on faculty in the six above-described academic departments. We selected three of the six departments at random at each university, and for each selected department we collected data from every faculty member listed on the department website whose position involved at least some teaching. 5 We focus our primary analysis on tenuretrack faculty, but show results that include non-tenure-track teaching faculty in Appendix B. Appendix A documents the departments at each university that are included in our analytic sample. Our use of data from all listed faculty members in each university-by-department cell we sampled offers an important advantage over survey-based studies, where individual respondents may choose not to participate. Of direct relevance to our research questions, Bollinger et al. (2014) show that survey response rates can differ by race; and moreover, correlate differentially with earnings outcomes for men and women. This type of self-selection into survey participation raises questions about the ability of survey data to inform the questions we pursue. The most widely used data to study faculty wages in previous research comes from the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which was discontinued in 2003-04. The 2003-04 NSOPF faculty survey had a response rate of 76 percent. on a paycheck-by-paycheck basis and it was not straightforward to aggregate the information. We also skipped two University of California schools (UC Davis and UC Santa Cruz) to minimize the overrepresentation of California universities in our data, which are disproportionately highly ranked. To confirm that our findings are not sensitive to which universities are in the sample, in results omitted for brevity we perform a sensitivity exercise where we randomly drop four universities from the sample (10 percent of universities) and replicate our analysis. We do this five times and across the five iterations our findings are qualitatively similar to what we report below. Thus, we conclude that small-to-moderate fluctuations in the list of universities included in our study do not influence the findings. 5 More specifically, we assigned a random number to each department and pulled data from the three departments within each university that had the highest numbers. One issue that came up is that universities sometimes house multiple biology-related departments. For example, the University of California-Santa Barbara has departments of ecology, evolution and marine biology; and molecular, cellular and developmental biology. When \"biology\" was a randomly selected department at such universities, we collected data from faculty in all departments that confer the undergraduate biology degree (in the UC-Santa Barbara example, both departments confer the degree). For each sampled university-by-department cell, we collected data on faculty demographics, qualifications, salaries, and measures of research productivity. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our dataset of tenure-track faculty (Appendix Table B.1 further breaks out the descriptive statistics by field). Note that although we evenly sampled departments across universities (subject to random sampling variabilitysee Appendix A), faculty in our data are disproportionately in STEM fields. This is because academic departments in these fields tend to be larger. Wage data for faculty at most public universities are published by government agencies and freely accessible. Our aim was to collect data on base pay for faculty in each state. While in many states base pay is clearly labeled in agency reports, this is not always the case. Thus, in some states it may be that the earnings data include some supplemental salary. Although our sense is that this is rare, it is a source of measurement error in the wage data. That said, empirically we do not anticipate this causing a significant problem because we use wages as the dependent variable in our analysis of earnings and in addition, our wage regressions include university fixed effects that will net out wage-reporting differences across states on average. Moreover, despite this potential limitation, our wage data offer a number of benefits over survey datawhich have been commonly used in previous, similar research to obtain faculty wage informationincluding (a) what is likely to be a significant reduction in measurement error owing to mistakes in self-reporting and (b) our ability to mitigate the potential for selective responses correlated with earnings (Bollinger et al., 2014) by pulling data from all faculty in sampled departments. Of all tenure-track faculty included on the rosters we sample, wage data were available for 94 percent. The primary reason for missing wage dataand in fact the only reason we can identify given the comprehensive nature of wage reporting for public employeesis that the faculty member is new to the university or was on leave and did not draw a salary during the previous year. This generates missing data because wage data are posted by government agencies with a lag. Consistent with this explanation, in Appendix Table B.2 we show that being a young professor is by far the strongest predictor of missing wage data. 6 The qualification data we collected include the faculty member's rank, years of experience, and the prestige of the PhD granting institution. Ideally, and for most faculty, we measure experience from the year the PhD was obtained as reported on faculty websites or CVs. In cases where a faculty member's profile does not indicate the year of the PhD, we measure experience by the time since the first registered publication, either on the faculty member's website (first choice) or Scopus\u00a9 (second choice). Between these various sources, we obtain experience measures for 98 percent of our sample. 7 The PhD-granting institution is taken from each faculty member's profile and is available for 94 percent of faculty. We divide PhD-granting institutions into four groups based on their ranking in U.S. News and World Report, inclusive of private universities, as shown in Table 1. We collected research-productivity data from Scopus\u00a9 including the number of publications, number of citations, and h-index for each faculty member. For each metric, we create standardized measures of productivity within fields as follows: Table B.2 reports results from a regression of an indicator variable for missing wages on faculty characteristics. The regression results reveal several differences between faculty with and without wage data, which derive primarily from the seniority difference. The one non-seniority related difference is that English professors are marginally less likely to have wage data, but this difference pales in comparison to the seniority-driven differences. 7 We use experience as a control variable in wage regressions below. A concern is that for faculty who do not list the year of the PhD, our approximation of experience based on the first publication likely introduces measurement error into the experience variable. In a robustness test omitted for brevity, we confirm that our findings are qualitatively insensitive to restricting the sample for the wage regressions to the 77 percent of faculty who list the year of the PhD on their website or CV, indicating that measurement error generated by our imperfect experience proxies does not unduly influence our results. where ij P is the standardized measure for faculty member i in field j, ij P is the raw measure, and j P and j \uf073 are the sample average and standard deviation in field j, respectively. The standardization allows for different distributions of productivity metrics across fields. While all of our metrics are imperfect measures of research productivity (Perry and Reny, 2016), below we show that they explain a substantial fraction of faculty wages and of racial/ethnic and gender wage gaps. Of the three measures, the h-index is the strongest single predictor of wages. The most important elements in our dataset are the demographic measuresi.e., the racial/ethnic and gender designations. While such measures are straightforward to obtain in respondent-driven datasets given their self-reported nature, obtaining these designations in our case is more complicated. In short, we relied on visual inspections of faculty pictures (found on faculty websites and elsewhere on the internet as available), origins of names, and in some cases biographical details (e.g., the country of the undergraduate institution listed on the CV) to assign racial/ethnic and gender designations to faculty. We group faculty into one of five possible race/ethnicity categories: black, Asian, Hispanic, white, and other/unknown. We use three gender groups: male, female, and unknown. We could speculatively debate the conceptual merits of our approach to collecting race/ethnicity and gender designations in some detail. One notable point is that unlike datasets that rely on respondents' own input, our designations are best described as race/ethnicity and gender \"appearance measures.\" This approach has both benefits and costs given our research objectives. Rather than delving into an extended conceptual discussion, we evaluate our data empirically. 8 8 The conceptual discussion is important but beyond the scope of the present article. Briefly, the issue is that given the nature of our measures, there will surely be instances where we have identified someone as one race/ethnicity but they would self-identify differently. This brings up the sensitive topic of perceived versus self-identified race, which has a long history in the United States and elsewhere, and remains policy relevant contemporarily. For example, the Brazilian government recently set up controversial boards charged with externally determining an Specifically, we ask how well the racial/ethnic and gender shares in our data compare to related available numbers. Table 2 compares the race/ethnicity and gender shares in our data with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) from 2014 (i.e., the most recently available data from IPEDS). IPEDS data can be used to measure faculty diversity at universities but the data are not broken out by field. We compare the race/ethnicity and gender shares in our full sample to the full IPEDS sample of Research-I universities, and to IPEDS data from the same 40 institutions we study. Overall, the race/ethnicity and gender shares in our data are a close match to the IPEDS shares, particularly when one recognizes that we sample a small and selected fraction of the academic departments upon which the IPEDS numbers are based. 9 While the comparisons in Table 2 are of some comfort and suggest that our data are broadly consistent with related data from other sources, surely there are some inaccuracies. To quantify the scope for errors in our data, we examine the inter-rater reliability of faculty designations by using two different raters to code race/ethnicity and gender designations for 400 faculty in our dataset. This exercise yields high inter-rater reliabilities. For the racial/ethnic designations interrater reliability is 95.5 percent; for the gender designations it is 99.75 percent (i.e., 1 inconsistency in 400). Table 3 shows field-specific race/ethnicity and gender representation in our data. We also show population shares using data from the 2010 Census as one point of comparison for the faculty individual's race in affirmative action cases, rather than relying on self-reported race (Garcia-Navarro, 2016). For the purposes of our study, the key empirical point is that our appearance measures line up well with self-identified measures from other sources (namely IPEDS; see below). 9 The shares of underrepresented minorities in biology, chemistry, and economics in our data also align closely with shares reported for the same fields by Nelson and Brammer (2010) (Nelson and Brammer do not study non-STEM fields). However, we hesitate to draw too strong of inference from this comparison because their sample includes selective private universities and is therefore less comparable to our public-university sample."}, {"section_title": "Racial/Ethnic and Gender Representation Among Faculty", "text": "representation numbers. Another useful comparison is to the pool of qualified workers, which we address below in Table 4. Starting with Table 3, our data highlight a stark contrast dividing the STEM fieldsbiology, chemistry, and economicsand non-STEM fieldseducational leadership and policy, English, and sociology. Black and Hispanic representation in STEM ranges from 0.7-2.9 and 2.5- In Figure 1, we provide complementary information to Table 3 by documenting differences in representation in STEM and non-STEM fields between assistant and associate/full professors. The rank separation is of interest for two reasons. First, representation at the assistant-professor level can be viewed as a leading indicator of faculty diversity in the future. 10 The comparison reveals that representation of Asian, Hispanic and female faculty among assistant professors is significantly higher than among associate/full professors, particularly in STEM fields. However, for black faculty, while there is a modest increase in representation in non-STEM fields, there is no indication of diversity progress in STEM in the assistant professor data. The second benefit of focusing on assistant professors is that it allows us to connect representation among young faculty to recent PhD production rates by field, as indicated by the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The SED is a national survey of recent doctoral recipients. In Table 4, we show PhD production rates by race/ethnicity, gender, and field for U.S. citizens and permanent residents from the SED, which we compare to racial/ethnic and gender shares among assistant professors in our data. 11 Because the selective public universities in our sample are likely to draw primary from selective programs for new hires, we limit the SED production data to include only universities in the top-50 of the U.S. News rankings, inclusive of private universities. The SED data are taken from the 2013-14 academic year; PhD production rates in 2013-14 should be highly relevant for assistant professors in 2015-2016. 12 The patterns in the SED data broadly reflect patterns in our assistant professor data. This  "}, {"section_title": "Wage Decompositions", "text": "In this section we decompose racial/ethnic and gender wage gaps into their observed components using the method of Gelbach (2016). The foundation of our decompositions is the following linear regression model: In Equation 2, ijk Y is the annual salary for faculty member i at university j in field k, in dollars. 13 as it is the most predictive over wages. We interact the normalized h-index with field indicators to allow for differential returns to productivity across disciplines. In Appendix Table B.4 we confirm that our wage-gap findings are qualitatively unaffected if we include all three Scopus\u00a9 measures simultaneously in the model. Finally, for the prestige of the Phd-granting institution, we use the categories shown in Table 1 to divide universities. We also include missing-data indicators as appropriate in cases where some data elements are unavailable for individual faculty. 15 Table 5 shows racial/ethnic and gender wage differences estimated from progressively detailed models. Column (1) reports unconditional wage gaps from a model that excludes the Xvector and university and field fixed effects. Column (2) adds university fixed effects, column 3adds field fixed effects, column (4) adds the prestige of the PhD-granting institution, column (5) adds experience, and column (6) adds the normalized h-index interacted with field, which fills out the full model as shown in Equation (2). We include individuals with unknown race/ethnicity and gender for completeness in the models; however, as indicated by Table 1, they account for a very small fraction of our sample (less than 0.5 percent) and thus strong inference is not warranted. The coefficients for the control variables are omitted from Table 5 for brevity but provided for interested readers in Appendix Table B.5. Column (1) of Table 5 shows that unconditional wage gaps favor white faculty and men, who are the omitted groups. In the racial/ethnic comparisons, black and Hispanic faculty have significantly lower wages than white faculty, on the order of roughly $10-15,000 annually, or 8-12 percent of the average wage ($120,195; see Table 1). Next, in order to understand the factors that drive observed wage gaps, we decompose the gaps into the following components: (1) differences in universities, (2) differences in fields, differences in experience, (4) differences in the prestige of the PhD granting institution, and 5differences in research productivity. It may be tempting to read across the columns in Table 5 to assess the relative importance of these factors. However, this can be misleading because the order 16 Our finding for current faculty that racial/ethnic wage gaps can be explained by observed factors is generally in line with previous findings using older data in Porter, Toutkoushian, and Moore (2008) and Toutkoushian, Bellas, and Moore (2007). Similarly, Ginther and Hayes (2003), Porter, Toutkoushian, and Moore, (2008), and Toutkoushian, Bellas, and Moore (2007) find unexplained gender gaps even after conditioning on observable factors. by which the variables are added can affect their implied explanatory significance. Gelbach (2016) shows that a number of previous high-profile studies have inaccurately estimated component weights in various decomposition exercises by relying on sequence-dependent methods. The sequence-invariant method developed by Gelbach (2016) and used in our study solves this problem. The key feature of Gelbach's approach that makes it order invariant is that the parameter estimates upon which the decomposition is based come only from of the full specification. Intermediary specifications are ignored. We illustrate following Gelbach's notation. Suppose we have an nx1 outcome vector, Y, and two nxk matrices of independent variables, X1 and X2, where X1 includes the group indicator variables (i.e., indicators for the groups between which we want to decompose outcomes) and the constant and X2 includes other covariates. Define \u0302 as the estimated coefficients on X1 in a baseline specification that excludes the covariates in X2, and \u0302 and \u0302 the estimated coefficients on X1 and X2 in the full specification. Gelbach notes that the difference between \u0302 and \u0302 is algebraically identical to the following sample omitted variables bias formula: 17 Thus, decomposing this formula is equivalent to decomposing the differences between the restricted-and full-model coefficients of interest: Defining X2k as the column of observations of the k th covariate in X2, Equation (4) indicates that the portion of sample omitted variable bias (\u0302k) due to X2k consists of two components: a) 17 \u0302 and \u0302 in our application are as reported in column (1) and column (6) of Table 5, respectively. \u0302= ( \u2032 ) \u22121 \u2032 , which is the estimated OLS coefficient from a regression of on ; and b) \u03022 , which is the estimated coefficient on X2k from the original, full specification. As a specific example consider our interest in how experience explains the gender wage gap among faculty. Intuitively, Equation (4) tells us that the explanatory power of experience depends on two factors: whether average experience differs by gender and whether years of experience conditionally influences salary. We decompose racial/ethnic and gender wage gaps into five covariate groups: university, field, experience, prestige of the PhD-granting institution, and research productivity. When the number of covariates is large as in our study, Gelbach proposes a way to simplify the computation process. First note that for covariate group g, the explained wage gap is \u0302= \u2211k \u2208group g . Defining a \"heterogeneity variable\" for each individual, \u0302( ) = 2 ( ) \u2032\u03022 , which reflects the estimated share of individual i's outcome attributable to the k th covariate, and summing over the covariates in group g (note that ( \u2032 ) \u22121 \u2032 does not vary with the index k), yields: The values in Equation 5, which capture the explanatory power for each group of covariates, g, can be recovered by applying the following procedure as outlined by Gelbach (2016, pp. 523): 1. Estimate the full model (in our application, this is the model shown in the last column of  The decompositions identify three factors that primarily explain observed wage gaps by race/ethnicity and gender: (1) academic field, (2) experience, and (3) research productivity. Although there is some variability in the importance of these factors across the gaps we consider, all three are generally important. 21 To elaborate briefly, field differences account for a substantial portion of the higher wages of white relative to black faculty, and men relative to women, but do not explain the wage gap between Hispanics and whites. For the Asian-white gap, field differences 18 The preceding paragraphs briefly summarize material in Gelbach (2016)additional details can be found in his paper. Gelbach (2016) also shows that this method nests the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, which under some assumptions can lead to additional insights about sources of unequal outcomes across groups. Also see Toutkoushian and Hoffman (2002) for more information about decomposition methods. 19 We do not decompose wage gaps for the groups with unknown race/ethnicity or gender because our sample sizes are too small for these groups to be informative (see Table 1). 20 That is, where the unconditional gap starts out negative but conditional on observable factors becomes positive (regardless of statistical significance). 21 Note that differences in the prestige of the PhD-granting institution do not explain faculty wage differences in our data (Appendix Table B.5), but this is surely driven by the fact that we condition on university of employment. If more prestigious universities place their PhD students at higher paying universities on average, this type of effect will not be reflected in our estimates. contribute positively because Asians tend to be concentrated in higher-paying fields than other faculty, including whites. Consistent with data from other occupations, we find significant wage returns to experience for faculty (see Appendix Table B.5), and Table 6 shows that a substantial share of each wage gap we consider can be explained by the fact that white and male faculty are more experienced than other groups, as illustrated by Figure 1. Figure 1 also implies a reduced role of experience in explaining wage gaps in the future. Finally, research productivity is a consistently important factor in explaining wage gaps by race/ethnicity and gender, accounting for at least 30 percent of the total gap in each comparison we consider. Tables 5 and 6 show that the racial/ethnic wage gaps are fully explained by the observable components in our data. On the one hand, this result is consistent with a lack of systematic bias toward specific racial/ethnic groups in hiring and wage negotiations. On the other, it is also consistent with universities placing little value on the diversity contributions of faculty per se, at least as measured by wages, although a caveat to this interpretation is that universities may be limited in how much wage flexibility they have. 22 It also bears mentioning that our models do not account for teaching or service contributions. Previous research on whether minorities and women are burdened by more service requirements and/or invest more time in teaching is mixed. While some studies find that these groups take on more service and invest more in teaching (Guarino and Borden, forthcoming; Menges and Exum, 1983), others find that they do not (Olsen, Maple, and Stage, 1995;Porter, 2007). 22 Given that universities may be constrained in their ability to manipulate wages to reflect diversity preferences, we also examined whether faculty who improve diversity receive their PhDs from less selective institutions than white men in our sample. With wage constraints, one way that universities could promote (and thus show that they value) diversity would be to recruit/accept faculty that improve diversity from less-selective PhD programs. However, conditional on being a faculty member at one of the institutions in our sample, we do not observe systematic differences in the prestige of the PhD-granting institution across race or gender groups (results omitted for brevity)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion & Conclusion", "text": "We use recent data from the 2015-16 academic year to examine faculty representation and wage gaps at 40 selective public universities. Our study focuses on six academic departments: biology, chemistry, economics, educational leadership and policy, English, and sociology. We show that the underrepresentation of black, Hispanic and female professors among faculty in these departments overall is driven predominantly by a lack of diversity in STEM fields. Non-STEM fields are much more diverse. Younger cohorts of faculty are more diverse than their senior colleagues in most respects, which projects for improved faculty diversity in the future. The trend toward diversity is particularly apparent in STEM fields. However, black faculty are an exception younger cohorts in STEM fields do not include more black faculty than older cohorts at the universities we study. Our wage decompositions identify three observed factors that explain racial/ethnic wage gaps in their entirety, and most of the gender wage gap: (1) academic field, (2) experience, and 3research productivity. These factors should be of focal consideration in policy efforts to ameliorate racial/ethnic and gender wage differences among faculty. We do not find any evidence of wage premiums associated with diversity per se, although for black faculty we cannot rule out a modest premium. We conclude by briefly addressing the policy implication of our finding that diversity is particularly lacking in STEM fields. If a rationale for policies to improve faculty diversity is to provide role models for underrepresented students, and if it is presumed that students will gravitate toward such role models, the current diversity imbalance in higher education implies that students from underrepresented groups may be nudged toward lower paying, non-STEM fields. 23 This would serve to perpetuate an already-existing imbalance in the workforce, both in academia and the broader labor market (e.g., also see Bayard et al., 1999;Carnavale et al., 2016). If an aim of diversifying the faculty is to promote better long-term outcomes for underrepresented students, targeted efforts to increase diversity in STEM fields may need to be an explicit objective. However, STEM specific considerations do not seem to be prominent in current policy discussions on faculty Notes: The rankings for PhD-granting institutions are taken from the 2016 U.S. News and World Report, inclusive of private institutions. There are 56 faculty in sampled English departments who do not have a PhD. These faculty have Master in Fine Arts (MFA) degrees instead (an MFA can be a terminal degree in the fine arts and performing arts). We report the sources of experience data where the options are (in order of our preference for where the data come from): (a) the faculty member's own profile based on the year the PhD was obtained, (b) the faculty member's own profile based on the year of the first publication, and (c) the year of the first publication reported in Scopus\u00a9. For two percent of faculty, we were unable to calculate experience using any of these three sources. Notes: Each cell reports the percent of the sample indicated by the column that is accounted for by the group indicated by the row. In the IPEDS data, we construct a comparable \"other/unknown\" group for race/ethnicity by combining faculty identified as \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" \"Two or More Races\" and \"Race/Ethnicity Unknown.\" The group of faculty identified as being of two or more races contributes to the larger \"other/unknown\" group in the IPEDS data; there is no way for us to code such a category in our study.

Each cell reports three numbers: (1) the contribution of the gap component measured in dollars, (2) the contribution of the gap component measured as a percent of the total gap (the total gap is shown in the bottom row of the table), and (3) the p-value for the statistical significance of the gap component calculating using Gelbach's (2016) method. Due to small sample sizes, we do not report decompositions for groups \"race other/unknown,\" or \"gender unknown\" (see Table 1). **/* Indicates statistical significance at the 5/10 percent level. Notes: This table breaks out the descriptive statistics shown in Table 1 "}]
