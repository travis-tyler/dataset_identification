[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "This report examines patterns and trends in the vocational/technical coursetaking of public high school graduates between 1982 and 1998. It updates and expands upon trends that were published in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) report Vocational Education in the United States: Toward the Year 2000 (Levesque et al. 2000). Specifically, the current report includes trends in the participation of graduates based on their special and protected population status, including race/ethnicity, sex, disability status, English proficiency, and several measures of student academic achievement, as well as school urbanicity and school poverty level. The report analyzes these trends by examining high school transcripts for the graduating classes of 1982, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1998.1 The analysis samples and variables used in the report are comparable across the survey years. The analysis focuses on public high school graduates who earned regular or honors diplomas.2 1These transcript studies were conducted as part of the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Sophomores, \"High School Transcript Study\" (HS&B-So:80/82) regarding 1982 graduates; the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88/92), \"Second Follow-up, Transcript Survey, 1992\" regarding 1992and the High School Transcript Studies (HSTS) of 1990regarding 1990 2The HS&B and NELS studies excluded students with the most severe disabilities, where it was determined by school staff that these students were unable to complete the lengthy student questionnaires that were a part of these studies. In order to ensure comparability across the data sets, graduates with special education diplomas were excluded from the HSTS samples (Gifford et al. 1989;Tuma 1996). Thus, the samples used for this trend analysis were consistent with the population of public high graduates, including students with disabilities, who earned regular or honors diplomas in each of Transcripts provide information on the courses that public high school graduates took in grades 9 through 12. For simplicity's sake, the report refers to this information as \"high school coursetaking.\" With the exception of a few tables that examine coursetaking in each grade (9 through 12) separately, the report describes the cumulative coursework that graduates took in high school. The report is intended to accompany the NCES report Trends in High School VocationallTechnical Coursetaking: 1982 (Levesque 2003), which provides an in-depth examination of the vocational/technical coursetaking patterns of public high school graduates in general."}, {"section_title": "Terms Used in the Report", "text": "The Vocational/Technical Curriculum The NCES Secondary School Taxonomy (SST) classifies high school vocational/technical education into three different curricula: specific labor market preparation, or \"occupational education\"; general labor market preparation; and family and consumer sciences education. Occupational education consists of courses that teach skills and knowledge required in a particular occupation or set of related occupations. General labor market preparation consists of courses that teach general employment skills that are not specific to one occupational area, such as basic typewriting/ (1998 Perkins Act) defines \"special populations\" The 1990 Perkins Act, which governed the second half of the period covered in this report (1990 1998), defined \"special populations\" fairly similarly, including individuals with handicaps, educationally and economically disadvantaged individuals (including foster children), individuals of limited English proficiency, individuals who participate in programs designed to eliminate sex bias, and individuals in correctional institutions. In addition, the Office for Civil Rights (2001) in the U.S. Department of Education enforces federal statutes that prohibit discrimination in education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance (such as Perkins Act funds) on the following bases: race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age. To the extent possible, this report provides information on trends in the vocational/technical coursetaking of these special and protected populations, as well as their peers who were not members of these groups. To do so, the report uses the following categories. Measures were selected based on federal definitions, previous related research, and data availability. Data were provided iv 6 Executive Summary only for those years and surveys that contained comparable variables. For the sake of readability when summarizing findings, the report uses the terms disadvantaged and advantaged to describe student groups on some of the key variables, as indicated below.5 Race/ethnicity. Includes the five categories of American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; Hispanic; non-Hispanic Black; and non-Hispanic White. For simplicity's sake, the text refers to Black and White graduates, although students in both of these groups were also non-Hispanic. Sex. Includes the two categories of male and female. Disability status (grade 12). Includes students who were reported to have a disability and students who were reported to have no disability as of grade 12. It should be remembered, however, that graduates with the most severe disabilities were excluded from the analysis due to survey constraints. Consequently, the disability status variable identifies students with and without disabilities among the population of public high school graduates who earned regular or honors diplomas.6 For purposes of this analysis, students with disabilities were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while students without disabilities were considered to be more \"advantaged.\" English proficiency (grade 12). Includes the two categories of limited English proficiency 51n a few cases, advantaged students were further classified as moderately advantaged and highly advantaged. The race/ethnicity and sex categories were not classified according to advantage, because the Perkins legislation did not make this distinction for these variables. 6As of 1998, about 31 percent of students with disabilities held special education diplomas and were excluded from the study. and English proficient. It is important to note that this variable describes students' English language proficiency as of grade 12. For purposes of this analysis, graduates who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while graduates who were English proficient in grade 12 were considered to be more \"advantaged.\" The report uses the following three measures of academic achievement.7 Grade-point average (GPA). Calculated from grades recorded in the transcript files, this variable has a range of 0.0 to 4.0. It was not possible in some of the surveys to calculate GPA for academic courses only (a preferable measure of academic achievement), so overall GPA was used. GPA was collapsed into the three categories: high GPA (greater than 3.5); mid-level GPA (2.0 to 3.5); and low GPA (less than 2.0). For purposes of this analysis, students with a GPA of less than 2.0 were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students with a GPA of 2.0 to 3.5 were considered to be \"moderately advantaged\"; and students with a GPA of greater than 3.5 were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" Academic coursework completed. This variable describes whether students completed all low or all high mathematics, science, and English courses, or some other combination of mathematics, science, and English courses 7The final federal regulations to the 1990 Perkins Act used grade-point average to define academically disadvantaged individuals. The other two measures were suggested by previous research on whether vocational education has been a \"dumping ground\" for low academically achieving students (Boesel et al. 1994). The 1998 Perkins Act offered no additional guidance for identifying students with barriers to educational achievement, other than limited English proficiency. Executive Summary (mid-level or mixed academic coursetaking). Low and high mathematics, science, and English courses are defined in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C). For purposes of this analysis, students completing all low-level academic coursework were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students completing all high-level academic coursework were considered to be \"highly advantaged\"; and students completing mid-level or mixed academic coursework were considered to be \"moderately advantaged.\" Grade 9 mathematics. This variable identifies the mathematics course a student took in grade 9. It includes the three categories of high-level grade 9 mathematics (geometry or higher), mid-level grade 9 mathematics (prealgebra or algebra 1), and low-level mathematics (no mathematics or mathematics courses below pre-algebra). It provides a measure of academic achievement before most of graduates' coursework in vocational/technical education was taken and is therefore less confounded than either GPA or academic coursework completed with that coursetaking. For purposes of this analysis, students who took low-level mathematics in grade 9 were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students who took mid-level grade 9 mathematics were considered to be \"moderately advantaged\"; and students who took high-level grade 9 mathematics were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" Although a student-level measure of socioeconomic status would have been preferable for this analysis, such a variable was not available from . Instead, the report uses the fol-lowing two school-level variables as measures of economic status.8 School urbanicity. This variable describes the location of the school a graduate attended in the 12th grade and includes the three categories of urban, suburban, and rural. These categories are defined further in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C). School poverty level. This variable describes the proportion of students in the school a graduate attended in the 12th grade who participated in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). It includes the categories of high poverty (greater than 50 percent in NSLP) and low poverty (5 percent or less in NSLP), with a middle group having greater than 5 to 50 percent of students in NSLP. This variable also includes a category for students whose schools did not report their participation in NSLP. For purposes of this analysis, students in high-poverty schools were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while students in low-poverty schools were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" The middle group was considered to be of mixed advantage. The variable is defined further in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C). It should be remembered that there may be a fairly high correlation among some of these population variables. The report did not attempt to isolate the unique contribution of each factor to 8Section 421 of the 1990 Perkins Act included information on students in rural and urban areas in its identification of economically disadvantaged students. The final regulations to the 1990 Perkins Act also included eligibility for the National School Lunch Program in the definition of this group. The 1998 Perkins Act provided no additional guidance on defining economically disadvantaged students. vi Executive.Summary participation in vocational/technical education. Instead, the report describes bivariate relationships according to NCES standards for this type of analysis. See appendix C for additional information on the technical methodology used in the report.\nThe Vocational/Technical Curriculum High school vocational/technical education encompasses three different curricula: specific labor market preparation, or \"occupational education\"; general labor market preparation; and family and consumer sciences education (figure 1).3 Occupational education consists of courses that teach skills and knowledge required in a particular occupation or set of related occupations. For example, health care programs may prepare students specifically for dental assisting or nursing assisting, or more broadly for general health occupations. Although, traditionally, the main purpose of occupational education was to prepare students for entering specific occupations, occupational education may also prepare students for entering a related vocational/technical program in college. Based on SST classifications, occupational education in this report consists of the 10 broad and 18 narrow program areas shown in figure 1. General labor market preparation consists of courses that teach general employment skills that are not specific to one occupational area, such as basic typewriting/keyboarding, introductory technology education, and career preparation and general work experience courses. Family and consumer sciences education consists of courses intended to prepare students for family and consumer roles outside the paid labor market.4 For purposes of this report, trends focus on vocational/technical coursetaking overall and on occupational coursetaking. Among 1998 public high school graduates, 96.5 percent earned at least some credits in vocational/technical education in high school (table 1). In addition, 90.7 percent of 1998 graduates earned some credits in occupational education (table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Vocational/Technical Coursetaking in 1998", "text": "Overall Patterns Among 1998 Graduates Although most 1998 public high school graduates took at least some vocational/technical and occupational coursework, graduates who were members of disadvantaged groups generally took more vocational/technical and occupational coursework and were more likely to concentrate in occupational education than their counterparts who were members of more advantaged groups. These differences were apparent with regard to disability status in grade 12, GPA, academic coursework completed, grade 9 mathematics, and school poverty. One exception was that students who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 generally took less vocational/technical and occupational coursework and were less likely to concentrate in occupational education than their English proficient peers. In addition, male graduates took more vocational/technical and occupational coursework than female graduates, and students in rural schools took more such coursework than students in either urban or suburban schools. In contrast, Asians/Pacific Islanders generally took less vocational/technical and occupational coursework than graduates in other racial/ethnic groups, particularly Black and White graduates."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Occupational Concentrators From the Class of 1998", "text": "Although disadvantaged students were more likely to participate in vocational/technical education in general, and to concentrate in occupational education in particular, these students represented a minority of all occupational concentrators. In fact, when students were classified into three groups (low-, moderate-or middle-, and highadvantage), the majority of occupational concentrators (about 60 percent or more) came from the middle groups. This pattern was apparent with regard to GPA, academic coursework completed, grade 9 mathematics, and school poverty. In each case, either occupational concentrators were more likely to be from the middle groups than was the 1998 public high school class as a whole, or no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from these groups. Moreover, no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from the lowest academic achievement groups. However, occupational concentrators were less likely than the 1998 graduating class as a whole to be from the highest academic achievement groups. In the cases of disability status and English proficiency in grade 12, most occupational concentrators (more than 95 percent) came from advantaged (rather than disadvantaged) groups. While a larger proportion of occupational concentrators than the 1998 graduating class as a whole were disabled in grade 12, the proportion of occupational concentrators who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 was lower than that for all 1998 graduates. The majority of occupational concentrators (more than 50 percent) were White and were male. In fact, occupational concentrators were more vii Executive Summary likely to be male than the 1998 graduating class as a whole.9 With regard to school urbanicity, no school type enrolled a majority of occupational concentrators. However, occupational concentrators were more likely to attend rural schools than urban schools.10 While academically disadvantaged graduates were more likely than their more advantaged peers to concentrate in occupational education generally, this pattern was reversed to some extent in certain occupational program areas. Notably, higher achieving students were somewhat more likely than their lower achieving peers to concentrate in communications technology. Trends in Vocational/Technical Coursetaking: 1982Coursetaking: to 1998 The average number of credits graduates earned in vocational/technical education declined from 1982 to 1990, after which no significant changes were detected. One question of interest to policymakers is whether these declines occurred across the board or only among certain subgroups of students. Most often, vocational/technical coursetaking declines occurred among groups earning numbers of vocational/technical credits that were not statistically different from the average for all 1982 graduates. In comparison, there were few signifi-9No significant difference was detected in the proportions of occupational concentrators and all 1998 graduates who were White. 10No significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators who' attended suburban schools and those who attended schools in other locales. In addition, no significant difference was detected between occupational concentrators and all 1998 graduates based on school urbanicity. 11Because data for 1982 were not available, trends between 1982 and 1998 could not be determined with regard to English proficiency in grade 12 and school' poverty. cant changes detected in the average number of vocational/technical credits earned by several groups that earned above-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982. At the same time, there were no significant changes detected between 1982 and 1998 in the average number of vocational/technical credits earned by several groups that earned be/ow-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 compared with all 1982 graduates. As a consequence of these changes, there were few shifts among subgroups of graduates with regard to their relative vocational/technical coursetaking patterns over the period studied. That is, most groups that earned above-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 still earned above-average numbers of such credits as of 1998 (including low academic achievers and students attending rural schools). In addition, all groups that earned below-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 still earned belowaverage numbers of such credits as of 1998 (including Asians/Pacific Islanders and high academic achievers). Finally, despite the coursetaking declines noted above, most groups that earned numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 that were not statistically different from the average for all 1982 graduates were also in this middle coursetaking group as of 1998. In contrast to declines in vocational/technical coursetaking, there was no statistically significant change between 1982 and 1998 in the average number of occupational credits that graduates earned in high school. However, trends varied somewhat among student groups. For example, students with disabilities as of grade 12 took the equivalent of about one additional full-year occupational course, while Hispanic graduates took about one-half fewer occupational courses, by the end of the period.\nWhile disadvantaged students who were members of the class of 1998 were more likely than their more advantaged peers to participate in vocational/technical education in general, and to concentrate in occupational education in particular, these disadvantaged students represented a minority of all occupational concentrators. In fact, when students were classified into three groups (low-, moderate-or middle-, and high-advantage), the majority of occupational concentra-25There were too few 1998 graduates with a low GPA who concentrated in communications technology to produce a reliable estimate for this group. 26There were too few 1998 graduates completing all low-level academic coursework who concentrated in communications technology to produce a reliable estimate for this group. 27131ack graduates were also less likely than Hispanic graduates to concentrate in materials production programs. '17 4 4 tors (about 60 percent or more) came from the middle groups. In each case, either occupational concentrators were more likely to be from these middle groups than was the 1998 public high school class as a whole, or no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from these groups. This section compares the percentage distributions for all graduates (table 38) and for occupational concentrators (table 39) as of 1998. Disadvantaged students represented a minority of all occupational concentrators. About 5 percent or less of occupational concentrators who were members of the class of 1998 were disabled in grade 12, had limited English proficiency in grade 12, or completed all low-level academic coursework in high school (table 39). In addition, about 10 percent of occupational concentrators had a low GPA (less than 2.0) or attended high-poverty schools, and about 20 percent of occupational concentrators took low-level mathematics courses in grade 9. Although disadvantaged students were a minority of all occupational concentrators, a larger proportion of occupational concentrators than the 1998 graduating class as a whole were disabled in grade 12 (4.2 percent versus 2.8 percent) (tables 39 and 38, respectively). However, the proportion of occupational concentrators who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 was lower than that for all 1998 graduates (0.2 percent versus 0.7 percent). On measures that classified students into three groups (low-, moderate-or middle-, and high-advantage), most occupational concentrators (about 60 percent or more) were from the middle groups (table 39). In each case, the proportion of occupational concentrators who were from these middle groups was either greater than or not statistically different from the corresponding proportions for the 1998 class as a whole. Specifically, 79.5 percent of occupational concentrators versus 75.5 percent of all 1998 graduates had mid-level GPAs (2.0 to 3.5) and 87.8 percent of occupational concentrators versus 82.8 percent of all graduates completed mid-level or mixed academic coursework in high school (tables 39 and 38, respectively). The percentages of occupational concentrators who took mid-level mathematics courses in grade 9 or who attended middle-poverty schools were not statistically different from the corresponding percentages of all graduates who were from these groups. In comparison to the 1998 graduating class as a whole, occupational concentrators were less likely to be from the highest academic achievement groups. Specifically, occupational concentrators were less likely than all graduates to have a high GPA (10.5 percent versus 17.4 percent), to complete all high-level academic coursework (8.5 per-cent versus 14.9 percent), or to take high-level mathematics courses in grade 9 (14.3 percent versus 20.4 percent) (tables 39 and 38, respectively). However no significant difference was detected in the percentage of occupational concentrators and all graduates who attended low-poverty schools. In addition, no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from low-advantaged groups on measures that classified students into three groups (including GPA, academic coursework completed in high school, grade 9 mathematics, and school poverty level) (tables 39 and 38, respectively). A higher percentage of occupational concentrators who were members of the class of 1998 completed all high-level academic coursework than completed all low-level academic coursework in high school (8.5 percent versus 3.7 percent) (table 39). On the other hand, no significant differences were detected in the percentages of occupational concentrators who were in the most advantaged and most disadvantaged categories with regard to GPA (10.5 percent versus 10.0 percent) and school poverty (10.2 percent versus 10.7 percent). With regard to grade 9 mathematics, the percentage of occupational concentrators in the lowest achievement group was greater than the percentage in the highest achievement group (20.2 percent versus 14.3 percent) (table 39).28 The majority of occupational concentrators were White and were male (table 39). In fact, occupational concentrators were more likely to be male than the 1998 graduating class as a whole (58.6 percent versus 47.8 percent) (tables 39 and 38, respectively).29 With regard to school urbanicity, no school type enrolled a majority of occupational concentrators (table 39). However, occupational concentrators were more likely to attend rural schools than urban schools (40.1 percent versus 26.2 percent).\" No significant difference was detected between occupational concentrators and all 1998 graduates based on school urbanicity (tables 39 and 38, respectively). 28As explained in the Introduction, grade 9 mathematics is a better measure of prior academic achievement than either GPA or academic coursework completed, which measure cumulative high school achievement. 29No significant difference was detected in the percentage of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were White. 30No significant differences were detected in the percentage of occupational concentrators who attended suburban schools and those who attended schools in other locales."}, {"section_title": "0 Executive Summary", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trends in Occupational Concentrating", "text": "The percentage of public high school graduates who concentrated in occupational education declined from 33.7 percent in 1982 to 27.8 percent in 1990, after which no significant changes were detected. However, trends varied among student groups. Similar to the vocational/technical coursetaking changes noted above, declines in occupational concentration rates occurred most often among groups with concentration rates in 1982 that were not statistically different from the average for all 1982 graduates. In addition, there were few significant changes detected between 1982 and 1998 in the concentration rates for several groups that exhibited be/ow-average occupational concentration rates in 1982 compared with all 1982 graduates. As a consequence of these changes, most subgroups of graduates kept their relative occupational concentration status over the period studied. That is, most groups that exhibited above-average occupational concentration rates in 1982 still concentrated in occupational education at aboveaverage rates as of 1998 (including males and students completing all low academic coursework in high school). In addition, most groups that exhibited be/ow-average occupational concentration rates in 1982 still concentrated in occupational education at below-average rates as of 1998 (including females and high academic achievers). Finally, most groups that exhibited occupational concentration rates in 1982 that were not statistically different from the average for all 1982 graduates were also in this middle occupational concentrating group as of 1998. Trends in occupational concentrating also varied by program area. For example, while most student groups were more likely to concentrate in communications technology in 1998 than in 1982, no significant changes in concentration rates in this program area were detected over this period among Blacks, Hispanics, students with disabilities as of grade 12, students taking low-level mathematics in grade 9, and students in urban schools. In addition, while no differences were detected between 1982 and 1998 in overall rates of concentrating in marketing, print production, and computer technology, these program areas attracted somewhat higher academically achieving students over the period."}, {"section_title": "Gaps in Occupational Concentration Rates", "text": "Occupational concentration rates in specific program areas often varied by student race/ethnicity, sex, and disability status. Most differences in occupational concentration rates among racial/ethnic groups in 1982 were no longer detected by 1998.

However, some of these gender gaps decreased, particularly in business services where male graduates increased their concentration rate Over the period. With regard to disability status in grade 12, in no program areas were students with disabilities more likely to concentrate than students without disabilities in 1982.12 However, by 1998, students with disabilities as of grade 12 were more likely than those without to concentrate in agriculture, construction, mechanics and repair, and materials production."}, {"section_title": "Trends in the Characteristics of Occupational Concentrators", "text": "Some changes in the characteristics of occupational concentrators were consistent with changes 121n fact, students with disabilities were less likely than those without to concentrate in business services and in communications technology in 1982. However, these gaps were no longer detected as of 1998. Executive Summary in the student body in general between 1982 and 1998. For example, both graduates in general and occupational concentrators in particular became more academically advantaged by 1998. However, the shift toward moderate academic achievement was greater for occupational concentrators than for the larger group of graduates.\nOver time, some changes in the characteristics of occupational concentrators (graduates who earned 3.0 or more credits in one of the 10 broad occupational program areas in figure 1) were consistent with changes in the student body in general. In cases where trends for occupational concentrators were different from those for graduates in general, this pattern may signal that occupational programs attracted a different mix of students in 1998 than in 1982 that extended beyond general demographic and coursetaking trends. This section compares trends in the percentage distributions for all graduates in general (table 38) and for occupational concentrators in particular (table 39). Both public high school graduates in general (table 38) and occupational concentrators in particular (table 39) were more likely in 1998 than in 1982 to be Asian/Pacific Islander or Black, have no reported disabilities in grade 12, earn a mid-or high-level GPA (2.0 or higher), complete high-level academic coursework in high school, take mid-or high-level mathematics in grade 9, and attend urban schools.53 o The proportion of occupational concentrators who took mid-level mathematics in grade 9 grew more than the corresponding proportion for graduates in general (increases of 18 percentage points versus 10 percentage points) (tables 39 and 38, respectively). No other significant differences were detected in the rates of change for occupational concentrators and all graduates on any other variables. One discernible pattern from these findings is that both graduates in general and occupational concentrators in particular increased the level of their academic coursetaking between 1982 53The apparent increase in the percentage of occupational concentrators who attended urban schools was not statistically significant, although the increase for all graduates was. In contrast to these trends, between 1982 and 1998, both graduates in general and occupational concentrators in particular were less likely to earn a low-level GPA (less than 2.0); complete mid-level or mixed academic coursework in high school; take low-level mathematics in grade 9; and attend suburban schools."}, {"section_title": "Computer-Related Coursetaking", "text": "The SST currently includes all computerrelated courses (including those taught in mathematics and computer science departments) under the vocational/technical curriculum.

This report is intended to accompany the NCES report Trends in High School Vocational/Technical Coursetaking: 1982(Uvesque 2003, which provides an in-depth exainination of the vocational/technical coursetaking trends of public high school graduates in general. The 1998 Perkins Act defines \"special populations\" as follows: individuals with disabilities; individuals from economically disadvantaged families, including foster children; individuals preparing for occupations that are nontraditional for their gender; single parents, including single pregnant women; displaced homemakers; and individuals with other barriers to educational achievement, including individuals with limited English proficiency."}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "In addition, federal statutes protect against discrimination in education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance (such as Perkins Act funds) on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age (Office for Civil Rights 2001). For purposes of this report, \"protected populations\" include American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Blacks; females; and students with disabilities. To the extent possible, this report provides information on trends in the vocational/technical coursetaking of these special and protected populations, as well as their peers who were not members of these groups.\nclassification was applied to each of the five data surveys used in the analysis so that coursetaking was defined consistently over time. In addition to the name of a course, the transcripts also provide the number of credits a student earned for each course. Credits have been standardized across the survey years, so that 1.0 credit is equivalent to completing a course that meets one period per day for an entire school year. This is equivalent to a standard Carnegie unit. However, for simplicity's sake, the report refers to credits rather than Carnegie units.\nAlthough vocational/technical coursetaking is prevalent in high schools, students take varying amounts and types of these courses and take them for different purposes. It is therefore important to examine a range of measures when analyzing participation. The measures examined in this report follow in ascending order of restrictiveness. There is considerable overlap among the measures, as indicated below. Graduates earning greater than 0.0 credits in vocational/technical education. All of the following groups of students are subsets of this group. Graduates earning greater than 0.0 credits in occupational education. This measure is a subset of the previous measure. Graduates earning 3.0 or more credits in vocational/technical education. All of the following groups of students are subsets of this group. Graduates earning 3.0 or more credits in occupational education, regardless of whether they concentrate their occupational coursetaking in a single program area. This measure is a subset of the previous measure. Graduates earning 3.0 or more credits in one of the 10 broad occupational program areas in figure 1. These students are referred to in this report as occupational concentrators.5 This measure is a subset of the previous measure. In some cases, the report also examines trends in concentrating (earning 3.0 or more credits) in the 18 narrow occupational program areas in figure 1. Graduates earning 3.0 or more credits in one or more of the 10 broad occupational program areas in figure 1, with at least 1.0 credit in second-or higher-level courses or cooperative education courses.6 These students are referred to in this report as advanced occupational concentrators; they are included in tables but are not discussed in the text. In addition to tracking the percentages of public high school graduates satisfying the participation measures mentioned above, the report also examines the average number of credits earned by graduates in vocational/technical and occupational education. Although all of the above measures are discussed in this report or referred to in the tables, the report emphasizes the coursetaking 5This classification was also used in Levesque et al. (2000), in which students were referred to as \"vocational\" concentrators. In the few cases where students earned 3.0 or more credits in more than one of the 10 program areas, they were assigned to the program area in which they earned the most credits. 6The SST divides the occupational courses in each program area into four categories: first-level, second-or higher-level, cooperative education, and specialty courses. The first three categories generally represent sequential coursetaking.\npatterns of occupational concentrators because this group is a common focus of federal and state accountability and research efforts for vocational/technical education (U.S. Department of Education 2002;Silverberg et al. 2002).7\nEnglish proficiency (grade 12). Includes the two categories of limited English proficiency and English proficient. It is important to note that this variable describes students' English language proficiency as of grade 12. For purposes of this analysis, graduates who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while graduates who were English proficient in grade 12 were considered to be more \"advantaged.\" The report uses the following three measures of academic achievement. The final federal regulations to the 1990 Perkins Act used grade-point average to define academically disadvantaged individuals.12 The other two measures were suggested by previous research on whether vocational education has been a \"dumping ground\" for low academically achieving students (Boesel et al. 1994). Grade-point average (GPA). Calculated from grades recorded in the transcript files, this variable has a possible range of 0.0 to 4.0. It was not possible in some of the surveys to calculate GPA for academic courses only (a preferable measure of academic achievement), so overall GPA was used. GPA was collapsed into the three categories: high GPA (greater than 3.5); mid-level GPA (2.0 to 3.5); and low GPA (less than 2.0). For purposes of this analysis, students with a GPA of less than 2.0 were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students with a GPA of 2.0 to 3.5 were considered to be \"moderately advantaged\"; and students with a GPA of greater than 3.5 were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" Academic coursework completed. This variable describes whether students completed all low or all high mathematics, science, and English courses, or some other combination of mathematics, science, and English courses (mid-level or mixed academic coursetaking). Low and high mathematics, science, and English courses are defined in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C). For purposes of this analysis, students completing all low-level academic coursework were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students completing all high-level academic coursework were considered to be \"highly advantaged\"; and students completing some other combination of academic coursework were considered to be \"moderately advantaged.\" Grade 9 mathematics. This variable identifies the mathematics course a student took in grade 9. It includes the three categories of high-level grade 9 mathematics (geometry or higher), mid-level grade 9 mathematics (pre-algebra or algebra 1), and low-level mathematics (no mathematics or mathematics courses below algebra 1). It provides a measure of academic achievement before most of graduates' coursework in vocational/technical education I. Introduction was taken and is therefore less confounded than either GPA or academic coursework completed with that coursetaking. For purposes of this analysis, students who took lowlevel mathematics in grade 9 were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students who took mid-level grade 9 mathematics were considered to be \"moderately advantaged\"; and students who took high-level grade 9 mathematics were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" Although a student-level measure of socioeconomic status would have been preferable for this analysis, such a variable was not available from . Instead, the report uses the following two school-level variables as measures of economic status.14 School urbanicity. This variable describes the location of the school a graduate attended in the 12th grade and includes the three categories of urban, suburban, and rural. These categories are defined further in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C). School poverty level. This variable describes the proportion of students in the school a graduate attended in the 12th grade who participated in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). It includes the categories of high poverty (greater than 50 percent in NSLP) and low poverty (5 percent or less in NSLP), with a middle group having greater than 5 to 50 percent of students in NSLP. This variable also includes a category for students whose schools did not report their participation in NSLP.15 For purposes of this analysis, students in high-poverty schools were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while students in lowpoverty schools were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" The middle group was considered to be of mixed advantage. Students who did not have school-reported NSLP information were not classified according to advantage on this variable. The variable is defined further in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C). It should be remembered that there may be a fairly high correspondence among some of these variables, for example, between school poverty level and grade 9 mathematics taken. This report did not attempt to isolate the unique contribution of each factor to participation in vocational/technical education. Rather, the report describes bivariate relationships according to NCES 13The 1998 public high school graduates earned about 21 percent of their total vocational/technical credits and 16 percent of their total occupational credits in grade 9. 14Section 421 of the 1990 Perkins Act included information on students in rural and urban areas in its identification of economically disadvantaged students. The final regulations to the 1990 Perkins Act also included eligibility for the National School Lunch Program in the definition of this group. The 1998 Perkins Act provided no additional guidance on defining economically disadvantaged students. 15A substantial proportion (14 to 17 percent) of students did not have school-reported information on their school's participation in the NSLP. Consequently, a \"not reported\" category was included for this variable. standards for this type of analysis.

The analysis focuses on public high school graduates who earned regular or honors diplomas.2 A detailed description of the data surveys and the rules for including students in the analysis population are provided in appendix C. Transcripts provide information on the courses that public high school graduates took in grades 9 through 12. For simplicity's sake, the report refers to this information as \"high school coursetaking.\" With the exception of tables 7-10, which examine coursetaking in each grade (9 through 12) separately, the report describes the cumulative coursework that graduates took in high school. Researchers assigned codes to each course on a transcript according to the Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) (Westat 1992). This report then used the Secondary School Taxonomy (SST) to classify these codes into broader course groupings (Bradby and Hoachlander 1999). As figure 1 shows, the SST classifies high school courses into three main curricular areas (academic, vocational/technical, and enrichment/other) and their subareas. The same course 1These transcript studies were conducted as part of the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Sophomores, \"High School Transcript Study\" (HS&B-So:80182) regarding 1982 graduates; the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88192), \"Second Follow-up, Transcript Survey, 1992\" regarding 1992and the High School Transcript Studies (HSTS) of 1990regarding 1990 graduates, respectively. 2The HS&B and NELS studies excluded students with the most severe disabilities, where it was determined by school staff that these students were unable to complete the lengthy student questionnaires that were a part of these studies. In order to ensure comparability across the data sets, graduates with special education diplomas were excluded from the HSTS samples (Gifford et al. 1989;Tuma 1996). Thus, the samples used for this trend analysis were consistent with the population of public high graduates, including students with disabilities, who earned regular or honors diplomas in each of the study years. This restriction is consistent with NCES reports on high school vocational/technical coursetaking published over the last decade and is consistent with NCES procedures for transcript studies (Alt and Bradby 1999). In addition, there may be some minor coding differences between NELS and the other transcript data that may affect the data for 1992. See appendix C for more information.

While students develop technical skillsand use various technologiesthroughout the vocational/technical curriculum, it is not usually possible to determine from transcript records the specific kinds of technical skills developed or technology and equipment used in a particular course. However, as one measure of exposure to technical skills, this report examines participation in courses whose primary objective is to teach students computer-related skills and knowledge, referred to here as computer-related courses. The NCES standard procedures for transcript studies currently include all computer-related courses (including those taught in mathematics and computer science departments) under the vocational/technical curriculum (Alt and Bradby 1999). Although some of these courses are included in general labor market preparation (under typewriting/keyboarding and under technology education), most computer-related courses are included in occupational education. Most of these courses are included under the business services and computer technology program areas, while some are included under the agriculture, business management, and drafting/graphics program areas. Figure 2 summarizes the classification of all computer-related courses in the SST. Only a subset of courses in technology education, agriculture, business management, business services, and drafting/graphics areas were classified as computer related.8 In contrast, virtually all courses in typewriting/keyboarding and computer technology were so classified. There was one main exception to this classification scheme. According to recommendations made by experts during the revision of the SST, all typewriting/keyboarding courses in 1982 were assumed not to be computer related (Alt and Bradby 1999). In contrast, in 1990 and subsequent years, all of these courses were classified as computer related because it is not usually possible to determine from transcript records what kind of equipmentwhether a standard electric typewriter, an electric typewriter with computerized memory, or a computerwas used in a typewriting/keyboarding course. This decision may have iesulted in an undercount of computerrelated coursetaking in 1982 and an overcount in the 1990s, particularly in the early 1990s. The 7The U.S. Department of Education (2002) and Silverberg (2002) refer to this group as \"vocational\" concentrators. 81n all years studied, there was no detectable computer-related coursetaking in agriculture and business management. Therefore, these program areas were dropped from the analysis of computer-related coursetaking. I. Introduction magnitude of these potential miscounts is not known. Because it is difficult to determine the computer-related nature of typewriting/keyboarding courses and because the level of computerrelated coursetaking overall was very low in 1982, this report focuses on trends in computerrelated coursetaking for the years 1990 to 1998. See Levesque (2003) for a more detailed description of the computer-related course classification used in this report."}, {"section_title": "Key Population Variables", "text": "This report uses the following variables and categories to provide information on as many of the above-identified special and protected populations as possible, as well as on their peers who were not members of these groups. Measures were selected based on federal definitions, previous related research, and data availability. Data were analyzed only for those years and surveys that contained comparable variables. For the sake of readability when summarizing findings, the report uses the terms disadvantaged and advantaged to describe student groups on some of the key variables, as indicated below.9 Appendix C provides additional information on how these variables were constructed. Race/ethnicity. Includes the five categories of American Indian/Alaska Native;10 Asian/Pacific Islander; Hispanic; non-Hispanic Black; and non-Hispanic White. For simplicity's sake, the text refers to Black and White graduates, although students in both of these groups were also non-Hispanic. Sex. Includes the two categories of male and female. Disability status (grade 12). Includes students who were reported to have a disability and students who were reported to have no disability as of grade 12. It should be remembered, however, that graduates with the most severe disabilities were excluded from the analysis due to survey constraints. Consequently, the disability status variable identifies students with and without disabilities among the population of public high school graduates who earned regular or honors diplomas.\" For purposes of this analysis, students with disabilities were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while students without disabilities were considered to be more \"advantaged.\" 9In a few cases, advantaged students were further classified as moderately advantaged and highly advantaged. The race/ethnicity and sex categories were not classified according to advantage, because the Perkins legislation did not make this distinction for these variables. 1\u00b0Small sample sizes for American Indian/Alaska Native graduates (between 84 and 200 students versus 300 or more students in other racial/ethnic groups in each of the five years studied) resulted in relatively large standard errors and relatively unreliable estimates for this group. As a result, many large apparent differences between American Indian/Alaska Native graduates and other racial/ethnic groups were not statistically significant. 11As of 1998, about 31 percent of students with disabilities held special education diplomas and were excluded from the study."}, {"section_title": "Overall Trends", "text": "Patterns and trends in who participates in vocational/technical education must be examined in the context of general trends in vocational/technical coursetaking. This section summarizes key trends that were detailed in Levesque (2003). During the period examined in this report, students changed both the amount and nature of their high school coursetaking. In particular, between 1982 and 1998, public high school graduates increased their total and their academic coursetaking while they decreased their vocational/technical coursetaking, although most declines occurred by the early 1990s. The primary change in vocational/technical coursetaking was not in the proportion of high school students participating in vocational/technical education but in the amount of vocational/technical education they took. That is, the breadth of vocational/technical coursetaking declined slightly, while the depth of this coursetaking declined more steeply. In contrast to vocational/technical coursetaking overall, occupational coursetaking was relatively steady, with the average number of occupational credits that 1998 graduates earned in high school not statistically different from the average number earned by 1982 graduates. Consequently, occupational coursetaking became a more prominent part of vocational/technical coursetaking over the period studied. However, graduates were less likely to concentrate in occupational education (earn 3.0 or more credits in one of the 10 broad occupational program areas in figure 1) over this period. Many of these coursetaking changes coincided with changes in education policies emphasizing academic achievement (National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983;1998 Perkins Acts;and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994) and in the labor market demand for specific occupations (Levesque et al. 2000;Hurst and Hudson 2000)."}, {"section_title": "II.

Although most of these graduates took at least some vocational/technical and occupational coursework, graduates who were members of disadvantaged groups generally took more such coursework and were more likely to concentrate in occupational education than their counterparts who were members of more advantaged groups. However, the majority of occupational concentrators came from moderately advantaged groups, rather than from disadvantaged or highly advantaged groups.\n"}, {"section_title": "Overall Vocational/Technical Coursetaking Among 1998 Graduates", "text": "Although there were some differences among student groups who were members of the class of 1998 in the extent of their vocational/technical coursetaking, more than 90 percent of each identified student group took some vocational/technical coursework in high school, regardless of their special or protected population status (table 1).16 The 1998 graduates earned more than 2.6 vocational/technical credits on average equivalent to taking more than two and a half full-year vocational/technical courses, regardless of their special or protected population status (table 3).17 Generally, disadvantaged students were more likely to earn 3.0 or more vocational/technical credits in high school than more advantaged students (table 11), and they earned a larger number of vocational/technical credits on average than their more advantaged peers (table 3).

Selected Findings Trends in Vocationall/Technicall Coursetaking: 1982to 199831 Trends in Overall Vocational/Technical Coursetaking Between 1982, the primary change in vocational/technical coursetaking was in the amount of vocational/technical education that students took rather than in the proportion of students participating in vocational/technical education. The average number of credits graduates earned in vocational/technical education declined from 1982 to 1990, after which no significant changes were detected. However, during the 1990s, vocational/technical credits continued to represent a declining share of the total high school credits that graduates earned. This relative decline was due to the fact that public high school graduates earned on average more academic credits andto a lesser extentmore enrichment/other credits over this decade (Levesque 2003). Nonetheless, vocational/technical coursetaking remained a substantial part of each student group's coursetaking. Some exceptions to these overall trends are listed below. Almost all public high school graduates (more than 90 percent) took some vocational/technical coursework in high school, regardless of their special or protected population status (table 1).
