Even so, a stable method to compute transformation-invariant shape descriptors would be highly advantageous to this research field. Landmark based statistical shape analysis is a technique that has been adopted by a variety of fields, including anthropology, genetics, and evolutionary biology (e.g. Boyer et al., 2011 ) and now has been widely used for brain imaging research (e.g. Thompson et al., 2004; Van Essen, 2005; Glaun\u00e8s et al., 2004 ) . Although many prior approaches have tried to build cortical correspondence by aligning curvature, sulcal depth or other geometric maps (e.g. Fischl et al., 1999c; Argall et al., 2006; Lyttelton et al., 2007; Tosun and Prince, 2008; Yeo et al., 2010 ) ), there is increasing evidence that good relationships can be created between primary sulci and the boundaries of cytoarchitectonic fields in primary cortices ( Fischl et al., 2008 ) and it suggests that a landmarkbased method may provide better results for cortical surface shape analysis. Since the manual labeling of landmark curves is timeconsuming and error-prone, a variety of cortical landmark identification algorithms have been developed to delineate landmark curves rather than rely upon manual landmark placement (e.g. Le Goualher et al., 1999; Lohmann and von Cramon, 20 0 0; Cachia et al., 2003; Van Essen, 2005; Shattuck et al., 2009; Im et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2010 ) .\nIn addition to serving as common geometric constraints to help shape analysis of cortical surfaces, brain landmark curves are often directly analyzed to illustrate brain morphometry changes (e.g. Joshi et al., 2012; Chollet et al., 2014 ) . For example, Mangin et al. (2003) has studied sulcal patterns by enforcing rotational as well as scale invariance. Some prior work (e.g. Tao et al., 2001; Vaillant and Davatzikos, 1997 ) studied and compared landmark curves via unit speed parameterizations of active contours for constructing Procrustes shape average for sulci. With the current-based diffeomorphic approach, Durrleman et al. (2007) focused on detecting variability in the sulcal patterns without pursuing explicit point correspondences. Fillard et al. (2007) proposed a statistical representation for sulcal curves and measured variability by extrapolating a covariance tensor field to the whole brain. Joshi et al. (2012) further developed a reparametrization invariant shape space of sulcal curves and built statistical models intrinsically on the shape space. However, most of the prior landmark curve analysis frameworks mainly focused on the landmark curves themselves. Missing at this time is an algorithm that studies the global brain morphometry changes through the landmark curve analysis. Here we propose a novel and intrinsic method to compute conformal invariants (shape indices) on multiply connected surfaces and apply it to study brain morphometry by analyzing statistics based on landmark curves. Our conformal invariants are based on the surface conformal structure and can be accurately computed using the surface hyperbolic Ricci flow method.\nAll oriented metric surfaces have conformal structures. If there exists a conformal map between two surfaces, then they are conformally equivalent. All surfaces can be classified by the conformal equivalence relation. Any two conformally equivalent surfaces have the same coordinates in the Teichm\u00fcller shape space ( Luo, 1998 ) and the coordinates are invariant to conformal maps. We call them conformal invariants. By computing and studying conformal invariants and their statistical behavior, we may develop a promising approach for measuring local and global changes or identifying abnormalities in anatomical morphometry due to neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous changes caused by some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer' s disease (AD), may dramatically alter surface conformal structure so that measuring the conformal invariant changes may offer a set of stable and accurate shape indices for brain morphometry that may enrich our understanding of AD effects and enhance our image analysis schemes. Furthermore, our system may be complementary to other brain shape analysis techniques and advance further the use of imaging biomarkers for preclinical AD research ( Sperling et al., 2011; Caselli and Reiman, 2013 ) .\nIn this work, we develop a conformal invariant-based brain morphometry system based on hyperbolic Ricci flow ( Hamilton, 1988 ) and Teichm\u00fcller space coordinate theorem ( Luo, 1998 ) . Here we automatically trace six landmark curves on each cortical surface with the FreeSurfer ( Fischl et al., 1999a ) and Caret software ( Van Essen et al., 2001 ) to represent major anatomical and functional features. After slicing a cortical surface along these landmarks, we convert it to a multiply connected surface. We then compute its hyperbolic uniformization metric with the hyperbolic Ricci flow method ( Zeng et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2015 ) and isometrically embed it onto the 2D Poincar\u00e9 disk. The lengths of the landmarks in the hyperbolic parameter space form the proposed shape indices, which are the Teichm\u00fcller space coordinates of the multiply connected cortical surface. We validate the proposed method on some synthetic and longitudinal brain image data. We further apply our system to study brain cortical structural differences associated with baseline T1-weighted brain images from the ADNI dataset, including 30 healthy control subjects and 30 AD patients. Here we set out to test whether our new system can compute reliable shape indices and whether the new shape indices are able to capture brain morphometry abnormalities."}, {"section_title": "Methods and materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Theoretical background", "text": "In this section, we briefly introduce the most relevant theoretical background in conformal geometry, hyperbolic geometry, surface Ricci flow ( Hamilton, 1988 ) and Teichm\u00fcller space theory ( Gardiner and Lakic, 20 0 0 ) .\nConformal Deformation Let S be a surface in R 3 with a Riemannian metric g (defined in Appendix A ). Suppose u : S \u2192 R is a scalar function defined on S . It can be verified that \u1e21 = e 2 u g is also a Riemannian metric on S and angles measured by \u1e21 are equal to angles measured by g , which means the deformation of metrics from g to \u1e21 is angle-preserving. Then \u1e21 is called the conformal deformation of g and u is the conformal factor . Furthermore, when surface metric changes, surface Gaussian curvature K (defined in Appendix B ) will change accordingly to K = e \u22122 u (\u2212 g u + K ) , where g is the Laplace-Beltrami operator under the metric g ."}, {"section_title": "Uniformization Theorem", "text": "Given a surface { S , g }, there exist an infinite number of metrics that are conformal to g . The uniformization theorem states that, among all the conformal metrics, there exists a unique representative, which induces constant Gaussian curvature everywhere on S . Furthermore, the constant will be one of { 1 , 0 , \u22121 } . The corresponding metric is called the uniformization metric of S . Therefore, using the uniformization metric, one can embed the universal covering space of any closed surface onto one of three canonical spaces: the unit sphere S 2 for genus-zero surfaces that have positive Euler characteristics; the plane E 2 for genus-one surfaces that have Euler characteristic zero; the hyperbolic space H 2 for high-genus surfaces that have negative Euler characteristics.\nFundamental Group and Universal Covering Space Let S be a closed surface and q \u2208 S is a base point. Two loops through q are homotopic if one of them can deform to the other without leaving S . The concatenation of two loops is called their product. All homotopy classes of loops form the fundamental group of S , denoted as \u03c0 1 ( S, q ). By slicing S along the fundamental group of loops, we obtain a simply connected domain of S , i.e., a genuszero surface with a single boundary, denoted as \u02dc S . For multiply connected surfaces, their fundamental groups consist of paths that connect existing boundaries. An example of the fundamental group on a multiply connected cortical surface is illustrated in Fig. 2 (d ( Zeng et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2015 ) . Given a Riemannian manifold { S , g }, the normalized surface Ricci flow is defined as\n, where A (0) is the total area of S at time 0 and K ( t ) is the Gaussian curvature induced by metric g ( t ).

(1) can be found in .\nHyperbolic Geometry Suppose S is a surface, given its hyperbolic uniformization metric and \u02dc S , we can isometrically embed its universal covering space onto the hyperbolic space H 2 . The hyperbolic space cannot be realized in R 3 , thus we use the Poincar\u00e9 disk model to visualize it.

Conformal metric deformations, in the smooth case, preserve infinitesimal circles and the intersection angles among them. The discrete conformal deformation of metrics uses circles with finite radii to approximate infinitesimal circles.

We see some more differences on the MCI converter subject's longitudinal image data than the MCI stable subject.\nFurther, to illustrate the difference on each conformal invariant, we plotted the radar chart ( Chambers et al., 1983 ) in Fig. 6 (b) . Basically, a radar chart is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart where three or more quantitative variables are represented on axes starting from the same point. In our case, six landmarks are associated with six corners on a hexagon and six axes connect them to the common origin point. The position on each axis is proportional to the absolute difference between the computed conformal invariants on two time points. The more different, the farther away the point is to the origin. Meanwhile, we used two different color lines to connect the longitudinal differences from two different subjects, the blue color is for the MCI stable subject while the orange color is for the MCI converter subject. From the radar chart, we find that there is a clear difference between these two subjects' radar charts. Interestingly, we also found on the MCI converter radar chart, there are sharp differences associated with two landmark curves on the medial wall ventral segment and medial wall dorsal segment, especially on medial wall ventral segment. Since medial wall ventral segment runs along the medial margin of the hippocampal sulcus and medal wall dorsal segment runs along the corpus collosum ( Fig. 3 ) .

Our data set consisted of 60 subjects which were randomly chosen from ADNI database, including 30 AD subjects and 30 matching normal controls. The demographic information of these subjects is shown in Table 1 . The cortical surface of each subject was computed, from which six landmarks were extracted using the same method as that in the previous experiments. Similarly, we use the lengths of six landmarks in hyperbolic space as the conformal invariants to represent morphometric characteristics of cortical surfaces. Here, conformal invariants for each cortical surface for a given hemisphere was a vector\nwhere v i is the length of a given landmark under hyperbolic metric.\nSimilar to our prior work (e.g. Wang et al., 2011 ) , we performed the permutation based Hotelling' s T 2 test to evaluate group difference. Suppose there are two sets of feature vectors from two different groups, C = (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x m ) and W = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n ) , where m and n are the number of subjects in AD and the control group respectively.

We first compute the true group distance based on the true grouped samples. Then we randomly assigned the feature vectors into two groups each with the equal size number of 30 and re-computed group distance. The process was repeated 50 0 0 times with the outcome of 50 0 0 permutation values. Finally, a probability ( p value) was computed as the ratio of the number of permutation values greater than the true group distance to the total permutation times.

For comparison purpose, we also computed the natural lengths of the six landmark curves in the ambient space, as they are the counterpart of the proposed shape indices in the Euclidean domain. Similarly, we used Hotelling' s T 2 test to perform group comparison. With the same permutation test as above, the Euclidean lengths of the landmarks did not reveal significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0 . 7844 ).

Our empirical results demonstrated that it may be possible to use our proposed shape indices to detect AD related morphometric variation on group-based studies."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Application of the shape space concept to investigate brain morphometry changes can be used to evaluate disease burden, progression and response to interventions. In this paper, we introduced a novel Teichm\u00fcller shape space based automatic brain imaging system that focuses on studying six major landmark curves on human brain cortical surfaces. There are two main findings in our paper. First, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of applying the concept of Teichm\u00fcller shape space to study image based brain morphometry variance. The Teichm\u00fcller shape space is an abstract mathematical concept which reflects intrinsic surface conformal structure. Our prior work ( Zeng et al., 2012 ) has shown that the Teichm\u00fcller shape space could be applied to study certain brain functional area morphometry changes. However, that work strongly depended on the specific areas to be studied. In this work, we focus on six common landmark curves and compute the Teichm\u00fcller shape space coordinates when modeling them as open curves. The proposed method is general and has the potential to provide an integrated simple morphometry descriptor to brain shape analysis research. Second, we built an efficient and practical imaging analysis pipeline by integrating surface Ricci flow, hyperbolic geometry methods and other popular neuroimaging software tools such as FreeSurfer and Caret. The obtained image indexing system is robust and automatic and defined on 6 most common landmarks in human brains. The obtained imaging indices practically encode information about intrinsic surface conformal structure, providing a unique way to study subtle brain morphometry changes that may enrich current state-of-the-art brain morphometry analysis algorithms.\nThe proposed conformal invariant computation system is theoretically sound and numerically efficient ( Jin et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2015 ) . To evaluate its numerical stability, we randomly selected a baseline brain image from a healthy control subject. With FreeSurfer and Caret, we identified 6 landmark curves on its left cortical surface. We further used Loop subdivision ( Loop, 1987 ) to increase its face numbers and generated two additional surfaces. These three cortical meshes with some zoom-in snapshots are shown in Fig. 7 . Then we applied the same computational pipeline on these three cortical surfaces to compute their conformal invariants. The computed conformal invariants for three meshes are [3.44536, 3.11303, 4.75132, 3.5008, 5.88926, 4.67419], [3.37195, 3.16175, 4.87988, 3.40043, 5.96301, 4.74933] and [3.46745, 3.10535, 4.76 6 6, 3.4886 6, 5.83625, 4.75211] for three meshes with 145440, 20 0 0 0 0, and 581760 faces, respectively. We can see the results are quite similar and difference are less than 2% of the the original values. The empirical results demonstrate that our computation is robust and independent of the mesh resolutions.\nIt is well known that noise in MR images has an important influence on brain imaging study and many denoising algorithms have been introduced ( Wink and Roerdink, 2004; Nobi and Yousuf, 2011 ) . Thus an MRI analysis tool that is robust to image noise will be highly advantageous. To study the sensitivity of our method to image noise, we randomly selected an MR image from the ANDI baseline control dataset. As studied in ( Gudbjartsson and Patz, 1995 ) , the image intensity in MR images with noise present is governed by a Rician distribution, we manually added the Racian noise to the original MR image with standard deviation of 35, using the method as in ( Ridgway, 2007 ) . The raw images without and with noise are shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b) , respectively. With FreeSurfer and Caret, the reconstructed cortical surfaces overlaid with land- mark curves are shown in Fig. 8 , where (c) and (e) are the front and back views of the left cortical surface from the image without noise, (d) and (f) are from the noisy image. We can see that the reconstructed cortical surfaces and the landmark curves are very similar to each other. Then we computed the conformal invariants with both multiply connected surfaces and the resulting shape indices are [3.44536, 3.11303, 4.75132, 3.5008, 5.88926, 4.67419] for Fig. 8 (c, e) and [3.46495, 3.1554, 4.81487, 3.53899, 5.84046, 4.67932] for Fig. 8 (d, f) , respectively. We can see that the results are quite similar, even with a high image noise level. Although more carefully designed experiments are necessary, this simple experiment demonstrates that our method may be robust to noise in raw MR images.\nThe longitudinal MCI experiment presented in Section. 3.2 serves as a quick illustration to justify the relevance of our proposed work with the AD research. It is not expected that such a simple comparison would bring any new insights to the AD research. To do so, more rigorous test-retest population based studies are certainly necessary. Even so, our work shows that the posterior cingulate area is one of the areas that has the drastic shape changes over the study period. In the literature, the posterior cingulate is among a few structures that are affected significantly by the early stages of AD ( Buckner et al., 2008; Leech and Sharp, 2014; Matsuda, 2007 ) . In our prior work ( Shi et al., 2015 ) , we also found that subregions on lateral ventricles that are adjacent to posterior cingulate demonstrated significant enlargement in MCI converters. Thus our observation is consistent with AD research results in the literature. It indicates that our shape indices may be able to capture the brain shape morphometry that is associated with AD progress.\nThe current work is related to manifold shape space research, which was pioneered by Kendall (1977) and Bookstein (1978) . In image analysis research, shape space was well studied for brain atlas estimation ( Fletcher et al., 2009; Fletcher, 2013 ) , shape analysis ( Kurtek et al., 2011; Gutman et al., 2015; Su et al., 2015a ) , morphometry study ( Younes et al., 2009; Boyer et al., 2011 ) , and other applications. In a computational anatomy framework ( Grenander and Miller, 1998 ) , the space of diffeomorphisms was carefully studied ( Miller et al., 2002; Miller and Younes, 2001; Trouv\u00e9, 1998; Younes, 2010 ) . In Srivastava et al. (2005) , Younes et al. (2008) and Srivastava and Jermyn (2009) , shape space was defined as the space of orbits of the reparameterization group acting on the space of immersions. The reparameterization invariant (RI) metric constructed in Bauer et al. (2010) and Bauer et al. (2012) used the volume form and the mean curvature of the immersion f , and the metric in used the area multiplication factor of f . Kurtek et al. (2013) extended the work in by adding landmark constraints. Jermyn et al. (2012) simplified the RI metric computation and Gutman et al. (2015) recently built a Riemannian framework for an intrinsic comparison of the RI metric structure. Lipman and Daubechies (2011) introduced a metric for shape comparison based on conformal uniformization and optimal mass transport. The metric is invariant under M\u00f6bius transformation. Later, Lipman et al. (2013) provided a convergence analysis of the discrete approximation to the arising mass transport problems. M\u00e9moli (2011) presented a modification and expansion of the original Gromov-Hausdorff notion of distance between metric spaces which considers probability measures defined on measurable subsets of metric spaces. Recently, Riemannian optimal mass transport ( Ambrosio and Gigli, 2013; Su et al., 2015a ) was introduced. It was used to compute Wasserstein distance on sphere ( Su et al., 2015b ) and hyperbolic domain There are two important caveats when applying Teichm\u00fcller shape space coordinates for brain morphometry research. First, it demands more investigations on how useful the conformal invariants are for brain morphometry study. Further, it may be beneficial to apply our method if the users have some prior knowledge on the brain deformations associated with a specific neurodegenerative disease. Otherwise, one may have to screen a set of candidate curves to find which are the most sensitive to certain disease states. It demands some computation time to make it clinically useful. Even so, it is a natural idea that one can expect certain neurodegenerative diseases would have distorted conformal structures so that one can use the conformal invariants to measure the severity and develop an imaging biomarker. Our work provides unique measurements to quantify cortical surface deformations and associate them with some brain cognitive measures. Second, Teichm\u00fcller shape space remains a fast growing research field, including some recent seminal work in the pure mathematics society (e.g. Mirzakhani, 2008 ) . The current work presents our initial effort s to study the possibility for the Teichm\u00fcller shape space coordinates as a valid brain imaging biomarker. We hope our preliminary results could inspire new ideas on this topic and further advance brain morphometry research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and future work", "text": "In this paper, we propose a stable way to compute conformal invariants for multiply connected surfaces. With topology optimization, surface hyperbolic Ricci flow and hyperbolic embedding, we can conformally map a 3 D surface with open boundaries onto the Poincar\u00e9 disk. The lengths of the open boundaries on the multiply connected surfaces under the hyperbolic uniformization metric are the Teichm\u00fcller space coordinates, i.e. conformal invariants. The computed conformal invariants are robust to rigidbody transformations and conformal transformations of the surfaces from which they are derived. Local geometry is well preserved under conformal mapping so conformal invariants may be good candidate features for brain research on cortical and subcortical surface morphometries. The proposed method is part of our ongoing work on hyperbolic conformal geometry and its applications in brain imaging research. In ( Shi et al., 2015 ) , we studied ventricular enlargement in MCI converters using hyperbolic Ricci flow and surface tensor-based morphometry (TBM) ( Chung et al., 2008 ) . Based on this work, we developed a hyperbolic space sparse coding system . In , we computed the hyperbolic Wasserstein distance and applied it to an ADcontrol cortical surface classification problem and achieved an accuracy rate of 76.7%. This demonstrates that we may use hyperbolic Wasserstein distance as a single shape index to characterize a unique brain surface. These promising results encourage us to further explore the power of hyperbolic geometry. In future, we will continue working on computing novel surface features from surface hyperbolic conformal structure and studying their applications in AD diagnosis. The proposed conformal invariant-based shape indices are an integral part of our future work. Specifically, first, we will further validate the method with more imaging data; second, by applying some popular statistical classifiers, such as the support vector machine ( Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 ) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) ( Fisher, 1936 ) , we plan to carefully study and validate these conformal invariants for MCI conversion prediction and AD prognosis. Furthermore, we will also study more shape space invariants, such as the period matrix of high-genus surfaces for conformal equivalence ( Gu et al., 2004 ) , heat kernel descriptors for isometry equivalence , etc. These invariants may provide new reliable and intrinsic shape features.\nis funded by the National Institute on Aging, the National "}, {"section_title": "Appendix A.
