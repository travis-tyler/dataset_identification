[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to identify a factor structure between variables-interest in broad science topics, perceived information and communications technology (ICT) competence, environmental awareness and optimism; and (2) to explore the relations between these variables at the country level. The first part of the aim is addressed using exploratory factor analysis with data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 15-year-old students from Singapore and Finland. The results show that a comparable structure with four factors was verified in both countries. Correlation analyses and linear regression were used to address the second part of the aim. The results show that adolescents' interest in broad science topics can predict perceived ICT competence. Their interest in broad science topics and perceived ICT competence can predict environmental awareness in both countries. However, there is difference in predicting environmental optimism. Singaporean students' interest in broad science topics and their perceived ICT competences are positive predictors, whereas environmental awareness is a negative predictor. Finnish students' environmental awareness negatively predicted environmental optimism."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Environmental issues are one of the primary concerns for future living. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been promoting the importance of environmental education for a sustainable future for more than four decades [1] . The concepts of environmental education have shifted from early focuses on ecosystems and forms of pollution to increasing recognition of sustainable development [2] . How advances in technological development and understanding of scientific knowledge are coordinated to foster awareness of the environment to bring us a greener future is a key to sustainable development [3] . This study compares the data associated with teenagers' perceived technology competence, science interest, environmental awareness, and optimism from two of the top-performing countries in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The research aims to evaluate how top-performing PISA countries are faring in educating the next generations for sustainable living.\nIn the context of contemporary education, integration of science and technology in teaching and learning is key to enhancing learners' 21st century competences [4] . While science provides the essential knowledge for people to address emerging environmental issues, information and communications technology (ICT) provide wide access to updated scientific knowledge, cognitive tools to model the problem and solution, and collaborative platforms for joint endeavors [5] . In other words, environment, and become aware of the environment [24, 25] . In the classroom, ICT is an important technological tool to support students in mapping out the multiple interconnected causal relationships that crisscross environmental issues. For example, Crawford, Holder, and O'Connor (2017) engaged learners in using mobile technologies to connect to the natural environment, and found that it can foster their environmental identity [26] . Ramasundaram, Grunwald, Mangeot, Comerford, and Bliss (2005) pointed out that learners who studied environmental issues in a simulation environment had opportunities to be involved in scientific investigations [27] . Kamarainen et al. (2013) combined an augmented reality application and environmental probes and found that it was able to enhance learners' ecosystem science knowledge and skills, and their valuation of environmental monitoring [28] . In the field of education, studies of ICT-based instruction have generally indicated positive effects on learning [29] . The topic of sustainable development has been strongly supported by ICT and integrated into higher education in recent years [30] . Yet few studies have explored whether secondary students' ICT competence would lead to a better understanding of the environment. While the relationship between uses of ICT, literacies, and academic achievement has been the focus of many studies using PISA and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data, researchers have apparently not drawn on PISA data to study the relationship between contemporary teenagers' ICT competence and their environmental awareness. We argue that this should be investigated to provide robust grounding to inform future science, technology, and environmental education practices.\nIn other words, with the rapid development of scientific knowledge and new technologies, there are ample opportunities for the integration of these subject matters to be anchored in environmental issues situated in everyday life. Learners can actively participate in the problem-solving processes to construct actionable ideas pertaining to sustainable development [31] . It is pedagogically beneficial to associate science and environment as an interdisciplinary subject and to integrate technology to help learners become active participants in environmental issues [12, 17] . In this paper, we used data from PISA 2015, and hypothesized that adolescent students' interest in science topics and ICT skills may predict their awareness of environmental challenges.\nStudents' interest in science topics is critical for understanding past, current, and future environmental issues [12] . ICT application could also contribute to reducing environmental issues such as the reduction of paper usage through e-learning and e-government [32] . With the advent of technology, ICT provides opportunities to build scientific knowledge and to take action to address environmental challenges (e.g., technology-supported inquiry-based, interdisciplinary learning) [20] . This paper aims to map out the potential relationships of students' interest in science topics, perceived ICT competence and environmental awareness to predict the environmental optimism of future living."}, {"section_title": "Contexts in Singapore and Finland", "text": "The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) provides a quantitative basis covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality for 180 countries.

Finland represents a Nordic education system and Singapore represents typical Asian education. They were selected for comparison in this study. Singapore and Finland are both high-performance countries in international assessment such as TIMSS and PISA. In PISA 2015, Singaporean and Finnish students ranked top of the science assessment. Both the Singaporean and Finnish curricula show an emphasis on aims for the integration of science-related, ICT-based knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values.

It has evolved into a highly competitive country with new ways of working and new technologies. Singapore reflects high-quality educational outcomes that rank first in science, mathematics, and reading performance as seen in the PISA results [33] .\nSingapore is renowned as a Garden City with remarkable green spaces and infrastructure [34] . Nonetheless, the country faces environmental issues such as limited land space, water, and waste problems. The emerging challenge of balancing economic imperatives with the need to conserve the natural environment needs to be addressed. Therefore, sustainable development is viewed as a top goal to be achieved [35] . Regarding knowledge of the environment, it is integrated into various subjects such as social studies, geography, moral education and the sciences as a cross-curriculum topic. It is taught through experiential learning methods to promote students' awareness [36] . The intention of environmental education in schools is progressive, and tailored with science education with the aim of acquiring knowledge (e.g., impacts of pollution and global warming, deforestation and environmental conservation in science), values (e.g., understanding of biological ecosystems in Singapore, the responsibilities of Singaporean citizens in social studies) and action (solutions to achieve environmental sustainability in geography, science and social studies) (see: https://www.moe.gov.sg/ news/parliamentary-replies/environmental-education).\nRegarding ICT and learning, Singapore has national plans for integrating and implementing technology coordinated with curricula, pedagogy, assessment, teacher professional development, and school reform.

In Finland, sustainable development has been brought into mainstream policies since 1993, and the integration of environmental issues in education has been extended through new learning curricula and teachers' training. The Finnish National Core Curriculum for Basic Education pointed out that environmental issues are studied across the curriculum in science subjects, such as in biology and geography, to reach the goal of education for sustainable development (ESD) [31] . Finland is surrounded by natural resources and has a long-standing commitment to support and promote sustainable development. The sustainable development element has been one of the seven topics emphasized in the national core curriculum for basic education since 2006. Since 2013, approximately 40% of schools have had a sustainable development plan in place [40] . Students learn to understand the interrelation between human beings and the natural environment, and raise awareness of the environment and commitment to building a sustainable future [41] .\nIncreasingly, environmental education is performed in various forms of integrated curricula and pedagogies (e.g., project-based collaboration; see, for example, [41] ; inquiry-based learning; see, for example, [42] ). Therefore, students have opportunities to learn about complex and real-world problems related to the environment within and outside of school science subjects [43] . They are also encouraged to share and create scientific knowledge that paves the way for sustainable development [41] .\nStudies have also shed light on the uses of ICT in recent science and environmental education [24, 44] . The Finnish National Core Curriculum indicates that \"competence in information and communication technology\" and \"participation, involvement and building a sustainable future\" are transversal competences in the Finnish National Core Curriculum (see: https://www.oph.fi/sites/default/files/ documents/new-national-core-curriculum-for-basic-education.pdf). ICT education in Finland is guided by a clear vision of how the availability of ICT-related skills and capacities could facilitate learning and concerns of environmental issues [24] . The cross-curricular projects not only emphasized social competencies such as collaboration, but also characterized innovative ICT skills to engage learners in active and independent learning to search for, organize, and analyze information, and to communicate and propose their ideas in various media forms [44] .\nIn the present study, we considered four factors assessed in PISA 2015, including students' interest in broad science topics, perceived ICT competence, environmental awareness, and environmental optimism.

Our study proposed that interest in science-related topics and perceived ICT competence are critical for understanding past, current, and potential future environmental issues, particularly the human-caused environmental problems. We analyzed data collected in the PISA 2015 assessment. This study brings students' interest in broad science topics, perceived ICT competence, environmental awareness, and environmental optimism together.\nFirst, we were able to identify a comparable factor structure to compare the two countries. This indicates that future researchers who are interested in understanding the relationship between science interest, ICT competence, environmental awareness, and optimism could use the PISA data to understand how various countries are leveraging these factors to promote environmental education. There should perhaps be more comparative studies, especially when the countries' environmental education has been well articulated and implemented. We chose Singapore and Finland as two contrasting high performing countries with different cultural roots, and our findings indicate that there are some differences.\nSecond, with regard to the differences, t-tests revealed that, compared to Finnish students, the Singaporean students had higher levels of interest in broad science topics, perceived better ICT competence, and had more environmental awareness. On the other hand, this study highlighted that Singapore and Finland did not differ significantly in terms of environmental optimism. These differences seem to reflect the general differences between the two countries in the achievement scores. Singapore as a small nation is placing much emphasis on science, and ICT in education [36] and it is facing obvious environmental threats due to rising sea level and haze problems from neighboring countries.\nNext, the Pearson's correlation analyses showed that the associations of the students' interest in broad science topics, perceived competence in ICT uses and environmental awareness were positive in both countries. However, environmental awareness and optimism were negatively associated. Results also showed that Singaporean students' perceptions of ICT competence were positively associated with environmental optimism, indicating that they had a higher degree of familiarity with ICT uses, and this could contribute to more optimistic outlook about improvements in these environmental issues. The underlying belief the result reflects could be that technology is a solution to environmental problems. In Finland, students had a higher degree of interest in broad science topics and were negative about environmental improvements. This could imply that students may believe that science is insufficient to resolve environmental issues. In either case, further qualitative research is needed to further unpack the relationships unearth in this study.\nAccording to the results obtained from the multiple linear regression analyses, both countries reported that students' interest in broad science topics predicted their competence in ICT. Moreover, students who were characterized as having interest in broad science topics, as well as possessing ICT competence, manifested concerns about the environmental issues. Regarding environmental optimism, Singaporean students' interest in broad science topics and perceived ICT competence were positive predictors, whereas environmental awareness was a negative predictor. This is aligned with studies indicating that increasing interest in scientific knowledge and the uses of ICT could provide directions to successfully resolve environmental problems [51] . For example, the capabilities of ICTs and other related technologies can be employed to identify environmental problems, collect environmental information, and find solutions to environmental problems. In the Finland data, environmental awareness was the only negative predictor of environmental optimism. It is worth noting that in Finland, students gain scientific knowledge based on craft activities rather than technology. Although research has pointed out that Finnish students were being motivated to learn how to protect the environment with the help of technology [52] , there is still a considerable amount of work to do in developing a more technology-integrated learning environment."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Limitations", "text": "Engaging youth as environmental citizens and developing their ability to identify the global environmental issues have been promoted [53] . Since PISA 2006, there have been investigations of students' environmental awareness and responsibility. This study provides robust evidence that advocating a sense of environmental awareness and optimism were supported by students' positive interest and engagement in science and ICT competences. However, further studies on exploring the relationship between science interest, ICT uses, and environmental literacy are needed. In parallel, teachers' environmental literacy and training should also be considered [54] .\nThe findings in the present study showed that the prediction of Singaporean students' environmental optimism was mediated through positive students' interest in broad science topics and ICT competences. They may be more ready to use their science knowledge to understand environmental issues and design solutions with the help of ICT. Results from PISA 2015 indicated that Singaporean students outperformed in science, mathematics, and reading assessment. The present study further explored and provided evidence that Singaporean students are able to discover broad scientific interest in the context of massive information flows. They are also able to use ICT and have developed a greater understanding of environmental literacies.\nAlthough results show that Finnish students' interest in science and perceived ICT competence did not predict their environmental optimism, new Finnish curriculum reforms from August 2016 have introduced multi-disciplinary learning and competences such as multi-literacy and ICT, and are working to develop a better integration of science, technology and environmental education (see: https: //www.oph.fi/sites/default/files/documents/new-national-core-curriculum-for-basic-education.pdf).\nIn this study, we examined factors that influence students' environmental awareness and optimism with students from Singapore and Finland. The aim is to contribute to the promotion of environmental awareness among students in education. However, there are some limitations to the present study that should be noted. For one, the PISA assessment is not a curriculum survey to assess students' learning outcomes. Students report self-evaluations of their learning, motivation, interests, and perceptions related to science, technology, and the environment. The interpretation of PISA data should be more cautious. Next, the purpose of this study is to provide insights into more understanding of adolescents' science interest, ICT competence and environmental literacies in two countries, but its application in various other countries needs further study. Third, the secondary data analysis is limited to what is taught in school classes and might not be well-connected to national policies. This study identifies science as the foundational discipline that predicts Singapore and Finland students' environmental literacy. In addition, students' ICT confidence could also influence their environmental literacy. Given the ubiquitous access to ICT, it is likely to be a good means to promote students' environmental literacy. Our findings, however, indicate that there seems to be room for improvement in promoting environmental education for students and future generations.\nLastly, some researchers, as pointed out by one of the reviewers for this study, hold the view that PISA data should be treated as qualitative variables since the Likert scale was employed to elicit students' responses. Consequently, they would suggest that the appropriate statistical analyses should be non-parametric method such as Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman instead of Pearson correlations. We conducted the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlations as appended in Appendices B and C for the readers' reference. The notable changes as indicated are that the non-significant finding in environmental optimism (see Appendix B is related to Table A2 ) has become significantly different and that the positively significant correlations among Singaporean students between perceived ICT competence and environmental optimism is reversed as significantly negative (see Appendix C in relation to Table A3 ). Overall, using a non-parametric test may result in slightly different findings and it can be an alternative way to explore the PISA data. However, such differences would require discussion of methodological issues that is beyond the focus of this study.
