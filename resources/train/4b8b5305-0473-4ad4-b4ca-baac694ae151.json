Here we aimed to study the role of other neurotransmitter pathways in AD pathology.\nObjective: This study aimed to determine associations between AD pathology at both symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of disease progression, and the metabolism of a range of non-cholinergic neurotransmitters. Methods: Tissue samples were obtained from three groups, controls, AD, and 'asymptomatic AD' (ASYMAD), i.e., cognitively normal individuals that had significant AD neuropathology. Three brain areas were studied, the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and the cerebellum. Results: 12 of 15 metabolites involved in neurotransmitter metabolism were shown to be associated with AD pathology. Decreases in dopamine were most pronounced in the MFG with lower levels seen in the ASYMAD group compared to control (FC = 0.78, p = 2.9 \u00d7 10 -2 ). In the ITG significant changes were seen in GABAergic and serotonin metabolism between control and AD patients; however, these changes were not seen between control and ASYMAD individuals. Conclusion: These results indicate that dopamine could be depleted in brains with AD pathology but intact cognition, while an imbalance of several neurotransmitters is evident in the brains of AD patients."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Dementia is a devastating illness for both patients and their families, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) estimated to account for up to 80% of total dementia cases. The 'World Alzheimer's Report 2015' 1 estimates that there are approximately 46 million AD patients worldwide, with this number expected to rise to over 130 million by the middle of the century [1] . As well as a significant human cost, AD also represents a major financial burden with worldwide costs related to AD expected to reach $1 trillion dollars in 2018 [1] .\nCholinesterase inhibitors make up three of the four approved AD treatments (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), making inhibition of acetylcholinesterase the leading therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD symptoms [2, 3] . There is a significant body of literature suggesting that the cognitive deficits associated with AD are the result of lower levels of acetylcholine in the brain resulting from dysfunction of cholinergic neurons [4] [5] [6] . The role of non-cholinergic neurotransmitter systems in AD pathogenesis has received less attention. While levels of non-cholinergic neurotransmitters in the brain have been associated with AD pathology [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , their role in mediating the onset of symptoms is less well understood. In this study, we analyzed data from a non-targeted metabolomics platform to compare differences in neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter-associated metabolite levels in brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We studied three groups of BLSA participants, AD patients, cognitively normal controls, and 'asymptomatic AD' (ASYMAD), i.e., individuals with significant AD neuropathology at death but with no evidence of cognitive impairment during life. We studied three distinct brain regions in these individuals that are differentially affected pathologically: the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) which is vulnerable to neurofibrillary tau tangles, the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) which is susceptible to the accumulation amyloid-\u2424 plaques, and the cerebellum which is resistant to classical AD pathology [12] . This study aimed to determine if non-cholinergic neurotransmission might also be dysregulated in the pathology of AD. We also wanted to see if the metabolism of neurotransmitters was being modulated differently in different brain regions with differing levels of amyloid-\u2424 and tau."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chemicals and reagents", "text": "All solvents, water, acetonitrile, methanol, ammonium formate, formic acid, and methyl tertiary butyl ether, were LC-MS grade purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Detailed examinations, including neuropsychological assessments and neurological, laboratory, and radiological evaluations, were conducted every 2 years. Since 2003, participants older than 80 years have received yearly assessments. Written informed consent was obtained at each visit, and the study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and the National Institute on Aging.

These pathways are responsible for regulating mood, and aiding cognitive and motor function. Impairment of this system potentially causes depression [24] , memory loss [25] , and impaired motor control observed in patients with AD. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is synthesized in two steps from the essential amino acid tyrosine, with the initial conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) with the subsequent conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine catalyzed by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). In the MFG, a comparable reduction in dopamine is observed in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic AD patients ( Fig. 2,  Supplementary Figure 1 ). In the MFG, tyrosine and L-DOPA, the precursors of dopamine, are elevated, with a reduction in the abundance of dopamine also observed, suggesting a decrease in the abundance or activity of TH and AAAD.\nThe activity of both TH and AAAD is inhibited by alpha-synuclein [26] , and has been implicated in the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease [27] , AD [28] , and Lewy bodies dementia [27] [28] [29] . Studies have also shown that soluble intraneuronal alpha-synuclein, in the absence of Lewy body pathology is increased in abundance by up to two-fold in the brain of AD patients [30, 31] . This suggests a plausible molecular mechanism by which alpha-synuclein may modulate brain dopamine concentrations in AD. Reduced dopamine could reduce the amount of the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft during synaptic transmission leading to impaired signal transduction (Fig. 2) . The data ( Table 2) shows that shifts in dopamine metabolism are greater in the middle frontal gyrus in the ASYMAD group, suggesting that the changes in dopamine metabolism occur before memory loss occurs."}, {"section_title": "Neurotransmission inhibition in the inferior temporal gyrus in AD", "text": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter serotonin and its precursor tryptophan were measured in this study and were decreased in the ITG of AD patients ( Table 2 , Supplementary Figure 1 N and O) . Serotonin is synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan by tryptophan monooxygenase and AAAD. As stated above, alpha-synuclein, which is increased in the brains of AD patients [30, 31] , has been shown to inhibit the action of AAAD [26] , suggesting a potential co-mechanism leading to decreased serotonin synthesis as observed in this study. While serotonin levels in the AD brain are marginally significant, it is interesting as recent reports have shown that antidepressants such as Trazodone, a serotonin antagonist, could help maintain neural integrity [32, 33] .\nGlutamate was also reduced in the ITG of AD patients; this was surprising as glutamate activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) on the post synaptic neuron and its excitotoxicity have long been implicated in the pathology of AD [34] [35] [36] . The impairment of the glutaminergic system in the brain leads to impairment of a range of neurological functions, including fast excitatory neurotransmission [37] , memory and learning [38] , and long term potentiation [39] [40] [41] . The role of glutamate in AD is well known. Memantine, an NMDA antagonist, is used to treat moderate to severe AD, and has been shown to have affinity for dopamine receptors which is interesting in light of this report's findings [42] .\nIn this study, GABA is increased in abundance but no change is seen in glutamate levels apart from a modest shift observed in the ITG. While increased GABA production could still be coming at least in part from glutamate, the changes observed in other metabolites associated with GABA metabolism mean that the alterations may arise from multiple pathways (Fig. 2) . GABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system [43, 44] . It does not cross the bloodbrain barrier [45] and in the brain is predominantly synthesized from the non-essential amino acid glutamate by the action of glutamate decarboxylase under standard physiological conditions [46] . However, GABA can be synthesized via several pathways from selection precursors, including aminobutanal by aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase [47] , succinate semialdehyde by aminobutyrate aminotransferase [48] , and guanidinobutanoate by guanidinobutyrase ( Supplementary Figure 2) . Two alternative GABA synthetic pathways, both of which start from the urea cycle, have intermediates that are significantly reduced in abundance ( Supplementary Figure 2) suggesting that they may play a role in the dysregulation of GABA metabolism.\nRegardless of the synthetic source of the increased abundance of GABA, this combined with the reduction in glutamate in the ITG ( Table 2) can produce a reduction in their ratio, leading to an inhibitory environment and a reduction in the transmission of action potentials. When GABA is released into the synaptic cleft it binds to a range of transmembrane receptors on both the pre and post-synaptic neurons leading to the opening of ion channels allowing the negatively charged chloride ions to enter and positively charged potassium ions to escape the neuron (Fig. 2) [49] . This shift leads to loss of the transmembrane potential and hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, inhibiting action potentials produced by excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "The main strengths of this study are the use of samples from the well-characterized BLSA, which has serial cognitive assessments and detailed neuropathological examination postmortem. This allows the identification and inclusion of the asymptomatic group enabling us to relate the observed shifts in metabolism with the severity of pathology as well as the expression of symptoms. The analysis of the three brain regions representing areas that are differentially susceptible to amyloid and tau pathology to determine how each of these proteins could be associated with neurotransmitter metabolism independently.\nThe main limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size, which means that our findings need independent validation. However, there are few cohorts with the extensive longitudinal cognitive assessment and postmortem neurological examination means that identifying a sample set that includes asymptomatic individuals is difficult.\nAnother possible limitation of this work is that neurotransmitters can be unstable and likely to break down after death, hence postmortem interval (PMI) (time between death and sample collection) is an important consideration. The postmortem interval in the control group is not significantly higher compared to the asymptomatic and AD groups ( Table 1) . As PMI in each of the groups is the same, degradation of these unstable metabolites should be comparable, meaning that the molecular relative abundances between groups should be similar."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, our results showed decreased levels in dopamine in brains with pathology from patients who exhibited no cognitive deficit during life. In AD brains, neurotransmitter dysregulation was observed in several pathways and correlated with cognitive tests in AD.
