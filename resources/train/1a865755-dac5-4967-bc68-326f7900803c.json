[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the past two decades, outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had caused deadly human diseases (Cheng et al. 2007; Chan et al. 2015) . The current pandemic of pandemic coronavirus disease 19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spreads through human-to-human contact via droplets due to sneezing or coughing or by touching the contaminated surface or coming in touch with an infected person (Drosten et al. 2003; Gralinski and Baric 2015; Guarner 2020) . Coronaviruses cause fever and upper respiratory diseases, but some of these viruses, such as HCoV-KHU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoVNL63 cause only minor respiratory infections (Zumla et al. 2016; Guarner 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is the 7th member of the coronavirus family which has spread in humans with symptoms like fever, and dry cough similar to SARS and MERS-CoV (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020; Liu et al. 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December-2019 in Wuhan, China, from where human-to-human transmission spread throughout the world (Wu et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) . The investigation pointed out that the main source of this virus were animals sold in the seafood market, but Anand Prakash Maurya and Rupesh V. Chikhale contributed equally. no specific linkage with SARS-CoV-2 has been identified . Based on the genomic arrangements and sequences, it was speculated that this virus originally came from bats . However, the intermediate host between bat and humans is still a mystery and a matter of investigation . The SARS-CoV-2 is a unique member of coronavirus, which is enveloped and singlestranded RNA virus (Zumla et al. 2016) . The virus consists of enveloped spike (S) protein (Du et al. 2009) , and this assists the receptor binding and fusion with the membrane, which is essential for shaping host tropism and the ability to spread the virus (Li 2016) .\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection came to highlight in January 2020, and the declaration of a COVID-19 pandemic by WHO led to a panic worldwide. Most of the countries have already reported COVID-19 cases by the end of March 2020. In this article, we put focus on the COVID-19 situation in the South Asian countries, which include India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. These countries are represented by the association known as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) . In this research, we have focused on the COVID-19 situation in the region, from the countries where the genomes of SAR-CoV-2 have being reported, and so, their phylogeny and the mutations have been analyzed. The history of the first cases from different SAARC countries has been given in Table S1 . A significant number of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported from the South Asian region [COVID-19 dashboard by Center for Systems Science and Engineering, 2020; accessed as on 10th August 2020].\nSeveral SARS-CoV-2 sequences were accessed from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, available on the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (NCBI gene bank). However, sequences from other South Asian countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Bhutan were not available on the NCBI gene bank. In this study, we have studied nine sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to construct the molecular evolutionary model based on their phylogenetic analysis and to explore the possible mutations while the spread of the infections in the SAARC regions."}, {"section_title": "Bioinformatics analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and molecular evolutionary modeling", "text": "The nucleotide sequences were accessed from the gene bank NCBI database (Sayers et al. 2019) . A total of 9 genome sequences of countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan, were analyzed with the Wuhan reference genome sequence. In addition to this, two sequences for analysis were taken from Italy, as some of the infected people traveled from Itlay to India. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done using the MUSCLE program version 3.8.31, and further percent identity matrixes were created by Clustal v2.1 (Edgar 2004) ]. Genome sequences were aligned using MAFT v7.42 for further analysis (Katoh et al. 2019) .\nThe phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA-X v10.1.8, and Molecular evolutionary (ME) history was inferred using the Maximum likelihood (ML) method, Tamura-Nei model, and Minimum Evolution (ME) method (Rzhetsky and Nei 1992; Tamura and Nei 1993; Kumar et al. 2018) . The tree was further authenticated by investigation on 100 bootstrapped input datasets. ML fits the model for nucleotide substitutions was evaluated to find the best nucleotide substitution, models. The tree topology was computed with 11 nucleotide sequences for the estimation of ML values. 1st + 2nd + 3rd + Noncoding codon positions have been included (Nei and Kumar 2000) .\nSubstitution patterns and rates in the sequences were estimated under the Tamura-Nei (1993) model (+G), which is essential for modernizing the evolutionary models. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate (Tamura and Nei 1993) . Relative values of instantaneous r were considered during evaluation. The user-specified tree topology was analyzed by using the ML method and Tamura-Nei model, and the Maximum Parsimony method (Tamura and Nei 1993; Nei and Kumar 2000) .\nThe strict and flexible uncorrelated relaxed Molecular clock test was done among 11 genome sequences to see the equality of evolutionary rate between 3 sequences; Tajima's relative rate test was performed. Genome sequences: A (MT012098.1 SARS-CoV-2 human IND 29 2020) and B (NC_045512.2 Wuhan Hu 1), and C (MT066156.1 SARS-CoV-2 human ITA INMI1 2020) were used as an outgroup. The analysis involved 3 nucleotide sequences, and 1st + 2nd + 3rd + Noncoding codon positions were included (Tajima 1993) .\nFor detecting correlation of evolutionary rates in a phylogenetic tree of all 11 taxa; Corrtest analysis was performed using the branch lengths to compute evolutionary rates (Tao et al. 2018) , and the tree topology (branch lengths) was analyzed using the ML method, based on the general time-reversible model (Nei and Kumar 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Modeling of S and N protein", "text": "The MSA FASTA files were processed on the T-Coffee server (Paolo et al. 2011) , and images were developed on the Boxshade v3.2 [https ://embne t.vital -it.ch/softw are/ BOX_doc.html] (ExPASy, 2019). The S-protein sequences were modeled on the locally installed Robetta (Walls et al. 2020) , model validation was performed by Qualitative model energy analysis (Qmean) and MolProbity method (Angira et al. 2019) . Ramachandran plot and images were generated in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) (Kerzare et al. 2016) . A score towards 1 is considered good; in this case, all models showed a score of 0.74, which is considered as highly acceptable. QMEAN estimates the native-ness of the protein model, and the score is based on the Z-score. Any homology model with a value between 0 and \u2212 4 is considered a high-quality model. The Nucleocapsid N-protein for the genome sequences was modeled similarly with the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein RNA binding domain (PDB: 6M3M) (Kang et al. 2020 ) as the reference template. The rest of the validation parameters and protocols were similar, as mentioned above."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis", "text": "We collected 11 full genomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the NCBI database, and reference genome of SARS-Cov-2. Selected genome was: MT358637.1 (SARS-CoV-2/ human/IND/GBRC1/2020); MT012098.1 (SARS-CoV-2/ human/IND/29/2020); MT050493.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ IND/166/2020); MT077125.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ ITA/INMI1/2020); MT066156.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ ITA/INMI1/2020); MT072688.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ NPL/61-TW/2020); MT371047.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ LKA/COV38/2020); MT371048.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ LKA/COV53/2020); MT262993.1 (SARS-Cov-2/human/ PAK/Manga1/2020); MT240479.1 (SARS-CoV-2/human/ PAK/Gilgit1/2020), and a reference genome: NC_045512.2 Wuhan-Hu-1. MSA using MUSCLE (v3.8.31) shown that all were highly similar (> 99.95%) to the reference genome (Percent identity matrix: Supplementary data 1). Mutations in the nucleotide bases were found by MSA using CLUSTAL O (1.2.4), which shows there were mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Based on the percentage identity phylogenetic tree was constructed ( Figure S1 ), and all 11 genomes show maximum similarity to the reference genome, suggesting that they were spread from Wuhan, China.\nThe phylogenetic tree with the highest log-likelihood is shown in Fig. 1 . The evolutionary history was inferred using heuristic search, that was found by using Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using tamura-Nei model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The result presented that genomes were highly conserved, and phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that transmission of COVID-19 happened from Wuhan, China.\nThe Close-Neighbor-Interchange (CNI) algorithm has been used for exploring the ME tree at a search level of 1. The molecular clock RelTime method has been used to estimate the divergence times for all branching points in the topology. Also, the bars around each node represent 95% confidence intervals, signifying that the evolutionary rate of nucleotide substitutions per year in SARS-CoV-2. The ME time tree is shown in Fig. 2 . All the 11 genome sequences implied that they were originated and spread through Wuhan SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Molecular evolutionary model analysis of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "ML fits the model for nucleotide substitutions were evaluated. A total of 24 different nucleotide substitution models were found for ML fits. The model HKY with the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores was found to be the best nucleotide substitution pattern model among all (Table S2 ). This model confirmed that nucleotides arose at diverse rates, and transitions and transversions happened at different degrees in transmission.\nThe heterogeneity rate among the genomes was determined using the ML estimate of the nucleotide substitution matrix and shown in Table 1 . For simplicity, the sum of r values is made equal to 100. The total nucleotide frequencies were A = 29.89%, T/U = 32.11%, C = 18.37%, and G = 19.62%. Computed tree topology of the maximum Log-likelihood was \u2212 40969.372. The results suggested that matrix found significant as the estimated Transition/ Transversion bias (R) was 2.90 and confirming that there was heterogeneity among the genomes, which is also supported by MSA using CLUSTAL O v1.2.4.\nML has been estimated for site rates, with the estimated value of 0.0500 for the shape parameter for the discrete Gamma Distribution. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories, [+ G]). Mean evolutionary rates in these categories were 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.03, 4.97 substitutions per site. The nucleotide frequencies are A = 29.89%, T/U = 32.11%, C = 18.37%, and G = 19.62%. A tree topology of maximum Log-likelihood for this computation was \u2212 40976.575, indicating that there are differences in the rate of evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\nEvolutionary divergence analysis of tree topology was presented in Figure S2 . Inferred Ancestral phylogeny tree was made. A set of possible nucleotides at each ancestral node was introduced in the tree and set of alternative nucleotides at each node, as shown in Figure S3 . The result showed that there were similarities between the genome sequences, with some differences in the nucleotides.\nThe equality of evolutionary rate difference between the genetic diversity among 3 sequences was seen using Tajima's relative rate test through the molecular clock. The \u03c7 2 test statistic was 5.00 (P = 0.02535 with 1 degree[s] of freedom). Since the P value here is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis was rejected for equal rates between lineages. Table 2) .\nThe correlation rate among 11 taxa was analyzed to see the evolutionary rates among the phylogenetic tree of the genomes by Corrtest analysis. The tree topology was analyzed using the ML method, and the Corrtest analysis score was 1.0000. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected (p value was < 0.001), showing evolutionary rates, and the model is significant. This shows a high correlation among the ML tree and genetic distances in genomes of all taxa."}, {"section_title": "The MSA of S and N-protein with homology modeling", "text": "The multiple sequence alignment of all 11 sequences of spike proteins and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was performed on the T-Coffee server, and the Clustal W server and aligned FASTA file were obtained. This file was further formatted in the BoxShade program to obtain the results (Fig. 3a) . The MSA of Spike-protein from these 8 sequences shows that four sequences had mutations in reference to the Spikeprotein sequence from Wuhan. Each FASTA sequence was further separated and modeled into the Robetta modeler program with the crystal structure of Spike glycoprotein as a template (PDB: 6vyb). This template was used for all 11 SARS-CoV-2 sequences due to its high identity of 99.50%. The models generated were further validated, and structural assessment was performed. The parameters studied were GMQE (Global Model Quality Estimation) score, Qmean score, Molprobity score, and Ramachandran plot analysis. The results of structural validation are provided in Table S3 . The GMQE is a quality estimation for the template alignment with the target sequence. All the 11 models generated have a Qmean score between \u2212 1.82 and \u2212 2.06 and thus represents a high-quality model for the spike protein.\nMolProbity score is based on the analysis of steric problems within the molecular framework of the model; it also checks for H-bonds and Van der Wall's contacts within the generated models. The spike protein models were scored from 1.26 to 1.40, representing high quality and structural stability of the models.\nRamachandran plots were also analyzed, and all models have low outlier percent and a low clash score. The models were visualized and superimposed for structural comparison in MOE. We found five different mutations from the sequences on comparison and superimposition. Out of five mutations in this group, one mutation is observed in the RBD of the spike protein (Fig. 3a, b) , and the rest four were in other regions of Spike protein ( Figure S4 ). The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein RNA binding domains for all the 11 sequences were modeled, and the models were validated (Table S4) . Model validation and assessment reveals high similarity but does not show any mutations in the binding domain (Fig. 4a) . The receptor-binding domain of the nucleocapsid protein was only modeled due to a lack of complete protein crystal structure; it shows a good homology ( Fig. 4b) with the reference crystal structure (PDB: 6M3M) in structural features and validation results."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We collected COVID-19 data of 8 countries; India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. The sequences from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives were only available at the time of this study. The evolution of death count was calculated using XLSTAT-2020 software since death 1 in all six countries, which indicated that the number of deaths has been increasing day by day in all SAARC countries.\nSince the relative analysis of genomic sequences and molecular evolutionary data is essential for evaluating and reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among genomes , we analyzed the different models with data. We found that the HKY model was the best model with the lowest BIC scores. This model confirms that SARS-CoV-2 arises at diverse rates, and transitions and transversions happened at different degrees in the genome during transmission of COVID-19 among individuals. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are highly similar to each other, consistent with earlier records (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020; Giovanetti et al. 2020) . Divergence times in tree topology were at a 95% confidence interval, which supported the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 substitutions site per year. ML BIC and evolutionary history indicate that there were mutations among the genomes, but they were highly conserved and similar to Wuhan SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to other reports (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020; Li Our results highlighted that there were heterogeneity and evolutionary differences with rates among the genome, which was supported by time tree analysis, Corrtest analysis, and Tajima's relative rate test. The high correlation between ML tree and genetic distances in the genomes was evident that evolutionary rates and molecular models are significant. However, further molecular genetics investigation is needed with these genomes to justify the mutation or polymorphisms.\nThe multiple differences in the ML estimation of gamma parameter for site rates among the genomes indicate that there is variation in the rate of evolution and transmission. ML evolutionary results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread at different time intervals from Wuhan as the genomes show the highest similarity. Further, our results also confirmed that there is a very low level of variation among all 11 selected genomes, which is supported by the MSA and phylogenetic tree analysis. The Nucleocapsid protein for these sequences showed three mutations compared to the reference genome (NC_045512.2 Wuhan-Hu-1). One of the mutations was found in the MR358637.1 sequence from India, and the other two mutations were found in the MT371047.1, MT371048.1 from Sri Lanka. We found that these data are inconsistent with earlier reports (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020; Li et al. 2020 ).\nThe Spike (S) protein models for sequences had shown mutations as compared to the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 model. The SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/29/2020 model showing two mutations; out of these two mutations, one is present in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike-protein. RBD is the site that interacts and binds to the ACE-II receptor of the host cell and initiates the viral entry; it extends from residues 331-524 (Fig. 3b, c) . The Arg407 has mutated to Ile407 (Fig. 3c ) in the RBD domain in the SARS-CoV-2/human/ IND/29/2020 sequence when compared to other strains from this region (Yadav et al. 2020) . Other mutations were found in the SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/29/2020 (Gap Val143-Tyr144), SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC1/2020/S-Protein (Arg271), SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/166/2020 (Val930), SARS-CoV-2/human/LKA/COV53/2020 and SARS-CoV-2/ human/IND/GBRC1/2020/S-Protein (Glu614) concerning the Wuhan sequence (Fig. 5a-e) .\nThe N -protein is essential for the viral RNA genome packaging, regulation of viral RNA synthesis during replication/ transcription, and modulation of infected cell metabolism. The N-terminal RNA-binding domain is responsible for RNA binding, and hence it is vital to target for drug discovery. It also plays an important role in viral self-assembly, and interaction with the multiple host cell proteins such as Smad3, pyruvate kinase, B23 phosphoprotein, and chemokine Ccl16. N protein is involved in binding to the nucleic acid at many places by the coupled-allostery method [Kang et al., 2020] . The modeled RNA-binding domain does not show any substitutions (Fig. 4b, c) . C-Terminal domain plays a significant role in the protein-protein interface, and in our study, we found this C-terminal dimerization domain and intrinsically disordered central Ser/Arg linker region does show few substitutions. The Substitutions observed compared to the Wuhan sequences are as follows; MT371048.1/SARS-CoV-2/human/LKA/COV53/2020 (Lys203, Arg204), MT371047.1/SARS-CoV-2/human/LKA/ COV38/2020 (Ser398), MT358637.1/SARS-CoV-2/human/ IND/GBRC1/2020 (Ile393) (Fig. 4a) . Since N protein is very stable, therefore, it is an excellent diagnostic and therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. Our observation of this study allows researchers to explore this region for the future exploitation of any possible antiviral therapy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The phylogenetic and evolutionary models successfully linked the human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in the South Asian regions through international travel between various neighboring countries as most of these share land borders. These mutations could also adversely affect the current efforts of drug repurposing because the binding mode of drugs may change in these cases. These observations are important as the mutations discovered in the South Asian region pose a great challenge to the development of a vaccine and or drug that would target all the strains of SARS-CoV-2. High population density and the high volume of national and international travel for business and tourism make this region vulnerable. These findings would also help devise strategies for governments and the public to take all necessary measures to control this pandemic."}]
