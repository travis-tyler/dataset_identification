[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Scientific literacy (SL) and critical thinking (CT) are key components of science education aiming to prepare students to think and to function as responsible citizens in a world increasingly affected by science and technology (S&T). Therefore, students should be given opportunities in their science classes to be engaged in learning experiences that promote SL and CT, which may trigger the need to build and develop knowledge, attitudes/values, thinking abilities, and standards/criteria in an integrated way, resulting in their ability to know how to take responsible action in contexts and situations of personal and social relevance. This paper reports on a study to design, implement, and assess science learning experiences focused on CT toward SL goal. Results support the conclusion that the learning experiences developed and implemented in a grade 6 science classroom had a significant influence on the students' CT and SL. Within this elementary school context, the theoretical framework used appears to be a relevant and practical aid for developing learning experiences that promote CT/SL and in supporting teaching practices that are more in line with the goals of critical scientific literacy."}, {"section_title": "", "text": ". Several recent international science education reforms have included scientific literacy (SL), science practices, critical thinking (CT), and socioscientific issues as learning outcomes (National Research Council [NRC], 2012; Rocard et al., 2007) . However, few reforms provide an operational definition of SL that includes CT and that is practical and useable by elementary science teachers to guide their planning, classroom teaching, and assessment practices.\nThis study, which is part of an ongoing program of inquiry, involved the development of a framework and an action research plan that documented a design-implementation-evaluation process of learning experiences focused on CT and SL.

Participation as active citizens and agents of social cohesion in a pluralistic, scientific, and technologically advanced democratic society requires more than being able to complete tasks imposed externally. It also requires being able to (a) extrapolate from what has been learnt; (b) apply built knowledge and thinking skills to interact with others, communicating positions and counter-arguments effectively; (c) participate in problem-solving and decision-making processes; and (d) form rational opinions about sciencebased issues to achieve sustainable development in modern societies (International Council for Science [ICSU] , 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Current International Science Education Reforms", "text": "International science education documents have stressed a science-technology-society (STS) approach in order to promote SL in close connection with CT (Aikenhead, 1992; Vieira et al., 2011) .

Without this preparation, people are likely to make decisions and choices with implications for themselves and others that are based on opinion, experience, or personal interest or based on information or the beliefs of others (ICSU, 2011) .

It established four foundation statements that delineated critical aspects of students' scientific literacy: (a) science, technology, society, and environment (STSE); (b) skills required for scientific and technological inquiry, for solving problems, for communicating scientific ideas and results, for working collaboratively, and for making informed decisions; (c) knowledge, understandings, and applications of scientific concepts to interpret, integrate, and extend their knowledge; and (d) attitudes that support the responsible acquisition and application of scientific and technological knowledge to the mutual benefit of self, society, and the environment."}, {"section_title": "European Union", "text": "The project Beyond 2000: Science Education for the Future (Millar & Osborne, 1998) argued in favor of a new vision for science education in Europe and presented ten recommendations. The first recommendation was that science curriculum (from 5 to 16 years of age) should be seen, first and foremost, as a promoter of general scientific literacy. Consequently, the report of Rocard et al. (2007) stressed that, in providing all citizens with both scientific literacy and a positive attitude toward science, the key point is equipping every citizen with the skills needed to live and work in the knowledge society by giving them the opportunity to develop CT and scientific reasoning thereby enabling them to make well-informed choices. Students should be able to (a) develop a basic understanding of mathematics and science to understand the issues and make informed choices; (b) acquire more knowledge, when necessary, whether for personal interest or for professional reasons; (c) make judgments on scientific ideas and procedures; (d) assess the reasons fundamental to making decisions that have to be made in everyday contexts; (e) understand and respond critically to reports presented by the media on social problems with underlying scientific issues; and (f) express a personal point of view on issues that encompass science and are in public debate in addition to becoming actively involved."}, {"section_title": "England", "text": "The current National Curriculum in England (Department for Education, 2013) aims to ensure that students, from an early age, develop essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes, and uses of science and other disciplines. It emphasizes that science provides opportunities for student to (a) develop their scientific vocabulary, articulating scientific concepts clearly and precisely in making their thinking clear and (b) work scientifically, developing secure understanding of key scientific knowledge and concepts and thinking skills through the involvement in scientific enquiry, and using a variety of approaches to answer relevant scientific questions. These approaches include observing over time; identifying, classifying, and grouping; investigating (controlled investigations); and researching using secondary sources. It should be noted that the development of the curriculum was based on comparative curricula studies of countries with high performance in international assessments (e.g. Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and Programme for International Student Assessment [PISA] ). The comparative studies showed that the main purpose of science education was to prepare students to continue their studies and ensure that all students are scientifically literate adults able to act responsibly and as informed individuals (Department for Education, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Finland", "text": "The National Core Curriculum for Basic Education in Finland (Finnish National Board of Education, 2004) emphasizes that basic education must provide an opportunity for diversified growth and learning so that students are able to build the knowledge and skills they need in order to continue their studies and develop a democratic society as concerned citizens. The curriculum assumes a sustainable development perspective in which it is stressed that science teaching must stimulate pupils to (a) care for their environment and act responsibly toward it and (b) make choices that promote individual and collective health and well-being."}, {"section_title": "Portugal", "text": "Portuguese curricular documents have identified SL as the main goal of science education, highlighting the importance of the development of scientific knowledge and thinking abilities, such as CT and reasoning, to deal with socioscientific issues . The latest science education curriculum guidelines identify the knowledge and skills that students must develop to continue their education and to meet the needs of society (Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ci\u00eancia [Ministry of Education and Science], 2013).\nThe commonalities across these international science education reforms are the broadening perspective of considering both mainstream SL-literacy for citizenship-and pipeline SL-further studies and future careers in science and engineering. Despite the restructuring of science curricula, international studies focused on SL suggest that, depending on the country, between one-and two-thirds of the population does not demonstrate a minimum level of skills considered essential to engage in further learning and to function in modern economies and societies increasingly dependent on the use of knowledge (Rocard et al., 2007) . Similarly, science that has been taught in school has failed to help students become interested in science (Osborne & Dillon, 2008; Rocard et al., 2007) .\nAs indicated by the high number of young people who experience social inequalities or learning difficulties or who leave school without a diploma and the high number of functionally illiterate adults, educational authorities have placed an increasing emphasis on changes to the curriculum. Oates (2010) noted that the national curriculum of a country cannot be considered isolated from other vital factors that affect the educational system (e.g. teacher education and professional development, learning activities and didactic resources, and teaching practices). All elements of the school system interact, and they should be constantly adjusted in order to be consistent with the goals stated in the curriculum (Department for Education, 2011). Therefore, it is crucial to sustain the development of resources, teaching strategies, and learning experiences for science education and provide professional development opportunities necessary for teachers to adapt and transform their practices (Osborne & Dillon, 2008) .\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) policy report entitled Evolution of Students' Interest in Science and Technology Studies (OECD, 2006b) stressed that traditional science teaching methods have a negative impact on students' interest in science and on the development of positive attitudes toward learning science. This report noted the uncomfortable situation for some teachers in the early years of schooling who are requested or required to teach subjects (i.e. science) in which they lack self-confidence or knowledge. This situation often leads them to resort to a blackboard-and-white-chalk approach with which they feel most comfortable and to avoid research-based approaches that require a deeper and integrated understanding of science, resulting in an emphasis on the memorization of factual information."}, {"section_title": "Scientific Literacy", "text": "Scientific literacy has been identified and recognized as a goal of science education. Despite this, there is no consensus on the meaning of the term scientific literacy. Science researchers and educators as well as various organizations have developed rationales and highlighted characteristics, mainly in terms of knowledge and skills, expected of a scientifically literate person. The NRC (1996) defined SL as \"the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity\" (p. 22). Each individual should be able to (a) ask or find answers to questions arising from their own curiosity regarding everyday experiences; (b) describe, explain, and predict natural phenomena; (c) interpret newspaper articles about science in the media and engage in public social discussion about the validity of the conclusions presented and methods used; (d) identify scientific issues underlying local and national decisions; (e) take and express positions based on scientific and technological knowledge; (f) assess scientific information based on the credibility of the sources and the validity of methods used to generate it; and (g) evaluate arguments based on scientific evidence.\nThe PISA framework defined SL as the ability to use scientific knowledge and processes not only to understand the natural world but also to participate in decisions about it and the changes therein made by human activity (OECD, 2006a (OECD, , 2009 ). More specifically, PISA considers that SL aids individuals in identifying scientific questions; acquiring new knowledge; explaining scientific phenomena and drawing conclusions based on evidence about science-related issues; understanding the characteristic features of science as a form of human research and knowledge; being aware of how S&T shape the material, intellectual, and cultural environments; and encouraging involvement in science-related issues and with scientific ideas as a reflective citizen. Harlen (2006) stressed that being scientifically literate means being able to appreciate and understand the impact of S&T in everyday life, assessing risks and benefits of scientific and technological advances; using ideas, concepts, and scientific processes in decision making; and having an open-mindedness to accept alternative viewpoints that are based on scientific evidence. Hofstein, Eilks & Bybee (2011) argued for increased emphasis on STS education and a stronger inclusion of societal issues in science education:\nDealing with issues that are socially relevant and which are actually discussed is relevant to the lives of students in present society. Skills developed along these lines will be important for students' participation in societal debates concerning the development of their future as scientifically literate citizens. (p. 1464) Science education with an STS orientation that emphasizes the interrelationships of scientific concepts and real-life phenomena can better serve students .\nThe PISA definition and STS context assume that students will acquire and apply scientific knowledge where rational thinking and relating evidence and conclusions are seen as pivotal to all citizens in order to make informed and sustainable decisions about courses of action that affect life on a personal, social, and global level. Fundamental in such literate use of empirical argumentation is the ability of individuals to communicate effectively; otherwise, they will not be able to engage and have a voice in public debates about SSI. Roberts (2007) defined the ideologies of SL on a continuum between two extremes: vision I and vision II. Vision I is scientist-centered and focused on decontextualized science subject matter; vision II is student-centered and context-driven, with the aim to enculturate students into their local, national, and global communities (Aikenhead, 2007) . Yore, Pimm & Tuan (2007) suggested that there are two interacting senses of contemporary disciplinary literacy: the fundamental sense and the derived sense.\nThe fundamental sense subsumes abilities, emotional dispositions, and information communication technologies as well as communication (speaking, listening, reading, writing, representing, interpreting) , while the derived sense subsumes the content goals regarding understanding the big ideas of science, the nature of science, scientific inquiry, technological design, and the relationships among STSE. (p. 568)\nRecently, science education researchers are mentioning a vision III. This vision emphasizes SL as being the combination of abilities, skills, dispositions, and knowledge to engage STSE issues and debates (Yore, 2012; Yore et al., 2007) . Based on the work of Yore and collaborators, Lin (2014) identified three interacting clusters involved in vision III: fundamental literacy in science (metacognition, CT, habits of mind, language, information communication technologies), understanding of the big ideas (core ideas, crosscutting concepts, nature of science, scientific inquiry, technological design), and fuller participation in the public debate about socioscientific issues resulting in informed decisions and sustainable actions."}, {"section_title": "Critical Thinking", "text": "Several definitions for CT have been proposed. Ennis (1987) suggested that CT is reasonable, reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do; it involves affective dispositions and cognitive abilities. CT dispositions reflect a critical spirit consisting of a trend, commitment, or inclination to act critically then applying CT abilities attending to CT criteria and standards. These dispositions include trying to be well informed, using and mentioning credible sources, searching for reasons and alternatives, having an open mind, and trying to be as precise as the issue permits. Ennis identified several cognitive abilities that contribute to rationally deciding what to do or what to believe: focusing on one question, asking and answering clarification and/or challenging questions, analyzing arguments, assessing the credibility of the sources, making and assessing observations, making and assessing inferences (deductions, inductions, and value judgments), deciding a course of action, and interacting with others. The use of standards as criteria for judging the quality of thought is required in order to ensure the effective use of such abilities. Hatcher & Spencer (2000) suggested that CT is thought which seeks to achieve judgment after the alternatives have been truly assessed, respecting the arguments and evidence available. Therefore, CT can be an open process given that sometimes the arguments and the evidence available may be insufficient or inappropriate. In this case, unless the individuals are forced to make a choice, they should not make a judgment before having done research that provides the necessary evidence to support or rebut an argument. Furthermore, CT should include the assessment of alternatives or different points of view before making a decision or judgment. This assessment should be honest, which implies seeking to act impartially and with objectivity, include all available alternatives, present each alternative in its most favorable light, use the same criteria used to reject a given alternative to all positions in order to assess each one with the same criteria and rationality, and be willing to change a position in light of new arguments or evidence. Scriven & Paul (2007) defined CT as a disciplined intellectual process that actively and effectively conceptualizes, applies, analyzes, and/or assesses information obtained from different sources (e.g. observation, experience, communication) as a guide to belief and action. The critical thinker systematically and intentionally develops attitudes, becomes aware of elements of thought, applies intellectual criteria to thought, and assesses the effectiveness of the thinking process while taking into account the purpose and intellectual criteria. CT is based on intellectual criteria (e.g. clarity, accuracy, consistency, and valid evidence) that are used in the analysis of elements of thought (e.g. problems or questions under consideration, assumptions, conclusions, implications and consequences from alternative viewpoints, and different frameworks of reference). Ford & Yore (2012) suggested that CT can be considered the deliberate process of determining what to believe or do about a worthy challenge. This means that the critical thinker needs to examine the text contents or arguments in mass media reports and then evaluate the evidence behind a claim, belief, or action that will allow them to determine the validity, reliability, and authenticity of the information and how well it supports the claim. Ennis & Millman (1985) developed the Cornell Critical Thinking Test based on prior conception, which is still considered to be one of the most valid measures of CT. The test incorporates five aspects of CT (i.e. induction, deduction, observation, credibility of statements made by others, and assumption identification) but does not assess value meaning, value judgment, CT attitudes, or values."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Research Questions", "text": "Classroom teachers, namely elementary school teachers, need fully developed resources and procedures to implement desired innovative ideas. Assuming the relevance of developing learning experiences and didactic resources that support teaching practices congruent with SL as the first goal of science education, this study was conducted in order to conceive, implement, and assess the influence of learning experiences focused on CT aimed at SL in science education during compulsory education. The following research questions guided the design and enactment of the study:\n1. Do the learning activities developed contribute to the improvement of students' critical thinking level? 2. Do the learning activities developed contribute to the improvement of students' scientific literacy level?"}, {"section_title": "Development of the Learning Experiences", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Framework for Scientific Literacy/Critical Thinking", "text": "Among the different conceptualizations of SL and CT, there is wide interdependence and overlap. Yore et al. (2007) suggested CT was one of the components in the fundamental sense of SL, where CT was defined as deciding what to believe or do about a challenge. When facing a worthwhile challenge, issue, or problem, a scientificliterate person will make a judgment about what to believe or do and will justify the claim/judgment based on accurate evidence and rational criteria. This makes CT critical in the construction of science understandings and the applications of this understanding to STS issues, problem solving, and decision making. Norris & Ennis (1989) suggested that CT involves problem solving and decision making because it occurs in a problematic context and/or an interacting context where it is necessary to rationally decide what to do or believe. The processes and practices of science help to make judgments in problem solving within interactive situations. Following this idea, some abilities arise at the intersection of SL and CT; for example, assessing the credibility of sources, assessing the available evidence and going beyond their immediate and apparent value; arguing, analyzing, and assessing arguments; identifying fallacies and assumptions underlying a given position; and considering, comparing, and weighing alternatives. Similarly, the SL-CT intersection contains dispositions such as the search to be well informed, respect for the use of evidence, skepticism in the assessment of assertions, intellectual honesty, and open-mindedness.\nCollectively, the definitions of SL and CT and the unique and shared attributes of SL and CT served as design principles for the SL-CT framework. Figure 1 highlights the components or dimensions common to SL and CT emerging from perspectives of various authors and organizations on these concepts (adapted from Tenreiro-Vieira & Vieira, 2011). Fig. 1 Intersection of components common to SL and CT (adapted from Tenreiro- In this context, science and technology are seen as socially contextualized human activities that influence each other. Science (S) as an inquiry-focused enterprise is mainly concerned with understanding of the natural world and how the natural world works; observable physical evidence is the basis of that understanding and related explanations stressing physical causality. Technology (T) is concerned with developing knowledge and designing processes in response to human needs and societal problems. Therefore, S and T influence and can be influenced by society (S). This framework can be used to develop resources and science activities that allow students to experience situations of action and participation, which may stimulate them to develop or reconstruct knowledge, abilities, dispositions, and standards. The integrated network constitutes a foundation for responsible action taken in contexts of personal, professional, or social relevance. The use of CT in such situations should appear closely linked to scientific practices and to the efficient and rational use of scientific knowledge-mainstream SL for citizenship. This is fundamental, particularly in real-life situations and contexts related to S&T that affect humanity and in which the public has or should have a legitimate voice in participatory action. Such participatory action may involve questioning arguments from different positions, keeping in mind the validity of the evidence and the credibility of sources used in its construction. This S-T-S framework integrates components from the fundamental and derived senses of SL vision III (Yore, 2012; Yore et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Design and Construction", "text": "The SL-CT framework and the Portuguese curriculum guidelines for the teaching of physics and natural sciences in elementary schools defined the context of this study.

Problem-questions and learning situations with a CT/SL orientation were identified for each topic based on the framework. Second, these activities were operationalized through the development of questions that required the construction of knowledge and development of thinking abilities to be mobilized for informed and rational action.

The TR organized the classroom instruction into three phases: presentation of the learning experience and delivery of the respective guide to the students; development of work by students, responding to requests and questions in the guide; and summary and evaluation of the work.\nIn the first stage, the TR presented the situation and promoted a comprehensive reading of the students' guide by formulating questions that appeal to CT abilities such as What are the words or phrases that need clarification regarding the definition. Why? Summarize the situation presented. In the second stage, students answered the requests and questions in their guide; for example, in the debate case, they were involved in the preparation and realization of the debate. During the debate preparation, students were asked to search for, select, and assess the credibility of sources of information; to seek, compare, and weigh reasons for and against a particular point of view; and to consider implications and alternatives. During the debate implementation, students were invited to present and defend their point of view about the focus questions and to question and rebut the opposing point of view. During this lesson stage, the TR encouraged students to progress with their work by formulating questions such as What are your options? What if [\u2026]? This happens every time or just sometimes? What happens in the cases analyzed? How did you justify the relationships you have set? Is this thesis consistent with the facts/evidence presented? Is the information used relevant, valid, and sufficient to support the thesis? Is there another plausible explanation for the observations made?

Comparison of the SL pretest and posttest averages revealed a significant improvement, t = 2.84, p < 0.01, also indicating a higher posttest than pretest average. Thus, the averages obtained by the students for both CT and SL were significantly higher after the implementation of the learning experiences.

However as I choose the classification \"Satisfactory\" I know that there are also some positive aspects, such as water, which is essential to our life, cantaloupe which is a fruit and we need this since it is the second largest sector in the Food Wheel.\nExample 2 (around the middle of the intervention)\nQuestion: Do you agree or not with the closure of the school bar during the lunch break?\nMy opinion: Yes, I agree.\nThe reasons that leads me to having this opinion: I agree, because if the bar is open, there are many students that instead of having lunch in the canteen will do it there and choose to eat junk food (cookies, cakes, soft drinks, \u2026). Lunch of these students will be less healthier and be more expensive than in the canteen."}, {"section_title": "Reasons against my opinion:", "text": "Students may say they do not like canteen food."}, {"section_title": "Refutation:", "text": "Eating at the bar will make a healthier eating less, which can cause diseases such as obesity."}, {"section_title": "Example 3 (near the end of the intervention)", "text": "Role-Play (preparation)\nQuestion: The Mayor should or not defend the installation of a cement factory in Vale Maior?\nRole: resident of that village\nPosition and Reasons (argumentation): I'm against it because in towns and villages where the cement factories have been installed there has been an increase in the number of persons residing nearby affected with respiratory diseases, mainly workers of the cement factory. Although the cement factory increases employment, I am against it because I value people's health. There are data suggesting that the cement factories destroy soils and this will also decrease the land for agriculture and thereby further affect air quality due to the decrease in the number of plants in the village.\nThe first example revealed little emphasis on the argument although the student does demonstrate the intention of being argumentative; in example 2, there are arguments based on scientific information, which are expressed using appropriate language. Example 3 showed the use of reasons relating to different aspects, namely, economic, environmental, and personal health. Also evident are the consideration of implications and consequences based on scientific information and the compare and weigh reasons in defense of the inherent role position.\nAfter implementation of the learning experiences developed using the CT/SL framework, the average levels of CT and SL reached by students were significantly higher than those obtained before the intervention. Content analysis of the students' work, within the learning experiences deployed, showed that there had been improvement in the target CT and SL areas of mobilization of scientific knowledge and in the use of thinking abilities, in particular, making inferences, presenting an argument, and communicating effectively about socioscientific ideas."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Implications", "text": "The results support the conclusion that the learning experiences developed and implemented-focused on CT and aiming for SL for teaching and learning sciencecontributed to the improvement of CT and SL levels of the students involved in this study. Despite the limitation of the absence of a control group, after the implementation of these innovative learning experiences in the science classes, the average CT and SL levels were significantly higher than those obtained at the start of the intervention. Thus, promoting students' CT and SL requires adequate learning experiences that create multiple and diverse opportunities for students to mobilize elements or aspects emerging from CT and SL, namely knowledge and CT abilities. At this level, the framework is configured as a relevant aid in fundamentally and explicitly developing learning experiences directed toward CT/SL and able to support science teaching practices more in line with the goals of critical SL, ensuring that all students develop abilities and knowledge relevant not only to the pursuit of their studies but also to operate effectively in their personal life, the labor market, and a pluralistic democratic, scientific, and technologically advanced society as active citizens and agents of social cohesion. As it has been repeatedly stressed in documents of international reference, science education should equip every citizen with the skills needed to live and work in a world that is rapidly changing, giving them the opportunity to develop CT and scientific reasoning that will enable them to participate in informed decisions and courses of action that affect their well-being and the welfare of society and the environment (Harlen, 2010; ICSU, 2011; Osborne & Dillon, 2008; Rocard et al., 2007) .\nIn this context, the appropriation of CT/SL rationales, learning experiences, and resources that are anchored on those rationales seems to be of great relevance for the TR. The CT/SL framework could help other teachers identify and then efficiently and effectively change their science teaching practices, seeking to promote SL by improving the quality of science education. Thus, professional development opportunities for teachers must be offered, including the creation of learning networks or communities where teachers can engage in cycles of thought and action, so that classroom practices are coherent and consistent with current international guidelines for science education, in particular, compulsory education.\nAcknowledgments The authors thank Dr. Larry Yore and Mrs. Sharyl Yore for their mentoring assistance.
