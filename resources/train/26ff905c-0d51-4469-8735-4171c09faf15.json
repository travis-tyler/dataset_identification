However, the government's efforts still failed to give satisfactory results when the condition of teacher teaching practices do not support the ability of students in mathematics achievement.\nThe results of TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) Video Study 2007 (Leung & Ragatz, 2010, p. 33) states that most junior high school mathematics teachers in Indonesia use 76% of their time to the problem activity and 24% for non-problem, while in Japan, 82% for problem activiy and 18% for non-problem, and Rachmadi Widdiharto, Badrun Kartowagiran, & Sugiman Hong Kong 85% of problem activity and 15% for non-problem activity.\nThe Report of Training Need Assessment and Recruitment (PPPPTK Matematika, 2007, p. 46 ) of a sample of 268 teachers in 15 provinces showed approximately 61.78% of the teachers had difficulty learning mathematics associated with problem solving. In a further interview with the respondents, there was a tendency for them to avoid delivering learning materials considered difficult. In terms of having no choice and a must to deliver the stated material, they lacked confidence in their performance or in their teaching practice. Sumardyono (2011, p. 244 ) in a study of math anxiety to 89 participants of mathematics teachers training in PPPPTK Matematika in 2010, from the District of Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, showed that adapting Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS), increased the level of anxiety gradually from the higher education in which teachers teach to the lower education. It means that the high school teacher had a low level of anxiety compared to the junior high school mathematics teachers or primary school teachers.\nMeanwhile, preliminary research conducted by the researchers to 38 junior high school mathematics teachers in Java, who attended PPPPTK Matematika training activities in 2012, by adopting Teacher Efficacy Scale (TES) from Tschannen-Moran, Hoy, and Hoy (1998) , reported that 13.16% of those with high-efficacy scale categories, and approximately 86.84% efficacy scale were in a medium category. The teachers were also tested with Mathematics Teacher's Efficacy Belief Instrument (MTEBI) developed by Enoch & Smith (1997) which states that most (almost all) their mathematics belief is in the medium category, and no participant was in the low or high category. Hastuti et al. (2009) mention that teacher certification improves the welfare and likely improves the teachers quality because they can concentrate more and become more motivated. However, he was not convinced by it because increasing the quality and performance is a matter of personal commitment. Sadtyadi and Kartowagiran, (2014, p. 291) mention that through the assessment done by the time the teacher is teaching, it is difficult to describe the actual performance of teachers, because they have a tendency to be better prepared, than when monitoring is not done, in the assessment of its performance.\nBased on that condition in which the teacher competence is still not optimal, and they themselves lack of confidence in carrying out the tasks they are responsible for, it is a bit difficult to expect they will be able to teach the material to their students well. Pajares (1996, p. 544) refers to Bandura\"s opinion that defines self-efficacy as a belief about their ability to successfully perform certain tasks in certain situations. Self-efficacy is also defined as an assessment of the person's ability to organize and execute courses of actions required to complete a type of work that has been determined, primarily for mathematics teachers\" duties associated with fostering students\" mathematical power (Kastberg, D\"Ambrosio, McDermot, & Saada, 2005, p . 10)."}, {"section_title": "Self-Concept", "text": "Burn (1984) states that self-concept is a composite image of what we think we are, what we think we can achieve, what we think others think of us, and what would we like to be. Most social psychologists, one of whom, Rokeach, (Burn, 1984, p. 52) agree that selfconcept as a set of self-attitudes that consist of four components appear to be embodied: (a) a belief, or knowledge or cognitive component, (b) an affective or emotional component, (c) an evaluation, and (d) a predisposition to respond. Attitude organizes a relatively enduring belief in the object or situation around as a person's tendency to respond in various ways that he or she likes. Thus the self-concept is more of a hypothetical construct. In other words, it is a concept or a useful way to predict the attitude or behavior of a person, but must be careful not to \"filter\" or judge the constructs as a thought that exists in the real world."}, {"section_title": "Self-efficacy", "text": "Another concept related to the belief of an individual or representation of one's self is the self-efficacy. Bandura in Keller (2010, p. 146) mentions another concept related to the belief in personal agency, i.e self-efficacy, the belief which is typically referred to as a person's belief that he or she can succeed in performing a given task. In line with this definition, Bandura also mentions self-efficacy as people's judgments on reviews of their abilities to organize and execute courses of action required to attain designated types of performances. Based on those opinions, it might be concluded that self-efficacy is defined as a belief or judgment about a person's ability to organize and execute courses of action required to complete a type of work that has been determined. Keller (2010, p. 146) states that a person's self-efficacy is comprised of combination of belief related to three questions: Am I capable of doing the things that are necessary for success, developing a plan that will lead to success, and persisting in my effort long enough to achieve success? Thus the results of the strength or toughness of selfefficacy can be expected of a person: whether repetition or modification of planned behavior, how much effort will be made, and how long one will survive in the face of obstacles and challenging experience."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Teacher Competency", "text": "Teacher competence, on Law No. 14 Year 2005 of Republic of Indonesia about Teachers and Lecturers, article 32, states that the promotion and development of the teaching profession as referred to in paragraph (1) includes the pedagogical competence, personal competence, social competence, and spiritual competence. In relation to the competence of mathematics teachers, there are some opinions that highlight the mastery of substance, achievement in performing or teaching in the classroom, peers assessment, or preparation of the portfolio. Fennema and Franke (Turnuklu & Yesildere, 2007, p. 2) mention that some of the components of mathematical knowledge to be possessed by a mathematics teacher: knowledge of mathematics, knowledge representation/math symbols, knowledge of the students, and knowledge about teaching and decision making.\nAnother opinion from Kulm and Wu (Turnuklu & Yesildere, 2007, p. 3) mentions the beliefs on a reciprocal basis underlying the substance of pedagogical content knowledge. Pedagogical content knowledge comprises of three components: content knowledge, teaching practice, and knowledge of the curriculum, each of which interacts reciprocally. In the practice of teaching, a teacher must understand the thought of his/her students (knowing students' thinking). The understanding of students\" thoughts is translated into five components namely: addressing students' misconception, engaging student learning in math, student learning, promoting student thinking in mathematics, and building on student math idea. Thus, this shows that the conviction of a mathematics teacher will be the basis for the substance of pedagogical knowledge, which will ultimately lead to active student activities, anticipate misconceptions, and build mathematical ideas."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Teacher Self-efficacy", "text": "Related to teacher efficacy, several studies support the theory that the belief in one's ability is the best predictor for the behavior of the completion of a task (Bandura, 1996 (Bandura, , 1997 Pajares, 1996 , in Leder, Pehkonen, & Torner, 2002 . Referring to Bandura\"s concept of self-efficacy as confidence in one's ability to organize and carry out a number of actions needed to generate the expected result, with the same understanding, Philippou and Christou (Leder et al., 2002, p. 217) , mention that the teaching efficacy can be understood as a belief in the ability of teachers to organize and create effective learning environments. The activities and actions of teachers are more dependent on what they believe than on what they know, or the competence they rarely achieve. The same idea is said by Hoy and Spero (2005, p. 29 ) that teachers 'sense of efficacy as teachers' judgments about reviews their capabilities to promote student learning.\nGibson and Debo (Leder et al., 2002, p. 218 ) classify the teacher's self-efficacy into two factors: general teaching efficacy (GTE) and personal teaching efficacy (PTE). GTE refers to teachers\" general feeling that their teaching and education system will be able to grow and develop students' academic achievement despite the negative influence of outside Rachmadi Widdiharto, Badrun Kartowagiran, & Sugiman teachers. Meanwhile, personal teaching efficacy (PTE) is intended as a reflection of teachers conviction on their own to continue the significant learning and student achievement. Furthermore, Philippou and Christou (Leder et al., 2002, p. 217) state that the efficacy of belief about the teaching of mathematics is mostly, but not entirely, shaped by one's experience and knowledge of mathematics and its pedagogy. The process skills of mathematics teachers should also be developed, i.e skills in reasoning, understanding of the concept, the relationship between concepts, representation, communication, and problem solving.\nIn relation to teachers\" efficacy and competence, Tschannen-Moran et al. (1998) proposed an Integrated Model of Teacher Efficacy Cyclical. Furthermore, with reference to Lee (2009, p. 15 ) about the teacher's selfconcept, as well as the opinion of Gibson and Dembo (1984) about the outcome efficacy, the approach develops a system model as presented in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Research on the construct of the instrument for measuring junior high school mathematics teacher self-efficacy is a kind of developmental research (Borg & Gall, 1983, p. 775) , to obtain a construct of dimensions or factors in relation to the self-efficacy of mathematics teachers, especially junior high school mathematics teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.\nThis study was conducted over four months from September to December 2013) in four districts, namely Sleman, Bantul, Kulonprogro, and Gunungkidul regencies, as well as in the municipality of Yogyakarta in the of Special Region of Yogyakarta."}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "The development of a modified construct in this study adapted Borg & Gall\"s model, which was simplified from 10 steps into 6 steps.

There are six stages in this research design. First, a construct was designed. This activity consisted of context analysis, relevant literature review, and prototype designing. At this stage, a preliminary instrument of mathematics teacher efficacy was developed. It consisted of four dimensions, namely: Personal Efficacy (PE), General Teaching Efficacy (GTE), Subject-Matter Teaching Efficacy (STE), and Outcome Efficacy (OE) based on the relevant theory and literature. The total number of items in this prototype instrument was 94 items consiting of: PE (25 items), GTE (26 items), STE (33 items), and OE (10 items). Likert scale was used with the rating scale of 1-4.\nThe second stage was validation by experts. This activity was a focus group discussion (FGD) involving eight experts or specialists from universities, consisting of: two mathematics education experts, three psychometric experts, one educational psychologist, and two experts on teacher training. The aspects assessed included: blue-print and indicators, clarity of the instruments, and the model development. The FGD results obtained content validity (content validity coefficient) through Aiken validity (Aiken, 1985, p. 132; Azwar, 2013, p. 134) was 0.71, meaning that the instrument could be used for collecting data.\nThe third stage was the limited testing. This activity involved 32 people, consisting of 22 mathematics teachers (of three districts in the province) and seven principals and three supervisors. The results of this readability test obtained a score of 4.13 which means that the instrument could be used.\nThe fourth stage was the revision or improvement. Based on the expert judgement in FGD and the limited testing, revision was done to improve the instrument in accordance with the input and advice from the experts. The fifth stage was the extended testing. In this case the test subjects were as many as 274 mathematics teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.\nThe sixth stage was the final product and its use. The data from the extended testing were analyzed by using Lisrel 8.80 through the the first order and the second order analysis of CFA in order to obtain a suitable construct between the model and data.

The sample size in the CFA analysis was determined by the number of the observed variables or items. According to Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson (2006) , for the sample size, it is recommended to use the estimates of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) at 100-200. In data analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) consisting of first-order and second order with the software of Lisrel 8.80 was used. The evaluation criteria for the model fit were by p-value on Chi-square (\uf0632) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The model was declared fit if the p-value was greater than Chi-square (\uf0632); was not significant if p-value \uf03e 0.05, meaning there is no significant difference between the model with the data (Joreskog & Sorbom, 2003, p. 128 ). The evaluation model with the RMSEA was expected to show the RMSEA value of \uf0a3 0.05 for the model considered as close to or the RMSEA value of \uf0a3 0.08 for a model declared as a good fit model.

First, the results in the second order analysis of the construct of the instrument for measuring the self-efficacy of junior high school mathematics teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta shows the model is fit to the data, indicated by Chi-Square = 297.58; df = 271; p-value = 0.12824; RMSEA = 0.019, from 54 items, 25 items obtained with factor loading (\uf06c) each dimension PE, GTE, STE, and OE consecutively are: 0.46; 0.84; 0.89 and 0.92.\nThe construct of the instrument for measuring self-efficacy of junior high school mathematics teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta consists of four dimensions. First, the dimensions of Personal Efficacy (PE) with a loading factor (\uf06c=0.41) with indicators: mathematics self concept, mathematics anxiety, and the internalization source of efficacy. Second, the dimensions of General Teaching Efficacy (GTE) with a loading factor (\uf06c = 0.84) with indicators: pedagogy content knowledge, classroom management and students engagement. Third, the dimensions of Subject-matter Teaching Efficacy (STE) with a loading factor (\uf06c=0.89) consisting of indicators: teaching strategies and fostering students' mathematical power. Fourth, Outcome Efficacy (OE) dimension with a loading factor (\uf06c=0.92), with indicators: student achievement, building mathematics attitude, and the continouing study.\nThe results of the mapping of the selfefficacy of mathematics teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta show that 43.07% of the teachers are categorized as low, 55.47% are categorized as moderate, and 1.46% are in high category.\nBesides, some suggestions are proposed. First, further research or advanced analysis needs to determine the relationship between mathematics teacher self-efficacy and teacher performance. Second, research or further analysis is required to find out how instruments are constructed for senior or vocational high school mathematics teachers."}]
