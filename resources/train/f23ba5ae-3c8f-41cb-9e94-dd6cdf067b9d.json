CSF Ab 42 and tau levels have emerged as useful biomarkers for disease and endophenotypes for genetic studies of AD. CSF tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau) are higher in AD cases compared with nondemented elderly controls (Shoji et al., 1998; Kawarabayashi et al., 2001; Strozyk et al., 2003; Sunderland et al., 2003; Hampel et al., 2004; Jia et al., 2005; Schoonenboom et al., 2005; Welge et al., 2009) . It has been shown that genetic variants that increase risk for AD modify CSF Ab 42 and tau levels, including pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, and the common variants in APOE (Kauwe et al., 2007 (Kauwe et al., , 2008 (Kauwe et al., , 2009 Ringman et al., 2008; Cruchaga et al., 2010) . CSF ptau levels correlate with the number of neurofibrillary tangles and the load of hyperphosphorylated tau present in the brain (Buerger et al., 2006) . Elevated CSF ptau levels are correlated with neuronal loss and predict cognitive decline and conversion to AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (de Leon et al., 2004; Buerger et al., 2006; Andersson et al., 2007) . Enigmatically, CSF tau levels are normal or low in other tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy, so the precise relationship between the burden of tau pathology as well as the extent of neurodegeneration and the levels of CSF tau remain to be fully clarified (Hu et al., 2011) . This notwithstanding, CSF tau levels may be a useful marker to identify genetic variants implicated not only with risk for Alzheimer's disease but also age at onset (Kauwe et al., 2008) or rate of progression (Shoji et al., 1998; Cruchaga et al., 2010) . Previous GWAS for CSF tau and ptau levels (Han et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011) have been conducted in much smaller samples and have shown robust association with markers on chromosome 19 surrounding APOE but failed to detect additional genome-wide significant associations. We have conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CSF tau and ptau using a sample that is more than three times the size of previous studies and have successfully detected loci that show novel genome-wide significant association signals."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Variability in CSF Tau and Ptau Levels Explained by Common Variants", "text": "Before performing any analysis, we performed stringent quality control (QC) in both the genotype and the phenotype data. For the phenotype data we confirmed that the tau and ptau level followed a normal distribution after log transformation. We also performed a stepwise regression analysis to identify the covariates showing a significant association with these endophenotypes. We performed a GWAS on 1,269 unrelated individuals recruited through the Knight-ADRC at Washington University, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a biomarker Consortium of Alzheimer Disease Centers coordinated by University of Washington and the University of Pennsylvania (Table 1 and see Table S1 available online). While there are differences in the absolute levels of the biomarker measurements between the different studies that likely reflect differences in the methods used for quantification (regular ELISA versus Luminex), both methods measure the same analytes but yield different absolute levels. In addition, CSF ptau and tau levels in the different studies show similar characteristics. CSF ptau and tau levels show a 10-to 17-fold difference in each data set, are normally distributed after log transformation, and have similar covariates in each data set (see statistical analyses).\nTo maximize our statistical power we performed a singlestage GWAS with our combined sample (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2007; Rohlfs et al., 2007; Kraft and Cox, 2008) . The sample includes 687 elderly nondemented individuals and 591 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD (Tables 1 and S1 ). We used linear regression to test the additive genetic model of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for association with CSF biomarker levels after adjustment for age, gender, site, and the three principal component factors from population stratification analysis. A total of 5,815,690 imputed and genotyped SNPs were included in these analyses. The inclusion of clinical dementia rating (CDR) or case/control status did not change the results significantly. No evidence of systematic inflation of p values was found (l = 1.003 for ptau, and 1.009 for tau). To estimate the proportion of variance in CSF tau and ptau levels explained by genetic variants we used a genome-partitioning analysis (Yang et al., 2011) . Approximately 7% (ptau) and 15% (tau) of the variability in the CSF levels of these proteins are explained by variants included on the GWAS chip plus the imputed SNPs. In this study SNPs in the APOE region show a genome-wide significant association with CSF tau and ptau (Tables 2 and 3 ) and explain just 0.25%-0.29% of the variability in CSF tau and ptau, suggesting that most of the genetic variability in CSF tau and ptau levels is explained by other genetic variants."}, {"section_title": "APOE Variants Affect CSF Tau and Ptau Levels Independently of Ab 42", "text": "Prevailing hypotheses suggest that APOE \u03b54 exerts its pathogenic effects through an Ab-dependent mechanism (Castellano et al., 2011) . However, several SNPs in the APOE region were genome-wide significant with both tau and ptau (rs769449; p = 1.96 3 10 \u00c016 and 2.56 3 10 \u00c018 , respectively; Tables 2 and 4 ; Figure 1) . To determine whether APOE SNPs influence CSF tau and ptau levels independently of Ab pathology, and disease status we performed analyses including CSF Ab 42 levels, or CDR as covariates in a regression model. When clinical status was included as a covariate the APOE SNP rs769449 was still the most significant signal (p = 1.23 3 10 \u00c012 ; Table 4 ). When CSF Ab 42 levels were included in the model we also found a strong, but less significant, association for rs769449 with CSF ptau levels (p = 3.22 3 10 \u00c005 ). Analyses of tau follow the same pattern (Table 4) suggesting that at least part of the tau/ptau-APOE association is due to the underlying association of APOE with Ab 42 levels. When the sample was stratified by clinical status, rs769449 showed a strong and similar effect size in both cases (n = 519; Beta: 0.067; p = 3.38 3 10 \u00c06 ) and in controls (n = 687; Beta: 0.075, p = 1.54 3 10 6 ) with CSF ptau levels (Table  S2) . Several studies have suggested that up to 30% of elderly nondemented control samples meet neuropathological criteria for AD (Price and Morris, 1999; Schneider et al., 2009 ). It has also been shown that individuals with CSF Ab 42 levels less than 500 pg/ml in the Knight-ADRC-CSF, and 192 pg/ml in the ADNI series have evidence of Ab deposition in the brain, as detected by PET-PIB (Fagan et al., 2006; Jagust et al., 2009) . Individuals with CSF Ab 42 levels below these thresholds could be classified as preclinical AD cases with the presumption that some evidence of fibrillar Ab deposits would be detected (Fagan et al., 2006; Jagust et al., 2009 ). When we used these thresholds, rs769449 showed a significant association with CSF tau and ptau in both strata, although the effect size was almost twofold higher in individuals with high Ab 42 levels (n = 416; Beta: 0.072; p = 6.58 3 10 \u00c05 , for CSF tau levels) than in individuals with low Ab 42 levels (n = 478; Beta: 0.035; p = 1.83 3 10 \u00c02 , for CSF tau levels; Loci Associated with CSF Tau and Ptau Levels Outside the APOE region, we detected genome-wide significant association with three loci for CSF tau, ptau, or both at 3q28, 9p24.2, and 6p21.1. Several SNPs in each locus showed highly significant p values (Figure 1 ). For all loci, at least one SNP was directly genotyped ( Rs514716, located at 9p24.2 in an intron of GLIS3, shows genome-wide significant association with both CSF tau and ptau levels (Figure 2) . The minor allele G (MAF = 0.136) is associated with lower CSF tau (b = \u00c00.071; p = 1.07 3 10 \u00c08 ) and ptau levels (b = \u00c00.072; p = 3.22 3 10 \u00c09 ). Seven additional intronic SNPs show genome-wide significant association with CSF ptau levels or p values lower than 9.00 3 10 \u00c005 for CSF tau levels (additional information on https://hopecenter.wustl. edu/data/Cruchaga_Neuron_2013). We used the HapMap and the 1,000 genome project data to identify all of the SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD, R 2 > 0.8) with rs514716. A total of nine SNPs were identified, all of them intronic. Our bioinformatic analysis indicated that none of these SNPs disrupt a core splice site, but all of them are located in a conserved region. Finally, for CSF ptau levels, several, relatively rare SNPs (MAF = 0.06), located at 6p21.1, within the TREM gene cluster show genome-wide significant p values ( Figure 2 ). As in the case of the other genome-wide signals, at least one SNP in the region was directly genotyped (rs6922617, b = \u00c00.094; p = 3.58 3 10"}, {"section_title": "\u00c08", "text": "; Table 2 ), and all of the CSF series contributed to the association (Table S5) . In this region, there was an additional peak driven by rs6916710 (MAF = 0.39; p = 1.58 3 10 -4; b = \u00c00.034) located in intron 2 of TREML2. In a recent study, we found a rare functional variant (R47H, rs75932628) in TREM2, which substantially increases risk for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2012) . Based on these results, we genotyped rs75932628 in the Knight-ADRC and ADNI series to test whether this variant is associated with CSF levels. TREM2 R47H (rs75932628) showed strong association with both CSF tau (MAF = 0.01; p = 6.9 3 10 -4; b = 0.19) and ptau levels (p = 2.6 3 10 -3; b = 0.16). As expected the minor allele (T) of rs75932628 is associated with higher CSF tau and ptau levels. The effect size (b) for the R47H variant was twice that of rs6922617 and rs6916710 (Table 5), while the less significant p value is explained by the lower were excluded from the analysis. A total of 13 SNPs were excluded for the APOE locus, 81 for chr 3, 14 for chr 6, and 9 for chr 9.\nNeuron GWAS for CSF Tau Levels MAF, and sample size. To determine whether the associations seen with these three SNPs represent one signal or several independent associations we analyzed the linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs and performed conditional analyses. When rs6922617, rs6916710, or rs75932628 were included as a covariate in the model the other SNPs remained significant (Table 5) . In our population, none of these SNPs were in LD with each other (Table S3 and additional information on https://hopecenter. wustl.edu/data/Cruchaga_Neuron_2013). Together these results suggest that these three SNPs are tagging three independent signals within the TREM gene cluster that influence CSF ptau levels, and at least in the case of TREM2-R47H, AD risk.\nConditional analysis was also performed for the other genome-wide significant loci to test whether the association signal at each locus is driven by a single effect or by multiple independent effects and to determine whether the identified loci interact with each other. For the other loci, the signal for the conditioned SNP (and other SNPs in the same locus) totally disappeared confirming that the association at each locus represents a single signal. Conditioning on the genome-wide significant SNPs did not dramatically change the signals in other parts of the genome (additional information on https:// hopecenter.wustl.edu/data/Cruchaga_Neuron_2013), suggesting that there is not strong interaction between these loci and the rest of the genome.\nTo evaluate the specificity of these genome-wide significant loci we also examined whether the SNPs were associated with another AD biomarker, CSF Ab42 levels. Only SNPs within the APOE region showed genome-wide association with CSF tau and CSF Ab42 (rs2075650 p = 1.83 3 10 \u00c040 ). For the other regions, the p values for association with CSF A\u00df42 were modest: 0.02 for rs9877502, 0.03, for rs514716, and for 3.6 3 10 \u00c03 rs6922617. Furthermore, the correlation between the variants that give p values < 10 \u00c04 for either phenotype was low (r 2 = 0.07). Together these results confirm the specificity of our results and that CSF tau/ptau and CSF A\u00df42 can be used as endophenotypes to identify genetic variants that influence different facets of the AD phenotype."}, {"section_title": "Gene Expression Analysis", "text": "To further characterize these associations we evaluated gene expression levels in three different ways. First, we determined whether the expression levels of the identified genes are associated with case-control status. Second, we determined whether the SNPs associated with CSF tau/ptau levels also affect tau (MAPT) gene expression levels in brain; and third, we tested whether the SNPs were associated with expression levels of the candidate genes within each locus. To do this, we analyzed MAPT, GEMC1, IL1RAP, OSTN, and FOXP4 gene expression using cDNA from the frontal lobes of 82 AD cases and 39 nondemented individuals obtained through the Knight-ADRC Neuropathology Core. In addition, MAPT, RFX3, SLC1A1, and PPAPDC2 gene expression were analyzed using publically available data from 486 late onset Alzheimer's disease cases and 279 neuropathologically clean individuals form the GSE15222 data set (Myers et al., 2007) . We found strong association for RFX3 (p = 1.39 3 10 \u00c09 ; b = 0.42), SLC1A1\n(p = 1.01 3 10 \u00c04 ; b = \u00c00.28), and PPAPDC2 (p = 4.80 3 10 \u00c03 ; b = \u00c00.35), all located in the chromosome 9 region of association, with case-control status. We also found a nominally significant association of IL1RAP (Chr. 3; p = 0.04; b = \u00c00.18) with case-control status but not for MAPT, GLIS3, GEMC1, OSTN, or FOXP4 (Table S5) . None of the SNPs associated with CSF tau/ptau levels showed an association with MAPT gene expression levels suggesting that they impact CSF tau levels by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Rs9877502 (chr. 3) showed nominally significant association with IL1RAP expression (p = 0.02; b = \u00c00.17), but not with other genes in the same locus: GEMC1 (p = 0.54; b = \u00c00.09), and OSTN (p = 0.87; b = \u00c00.02; Table S5 ).\nAnalyses of association between SNPs and gene expression was carried out using cDNA from the frontal lobes of 82 AD cases and 39 nondemented individuals obtained through the Washington University Knight-Alzheimer Disease Research Center (WU-ADRC) Neuropathology Core. Total RNA was extracted from the frontal lobe using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were prepared from the total RNA, using the HighCapacity cDNA Archive kit (ABI). Gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, using an ABI-7500 real-time PCR system. Real-time PCR assays were used to quantify MAPT, GLIS3, GEMC1, IL1RAP, OSTN, and FOXP4 cDNA levels using Taqman assays. GADPH, MAP2, AIF, and GFAP were used as reference genes. Each real-time PCR run included within-plate duplicates. Real-time data were analyzed using the comparative Ct method. The Ct values of each sample were normalized with the Ct value for the housekeeping genes. We also used the GEO data set GSE15222 (Myers et al., 2007) to analyze the association of MAPT, RFX3, SLC1A1, and PPAPDC2 genes and case-control status. None of the other genes (GLIS3, GEMC1, IL1RAP, OSTN, FOXP4) were found in this data set. This data set includes genotype and expression data from 486 late onset Alzheimer's disease cases and 279 neuropathologically clean individuals. Association of mRNA levels with case control status or the different SNPs was carried out using ANCOVA. Stepwise regression analysis was used to identify the potential covariates (postmortem interval, age at death, site, and gender) and significant covariates were included in the analysis. SNPs were tested using an additive model with minor allele homozygotes coded as 0, heterozygotes coded as 1, and major allele homozygotes coded as 2."}, {"section_title": "Impact of the Identified Loci on Other AD Phenotypes", "text": "Because the purpose of this endophenotype-based approach is to identify variants implicated in disease, we tested whether the most significant SNP from each locus shows association with risk for AD, tau pathology, or rate of cognitive decline. For the SNP located on 3q28 between GEMC1 and OSTN, each copy of the rs9877502-A allele (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.386) is associated with higher CSF tau levels (regression coefficient [b] = 0.052). Genotypes for rs9877502 were not available for the case-control series, but rs1316356, which is in LD with rs9877502 (D 0 = 1, R 2 = 0.932) showed a strong association with AD risk (b = 0.81; p = 2.67 3 10 \u00c04 ). Further, in an independent analysis leveraging two prospective cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, rs9877502 was associated with global cognitive decline (n = 1,593; b = \u00c00.014; p = 4.6 3 10 \u00c05 ), and in deceased subjects, this variant was associated with burden of neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy (n = 651; b = 0.055; p = 0.014) (Table 6 ). Importantly, these associations showed the predicted direction of effect for these phenotypes based on the CSF tau levels: the allele associated with lower tau levels is predicted to be protective for disease risk, associated with lower tau pathology, and with slower cognitive decline. There was also some evidence that the SNPs associated with CSF tau and ptau levels in the 6p21.1 locus are also associated with risk for AD. A rare (MAF = 0.01) functional coding variant with large effect size (odds ratio > 2) for AD risk was recently reported (Guerreiro et al., 2012) . This rare SNP (TREM2-R47H, rs75932628) was also associated with CSF ptau levels at p = 2.6 3 10 \u00c03 (Table 4) . For the other locus we failed to detect significant association with risk for AD, tau pathology or cognitive decline, although the direction of the effect was in the expected direction based on the CSF levels (Table 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Pathway Analyses", "text": "We performed a pathway analysis to determine whether signals that do not achieve genome-wide significance (p < 1.0 3 10 \u00c004 ) are enriched for sets of biologically related genes, represented as gene ontology terms (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG). Gene ontology terms for lipid transport and metabolism are significant for tau and ptau (Table S6) . Furthermore, the KEGG pathway Type II diabetes mellitus is also significant for ptau (enriched by MAPK9 and IRS2) and tau (enriched by MAPK9, IRS2, and MAPK1). These results and the association of genetic variants in GLIS3, implicated in diabetes, with CSF tau levels support previous data suggesting that diabetes could influence risk for AD."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We have previously shown that using CSF tau and ptau levels as endophenotypes it is possible to identify genetic variants implicated in AD (Kauwe et al., 2008 Cruchaga et al., 2011 Cruchaga et al., , 2012 . This study represents the largest GWAS for CSF tau and ptau levels performed to date. Two other GWAS using the ADNI data (n = 394) have been reported previously. In these smaller studies only the APOE locus showed genome-wide significant association with CSF Ab 42 and tau levels. By using a threefold larger sample size than these studies we were able to identify four independent genome-wide significant loci, including APOE (Table 2) . We calculated that common variants tagged by SNPs on the GWAS chip explain 6.45% and 15.14% of the overall variability in CSF ptau and tau levels, respectively. The four genome-wide significant loci identified in this study explain 1.45% of CSF ptau and 1.28% of CSF tau variability (Table 3) . Together these four loci explain 22% and 9% of the genetic component for CSF ptau and tau levels, respectively, indicating additional variants and genes associated with CSF tau and ptau levels may be identified in future, using larger data sets and different approaches such as wholegenome sequencing.\nA single-stage GWAS, rather than a two stage GWAS approach using the largest series as the discovery series, with follow up of the most significant SNPs in the rest of the samples, was used to maximize power (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2007; Rohlfs et al., 2007; Kraft and Cox, 2008) . There are several indications that the identified genome-wide significant loci are real signals and not artifacts from the analysis or type I errors. First, several SNPs in each locus show highly significant p values (Figure 1 ), and at least one SNP in each locus was directly genotyped (Table  2) , eliminating the possibility that the signal is the result of an imputation error. Second, each of the genome-wide significant loci is the result of a strong and consistent association in each data set. This is especially important, because a priori, the absolute values for the CSF biomarker traits are significantly different between series, which could lead to the identification of false positives. The fact that the SNPs show similar effect sizes and the same direction of effect in each data set indicates that we were able to correct for any potential series-bias and represents an internal replication of each of the associations. If we had performed a two-stage analysis we would have identified these same four loci. Finally, for three (chr. 19, APOE and 3q28 and 6p21.1) of the four genome-wide significant loci we also found that the SNPs associated with CSF levels are also associated with risk for disease, tau pathology, and/or cognitive decline. Importantly, all of these associations are in the direction predicted by the CSF tau and ptau associations. The alleles associated with lower tau and ptau levels (which would be considered protective) are associated with lower risk for AD, lower tangle counts and slower memory decline. As in the previously published GWAS for CSF tau/ptau levels, we found that the APOE locus was the strongest signal for CSF tau and ptau (Han et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011;  Table 2 ). SNPs in this locus explain between 0.25% and 0.29% of the variability in CSF tau and ptau levels (Table 3) . APOE is a known genetic risk factor for AD and most functional studies have focused on Ab-dependent mechanisms. To determine whether or not the association of APOE SNPs with CSF tau and ptau levels was dependent of Ab pathology we performed analyses including CSF Ab 42 levels as a covariate. We also stratified our samples by case control status and by low or high CSF Ab 42 levels. In all of these analyses, we found that the association between APOE SNPs and tau or ptau levels remained significant (Table  4 and S2), suggesting that APOE may also affect tau pathology via an Ab-independent mechanism. Several other studies support this hypothesis. APOE shows isoform specific differences in its interaction with tau in vitro (Gibb et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2006) , and in transgenic mice neuron-specific differences in APOE isoform proteolysis are associated with increased tau phosphorylation (Brecht et al., 2004) and pathology (AndrewsZwilling et al., 2010) . These data provide additional evidence that APOE could also influence risk for AD through a tau-dependent mechanism, independent of effects on Ab. When APOE genotype was included as a covariate, some SNPs in the APOE locus showed a moderate association with CSF tau/ ptau levels (rs769449; p = 9.07 3 10 \u00c003 ), indicating that most of the association is driven by APOE genotype, but suggesting that there may be additional variants in this region that modify CSF tau levels and risk for AD, independently of APOE genotype. SNPs within the 3q28 locus showed association with CSF tau/ptau levels and a range of AD phenotypes including AD risk in the case control data set, tangle pathology, and rate of cognitive decline providing four independent sources of evidence that variants in this region influence risk for AD through a tau-dependent mechanism. Bioinformatic analysis did not reveal any strong putative functional SNP. However, the genes located in this region (GEMC1, OSTN and the noncoding RNA SNAR-I, IL6RAP, UTS2D, and CCDC50) are highly expressed in brain and involved in neuronal synaptogenesis (Yoshida et al., 2012) . The most significant SNP in this locus and 33 SNPs in LD with rs9877502 are located in transcription factor binding sites and some of these SNPs are also part of a transcription factor matrix (additional information on https:// hopecenter.wustl.edu/data/Cruchaga_Neuron_2013), suggesting that rs9877502 or a linked variant could influence the expression of one or more of the genes located in this region. Based on the results of these bioinformatic analyses we performed several gene-expression experiments. IL1RAP showed a nominally significant association with case-control status (p = 0.04). In addition rs9877502 showed a significant association with IL1RAP expression in frontal cortex (p = 0.02; Table S5 ).\nThe lack of association with risk for AD in the ADGC GWAS for the most significant SNP in the 6p21.1 locus may reflect insufficient power because the SNP has a low minor allele frequency (MAF = 0.06). This hypothesis is supported by our recent identification of a rare functional coding variant (TREM2-R47H, rs75932628) in the same locus which substantially increases risk for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2012) , and is also associated with CSF ptau levels in the present study. Interestingly, the genome-wide significant signal (tagged by rs6922617) is not in LD with rs75932628. Conditional analyses in this region identified another independent SNP (Figure 2 ; Table 5 ), located in an intron of TREML2 that is associated with CSF tau and ptau levels. These data suggest that in this region there are at least three independent signals modifying CSF tau levels and risk for AD. Six TREM-family genes (TREM1, TREM2, and TREML1 to TREML4) are located in this region suggesting that several variants in genes with similar function may affect risk for AD in an independent manner. The genome-wide significant SNP in this locus (rs11966476; p = 4.79 3 10 \u00c08 ), is located in a regulatory element and could modify the expression of FOXP4, TREML3, TREML4, or TREM1 (Figure 2) . Unfortunately, these genes were not included in the GSE15222 data set and Taqman assays for these genes were out of the dynamic range so we were unsuccessful in analyzing expression levels in brain tissue. Despite this, data from the Allen Brain Atlas suggests that these genes are expressed in the brain. TREM2 was expressed at higher levels in brain tissue from AD cases compared to controls (p = 1.35 3 10 \u00c05 ), as predicted in our previous studies (Guerreiro et al., 2012) . For the 9p24.2 locus, we did not observe significant association with risk for AD. This could be because these SNPs affect another aspect of AD such as disease duration or age at onset. Alternatively, these SNPs could affect CSF clearance or protein half-life without affecting risk for AD. If this were the case, we would expect that the same locus would be associated with levels of other CSF proteins. To test this, we looked at the association of all of the SNPs identified in this study at the genome-wide significance level with other CSF biomarkers. We did not observe association between these SNPs and CSF levels of either APOE or Ab , suggesting that these loci are specific for CSF tau levels and are not associated with CSF clearance or protein half life in general. Finally, the lack of association of these loci with AD risk could indicate that the association with this locus is a type I error. The most significant SNPs in this locus are located in intron 7 of GLIS3, a gene which is highly expressed in brain. However, these SNPs (rs514716) are not associated with GLIS3 expression in our relatively small series of brain samples (82 AD cases and 39 nondemented individuals). Both common and rare variants in this gene have been associated with risk for diabetes (Barker et al., 2011; Dimitri et al., 2011) . There are several studies linking AD with glucose metabolism and diabetes (Accardi et al., 2012) . In fact, a metaanalysis combining data from eight studies, observed an association between diabetes mellitus and increased risk for AD (OR: 1.51, 95%; CI = 1.31-1.73) (Bertram et al., 2013) . In addition, our pathway analysis independently identified a diabetes pathway (path: hsa04930, p value for ptau = 6.60 3 10 \u00c003 , and tau = 8.00 3 10 \u00c004 ; Table S6 ), because of an enrichment of significant SNPs in MAPK9, IRS2, and MAPK1. Two independent analyses in this study therefore suggest that diabetes-related genes may influence CSF tau and ptau levels, and ultimately risk for AD. These data all provide supportive evidence for common variants in this locus that influence AD pathogenesis. Finally, because SNPs identified in this study were associated with CSF tau/ptau levels, we tested whether these SNPs are also associated with MAPT gene expression. None of the genomewide significant SNPs showed association with MAPT expression in the brain and MAPT expression was not associated with case-control status in our brain series, the GSE15222, or any other published work on gene expression in brain (Webster et al., 2009; Zou et al., 2012) . These results suggest that the SNPs identified in this study influence CSF tau/ptau protein levels posttranscriptional mechanism. Tau protein undergoes several posttranslational modifications including acetylation, glycosylation; and phosphorylation. These changes are thought to play an important role in tau-related pathogenesis (Far\u00edas et al., 2011; Marcus and Schachter, 2011) . It is possible that the genes identified in this study modify tau protein levels through posttranslational modification rather than gene expression.\nTogether these results clearly demonstrate the utility of using these endophenotypes to identify AD risk variants and variants associated with the rate of decline in symptomatic AD cases. The use of these endophenotype allowed us to identify risk variants that were not identified by GWAS because either those variants did not pass the stringent multiple test correction applied in the GWAS or were not covered in the earlier studies, because of their relatively low MAF. A second advantage of this approach is that in contrast to GWAS hits from case control studies the endophenotype predicts a specific biological hypothesis for the pathogenic effect, which can be directly tested.\nIn summary, we have detected four genetic loci associated with CSF levels of tau, and ptau. One of them, in APOE, is already known to be associated with CSF tau and Ab 42 (Kauwe et al., 2007 (Kauwe et al., , 2008 Cruchaga et al., 2010 Cruchaga et al., , 2011 as well as risk for AD. The other three are novel loci. The top hit for CSF tau (rs9877502; 3q28) also exhibited association with risk for AD (p = 2.67 3 10 \u00c04 ), tangle pathology (p = 0.01), and global memory decline (p = 4.86 3 10 \u00c05 ). SNPs in the 6q21.1 locus are in the TREM gene cluster close to TREM2, a gene in which a rare variant has recently been reported to substantially increase risk for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2012) . The other genome-wide significant locus identified in this study did not show association with risk for disease, tangle pathology or memory decline. The lack of association with other AD phenotypes could be because these SNPs have a weaker impact on these phenotypes, or because they affect other aspects of AD, such as disease duration or age at onset. Alternatively, the sample size for the data sets used in the pathology and memory decline studies may not provide enough statistical power. Overall, these results illustrate how genetic studies of disease endophenotypes are an effective approach for identifying disease risk loci that is complementary to case-control association studies. The association of the most significant SNPs for CSF tau and ptau for risk for AD, tangle count, or cognitive decline is shown. p values and direction for risk for disease were extracted from the previously published GWAS for AD (Naj et al., 2011) . Association with tangle counts and memory decline was performed in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) as previously reported (De Jager et al., 2012; Keenan et al., 2012) . *The p value for risk for disease is for rs1316356, which is in high LD with rs9877502. In all cases the beta is calculated in reference to the minor allele."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES", "text": "Subjects and Phenotypes CSF tau, ptau, and Ab 42 were measured in 1,269 individuals. There were 501 samples from research participants enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight-ADRC, 394 in ADNI, 323 in studies at the University of Washington (UW), and 51 in studies in University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). CSF collection and Ab 42 , tau, and ptau181 measurements were performed as described previously (Fagan et al., 2006) . Table 1 shows the demographic data and description of the CSF biomarkers in each data set. The samples were genotyped using Illumina chips. Cases received a diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), using criteria equivalent to the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association for probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984) . Controls received the same assessment as the cases but were nondemented. All individuals were of European descent and written consent was obtained from all participants. While there are differences in the absolute levels of the biomarker measurements between the studies that likely reflect differences in the methods used for quantification (regular ELISA versus Luminex), ascertainment, and/or in handling of the CSF after collection, CSF ptau levels in the Knight-ADRC, ADNI, UW, and UPenn samples show similar characteristics (Table S1) . CSF ptau and tau show a 10-fold difference between individuals in each data set and have similar covariates in each data set.\nThe Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) recruit participants without known dementia who agree to annual clinical evaluations and sign an Anatomic Gift Act donating their brains at death. The full cohort with genotype data included 1,708 subjects (817 ROS and 891 MAP). The mean age at enrollment was 78.5 years and 30.9% were male. At the last evaluation, 24.9% met clinical diagnostic criteria for AD and 21.8% had mild cognitive impairment. The summary measure of global cognitive performance was based on annual assessments of 17 neuropsychiatric tests. A nested autopsy cohort consisted of 651 deceased subjects (376 ROS and 275 MAP); mean age at death was 81.5 years and 37.6% were male. Proximate to death, 40.9% of subjects included in the autopsy cohort met clinical diagnostic criteria for AD. Bielschowsky silver stain was used to visualize neurofibrillary tangles in tissue sections from the midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, and entorhinal cortices, and the hippocampal CA1 sector. A quantitative composite score for neurofibrillary tangle pathologic burden was created by dividing the raw counts in each region by the standard deviation of the region specific counts and then averaging the scaled counts over the five brain regions to create a single standardized summary measure.

The ADNI samples were genotyped with the Illumina 610 chip, and the UPenn sample with the Omniexpress.

Genotype data were cleaned by applying a minimum call rate for SNPs and individuals (98%) and minimum minor allele frequencies (0.02). SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1 3 10 \u00c06 ) were excluded. The QC cleaning steps were applied for each genotyping array separately. We tested for unanticipated duplicates and cryptic relatedness among samples using pairwise genome-wide estimates of proportion identity-by-descent. When a pair of identical samples or a pair of samples with cryptic relatedness was identified, the sample from the Knight-ADRC or samples with a higher number of SNPs passing QC were prioritized. Eigenstrat (Price et al., 2006) was used to calculate principal component factors for each sample and confirm the ethnicity of the samples.

Because the CSF biomarker levels were measured using different platforms (Innotest plate ELISA versus AlzBia3 bead-based ELISA, respectively), we were not able to combine the raw data. For the combined analyses we standardized the mean of the log transformed values from each data set to zero. No significant differences in the transformed and standardized CSF values for different series were found. We used Plink to analyze the association of SNPs with CSF biomarker levels.
