[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "White Matter Hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer's disease. However, the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not as clearly related to vascular causes, and therefore the role of WMHs as a marker of small-vessel disease (SVD) in PD is less clear. Currently, SVD in PD is assessed and treated independently of the disease. However, if WMH as the major MRI sign of SVD has a higher impact on cognitive decline in PD patients than in healthy controls, vascular pathology needs to be assessed and treated with a higher priority in this population. Here we investigate whether the presence of WMHs leads to increased cognitive decline in de Novo PD, and if these effects relate to cortical atrophy. WMHs and cortical thickness were measured in de novo PD patients and age-matched controls (N PD = 365, N Control = 174) from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) to study the relationship between baseline WMHs, future cognitive decline (follow-up:\n4.09 \u00b1 1.14 years) and cortical atrophy (follow-up: 1.05 \u00b1 0.10 years). PD subjects with high baseline WMH loads had significantly greater cognitive decline than i) PD subjects with low WMH load, and ii) control subjects with high WMH load. Furthermore, in PD subjects, high WMH load resulted in more cortical thinning in the right frontal lobe. The results show that the presence of WMHs in de novo PD patients predicts greater future cognitive decline and cortical atrophy than in normal aging."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "\nimplement different tests to assess cognition and many do not perform a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.\nCapitalizing on the longitudinal assessment of cognitive abilities and neuroimaging biomarkers in the large-scale, multi-centre cohort of de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative 25 , we investigated the relationship between WMH burden and: 1) cognitive decline over time, and 2) cortical grey matter changes over time (as indexed by cortical thinning) in early stages of PD.\nvalidate the correlation between these two components, we verified their relationship in the PD population (r=0.56, p<0.0001). For more information on clinical measurements, see supplementary material, section Cognitive Testing. Procedures: All MR images were preprocessed using our standard pipeline 27 in three steps: noise reduction, intensity non-uniformity correction, and intensity normalization.\nT2-weighted and FLAIR images were linearly co-registered to the T1-weighted images using a 6-parameter rigid registration. The T1-weighted images were first linearly and then nonlinearly registered to the standard template (MNI-ICBM-152). The WMHs were segmented using a previously validated automatic multi-modality segmentation technique in the native space of FLAIR or T2-weighted scans to avoid further blurring caused by resampling of the images 28, 29 . This technique uses a set of location and intensity features obtained from a library of manually segmented scans in combination with a random forest classifier to detect the WMHs in new images. The libraries used in\nthis study were obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset since the T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences for the PPMI images follow the same acquisition protocol as ADNI. The quality of the registrations and segmentations was visually assessed and cases that did not pass this quality control were discarded (n=43). WMHL was defined as the volume (in cm 3 ) of all segmented WMH voxels in the standard space, i.e. the WMH volumes were corrected for total intracranial volume (ICV). All MRI processing and segmentation steps were blinded to clinical outcomes.\nFor voxel-wise analysis of WMHs, the WMH probability maps generated by the segmentation tool were nonlinearly transformed to the template space at 2\u00d72\u00d72mm 3 resolution and blurred with a 3D Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum of 5 mm to compensate for the variability caused by differences in voxel sizes in the native FLAIR and T2-weighted images. Rates of cognitive decline were calculated for subjects that had at least one-year follow-up information as the change of the score per year (N PD =365, N HC =174), using a linear regression between time and the score values at different time points along with an intercept term.\nOnly subjects with T1-weighted 3T MRI data at both initial/baseline visit and at a one-\nyear follow-up MRI were included for cortical thickness analysis (N Total =155, see Table   1 ). Cortical models were generated using the CIVET 2.1 preprocessing pipeline 30 , registered to MNI-ICBM-152 template, and analyzed using the SurfStat software package (http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/) 31 . Distances between inner and outer cortical surfaces were evaluated to provide a measure of cortical thickness at each vertex. Changes in cortical thickness were calculated by subtracting the values (\u0394t=t 1 \u2212t 2 ) at the one-year follow-up (t 2 ) from the baseline (t 1 ). The average time\nbetween the baseline and follow-up visits was 1.05\u00b10.11 and 1.05\u00b10.09 years for the PD and control subjects, respectively.\n\n\nwith low WMHL. Taken together, these findings suggest that measures of WMHL in de novo PD patients can predict later cognitive decline, even in patients exhibiting no cognitive symptoms at baseline. This information could potentially be used to enrich PD cohorts in clinical trials of neuroprotective agents.\nAs with previous studies 43 , cross-sectional WMHL at baseline in early PD was not significantly associated with baseline cognitive performance. Rather, WMHL at baseline was associated with future cognitive deterioration across multiple cognitive domains including visuospatial, memory, and global cognition, and this independent of age. This suggests that we can extend previous work on later stages of PD, where WMH burden was significantly associated with conversion to dementia in patients with MCI 44, 45 , to the earliest stages of the disease. In line with these findings, post-mortem studies have shown that vascular lesions are common in idiopathic PD (i.e., Lewy body disease of the brainstem type) 46 .\nMoCA has been validated as a sensitive measure for detecting and monitoring cognitive change over time 38 . Controlling for age, MoCA decline was significantly correlated with baseline WMHL in the PD cohort, but not in controls. Additionally, PD subjects with high WMHLs were more likely to experience a 2-point drop in MoCA than i) the low WMHL PD and ii) the high WMHL HC subjects, as evaluated by the survival analysis.\nRepeating the analysis with a tertile split yielded consistent results (Fig. 1) , supporting the robustness of the findings. The driver for cognitive decline in controls and PD appear to differ in that the former is largely driven by age, while the latter is affected by both advancing age and greater baseline WMHL.\nWhile the literature on PD and WMH is scarce, there has been substantial progress in understanding the relationship between WMHs and cognitive impairment and dementia in AD, especially in the context of amyloid pathology. WMHs associated with vascular risk factors (e.g., hypoperfusion and inflammation) are thought to precede A\u03b2 aggregation. Previous work found significant associations between baseline WMHs and later progression of amyloid load 47 . This further supports the hypothesis of a chain of events; namely vascular pathology associated with WMHs impairs clearance of amyloid, which builds up and contributes to cognitive impairment and AD symptoms.\nWhile amyloid deposition strongly predicts progression to AD, WMH burden can provide additional independent information to this prediction 48 , suggesting that WMH is not solely related to amyloid pathology, but can directly impact cognitive impairment.\nInterestingly, there has also been evidence linking low levels of amyloid beta in CSF, which is considered as a marker of parenchymal and small vessel deposition of this protein, and parieto-occipital WMH load in PD patients that experience cognitive decline, showing both an independent cross-sectional association between moderate-tosevere parieto-occipital WMHs, decrease in CSF amyloid beta levels and PD-dementia, as well as a longitudinal association between moderate-to-severe parieto-occipital WMHs and low CSF amyloid beta with progression to dementia 49 . Whether a similar interaction between vascular lesions and \u03b1-synuclein formation or deposition occurs in PD remains unclear and will require further study.\nWMH burden can also precede irreversible neurological damage as indexed by cortical atrophy. Previous studies have found higher WMHL to be correlated with lower cortical thickness in frontotemporal regions which in turn are related to cognitive decline 21 .\nCortical thinning caused by direct or indirect effects of small vessel disease as indicated by WMHs (tract-specific damage) might lead to cognitive decline and eventually dementia. Cortical thickness might be a sensitive measurement to detect regional grey matter micro-changes that are missed by conventional voxel-based techniques at the earlier stages of the neurodegeneration due to partial volume effects 50, 51 . While we observed whole-brain cortical thinning among all PD patients, those with high WMHL showed greater cortical thinning of a frontal cluster, mostly encompassing the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) which was further associated with decline in memory performance in HVLT over the one-year period. This is consistent with previous studies that have found significant associations between rDLPFC and HVLT scores 52, 53 . Our results suggest that cortical changes in early PD are potentially moderated by WMHL, and might in turn presage cognitive decline.\nPrevention and treatment of vascular risk factors associated with WMHs is a promising avenue to slow down cognitive deterioration, especially in de novo PD patients who are largely cognitively asymptomatic. The classical and most explored strategy regarding reduction of vascular disease risk and WMHs has been to control hypertension, which subsequently reduces the risk of cognitive deterioration 11, 12, 54 . In a randomized trial, active lowering of blood pressure was shown to stop or lower the progression of WMHs in patients with cerebrovascular disease over 3 years of follow-up 14 . In the present cohort, we observed an association between WMHL and (systolic-diastolic) blood pressure for both PDs and controls (p<0.001). However, there is also evidence linking WMHs and dementia in PD to orthostatic hypotension, a common occurrence in PD which can be aggravated with anti-hypertensive medication, especially as the disease From a practical standpoint, WMHs can be quantified reliably and non-invasively on large samples and can be measured as a continuous trait, thus providing increased statistical power to detect potential associations 12 . The image processing and WMH segmentation pipelines used in this study have been designed to process data from multi-center studies, are able to control biases due to multi-site MRI scanning (i.e. differences in acquisition parameters), and have been previously applied successfully to a number of multi-site projects [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . The WMH segmentation pipeline has been trained and extensively validated on data from multiple scanners and different acquisition parameters to ensure inter-site and inter-scanner generalizability 29 .\nThe ranges of the WMH loads found in this study for both control and de novo PD populations (mean value of 7 CCs = 0.37% of the total intracranial volume) were similar to values reported in other normal aging studies, suggesting that similar trends of decline can be expected in such populations as well [61] [62] [63] [64] .\nWe acknowledge there are limitations to the present study. First, while their differences were accounted for in our analysis, segmentations were based on either T2-weighted (N=293) or FLAIR (N=246) images, of which the latter has the better contrast for detecting WMHs. Second, subjects had these scans only at their baseline visit; therefore, novo, other studies have also found only weak associations between different variables and cognition in different domains, after adjusting for age 31, 67 . While some of the correlation coefficients in the present study may be considered modest, they nonetheless hold important clinical implications.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that WMH burden is an important predictor of subsequent acceleration in cortical thinning and cognitive decline in early-stage de novo PD. Recognizing WMHs as early indicators of cognitive deficit, prior to onset of MCI or dementia, provides an opportunity for timely interventions 25, 56 . "}, {"section_title": "Introduction:", "text": "While Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically characterized by motor symptoms, cognitive deficits occur in approximately 15% of patients in early drug-na\u00efve stages 1 . Two decades after disease onset, this prevalence increases to over 80% 2 . Early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a strong predictor of later development of dementia 3, 4 , which is a key determinant of mortality and poorer quality of life in PD 5 6, 7 . More specifically, they report that high levels of cortical amyloid beta correlate with faster progression to dementia 6 , and that in a cohort of samples obtained from 92 PD patients with a diagnosis of diagnosis, almost a third had histopathologic findings associated with AD as a comorbidity 7 . Nevertheless, how vascular pathology (i.e., small-vessel disease (SVD) 8, 9 ) -assessed by white matter changes or leukoaraiosis 10 -may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD remains unclear.\nThe term SVD is mainly related to two etiologies: age-related vascular disease, also referred as arteriolosclerosis, or vascular-risk-factor related SVD 11, 12 , and cerebral amyloid angiopathy 13 , which is also present in the small cortical vessels in AD A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T pathology. Both etiologies play a crucial role in stroke, dementia and aging, and could also be relevant in PD. Therefore, early detection of WMHs and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors could have a positive impact on cognitive decline in PD [14] [15] [16] [17] .\nOne measure of SVD is white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) which are areas of increased signal in T2-weighted and FLAIR structural MRI 18 . Neuropathologic correlates of WMHs include loss of axons and glial cells, myelin rarefaction, spongiosis, perivascular demyelination, gliosis, subependymal glial accumulation and loss of the ependymal lining 9 . Despite the various findings, consensus exists regarding the association of WMHs and SVD 18 .\nIn Alzheimer's disease (AD), WMHs have been extensively studied and strongly predict rapid cognitive decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 19, 20 . In PD, the pathogenic role of vascular risk factors is less clear 5 and results have been contradictory 17 . WMHs might cause cognitive decline independent of PD, or the synergy between the two mechanisms may accelerate cognitive impairment 17 .\nAlternatively, WMHs might aggravate the pathologic spread of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein or amyloid-\u03b2 proteins. WMH burden can also precede neurological damage as indexed by cortical atrophy. Higher WMHL has been shown to correlate with lower cortical thickness in regions that are related to cognitive decline 21 . Cortical thinning caused by direct or indirect effects of WMHs might lead to cognitive decline in PD.\nOf the few studies that have investigated WMHs and cognitive decline in PD, most are cross-sectional, include patients that are on dopaminergic medication, and are typically from cohorts that are at later stages of disease [22] [23] [24] .
