[{"section_title": "", "text": "THE DECLINE OF BREEDING BIRD POPULATIONS in forests of eastern North America has received considerable recent attention (Askins et al. 1990 , Hagan and Johnston 1992 , Finch and Stangel 1993 . The status of bird populations in grasslands and midcontinental areas, however, has received far less attention. Yet, analyses of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data indicate that more breeding species are declining than increasing in the prairie regions of North America (Droege and Sauer 1994) . Also, grassland species show greater and more consistent patterns of decline at the continental level than do other ecological guilds, including long-distance migrants in eastern forests (Askins 1993, Droege and . These declines have been most pronounced in areas of intensive agriculture, such as the Midwest (Herkert 1991 (Herkert , 1995 Warner 1994 ) and the northern Great Plains (Johnson and Schwartz 1993, Reynolds et al. 1994) .\nAlthough the BBS is the best source of quantitative data on trends of breeding bird populations in the midcontinent, it has several limitations, including sparse coverage in central North America and biases associated with road-' E-mail: larry-igl@nbs.gov side surveys. Several studies have attempted to verify population trends from the BBS with data from independent, long-term surveys (e.g. Breeding Bird Atlas: Robbins et al. 1989; checklists: Temple and Cary 1990; Christmas Bird Count: Hagan 1993 ; migration counts: Dunn and Hussell 1995) . Parallel trends derived from studying the same populations in different ways may provide corroborating evidence and strengthen the assessment of population trends of the BBS. Compared with eastern deciduous forests (e.g. Johnston and Hagan 1992) , however, long-term data sets on breeding birds in the midcontinent are scarce.\nThough a paucity of comparative information exists in the midcontinent, historic surveys provide an often overlooked source of baseline data on breeding bird populations (e.g. Graber and Graber 1963) . These include the extensive survey of breeding birds in North Dakota conducted by Stewart and Kantrud (1972) in 1967 to obtain estimates of statewide breeding bird abundances and frequencies of occurrence. Data from the Stewart-Kantrud survey provided a unique opportunity to evaluate changes in breeding bird populations in the northern Great Plains. In 1992 and 1993, we repeated the Stewart-Kantrud survey using the same sample units and methods. Our objectives in this paper are to: (1) examine changes in breeding bird populations in North Dakota; (2) compare patterns in breeding bird population changes with trends from the BBS; and (3) assess the likelihood that population changes have been influenced by changes in land use in North Dakota."}, {"section_title": "STUDY AREA AND METHODS", "text": "Study area.-Situated in the geographical center of North America, North Dakota has a climate characterized by warm summers and long, cold winters. The distribution of precipitation is highly seasonal, with --about 75% of the annual precipitation occurring during the growing season (April-September; Jensen 1972) . Precipitation for January through June (f = 22. 4 cm, 1961-1990) in North Dakota was nearly normal in 1967 (21.8 cm), below normal in 1992 (18.0 cm), and above normal in 1993 (25.7 cm; NOAA 1967 NOAA ,1992 NOAA , 1993 . Many areas in North Dakota and the northern Great Plains experienced moderate to extreme drought conditions from 1988 to early (NOAA 1988 . In 1967, Stewart and Kantrud (1972) divided the state into eight major strata based on biogeographical, physiographical, and ecological characteristics (Fig.  1) . From these eight strata, Stewart and Kantrud (1972) selected 130 sample units by random selection without replacement. The number of sample units allocated to each stratum was proportional to the area of the stratum. Within each stratum, sample units were proportionately distributed according to the relative size of substrata that were differentiated on the basis of prevalent habitat types. The number of substrata ranged from two to five for each of the eight major strata and totaled 27 for the state. The stratification used by Stewart and Kantrud (1972) was effective in reducing the estimated variance in population estimates by as much as 15% compared with simple random sampling (Nelms et al. 1994) .\nTo facilitate a direct comparison, we surveyed the same sample units used by Stewart and Kantrud (Fig. 1; H. A. Kantrud unpubl. data) . We visited 128 of the 130 quarter-sections (each ca. 64.7 ha) originally surveyed by Stewart and Kantrud in 1967 ; landowners denied access to the two other quarter-sections. Comparisons among years are based on the 128 quartersections that were surveyed in all three years.\nMethods.-We surveyed breeding birds using the same methods employed by Stewart and Kantrud (1972; H. A. Kantrud pers. comm.) . Surveys were conducted by two observers on foot. Each observer surveyed a rectangular half (805 x 402 m; 32.37 ha) of a quarter-section by following a standardized survey route. This route was 100 m inside of and parallel to the boundary of the rectangle. Deviations up to 100 m from the route often were necessary to survey all habitats adequately. The rectangular halves usually were surveyed simultaneously, and an interval of 400 m was maintained between observers. Both observers compared field notes at the end of each coverage of a sample unit to prevent duplications in the counts of wide-ranging birds such as vultures, hawks, and crows. We minimized observer bias in 1992 and 1993 by using the same two observers in both years. In 1993, some of the quarter-sections were surveyed by a single, experienced observer, who censused both rectangular halves on the same day.\nLarge wetlands required a different type of coverage. Birds on open water were counted with a spotting scope from the shoreline. In large zones of emergent vegetation, one observer attempted to flush large (e.g. ducks and herons) or secretive (e.g. rails and bitterns) species by wading in a zigzag course throughout the wetland while making noise. From a nearby vantage point, the second observer recorded all birds flushed, including conspicuous, colonial marsh birds such as Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus).\nThe phenological advance in seasons during the spring and early summer is about two weeks earlier in southwestern North Dakota than in the northeastern portion of the state. To compensate for these differences, the sequence in which sample units were covered progressed from southwestern to northeastern North Dakota. We matched the date that a quartersection was surveyed in 1992 and 1993 as closely as feasible to the date that it was surveyed in 1967 (H. A. Kantrud unpubl. data). The surveys of breeding birds extended from 24 April to 19 July in 1967, from 27 April to 18 July in 1992, and from 24 April to 21 July in 1993. The overall absolute difference between the 1967 surveys and the 1992 and 1993 surveys averaged 3.3 days and 1.7 days, respectively.\nIn each year, sample units were surveyed once or twice; the number of breeding pairs for each species, however, was based on single counts during each species' peak breeding period. All sample units were surveyed for early-nesting species between 24 April and 7 June, for mid-nesting species between 14 May and 10 July, and for late-nesting species between 22 May and 21 July (Table 1) . When a survey was conducted during an overlapping portion of the peak breeding periods, counts of early-, mid-, and latenesting species coincided. Thus, quarter-sections that were visited between 22 May to 7 June were surveyed only once, and those that were surveyed before 22 May were surveyed again after 7 June to include species from all three breeding periods. Peak breeding periods for some species differ from those in Stewart and Kantrud (1972) due to typographical errors in the original publication; these errors did not affect statewide population estimates or variances in Stewart and Kantrud (1972) . Stewart and Kantrud (1972, Kantrud 1982 ) felt justified in estimating bird populations in open habitats using single counts because many species have behavioral adaptations (e.g. elevated perches, flight songs, synchronous displays) that tend to increase their detectability compared with birds inhabiting extensive wooded areas (see Speirs and Orenstein 1967, Cody 1985) .\nSpecies were identified by sight or sound. Counts during precipitation and strong winds (>24 km/h) were avoided. Surveys of open-country birds were conducted between 0.5 h after sunrise and 0.5 h before sunset. Although some surveys occurred outside the time of peak vocal activity (i.e. early morning or late evening), Stewart and Kantrud (1972) concluded that singing and other activities of open-country birds were not appreciably affected by time of day. Quarter-sections containing extensive woodland habitats usually were covered on relatively calm ( < 8 km/h), sunny days between 0.5 h after sunrise and 1000 CST. These limitations were necessary because song frequencies and other activities of most woodland birds are reduced on cloudy days, in moderate or high winds, and at midday.\nCounts of breeding birds were based primarily on the number of indicated breeding pairs on territories or home ranges during peak breeding periods. For most species, nearly all indicated pairs were observed as segregated pairs or as territorial males. For Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), segregated pairs and lone females were recorded as indicated pairs. Although currently not in vogue, for consistency we based the number of indicated pairs of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) on the total number of males seen per sample unit. In the case of colonial birds that are not sexually dimorphic (e.g. Black Tern [Chlidonias niger] and Cliff Swallow [Hirundo pyrrhonota]), the number of indicated pairs was based either on a count of occupied nests or was derived by halving the total number of individuals counted.\nThe procedures used to determine the number of pairs of breeding waterfowl followed Hammond (1969) with one exception. Occasionally, the number of lone females on a given quarter-section exceeded the number of males unaccompanied by females. In this case, each excess lone female was considered to represent an indicated pair.\nWe excluded from our results birds that we considered to be nonbreeders. These included: (1) migrant flocks and individuals of species that are not known to breed in North Dakota (Faanes and Stewart 1982) ; (2) nonbreeding, vagrant waterbirds in the summer and oversummering shorebirds (i.e. transient shorebirds remaining in North Dakota during the boreal summer); (3) wide-ranging colonial waterbirds passing high overhead (e.g. pelicans and gulls); and (4) other birds passing overhead in high, direct flight. By counting birds only during their peak breeding periods, we maximized the potential for recording breeding pairs and territorial males and, at the same time, minimized the likelihood for confounding territorial birds with migrants.\nVernacular and scientific names follow the American Ornithologists' Union (1983) and subsequent supplements, with one exception. We recorded Redshafted (Colaptes auratus cafer) and Yellow-shafted (C. auratus auratus) subspecies of the Northern Flicker separately to reflect their species status in 1967. One obvious intergrade was recorded as a Red-shafted Flicker in 1967.\nSpecies classification.-Based on published accounts, we classified each species into one of three groups according to its migratory behavior (Table 1) : permanent resident (present in North Dakota year-round), short-distance migrant (winters primarily north of the U.S./Mexico border), and long-distance migrant (winters primarily south of the U.S./Mexico border; Faanes and Stewart 1982 , AOU 1983 , Harrison 1983 , Rappole et al. 1983 , Hayman et al. 1986 , Madge and Burn 1988 , Thompson et al. 1993 ). The migratory status of some year-round residents (e.g. Blue Jay [Cyanocitta cristata], American Crow [Corvus brachyrhynchos], European Starling [Sturnus vulgaris]) was d;fficult to determine because some wintering individuals may have originated from breeding populations north of North Dakota. We considered these species to be short-distance migrants. In addition, we categorized each species into a general breeding habitat based on the literature (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Peterjohn and Sauer 1993 ) and personal observations. Habitats were described as wetland (including wet meadow), grassland, open habitat with scattered trees, woodland, open or semiopen deciduous woodland and edge, shrubland, residential areas and human-made structures (hereafter, human-made structures), and \"other\" (mostly unvegetated habitats including clay buttes, cliffs, banks, etc.). Waterfowl were included in the wetland class, i.e. their primary foraging and broodrearing habitat. Species using a broad range of habitats (e.g. Song Sparrow [Melospiza melodia], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were classified according to their principal habitat type.\nCalculation of population estimates.-We estimated population means and totals, and their standard deviations, using standard methods for stratified random samples with proportional allocation (Cochran 1977) . We calculated Bayesian confidence intervals (95% confidence limits; Box and Tiao 1973) in lieu of the usual confidence intervals using the methods described in Johnson (1977) . Bayesian intervals exploit the prior knowledge that the means of bird densities and of total numbers of birds are non-negative. Population estimates are given only for species with statewide frequencies of occurrence of 10% or higher (i.e. common species). Results for 1967 in this paper may vary slightly from those given in Stewart and Kantrud (1972) and 1993 values were both significant at P 5 0.10 and only if both differences were in the same direction.\nBiases associated with the bird survey were not quantified (see Stewart and Kantrud 1972) . In 1967, Stewart and Kantrud made efforts to minimize apparent biases in methodology through adjustments in census techniques. In the recent surveys, we endeavored to conduct our surveys as similarly as possible to the methods used in 1967. We recognize that the size of the breeding population for certain species may be over-or underestimated. For example, we assumed that all males were mated, although some territorial males may have been unmated (e.g. Dickcissel [Spiza americana], Fretwell and Calver 1970; Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapillus], Gibbs and Faaborg 1990) . Also, population estimates of wide-ranging species or species with large territories or home ranges may have been overestimated. For polygynous (e.g. Yellow-headed Blackbird [Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus]) and polyandrous (Wilson's Phalarope) species, the number of indicated pairs represents, in terms of breeding mates, a minimum population. Undoubtedly, biases related to differences in observers, years, weather, sampling time, etc. were present, but biases associated with methodology should be relatively consistent among years.\nBreeding Bird Survey trends.-We obtained trends in abundance from the BBS for North Dakota during the period 1967-1993 (J. R. Sauer and B. G. Pete john pers. comm.). Trends are based on statistical methods described by Geissler and Sauer (1990) and are presented as the average percent annual change between 1967 and 1993. In North Dakota, the BBS began in 1967, the same year that Stewart and Kantrud (1972) conducted their survey.\nLand use changes.-Comparable data on land use and cover were available each year for every quarter-section. To evaluate overall changes in major habitats, we digitized land use and cover by drawing vectors over scaled rasters of scanned aerial photographs using Map and Image Processing System (MIPS) software (Microimages, Inc. 1992) . Eight major land use or cover classes were delineated: (1) Cropland (all land used for the production of annual field crops and land under summer fallow); (2) Hayland (areas that have been plowed and seeded to mixtures of grasses and legumes for forage or seed production); (3) Grassland (natural grassland regardless of condition and disturbance regime [e.g. grazed, mowed, idle] and areas planted to introduced species); (4 5  0  11  28  1  2  12  45  11  44  212  113  200  171  23  58  0  1  0  286  99  145  87  25  52  96  111  118  25  22  32  10  4  5  27  19  42  2  0  1  3  4  4  0  0  1  0  0  2  36  56  23  2  0  1  15  21  34  0  1  0  3  2  8  0  1  1  7  14  25  7  11  16  4  4  8  0  2  3  5  10  11  0  3  3  17  40  36 Migratory statusb and semipermanent riparian areas); (7) Human-made Structures (human-made structures, fence rows and field borders, and road and railroad rights-of-way); and (8) Clay Buttes (portions of clay buttes that are mostly unvegetated).\nSpecies composition.-One hundred and sixtyone breeding bird species (not including subspecies) were recorded within the 128 quartersections surveyed in at least one year, including 129 species in 1967,144 in 1992, and 153 in 1993. These 161 species represent about 72% of the 223 species of North Dakota's breeding avifauna (Faanes and Stewart 1982) . Most of the remaining species that were not observed on the quarter-sections are either rare, uncommon, localized, or irregular breeders in North Dakota (Faanes and Stewart 1982, DeSante and Pyle 1986) .\nThe composition of breeding birds in North Dakota in 1992 and 1993 was similar to that in 1967 (Table 1) . One hundred twenty-two species were recorded in all three years, 21 species were observed in two of the three years, and 18 species were detected in only one of the three years (Table 1) . One species was recorded only in 1967, four species only in 1992, and 13 species only in 1993. Thirty-two species were observed only in 1992 and/or 1993, but not in 1967.\nMost (92%) of the 161 breeding bird species are migratory, and only a few species are considered permanent residents that show little or no seasonal movements in North Dakota (Tables 1 and 2). Of the species that migrate, 86 species are short-distance migrants and 62 are long-distance migrants. Moreover, migrants constituted over 96% of the total number of indicated pairs detected each year. Short-distance migrants composed over one-half of the observed indicated pairs each year.\nAmong breeding habitat associations, wetland species composed the largest proportion (32%) of species, followed by species associated with open woodland or edge and grassland habitats (Table 1 and 2). In contrast, grassland birds composed the largest proportion of observed breeding pairs, accounting for 38% or more of the indicated pairs recorded in each year.\nFrequencies of occurrence on sample units.-Sixty-nine species (i.e. common species) occurred in 10% or more of the sample quarter-sections in one or more years, including 48 species in Stewart and Kantrud (1972) commented that the absence of the Downy Woodpecker in 1967 was \"somewhat surprising,\" given the species' widespread distribution in North Dakota. Statewide population estimates.-The projected statewide population estimates for breeding birds in North Dakota were 25.5 million breeding pairs in 1967,24.1 million in 1992, and 27.4 million in 1993. Projected statewide population estimates are given in Appendix 2 for the 69 species that had statewide frequencies of occurrence of 10% or higher in one or more years (i.e. common species). These 69 common species composed 95% of the projected statewide breeding bird populations in 1967, 92% in 1992, and 92% in 1993 . By this criterion, more than onehalf (92 species) of the species observed in the three years were uncommon breeders. In decreasing order of abundance, the five most common species were the Horned Lark, Chestnutcollared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), Redwinged Blackbird, Western Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird. Collectively, these species accounted for 31-41% of the estimated statewide breeding populations in the three years. The Horned Lark, a species that is most characteristic of cropland and heavily grazed grassland, accounted for over 10% of the projected statewide populations in each year.\nPopulation changes. -Annual variation in breeding bird populations was considerable (Tables 2 and 3 , Appendices 1 and 2). Annual breeding bird density for all species varied from 141 indicated breeding pairs per 100 ha in 1967 to 133 in 1992 and 151 in 1993. An evaluation of population changes for each species is beyond the scope of this paper. Rather, we restrict our evaluation to two broad patterns of population change evident in our data. First, most wetland species and many grassland species occurred less frequently and were less abundant during the dry year, 1992, than during the wetter years, 1967 and 1993 . This pattern appears to be most pronounced and consistent for species associated with open water, such as waterfowl and the American Coot (Fulica americana). Second, many permanent residents and many species associated with human-made structures and woody vegetation generally increased in frequency and abundance between 1967 and 1992-93.\nOf the 161 breeding bird species observed, 46 (29%) had consistent and significant (P 5 0.10) population changes between 1967 and 1992 and between 1967 and 1993 ( 2). Of these 46 species, 11 long-distance migrants, 15 short-distance migrants, and 8 permanent residents exhibited increasing population changes, and 7 long-distance migrants, 5 short-distance migrants, and no permanent residents showed decreasing population changes. Twenty-four of the 34 (71%) species with significantly increasing population changes were associated with woody vegetation or humanmade structures. In contrast, 11 of 12 (92%) species with significantly decreasing population changes were associated with wetlands or grasslands. Grassland species, however, had equal numbers of significantly increasing (4) and decreasing (4) population changes. Breeding Bird Survey trends.-Sample sizes were sufficient to estimate statewide BBS trends from 1967 to 1993 for 151 of the 161 observed species. Of the 64 species with statistically significant trends, 14 long-distance migrants, 15 short-distance migrants, and 7 permanent residents exhibited increasing trends. In contrast, 9 longdistance migrants, 18 short-distance migrants, and 1 permanent resident showed significantly decreasing trends. Twenty-eight of the 36 (78%) species with significantly increasing trends were associated with human-made structures or woody vegetation. Most (23) of the 28 species with significantly decreasing trends were associated with wetlands or grasslands. Grassland species, however, had equal numbers of significantly increasing (5) and decreasing (5) population trends.\nLand use changes.-Cropland and grassland were the dominant land uses in the study area, covering about three-quarters of the total area on the 128 quarter-sections in all three years (Table 3 ). The area of cropland increased by 2% between 1967 and 1992-93. In contrast, grassland, wetland, and hayland declined by about 3%, 27%, and 52%, respectively, from their 1967 levels; all declines reflected nationwide trends (Samson and Knopf 1994 , Dahl 1990 , Herkert 1991 . Woodland, human-made structures, and unvegetated portions of clay buttes increased by about 19%, 13%, and 6%, respectively, between 1967 and 1992-93. Planted cover increased by 40%, which largely reflects the Conservation Reserve Program, a long-term, federal cropland retirement program that began in 1985 . Land use changes between 1992 and 1993 were relatively small. Species composition.-Compared with other ecological regions, the breeding avifauna of grasslands is relatively simple (Risser et al. 1981) . A characteristic of grassland bird communities is low species diversity and numerical domination by a few species (Cody 1985) . Although North Dakota is situated in the grassland biome of North America, the breeding avifauna of North Dakota is enriched by a diverse assemblage of birds with eastern, western, central, and northern North American affinities (Table  1; Stewart 1975) . Nonetheless, the predominance of grassland birds is evident from our data. Collectively, eight species-Horned Lark, Western Meadowlark, Red-winged Blackbird, Brown-headed Cowbird, Lark Bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Chestnut-collared Longspur-accounted for 43-53% of the breeding birds in North Dakota each year. All but two of these species (Brown-headed Cowbird and Red-winged Blackbird) are considered endemic or secondary grassland species in North America (Mengel 1970; Knopf 1988 Knopf , 1994 .\nAnother characteristic of grassland bird assemblages in North America is the prevalence of short-distance migrants (MacArthur 1959 , Willson 1976 . In this study, short-distance migrants composed more than one-half of the observed species and indicated pairs in each year. These patterns are comparable to those of other grasslands in North America but contrast greatly with northeastern deciduous forests, where long-distance migrants and permanent residents dominate the breeding avifauna (MacArthur 1959 , Willson 1976 .\nOne species, Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), was recorded only in 1967, compared with 32 species detected only in 1992 and/or 1993. Although differences in observer abilities between 1967 and 1992-93 may account for the increased number of species between the two periods ( Lee et al. 1984) , and increased habitat availability (species associated with woody vegetation, see below). Nonetheless, most of the 32 species that were not observed in 1967 are considered rare, uncommon, localized, or irregular breeders in North Dakota (Faanes and Stewart 1982, DeSante and Pyle 1986) .\nPatterns of population changes.-Current evidence indicates that populations of some endemic grassland birds and many other species have declined in grassland regions in North America in recent decades (Knopf 1988 (Knopf , 1994 Finch 1992; Droege and Sauer 1994; USFWS 1995) . Despite early indications of population declines in some breeding birds in the Midwest and Great Plains (Anonymous 1983 , Robbins et al. 1986 , Knopf 1988 , birds in the midcontinent have not received the attention accorded other bird groups, such as Neotropical migrants in eastern forests Johnston 1992, Finch and Stangel 1993) . In part, this may due to the inherent variability of bird populations in the Great Plains, making it difficult to detect longterm population changes. Species that breed in this region are believed to have evolved mechanisms in response to a naturally dynamic environment, including a high degree of behavioral plasticity in locating available habitat opportunistically (Cody 1985) . Accordingly, many grassland and wetland birds undergo considerable annual changes in distribution and abundance in the Great Plains (Henny 1973 , Trapp et al. 1981 , Johnson and Grier 1988 , Mulvihill 1989 , Goosen et al. 1993 .\nOur results (Tables 1 and 2 ; Appendices 1 and 2) are consistent with earlier reports showing that breeding bird populations in grassland ecosystems are tremendously dynamic, exhibiting considerable annual variation in abundance and frequency of occurrence (Graber and Graber 1963 , George et al. 1992 , Zimmerman 1992 The two patterns of long-term population change evident in our data were consistent with trends from the BBS. For both surveys, most species with significantly increasing population changes were associated with human-made structures or woody vegetation, and most species with significantly decreasing population changes were associated with wetlands or grasslands. This concordance illustrates that both independently derived measures of population change likely were recording the same phenomena. Moreover, of the 46 and 64 species that had significant population changes in our survey and the BBS, respectively, 26 species had significant trends in both data sets; all 26 species were considered common species in North Dakota (Appendices 1 and 2). Only one of the 26 species, Grasshopper Sparrow, had a population change that was opposite in sign. This discrep-ancy could be attributed to many factors, including differences in survey methodology or trend analysis. However, the long-term trend from the BBS may have masked the recent population increase in Grasshopper Sparrows in the Great Plains; these increases have been associated with the increased availability of perennial grassland habitat established by the Conservation Reserve Program (Reynolds et al. 1994, Johnson and .\nThe causes of the above patterns may involve conditions in the breeding, migration, or wintering seasons (Sherry and Holmes 1992) . The prevalence of parallel patterns of population change among habitat associations, but not among migratory behaviors, suggests that these population changes may be caused, at least in part, by conditions on the breeding grounds (Finch 1991) . A common feature of breeding birds observed in this study is their dependence on habitats on the breeding grounds; most of these species breed in the northern Great Plains but winter elsewhere. For example, if breedingground conditions are primary influences on bird population dynamics, then populations of long-distance migrants should show similar patterns of change as short-distance migrants. The examples of Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors) and American Coot for wetlands, Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and Savannah Sparrow for grasslands, and House Wren and Blue Jay for open woodlands are illustrative (Appendices 1 and 2). What conditions or factors might limit populations on the breeding grounds in the northern Great Plains? Habitat loss and changes in land use have been viewed as major potential causes of population change for many breeding birds in the Great Plains (Knopf 1988 (Knopf , 1994 McNicholl 1988) . Within the last century, the landscape of the Great Plains has been greatly modified by a number of human-induced changes. The once abundant grasslands and wetlands of the Great Plains have been drastically reduced, altered, and fragmented by intensive agriculture, roads, tree plantings, encroachment by woody vegetation, invasion of exotic plants, and other human activities. Knopf (1994) described several historic, contemporary, and continuing influences on breeding birds and their habitats in the Great Plains, including: (1) removal of native grazers and transformation to intensive, domestic livestock grazing; (2) cultivation of native grasslands; (3) loss of wetlands; and (4) woody development in the form of tree plantings and ecological invasions. The first three influences were implicated in the recent declines of grassland bird populations, as well as wetland associates. The fourth provided increased nesting opportunities for species associated with woody vegetation that generally were lacking or were limited in presettlement times. Likewise, Herkert (1994) , Vickery et al. (1994) , and Warner (1994) implicated fragmentation of grasslands in the recent declines of breeding birds in eastern and midwestern grasslands.\nBefore European settlement, the landscape of North Dakota included vast expanses of grassland, consisting primarily of northern mixedgrass prairie with some tallgrass prairie on the extreme eastern edge of the state (Risser et al. 1981) . Moreover, the grasslands of the prairie pothole region (i.e. Drift Plains and the Missouri Coteau; Fig. 1 ) were dotted by millions of shallow wetland basins. Since settlement, North Dakota has lost about 49% of its wetlands (Dahl 1990 ) and 75% of its native grasslands (Samson and Knopf 1994) , much of this before 1967. We compared the statewide changes in bird populations (Tables 1 and 2 , Appendices 1 and 2) with the overall changes in land use area (Table  3 ) between 1967 and 1992-93. Long-term population changes in our study and BBS were consistent with the notion that these changes were, -in part, caused by changes in land use on the breeding grounds (e.g. Knopf 1994 ). Declines in wetland species were commensurate with declines in wetland area. The increases in species associated with human-made structures and woody vegetation were consistent with the overall increases in area of those habitats. The declines in grassland birds paralleled the decrease in the combined total area of grassland and secondary grasslands (hayland and planted cover). Bernstein et al. (1990) repeated the historic survey of Kendeigh (1941) in northwestern Iowa and found similar declines in grassland birds and increases in species associated with woody vegetation.\nLand use area, however, changed very little between 1992 and 1993, but our results suggest that many grassland and wetland species, as well as several other species, shifted similarly by increases in frequency and abundance between the two recent years (Tables 1 and 2 , Appendices 1 and 2). Droege and Sauer (1989) and Peterjohn and Sauer (1993) suggested that breeding bird population declines on BBS routes in the late 1980s and increases in the early 1990s reflect extreme drought conditions a n d amelioration of drought conditions, respectively. Extended periods of below-average rainfall are k n o w n to affect populations of grassland a n d wetland birds (e.g. Johnson a n d Grier 1988). I n this study, t h e increases between 1992 a n d 1993 corresponded with the amelioration of the longterm drought conditions and are consistent with observations of behavioral flexibility a n d opportunism i n habitat selection (Cody 1985 ) a n d weather-related shifts i n distribution a n d abundance by grassland (Wiens 1974 ) a n d wetland (Johnson a n d Grier 1988) species. George et al. (1992) also noted rapid recoveries of grassland bird densities after drought. Reproductive success of grassland birds varies annually, with very poor productivity during some drought years (George et al. 1992) .\nI n conclusion, our results indicate that BBS data reflect real population changes for many common species i n North Dakota. The increase i n species associated with human-made structures a n d woody vegetation a n d decreases i n wetland a n d grassland species i n agricultural landscapes have been reported previously, both in North America (McNicholl1988, Knopf 1994 , Herkert 1995 ) a n d elsewhere (Bohning-Gause a n d Bauer 1996) . O u r data suggest that land use changes, a n d probably drought conditions, influenced some breeding bird population changes i n North Dakota between 1967 a n d 1992-93. Although these factors would not necessarily affect different species to t h e same extent, t h e fact that our surveys detected significant population changes for several common species (e.g. Northern Shoveler [Anas clypeata]) that t h e BBS d i d not detect a n d vice versa (e.g. Sora [Porzana carolina]) deserves further investigation. Furthermore, w e cannot attribute all population changes to conditions o n t h e breeding grounds. However, because many birds i n the Great Plains are short-distance migrants, many of t h e factors driving population changes o n t h e Great Plains are likely North American processes (Knopf 1994 , Herkert 1995 . Nonetheless, our data indicate that factors o n t h e breeding grounds are having a major effect o n breeding bird populations i n t h e northern Great Plains.\nWe are grateful to H. A. Kantrud, National Biological Service, for his advice and guidance throughout all phases of this study. J. R. Sauer of the National Biological Service and B. G. Peterjohn of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service supplied trends from the Breeding Bird Survey. This study would not have been possible without the cooperation of the many land owners, operators, and managers who allowed us to survey birds on their land. We thank C. J. Johnson and M. D. Schwartz for assistance in the field. R. L. Hutto, H. A. Kantrud, T. E. Martin, C. S. Robbins, P. F. Springer, and three anonymous reviewers commented on earlier drafts of this manuscript. This study was inspired by the innovative thoughts and foresight of Robert E. Stewart (1913 Stewart ( -1993 , whose scientific accomplishments were innumerable; we dedicate this paper to his memory."}]
