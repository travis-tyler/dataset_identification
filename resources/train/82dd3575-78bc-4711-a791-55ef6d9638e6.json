They are based on agricultural production and ancillary data from the US Census of agriculture, population data from the US census, and other sources. Full details on methodology and original sources can be found in the references below [1e5].\nSpecifications Table   Subject area Biogeochemistry, agriculture, ecology More specific subject area"}, {"section_title": "Phosphorus cycling, phosphorus use efficiency, net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs (NAPI)", "text": "Type of data Tables, multi-page spreadsheet How data was acquired Derived from publicly available sources, including US Census of Agriculture, US population Census, and processed using the NANI/NAPI toolbox Data format Raw Parameters for data selection\nCounty level data were typically estimated from agricultural and population census information. Data were aggregated to multi-county units to achieve better spatial uniformity, and to USDA-ERS Farm Resource Regions for regional comparison."}, {"section_title": "Parameters for data collection", "text": "Basic data are not derived from experiments, but represent county-level estimates based on government statistics typically collected at 5- Value of the data Why are these data useful? They represent county-level to regional variation of major agricultural phosphorus flows across the US over 3 decades at 5-year intervals, and are thus useful for biogeochemical, ecological or agricultural studies of local to regional variation Who can benefit from these data? The data should be useful to environmental research scientists interested in understanding agricultural impacts on the environment as well as patterns of agricultural production. Environmental managers at the federal, state and local level, as well as NGOs, may also find them useful. How can these data be used for further insights and development of experiments? These data provide information on phosphorus use efficiency, surplus/deficits, and anthropogenic P inputs useful for establishing nutrient budgets at various scales, for regional comparisons, and as baseline data against which to compare impacts of alternative management options. The data are of sufficient resolution (county and multi-county) that they may also be useful for within-region or largewatershed studies. "}]
