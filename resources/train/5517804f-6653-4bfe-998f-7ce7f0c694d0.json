[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Grey matter (GM) atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most commonly modelled as a function of time. However, this approach does not take into account interindividual differences in initial disease severity or changes due to aging. Here, we modeled GM atrophy within individuals across the AD clinical spectrum as a function of time, aging and MMSE, as a proxy for disease severity, and investigated how these models influence estimates of GM atrophy.\nWe selected 523 individuals from ADNI (100 preclinical AD, 288 prodromal AD, 135 AD dementia) with abnormal baseline amyloid PET/CSF and \u22651 year of MRI follow-up.\nWe calculated total and 90 regional GM volumes for 2281 MRI scans (median [IQR]; 4 [3][4][5] scans per individual over 2 [1.6-4] years) and used linear mixed models to investigate atrophy as a function of time, aging and decline on MMSE. Analyses included clinical stage as interaction with the predictor and were corrected for baseline age, sex, education, field strength and total intracranial volume. We repeated analyses for a sample of participants with normal amyloid (n=387) to assess whether associations were specific for amyloid pathology.\nUsing time or aging as predictors, amyloid abnormal participants annually declined -1.29\u00b10.08 points and -0.28\u00b10.03 points respectively on the MMSE and -12.23\u00b10.47 cm 3 and -8.87\u00b10.34 respectively in total GM volume (p<0.001). For the time and age models atrophy was widespread and preclinical and prodromal AD showed similar atrophy patterns.\nComparing prodromal AD to AD dementia, AD dementia showed faster atrophy mostly in temporal lobes as modeled with time, while prodromal AD showed faster atrophy in mostly frontoparietal areas as modeled with age (p FDR <0.05). Modeling change in GM volume as a function of decline on MMSE, slopes were less steep compared to those based on time and aging (-4.1\u00b10.25 cm 3 per MMSE point decline; p<0.001) and showed steeper atrophy for prodromal AD compared to preclinical AD in the right inferior temporal gyrus (p<0.05) and compared to AD dementia mostly in temporal areas (p FDR <0.05). Associations with time, aging and MMSE remained when accounting for these effects in the other models, suggesting that all measures explain part of the variance in GM atrophy. Repeating analyses in amyloid normal individuals, effects for time and aging showed similar widespread anatomical patterns, while associations with MMSE were largely reduced.\nEffects of time, aging and MMSE all explained variance in GM atrophy slopes within individuals. Associations with MMSE were weaker than those for time or age, but specific for amyloid pathology. This suggests that at least some of the atrophy observed in time or age models may not be specific to AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia (Lobo et al., 2000; Plassman et al., 2007) . The disease presumably starts with the aggregation of amyloid beta, after which it can take up to 15 years for the dementia syndrome to manifest (Bateman et al., 2012; Jansen et al., 2015) . Because amyloid becomes abnormal very early in the disease when cognition is still normal, it is difficult to estimate when the disease has started and where individuals are in their disease trajectory. As such, when modeling disease progression solely based on time from first assessment, individuals' positions in their disease trajectory are not taken into account. Models that account for disease severity might more accurately estimate disease specific outcome measures within individuals, such as grey matter (GM) atrophy rates.\nGM atrophy is thought of as a close biological substrate of decline in cognitive functioning Terry et al., 1991) . Still, most studies model changes in GM atrophy and cognitive decline separately, and not within individuals. Although changes over time in both variables are correlated with each other (Jack et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2012; Sluimer et al., 2008) , these associations do not account for inter-individual differences in disease severity. Modeling change in both GM atrophy and cognition within individuals, Jack et al. (2012) used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline as a proxy of disease severity to align individuals according to their initial disease stage and investigated the associations of rates of hippocampal volume and annualized cognitive decline in the MMSE.\nResults were in line with previous findings of increasing hippocampal atrophy with advancing disease stages, supporting tests of cognitive performance as a continuous approximation for disease severity. Other brain areas in addition to the hippocampus are, however, likely related to disease progression (ten Kate et al., 2017; Vemuri et al., 2011; Zeifman et al., 2015) .\nAnother complicating factor is that GM volume declines with age (Bakkour et al., 2013; Fjell "}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Good et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2018) . It remains unclear, however, whether atrophy in more widespread cortical areas is related to decline in MMSE within individuals, and to which extent such associations are specific for AD and influenced by effects of time and/or aging.\nIn this study we therefore analyzed longitudinal changes in GM volumes using MMSE as an anchor point for individual disease severity and investigated how these associations differed from those using follow-up time or age in individuals with abnormal amyloid across the clinical spectrum. We further studied whether such associations were specific for distinct anatomical regions and for amyloid pathology.\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T\n\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T === Please insert\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Material & Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). ADNI was approved by the institutional review board of all participating institutions and written informed consent was obtained from all participants at each site.\nDetails of clinical diagnoses have been previously described elsewhere (Petersen et al., 2010;  for a general procedures manual see https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2010/09/ADNI_GeneralProceduresManual.pdf). Briefly, classification into the clinical stages, cognitively normal (CN), and MCI was based on screening with the CDR, MMSE and delayed recall on Logical Memory II subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (adjusted for education). Additionally, MCI and dementia participants had to have a memory complaint. Dementia patients had to have a clinical diagnosis of probable AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984) .\nWe selected participants across the different clinical stages of the AD continuum (preclinical AD, prodromal AD, AD dementia) from ADNI-1/GO/-2 with abnormal amyloid biomarkers at baseline (PiB, AV45-PET or amyloid \u03b2 1-42 CSF) and \u22650.9 years of repeated MRI available. A total of 523 patients met inclusion criteria and had MRI scans of sufficient quality available."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "We used repeated MMSE as a measure for general cognitive functioning to align individuals according to their disease severity. Over a median follow-up time of 2 years (interquartile range (IQR): 1.6-4), a total of 2281 MMSE assessments were available with a median number of neuropsychological follow-up of 4 (IQR: 3-5).\nAdditionally, we repeated analyses in a sample of individuals that fulfilled the same inclusion criteria but with normal amyloid markers at baseline (n=387). For these individuals, a total of 1710 MMSE assessments were available (median (IQR) follow-up time: 2.6 (2-4); median (IQR) number of assessments: 4 (3.8-5)).\nRandom Fields (MRF) parameter set to 2 and default settings for all other parameters. Next, the automated anatomical labeling atlas (AAL; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) was warped from standard space to subject space using the subject specific inversed normalization parameters. For each of the 90 cortical and subcortical AAL areas we calculated regional GM volumes. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was computed as the sum of GM, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes in cm 3 . All GM segmentations and subject-specific atlases were visually inspected for quality.\nWe tested three models taking time, age or MMSE as predictor for change in GM volume (outcome) with linear mixed effects using the R package 'lme4' (Bates et al., 2015) (see also Model 2 included age (longitudinal, i.e., baseline age + follow-up time in years) as the predictor and subject-specific random intercepts and random slopes for age:\nModel 3 included MMSE as the predictor and subject-specific random intercepts and random slopes for MMSE:\nAnalyses were adjusted for the potential influence of age at baseline C 1 (model 1 and model 3), gender C 2 , education C 3 , field strength C 4 and baseline total intracranial volume C 5 .\nBecause it is conceivable that baseline clinical stage (i.e., CN, MCI, AD dementia) may influence the results and in order to assess potential non-linear effects for MMSE, we repeated the models with an additional interaction term for time \u00d7 diagnosis, age \u00d7 diagnosis and MMSE \u00d7 diagnosis, respectively. We only considered paired MRI and MMSE data for these analyses (n=2281 observations for individuals with abnormal amyloid, n=1710\nobservations for individuals with normal amyloid). For all models we used an unstructured covariance matrix. Clinical stage differences in estimated marginal means and trends are\nreported with the emmeans package (Lenth, 2018) . Raw scores of MMSE and GM volumes were used to aid interpretation. Models were repeated for all 90 AAL regions. In order to standardize effects across the different regions, local volumes were normalized to the mean values of cognitively normal individuals with normal amyloid at baseline. Type III analysis of variance with Satterthwaite's method were used to estimate main effects. For each model, local analyses were corrected for multiple testing with the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) . To investigate whether longitudinal changes in MMSE or grey matter volumes were different depending on amyloid abnormality we refit all models for the total sample including baseline amyloid status as a main term and interaction effect with the respective predictor. Analyses were then repeated for individuals with normal amyloid markers to investigate whether observed effects were specific for the presence of amyloid pathology. We also investigated whether differences in field strength impacted our results and repeated all main models stratified by field strength. Finally, we performed model fit comparisons for non-nested linear mixed models based on differences in AIC and the likelihood ratio test (Vuong, 1989) with the package 'nonnest2'. R 2 for fixed and random effects were estimated with the 'MuMIn' package (Johnson, 2014; Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2013) . Statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.4.4, 2018-03-15) and Surf Ice (version 2017-08-08) was used to visualize regional results.\nlevel, we found a widespread atrophy pattern with the strongest associations for decline over time for the bilateral hippocampi, insulae and Rolandic opercula (all p FDR <0.001; Figure 3a ).\nAD dementia participants showed faster atrophy over time mostly in temporal regions as compared to prodromal AD participants, while the atrophy pattern was similar between prodromal and preclinical AD individuals with faster atrophy for prodromal AD (all p FDR <0.05). \nmodeling atrophy as a function of time or aging, respectively. Possibly, when individuals are not aligned according to their initial disease severity, the steeper slopes may reflect differences between individuals who were in early and those who were in more advanced stages of the disease at their first visit. Our results suggest that modelling GM atrophy as a function of MMSE shows involvement of anatomical areas that seem to be specifically related to cognitive decline in AD. Still, the slopes for the MMSE model were less steep as compared to the other models, and so we cannot exclude the possibility that GM atrophy in other anatomical areas as observed in the time and age models may have yet to affect the MMSE, or that those areas may be related to decline in more specific neuropsychological domains.\neffect of aging within individuals. Regional atrophy as modeled over time and aging were also widespread in both samples with steeper slopes for individuals with abnormal amyloid and most pronounced in the medial temporal lobes, especially in the hippocampus. These results provide further support for the notion that amyloid aggregation is not part of normal aging and suggest that atrophy of the hippocampus is not specific for AD per se (Fjell et al., 2014; ten Kate et al., 2017) , but rather the rate of hippocampal atrophy.\nFinally, model fit comparisons showed that the time model showed the best model fit. Strengths of our study are the large number of individuals, which we were able to include from ADNI, and patients with different levels of cognitive impairment with and without biomarker evidence of AD over a long follow-up period of up to 10 years. A potential limitation of our approach is the use of MMSE as a measure for general cognitive functioning in this study. The MMSE is a cognitive screening tool that might not adequately capture subtle cognitive impairment and cognitive decline (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992) , and this may have contributed to the less steep atrophy slopes we observed. Although the MMSE is widely used and readily available for most studies, future research should further investigate how atrophy correlates with other measures that are more sensitive to subtle cognitive decline\nand to specific cognitive domains, which might relate to distinct, regional atrophy patterns.\nFurthermore, our sample of individuals with normal amyloid included only few dementia cases, which might have contributed to the weaker associations of MMSE and GM atrophy.\nFuture research should further investigate the association of GM atrophy with time, age and cognitive decline in larger samples of individuals with non-AD dementia. Another possible limitation of our study might be in amyloid status classification. Here, we used PET when available, and otherwise CSF results were used to classify participants. Although these measures correlate (Zwan et al., 2014) , they may reflect different aspects of amyloid pathology (Landau et al., 2013; Mattsson et al., 2014; Palmqvist et al., 2016) , since PET tracers directly bind to amyloid fibrils, while in CSF amyloid accumulation is measured indirectly by decreasing levels of soluble A\u03b21-42. By using PET as first criterion for amyloid abnormality we classified some participants as amyloid normal although they had abnormal levels of CSF A\u03b21-42 (n=76, 8.4%) and vice versa (n=38, 4.2%). Given that this discordance occurred in less than 10% of individuals, however, it is unlikely to have influenced the results.\nFinally, scans included in the present study were obtained with different field strengths.\nAlthough we ensured that, within subjects, the same field strength was used, and we adjusted for this variable in all the models, these field strengths may still have influenced our estimates on grey matter atrophy. Additional post-hoc analyses stratifying analyses for field strength showed that for abnormal amyloid individuals, estimates of grey matter and hippocampal volumes for 1.5 Tesla scans were slightly higher, those for 3 Tesla scans slightly lower as compared to the original estimates, which were based on all individuals with abnormal amyloid (see Inline Supplementary Table 11 ). Importantly, individuals with 1.5 Tesla scans (who were most often included at the start of the study) also showed steeper decline on the MMSE, while individuals with 3 Tesla scans showed less steep decline on the MMSE over time. For individuals with normal amyloid, stratifying by field strength resulted in similar\nestimates for all outcome measures in all models. These results suggest that differences in subsample characteristics might have driven these differences, but not necessarily field strength per se.\n\n\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 0.31% (-0.49%, 1.1%) Data are presented as \u03b2\u00b1SE [t ratio] and in percentages (95% CI) for annual atrophy rates.
