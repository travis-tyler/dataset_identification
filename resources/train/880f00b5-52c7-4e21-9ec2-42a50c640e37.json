The report is divided into four main sections. The first section provides an overview of the U.S. higher education system, with special emphasis on several types of institutions, and on distance and online education. This section also provides information on sources of aid for undergraduate and graduate S&E education, with a focus on the federal government's role. The second section looks at trends over time in S&E degree awards at the undergraduate and graduate levels, highlighting patterns by field. The third section focuses on the demographic attributes of S&E degree recipients, including sex and race and ethnicity. It examines trends by degree level and field. The final section focuses on international S&E higher education. This section provides data on students on temporary visas who study or earn degrees in the United States.

The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is widely used to characterize differences in academic institutions. 3 The 115 Carnegie-classified \"highest research activity\" doctoral universities, for example, play a key role in producing S&E doctoral degrees in the United States (Table S2-1). 4\n\nFunding mechanisms also vary by demographic groups (Table S2-3) for U.S. citizens and permanent residents who earned S&E doctorates between 2015 and 2017. Overall, men (31%) earning S&E doctorates were more likely to be supported by RAs than women (22%), whereas women (18%) were more likely to self-support than men (10%). Women (16%) and men (17%) were around equally likely to be supported by TAs. Asians (32%) and whites (29%) were most likely to have primary RA support. To some extent, demographic differences in support mechanisms relate to field-of-study differences. However, certain patterns hold across fields. For example, black doctorate recipients were more likely to use personal sources of funding in every S&E field for which data were available. Data on primary source of support for S&E doctorate recipients by race, ethnicity, sex, and field are available (NCSES WMPD 2019: Table 7-26). These differences may also reflect variation among groups in the types of institutions attended.\nIn their support patterns across fields, agencies take on portfolios consistent with their missions ( Figure 2-4, NCSES GSS 2017: Table 3-3). NSF supports substantial numbers of students across a range of fields, whereas about 70% of those supported by NIH are in biological and biomedical sciences and health fields. More than half of the students funded by DOD study engineering, and nearly 90% funded by DOE are in physical sciences and engineering. \nRAs are the primary mechanism the federal government uses to fund graduate students. Among full-time S&E graduate students primarily funded by the federal government in 2016, 71% received RAs, followed by fellowships (13%) and traineeships (9%). Reflective of overall enrollment patterns, about 70% of graduate students supported by the federal government in 2016 were enrolled in public institutions. 33 Seventy-eight percent were enrolled in Carnegie-classified \"highest research activity\" doctoral universities, and another 13% were enrolled in \"higher research activity\" doctoral universities. Only 2% of federally supported graduate students were enrolled in \"moderate research activity\" doctoral universities, along with about 4% at medical schools and 2% at master's colleges and universities. 34 \nIn 2017, community colleges awarded 133,000 associate's degrees in S&E technologies-more degrees than in S&E fields themselves, which is a long-standing trend. S&E technologies have a more applied focus and include engineering, health sciences, and other S&E technologies. 36 These degrees prepare students for skilled technical jobs (jobs requiring S&E technical expertise but not necessarily a 4-year degree; for more, see the forthcoming Science and Engineering Indicators 2020 report \"Science and Engineering Labor Force\"). The number of associate's degrees awarded in S&E technologies peaked at 166,000 in 2012; since then, it has declined for engineering technologies (from 41,000 to 32,000) and health technologies (from 122,000 to 96,000). The decline in associate's degrees in S&E technologies is greater than the increase seen in S&E associate's degrees, meaning that the trends reflect more than students switching from one set of fields to the other.\nLarge public universities have long dominated degree conferral in S&E and in all fields. Additionally, in 2017, the \"highest research activity\" doctoral universities, as classified by Carnegie, awarded a disproportionately high percentage of S&E bachelor's degrees (40%) relative to total bachelor's degrees (28%); this is also a long-standing pattern.\nSince 2000, public universities experienced large increases in doctoral degree awards and in 2017 awarded most doctoral degrees in S&E fields (67%) and in all fields (61%). 42 The 115 \"highest research activity\" doctoral universities award most doctoral degrees across virtually all fields of study (Table S2-1). In 2017, these institutions awarded nearly 45,000 total doctorates (63% of all doctorates) and nearly 33,000 S&E doctorates (72% of all S&E doctorates). Although still small, the number of S&E doctorates awarded by for-profit institutions (across all classification types) increased fivefold between 2000 and 2017, from about 400 to nearly 2,000 (4% of S&E doctorates).\nHistorically high-participation S&E fields for women include psychology, biological sciences, and social sciences. In 2017, women earned about half or more degrees awarded at all degree levels in these fields. Historically low S&E participation fields include engineering; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; computer sciences; mathematics and statistics; and physical sciences. Women's participation in these fields varies. The physical (low participation) and social (high participation) sciences include fields where women's participation rates differ from the overall trends. In chemistry, for example, women approached near parity with men at the bachelor's and master's levels, but not at the doctoral level. In economics, women earned around one-third of bachelor's and doctoral degrees. Since 2000, women's overall share of S&E bachelor's degrees has remained at about half, although the trend over time varies across fields. In computer sciences and mathematics and statistics, the number of women earning bachelor's degrees increased during this interval; the number of men, however, grew at a faster rate than the number of women, resulting in an overall decline in women's share from 28% to 19% in computer sciences and from 48% to 42% in mathematics and statistics (Table S2-6). Unlike S&E bachelor's-level degrees, the share of doctoral degrees received by women increased across virtually all S&E fields since 2000 (Table S2-10). Overall, S&E doctorates earned by women increased from 11,000 (39%) in 2000 to 21,000 (45%) in 2017. Women earned more than half of doctorates in most social sciences fields and in biological and medical sciences in 2017. Women earned about one-quarter of doctoral degrees in engineering in 2017, up from 16% in 2000; however, there was variability across engineering fields. Women earned relatively low shares of doctoral degrees in computer sciences (23%) and mathematics and statistics (27%). 46 \nNote(s) Hispanic may be any race; race categories exclude Hispanic origin. Percentages may not add to total because data do not include people who did not report their race and ethnicity and those who reported more than one race.\nSocial sciences and psychology were the most common S&E bachelor's degree fields among many racial and ethnic groups. Engineering degrees were more common among Asians and whites than among other groups. Asians were also more likely to earn biological sciences bachelor's degrees compared with other groups (Table S2-7). Many of these trends over time are similar for doctoral degree awards. Overall, underrepresented minorities-blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians or Alaska Natives-earned more S&E doctorates in 2017 compared with 2000 ( Figure  2-12 and Figure 2- 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 \n\nRacial and ethnic groups also vary in their fields of doctoral degree (Table S2 -11). In 2017, the top field for black recipients was medical and other health sciences (32% of S&E doctorates awarded to blacks), followed by psychology (18%), biological sciences (13%), and political science and public administration (9%). Psychology is the top field for Hispanics (24%), followed by biological sciences (20%), engineering (14%), and medical and other health sciences (14%). For Asians, the top fields are engineering and biological sciences (24% each), followed by medical and other health sciences (15%) and psychology (8%). 48 Blacks were more likely to earn S&E doctorates at for-profit institutions (in 2017, 25% did so, compared with 7% of Hispanics, 4% of whites, and 3% of Asians). While the number of S&E doctorates earned by blacks from \"highest research activity\" doctoral universities rose from about 500 in 2000 to more than 850 in 2017, the percentage of blacks who earned doctorates from these institutions declined from 61% to 40% during this time.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the number of international students declined by about 4,000 (less than 1%). 52 This represents a second year of decline but is smaller than the decline of about 31,500 students (nearly 4%) between 2016 and 2017. Underlying this overall decline is a mixed picture that varies by student level, field of study, and country of origin. In 2018, just over half of all international students were enrolled at the undergraduate level (mostly in bachelor's degree programs). Between 2017 and 2018, the number of international undergraduate students declined (by about 5,500 or just over 1%); however, the number studying S&E fields increased (by about 2,500 or just over 1%), after holding essentially flat between 2016 and 2017 (Table 2-3, Figure 2-15). The rise in S&E enrollment was driven by rising enrollment in science; by contrast, enrollment declined in engineering for the second year in a row (Table S2-13). Among the top five countries sending undergraduates to study engineering, only Vietnam saw consistent increases in the numbers over the last 2 years (Table S2- Note(s) Data include active foreign national students on F-1 visas and exclude those on optional practical training. Undergraduate level includes associate's and bachelor's degrees. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. The data reflect fall enrollment in a given year and include students with \"active\" status as of 15 November of that year. \nUnlike undergraduate enrollment, international graduate student enrollment rose slightly from 2017 to 2018 (from 368,000 to 369,000) after a considerable decline (6%) between 2016 and 2017. 54 The number studying S&E fields also increased (by 2%) ( Table 2-3). Although these increases do not erase the declines of the previous year, they call into question whether those declines represent a trend. As is the case for undergraduates, the rise in S&E graduate enrollment was driven by those studying science fields, whose numbers increased back to 2016 levels. The number of those studying engineering, however, declined for the second year in a row. Since 2016, countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia have seen declines in the numbers of graduate students, especially in engineering. But China and India, and the contrast between them, dominate the story because of the large numbers of students from those countries who study in the United States (Figure 2-16 Note(s) Data include active foreign national students on F-1 visas and exclude those on optional practical training. Graduate level includes master's and doctoral degrees. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. The data reflect fall enrollment in a given year and include students with \"active\" status as of 15 November of that year. \nThe number of Chinese S&E graduate students at U.S. institutions has increased by more than 8,000 (11%) since 2016, with the largest gains in computer sciences and mathematics and statistics. India's numbers, during the same interval, declined sharply, by nearly 21,000 (22%). In 2016, India sent the most students to study engineering, surpassing China by nearly 9,000. China has now surpassed India as the largest sender of graduate students in engineering, largely due to a major reduction in the number of Indian engineering graduate students (a 28% decline) during this interval. International Students in U.S. Higher Education: Degrees Earned\nAlthough students from South Korea earned only one-third of the number of doctorates earned by students from China between 2000 and 2017, they earned more non-S&E doctorates (about 5,500 for South Korea and 5,200 for China). Canada and Mexico are in the top 10 countries where students earn doctorates in the United States. For Canadian students earning doctorates in the United States, the most popular S&E fields are biological and social sciences; for Mexican students, the most popular fields are engineering and social sciences. \nIn the United States, there is large variation in the proportion of 25-to 34-year-olds with a postsecondary degree (in international comparisons, this is often referred to as tertiary attainment). 60 There are differences between demographic groups (Snyder et al. Digest of Education Statistics 2017: Table 104.20 and Table 104.60). There is also geographic variation in the United States, with tertiary attainment levels ranging from a high of 73% in the District of Columbia to a low of 30% in Nevada (OECD 2018b). Parents' levels of educational attainment also matter: 70% of 25-to 64-year-olds with at least one tertiary-educated parent have themselves attained tertiary education. Percentages are substantially lower for those with less-educated parents.\nS&E first university degrees as a proportion of all first university degrees vary across countries (Figure 2-20). For the United States, the figure is about 40%, lower than that of China, South Korea, and several European nations. Of the countries and economies displayed in Figure 2- \n\nIn the United States, and in France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the largest numbers of S&E doctoral degrees were awarded in natural sciences (Figure 2-22, Table S2-16). In other countries and economies, the proportion of S&E doctoral degrees in engineering is greater; for China, South Korea, and Taiwan, for example, more than 50% of S&E doctorates are awarded in engineering. \n\nThe U.S. share of worldwide internationally mobile students has declined slightly over time, reflecting several factors. The number of internationally mobile students in higher education worldwide has risen dramatically, from 2 million in 1999 to 5 million in 2016 (OECD 2018a). China and India send the most students abroad: their combined share of outbound internationally mobile students rose from 19% in 2008 to 23% in 2017. Another factor is increasing competition among countries for international students: some have set targets for attracting certain numbers. Countries like Australia and Canada have recently reported double-digit growth in international students. 72"}, {"section_title": "Minority-Serving Institutions", "text": "There are more than 700 federally designated minority-serving institutions (MSIs) of seven types (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM] 2019). 5 MSIs may be defined by legislation (\"historically defined\") or by the percentage of minority student enrollment and other characteristics of the student body (\"enrollment defined\") (Li 2007;NASEM 2019). Historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges or universities are historically defined. 6 High-Hispanic-enrollment institutions (HHEs), in contrast, are one example of enrollment-defined MSIs. 7 Some institutions may qualify as more than one type of MSI, and there is substantial diversity in institutional characteristics between different MSIs (NASEM 2019). The number of institutions in historically defined MSI categories are more or less fixed, whereas the numbers of institutions included in enrollment-defined MSI categories may change. This has implications for interpreting trends over time. MSIs enroll a substantial fraction of underrepresented minority undergraduates. The number of blacks earning S&E bachelor's degrees from HBCUs has remained roughly constant, likely reflecting the capacity of these institutions. Overall, across all institutions, numbers of S&E bachelor's degrees earned by blacks are increasing (NCSES WMPD 2019: Table  5-8). In 2016, S&E fields accounted for roughly 30% of the bachelor's degrees blacks earned at HBCUs; the percentage of S&E bachelor's degrees blacks earned across all institutions was about the same. Numbers of Hispanics earning S&E bachelor's degrees from HHEs have increased, whereas the percentage has remained roughly the same (NCSES WMPD 2019: Table 5-9). 8 This reflects increasing numbers of Hispanics earning S&E bachelor's degrees at HHEs and at other types of institutions. In 2016, S&E fields accounted for roughly one-third of the bachelor's degrees that Hispanics earned at HHEs; the percentage of S&E bachelor's degrees Hispanics earned across all institutions was about the same. MSIs also play an important role in training underrepresented minority students for doctoral-level study in S&E fields. A considerable share of black and Hispanic S&E doctoral recipients received their bachelor's degree from an MSI. Around 25% of black S&E doctoral recipients between 2013 and 2017 earned a bachelor's degree from an HBCU (NCSES 2019b). Likewise, around 37% of Hispanic S&E doctoral recipients between 2013 and 2017 earned a bachelor's degree from an HHE (NCSES 2019b). The percentages of black and Hispanic S&E doctoral recipients whose baccalaureate origins were HBCUs and HHEs, respectively, have been relatively stable for several decades. 9 More data on the importance of these institutions as baccalaureate origin institutions is available in Burrelli and Rapoport (2008) and Fiegener and Proudfoot (2013), as well as in Henderson (2017, 2019), who emphasize the role that predominantly white institutions must also play in preparing underrepresented minority students for S&E doctoral training."}, {"section_title": "Community Colleges", "text": "Community colleges (also known as public 2-year colleges or associate's colleges) play a key role in providing broad access to higher education. Community colleges prepare students to enter the workforce with certificates or associate's degrees, or to transition to 4-year institutions (frequently without earning associate's degrees). 10 Of students who earned bachelor's degrees in any field between 2010 and 2017, more than half (53%) had done some coursework at a community college and about one-fourth (26%) earned associate's degrees. The figures were 47% and 18%, respectively, among S&E degree recipients. 11 Community colleges also provide a pathway that ultimately leads some students to earn doctoral degrees. About 20% of students receiving S&E doctoral degrees in 2017 reported having attended a community or 2-year college (NCSES SED 2017 : Table 30), and about 6% had previously earned an associate's degree (Table S2-2). 12 Community college attendance, however, varies across degree fields and between demographic groups. The percentage of 2017 doctorate recipients with associate's degrees ranged from less than 4% among engineering doctorates to nearly 11% among medical and other health sciences doctorates; percentages having attended community college were higher (NCSES SED 2017: Table 30). Black S&E doctoral degree recipients were most likely to have earned an associate's degree (11%) and Asians least likely (less than 3%).

Distance education has been around for more than 100 years, whereas online education is a relatively new phenomenon, mirroring the growth of technologies such as the personal computer and the Internet (Miller et al. 2017;Perna et al. 2014). 15 Distance education offerings can be delivered through a range of technologies and in a variety of modes: completely distance education, traditional or in-person instruction, and a combination often referred to as hybrid or blended instruction (RTI International 2017). Distance education may occur synchronously (live) or asynchronously (prerecorded) in time, and online courses may be offered to students living on campus, without any physical distance from the instructor (RTI International 2017). Distance and online education enable higher education institutions to reach more students by providing greater flexibility and expanding access in remote locations. About 18% of the U.S. adult population live in \"higher education deserts,\" whereas only about 2% live in \"online deserts,\" according to a study by Rosenboom and Blagg (2018). The study defines a higher education desert as \"either having no colleges and universities within 25 miles or having access to a single community college as the only broad-access public institution within 25 miles.\" Online deserts are \"areas where Internet speeds are below 25 megabits per second for downloads and 2 megabits per second for uploads.\" Nationally representative data on distance education are available through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). These data include instances where instructional content is delivered exclusively through distance education (i.e., hybrid or blended courses are not included; see RTI International 2017). 16 The number of distance education programs offered by degree-granting higher education institutions, as defined by IPEDS, stayed roughly the same between 2016 and 2017 (at about 21,000), after a period of rapid growth (from about 11,000 in 2012). This overall trend includes a decline in programs offered at the associate's and bachelor's levels and a continued increase in those at the master's and doctoral levels. In contrast, enrollment of undergraduate and graduate students in distance education increased each year from 2012 to 2016, except for enrollment at for-profit institutions, which declined. Public, private nonprofit, and for-profit institutions all offer distance education programs; however, public universities account for most students taking these courses (Seaman, Allen, and Seaman 2018). 17 Most distance education students also take courses on campus; of those who take only distance education courses, 56% do so through institutions in their home state. In S&E fields, distance education programs are most likely to be offered in computer sciences, social sciences, and psychology at the associate's and bachelor's levels; in computer sciences and engineering at the master's level; and in medical and health sciences and engineering at the doctoral level. 18 Although no nationally representative data exist specifically for online education, a recent analysis of data from massive open online courses (MOOCs) taught on edX by its founding partner institutions found that these courses primarily draw students from affluent countries and continue to face low completion and retention rates (Reich and Ruip\u00e9rez-Valiente 2019). According to the study, MOOCs have been most successful in helping universities outsource online master's degrees for professionals. The study, however, noted that this finding might not be broadly generalizable and that information from other edX partners or MOOC providers might \"reveal different dynamics.\" Related to this, although the literature around online education is robust, it remains unclear how generalizable results from any one program or class are to others, given the complexity of the landscape (Miller et al. 2017). Studies have explored issues such as whether online options substitute for existing university options or expand enrollment (e.g., Goodman, Melkers, and Pallais 2018), how learning outcomes compare with those from traditional courses (e.g., Joyner 2018), and whether course completions lead to beneficial outcomes like higher earnings or job mobility (e.g., Hadavand, Gooding, and Leek 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Cost and Financing of S&E Higher Education for Undergraduate and Graduate Students", "text": "This section provides information on undergraduate and graduate students' cost and debt.

Among graduate students, master's students are largely self-supporting, whereas doctoral students rely on multiple funding sources and mechanisms to support their education.

College pricing is complex and often poorly understood. Institutions operate at different prices. For example, during the 2018-19 academic year, average tuition and fees were $3,660 at public 2-year institutions, $10,500 at public 4-year institutions, and $36,980 at private nonprofit 4-year institutions. 20 Published tuition and fees have greatly increased over the last 30 years (College Board Trends in College Pricing 2018: Figure 3). Net price, defined by the College Board as \"what the student and/or family must cover after grant aid and savings from tax credits and deductions are subtracted,\" is more relevant for students than published price. Across institutional types, net prices rose much more slowly than published prices (College Board Trends in College Pricing 2018: Table 7). For 2018-19, average net tuition and fees were $3,740 at public 4-year institutions and $14,610 at private nonprofit 4-year institutions. At public 2-year institutions, students on average received enough funding through grant aid and federal education tax credits and deductions to more than cover tuition and fees. Net price, however, varies based on family income (College Board Trends in College Pricing 2018: Figure 2017_11). In addition, the cost of attending public 4-year universities varies by state of residence and whether students attend an institution in their own state or in another state. 21 The affordability of college also depends on time to degree and the amount of money spent on other living expenses, like room and board."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Debt", "text": "Level of undergraduate debt varies by type of institution, but the frequency and amount of borrowing among those who graduate have increased little over the past 5 years.

Other main sources of support for graduate students include academic institutions (where a student is enrolled) and the federal government. Academic institutions were the primary source of support for 24% of master's students and 57% of doctoral students. Federal support is discussed in the section \"Federal Support for S&E Graduate Students.\" Financial support may be delivered through various mechanisms, including research assistantships (RAs), teaching assistantships (TAs), and fellowships. 27 TAs and fellowships are mainly institutionally funded, whereas nearly half of RAs are funded through federal academic research grants. 28 Most doctoral students are supported by multiple sources or mechanisms during graduate school, even in a single academic year. Patterns of support vary by field (Figure 2-2; GSS 2017: Table 3-1) and the type of institution attended ( Table 2-2). For example, in 2017, doctorate recipients from the \"highest research activity\" doctoral universities (based on Carnegie classification) were less likely to self-support (7%) than those who attended other types of institutions. Even among this group of institutions, however, public and private universities used funding mechanisms at different rates ( Full-time S&E doctoral students, by field and mechanism of primary support: 2017 Note(s) Self-support includes any loans (including federal) and support from personal or family financial contributions."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate Recipient Debt", "text": "Debt levels are an indicator of external financial support for doctoral training.

A greater percentage of doctorate recipients in non-S&E fields (50%) than in S&E fields (29%) reported graduate debt (NCSES SED 2017: Table 38). Levels of debt also vary among S&E fields. For instance, doctorate recipients in psychology and social sciences are more likely to hold graduate debt (49% hold debt, with an average of nearly $25,000) than those in physical and earth sciences (19% hold debt, with an average of about $5,000) (NCSES SED 2017: Table 38). Debt levels also vary across demographic groups. Women are more likely than men to accumulate higher graduate debt (NCSES SED 2017: Table 40). Across fields, black doctorate recipients are most likely to hold more than $30,000 in graduate school debt, and Asians are least likely (NCSES SED 2017: Table 41). Other factors influencing debt include the type of institution attended, time to degree, marital and dependent status, and highest level of parental education (Schacht, Hoffler, and Fiegener 2018 in preparation). Many factors leading to greater indebtedness are related. For instance, black doctorate recipients are more likely to possess other characteristics related to higher indebtedness: for example, many are female, attend for-profit institutions, and earn degrees in non-S&E fields or S&E fields like psychology and social sciences, which have lower levels of external financial support (see the later section \"Demographic Attributes of S&E Degree Recipients\" and Scott-Clayton and Li 2016). 30"}, {"section_title": "National Investment in S&E Higher Education", "text": "This section discusses sources of financial aid for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as federal support for S&E graduate students.

One other notable trend is an increase in the number of doctorate recipients from Iran, rising steadily from about 140 in 2008 to 770 in 2017 (see NCSES SED 2017: Table 26 and, for older trend data, NCSES SED 2010: Table 26)."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Position in Global S&E Higher Education", "text": "Educational Attainment"}, {"section_title": "Overall Attainment Levels", "text": "Educational attainment, measured as the proportion of a population that has reached a specific level of education, is often used as a proxy for human capital and the skill levels associated with that level (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2018a).

Across degree levels, S&E fields continue to grow. However, many groups of Americans are still underrepresented among S&E degree recipients. The United States remains a top destination for foreign students, especially in S&E fields; more foreign students continue to earn U.S. S&E degrees. The data, however, indicate a recent decline in international student enrollment at U.S. academic institutions. Maintaining the preeminence of U.S. S&E higher education, while serving Americans of all backgrounds, represents a continuing aspiration. 16 No standard guideline exists that specifies how much education must be delivered via technology to qualify as online or distance education (Miller et al. 2017). IPEDS defines distance education as \"education that uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously.\" Distance education courses are courses \"in which the instructional content is delivered exclusively via distance education.\" Distance education programs are those \"for which all the required coursework for program completion is able to be completed via distance education courses.\" For more detail, see https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx. 17 This analysis is based on 2016 IPEDS data."}]
