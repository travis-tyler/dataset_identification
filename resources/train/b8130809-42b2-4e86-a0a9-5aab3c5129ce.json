A global cognitive composite score was derived (mean Z-score) from performance on 9 neuropsychologic subtests. Height and weight were assessed at baseline and used to calculate BMI. Generalized estimating equations (linear and logistic) assessed the relationships of baseline BMI with cognitive outcomes, clinician judgment of ''clinically significant decline'' over 1-year, and diagnostic progression from MCI to Alzheimer disease.\nResults: Lower baseline BMI was associated with significant declines in cognitive performance in individuals with MCI over 1 year (Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, and a global cognitive composite; all P<0.05). We observed a significant protective effect of baseline BMI in reducing the risk of a clinically significant decline in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and mini-mental state examination (P<0.05). No association was found between BMI and changes in the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes or conversion to Alzheimer disease.\nConclusions: Lower baseline BMI is associated with more rapid cognitive decline in MCI.

Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that the relationship between BMI and cognitive outcomes is attenuated, and perhaps reversed, by age. 5 In longitudinal studies of older adult populations (generally aged 65 y and above), low BMI is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, 6 whereas high BMI is associated with a lower risk of dementia. 5, 7 In addition, weight loss is associated with an increased risk of dementia 5 suggesting it may be a risk factor or an early sign of AD. This is consistent with multiple studies demonstrating that weight loss is present several years before the onset of clinically recognizable AD symptoms. [8] [9] [10] [11] Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized as a transition phase between normal aging and AD with 10% to 15% of MCI patients progressing to overt AD annually. There is little prospective data on body composition in MCI. Thus, we examined the relationship between BMI and cognitive decline in individuals with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

We used height and weight measures to calculate BMI (kg body weight/m 2 height).

Cognitively normal participants had MMSE scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), a CDR of 0, were nondepressed, non-MCI, and nondemented. Participants diagnosed with MCI had MMSE scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), a memory complaint and objective memory loss measured by education-adjusted scores on WMS-Revised Logical Memory II, a CDR of 0.5, largely preserved activities of daily living, and an absence of dementia. Participants diagnosed with AD had MMSE scores between 20 and 26 (inclusive), CDR of 0.5 or 1.0, and met National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD.

The MMSE is a brief cognitive impairment-screening instrument. ADAS-Cog is a slightly longer cognitive impairment instrument used frequently in clinical trials. The CDR assesses cognitive function along 5 levels of impairment (rated as 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3) in each of 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. CDR sum of boxes is the sum of the ratings in each of the 6 domains.\nIn follow up assessments, 3 of these quantitative measures (ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and the CDR sum of boxes scores) were rated by the clinician as representing either a ''clinically significant or nonsignificant'' decrement in performance (relative to the participant's previous assessment; yes or no). Given the entire clinical-cognitive profile of each participant, the evaluating clinician also rendered a diagnostic appreciation whether that individual had progressed from MCI to dementia (yes or no).

Lower BMI was also associated with increased risk of clinically significant decline on the MMSE and ADAS-cog suggesting that these associations are clinically recognizable and important. The data indicate that BMI remained stable through this short follow-up whereas cognition declined, suggesting that low BMI predisposes an individual to more rapid disease progression. Alternatively, factors associated with MCI and cognitive decline may influence body composition. Longer follow-up with time-lagged or change-score designs in the ADNI sample is warranted to investigate the causal relationship between weight loss and cognition.\nBMI is a commonly used measure of adiposity that is associated with adverse health outcomes including mortality, [18] [19] [20] cardiovascular disease, [21] [22] [23] diabetes, 24 and hypertension. 25, 26 Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that lower BMI at baseline and loss of BMI over time is associated with an increased risk of developing AD. 10, 11, 27, 28 Individuals who develop dementia have weight loss in the 4 to 10 years leading up to diagnosis with accentuation of this weight loss at the time of diagnosis, depending on diagnostic criteria. 10, 11 Although clinical studies suggest that weight loss may be present in the clinical and preclinical stages of AD, autopsy data suggests that the loss of BMI in older adults may be in part related to the accumulation of AD pathology. 29 In a clinical-pathologic study of 298 individuals, BMI in the years before death was associated with AD pathologic burden, even in nondemented individuals. 29 As many, if not most, individuals with MCI are in the earliest clinical stages of AD, 30, 31 our data is consistent with prior studies suggesting that decreased BMI may be an early systemic manifestation of the AD process. 10, 27, 28 In this study, however, BMI did not predict progression to a diagnosis of AD, although the power to assess this relationship is limited by the small number of individuals progressing to AD (n = 54) over the short time frame (1 y). This issue is likely compounded by the subjectivity of the diagnostic appreciation across centers and individual clinicians.\nAlthough MCI is a heterogeneous condition and can be related to static or reversible causes (ie, depression, medications, and medical illness), the MCI criteria identify a population enriched with individuals in the earliest clinical stages of AD. Although our analyses did not demonstrate increased rates of progression to overt clinical AD, the relationship between BMI and cognitive decline is consistent with prior studies suggesting that AD neuropathology, which likely begins accumulating years before the clinical onset, may be in part responsible for lower BMI. 27 Greater atrophy in the medial temporal lobe in AD is associated with lower BMI suggesting that brain change and body weight occur in tandem. 32 Psychosocial hypotheses for weight loss such as behavioral changes influencing caloric intake (forgetting to eat or the inability to plan and prepare adequate meals) are possible, although the studies suggest against this possibility 10, 33 and MCI participants have limited functional changes.\nThis study is limited by a short follow up period of 1 year attenuating our power to assess the impact of BMI on cognitive decline in MCI and subsequent progression of MCI to AD. Although the overall effect reported here is modest, the time period measured is short (1 y) and given the likelihood of cumulative cognitive decrements, the longterm clinical impact on cognition may be severe. Thus, the findings reported here are confined to associations with the baseline BMI and not with change in BMI over time. In addition, BMI does not differentiate the contributions from muscle mass and body fat; thus, low BMI may reflect reductions in muscle mass, fat mass, or both. Further differentiating the role of body composition using more sensitive measures that differentiate components of body composition may be important given that muscle and fat are metabolically different and have different risk implications. Future studies should explore the use of more sophisticated measures of body composition to characterize the individual relationships of lean mass and fat mass on cognitive decline through time."}]
