[{"section_title": "PREFACE", "text": "Giving thanks. Defending the thesis on the 22 nd day of November was purposefully. First, friends and family are at home celebrating Thanksgiving Day. Secondly, 49 years ago today JFK was assassinated in Dallas. Both days, I remember for different reasons. My impending fate with road traffic safety came in the 1960's. A drunk driver broadsided our family car at high speed right behind the front passenger door where I was sitting unrestrained. I was thrown from the car, lucky to survive. The car that hit us was a Corvair, known for the engine compartment in the back as noted by US consumer advocate Ralph Nader as \"unsafe at any speed.\" If the engine compartment was in the front, the added force might have killed me on contact. Unlicensed driving is a curious thesis topic that I stumbled upon in providing technical assistance. The western slope of Colorado suffered two fourteen year-olds killed while driving unlicensed. There was little written at the time, sensing an opportunity -a thesis was launched with a personal and scientific zeal! You realize the complexity of road traffic safety as a complex global problem. In the US alone each year, there are over 36,000 victims, 600 related to young people going unlicensed each year. My commitment comes as a victim, advocate, and a parent with three young adult drivers, reminding me of the dangers of sharing the road each day. Let's get going!"}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND TRANSPORT, MOTORIZATION AND MOBILITY", "text": "Road traffic injuries are still an increasing and major global public health problem (WHO, 2004). Motor vehicles are a primary mode of travel, providing an unprecedented degree of mobility throughout the world (Arnett, 2002). The use of cars and access to driving privileges may come at a public health cost in terms of morbidity, mortality and their other human and societal costs. Motor vehicle transport is estimated to kill 1.2 million people each year accounting for 25% of all deaths from injury. Worldwide, between 20 million and 50 million people are injured or disabled each year in road traffic crashes (RTCs) and this probably underreported (WHO, 2009). In motorized countries cars provide important economic, social, financial, and educational opportunities for families (Hirsch, 2003). Privately owned vehicles are essential where population settlement patterns have decentralized communities separating people by distance from schools, jobs, and services. Distance plays an even greater role especially where public transportation is not available or inadequate and being mobile requires access to a car and possessing a driver license (Patel et al., 2000;McDonald & Trowbridge, 2009). The issue of unlicensed driving arises when the developmental and mobility needs precede obtaining a license to drive that can occur before and long after the age of becoming eligible to be licensed (Tsai et al., 2008). A sub-group of young people who drive unauthorized and illegally as unlicensed drivers (going unlicensed) who are primarily recognized by their involvement in RTCs (Williams et al., 1985;Williams et al., 1995)."}, {"section_title": "YOUNG DRIVERS AND INJURIES ON THE ROAD", "text": "According to the WHO data, traffic crashes globally are the single greatest killer of 15-24 year-olds in motorized countries. An estimated 8,500 young drivers of motor vehicles were killed in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2004. This includes almost 4,000 in the US, over 750 in Germany,645 in France, and over 300 in both Japan and Spain. These young people represent about 27% of all drivers killed in these countries, although within the same age group they account for about 10% of the population. Furthermore, for each young driver killed, it is likely that more than 1.3 passengers or other road users also die in the same crashes, based on findings from the US and the Netherlands (WHO, 2009). Males account for three-fourths (73%) of all road traffic deaths, with an overall rate almost three times that for females in all areas, income levels, and age groups. The sex difference in mortality rates are related to both driving exposure and risk-taking behavior (WHO, 2004). Even though globally, unlicensed driving among the young has not been fully recognized. Driver licensing systems. A driving license is an official document that allows a person to operate a motorized vehicle legally on a public roadway. The laws, requirements, ages, and difficulty of obtaining a license vary among and between countries. In the US, the ease and age of licensing are viewed as relatively easy compared to global standards (Arnett, 2002). Basically, to qualify and prepare young people to drive, an organized sequence of education, training, and practice provide basic knowledge and skills to prepare for a license is usually provided (Vernick et al., 1999;Williams, 2009;Curry et al., 2012). In countries that provide driver training and earlier licensing, a side effect of driver training is that it provides premature access to driving. In response, these countries have added a graduated drivers licensing system (GDL) to delay early exposures to high risk driving environments and circumstances. It also contributes to continued adult supervised driving experience as the young person gains maturity prior to obtaining a full license (Dee et al., 2005;Preusser & Tison, 2007). While training or a GDL does not guarantee a safer driver, it does provide parental control and legal oversight from authorities to their on-road behavior over a given period. In turn, GDL increases the time, costs, and commitment to obtaining a license. For some disadvantaged young people, it provides a barrier from gaining a timely license upon becoming age-eligible (Ferguson, 2003;Mayhew, 2007). Inadvertently, GDL may also contribute to some youth who may forego the process and drive as illegal unlicensed drivers (Males, 2007;Scott-Parker et al., 2012). If licensing requirements become too restrictive to get a timely license or if viewed as unfair, young people may alternatively use other forms of transport such as driving unlicensed or motorcycles (Simons-Morton et al., 2006). Unlicensed drivers miss out on the knowledge and practice opportunities provided by the education and GDL as part of the licensing process."}, {"section_title": "UNDERSTANDING YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR IN AND OUT OF THE CAR", "text": "A body of literature primarily on licensed drivers aims to clarify the elevated risk behaviors of young people who drive and are involved in a road traffic crash (RTC) or sustaining a road traffic injury (RTI). The Transitional Teen Theory (TTT) provides a framework to examine risks consisting of four key elements that influence driving behaviors as young people approach and obtain the age of licensing (TTT) (Voas & Kelley-Baker, 2008). The elements include the internal development-and age-related factor and three external influences that are peers, the home environment, and the extended environment (see Figure 1). Developmentally during the transition stage young people seek their identity and independence. By virtue of their age, they also become eligible to drive and interested in cars that provide opportunities to explore new areas and participate in adult activities. This transition stage is recognized as a legitimate developmental step as an integral part of the maturation and socialization process for young people, especially in car dependent and motorized countries. The transition to driving as a stage of development coincides with the developmental need to increase their independence from family life requiring increased mobility (Arnett, 1992;Bingham & Shope, 2004a;Bina et al., 2006). Challenges to obtaining mobility to gain independence can be a precursor to unlicensed driving when options such as public transportation, parental support, or transport by peers are not available (Males, 2006). The TTT model provides an opportunity to integrate developmental science, public health, and traffic safety when young people are vulnerable to unlicensed driving or riding with an unlicensed driver. The internal and three external elements are described and illustrated below. Development-and age-related influences. Central to the model are the internallycontrolled development-and age-related factors that influence driving behaviors of young people. These include the propensity to adopt unsafe driving practices, abilities to detect and respond to hazards, distinguish high-risk situations, maturity, and estimating one's abilities to drive (Ferguson et al., 1996;Rice et al., 2003;Ivers et al., 2009). As a result, crash risk is highest during the first years of independent driving among the youngest drivers (Mayhew et al. 2003;McCartt et al. 2003;Williams & Shabanova, 2003;Ferguson et al. 2007;Twisk & Stacey 2007) and declines each year until age 30 (IIHS, 2005). Studies of licensed young drivers (under age 20) have shown a per-mile crash rate that is up to five times that of the overall adult population, while that of 16-year-old licensed drivers are approximately ten times that of adults (McKnight & McKnight, 2003). Peer influences. In the evolving absence of parental supervision young people seek to have an increased orientation to peers during the transition, especially into smaller affinity groups, that fit into a car and seek others with similar behavioral norms and activities. The car as the \"vehicle\" provides the mobility for the peer group to experiment with other health risk behaviors. The use of cars for this purpose with peers can be considered inherently a dangerous approach to driving (Gregersen & Berg, 1994;Preusser et al., 2000) and functional in the lives of young people (M\u00f8ller & Gregersen, 2008). Previous away-from-home transportation destinations were controlled and limited by adults. The increased mobility brings wider exposure to peers and environments where they perceive that they have more control over their own behavior (McCarthy & Brown, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Home environment influences.", "text": "For the home environment, the model recognizes a continuing role in providing supervision and clear rule-definition with respect to vehicle access and driving expectations by parents. Continued adult supervision with car driving can impose compliance expectations, controls, and the promotion of alternative outlets to counterbalance the increasing role of peers (Bingham & Shope, 2004b). The use of GDL provides an opportunity to extend the role of parents by increasing the length of supervision (Hartos et al., 2004;Simons-Morton et al., 2006). It is the absence of parental guidance that peer influence can be influential in driving practices. Extended environment influences. Driving behaviors and outcomes are also influenced by the extended environment where young people live and drive. Of particular interest to unlicensed drivers are the role of area and individual socioeconomic disadvantage and population density in the extended environment. Most of what is known about this comes from studies of adult populations where disadvantage and density were found to be associated with specific dangerous driving practices (e.g., restraint use, speed, and alcohol) and driving conditions (e.g., road conditions, vehicle types, and post-crash trauma care) (Baker et al., 1987;van Beeck et al., 1991;Noland & Quddus, 2004;La Torre et al., 2007;MMWR, 2009) contributing to negative RTI outcomes. Similar findings were also found to a lesser degree for the vulnerability of young drivers to socioeconomic disadvantage and low population density (Males 2009b;Chen et al., 2010a;Chen et al., 2010b) with comparable outcomes. Whether or not this is important for unlicensed drivers has not been investigated. Within the extended environment expectations and norms related to dangerous driving practices such as unlicensed driving can also influence behaviors. Even though unlicensed driving is illegal, it is not always consistently enforced or detected in different settings (DeYoung & Gebers, 2004). By setting community standards, laws, and practices that are clearly communicated, modeled by parents, and consistently enforced to young people can define and direct driving behaviors of young people (Imai & Mansfield, 2008). Examples of such practices include zero-tolerance for alcohol laws (Williams & Ferguson, 2002), GDL systems , and night curfews (Phebo & Dellinger, 1998). The challenge for parents and communities is to provide the appropriate expectations and norms and within given boundaries that do not limit opportunities for mobility, while also protecting them from the hazards."}, {"section_title": "UNLICENSED DRIVING AND RTI", "text": "The bulk of the studies dealing with RTCs are concerned with licensed drivers. Much less attention is paid to young people who drive a car illegally without a license as unlicensed drivers. The phenomenon of unlicensed driving and the subsequent RTI has been addressed in a limited number of studies, among others from Great Britain (Knox et al., 2003), Sweden (Hasselberg & Laflamme, 2009), Australia (FORS, 1997;Lam, 2003), New Zealand (Harr\u00e9 et al., 1996), Italy (Bina et al., 2006), and the US (Williams et al., 1995). It is of note that there are challenges to studying unlicensed driving poised by the illegal nature and wide availability of cars to all ages, in all settings (Watson, 1998). It is also suspected that the majority of unlicensed driving goes undetected limiting the true understanding of the scope and determinants of the problem (DeYoung & Gebers, 2004). When unlicensed drivers take to the road, it otherwise unknown unless they are involved in an incident reported to the police (Mayhew et al., 2000). Unlicensed driving. Whether or not YUDs pose a greater risk for RTI has been suggested but not demonstrated from a lack of comparative crash data on the prevalence of unlicensed driving in the general population. Studies based on young adults and adult RTI and RTCs provide insight on the risk associated with unlicensed driving. In California (US) it was found that, for all ages aggregated there was a 4.9 increased risk of a RTC and severe RTI by unlicensed drivers (DeYoung et al., 1997). In turn, a study of unlicensed, suspended, revoked drivers from New Zealand showed an 11 times increase in risk for a RTC . In Sweden a study of 18-20 year-old unlicensed drivers revealed that they were over represented in RTC and severe RTI injuries when compared to same age licensed drivers (Hasselberg & Laflamme, 2009). The studies reveal that unlicensed and illegal driving are risky in their own right justifying further investigations of young people who drive unlicensed (DeYoung & Gebers, 2004;. Unlicensed driving in the US. An overview of fatal crashes from illegal driving (including suspended, revoked, cancelled, and unlicensed drivers) of all ages is provided by a series of US reports wittily titled \"Unlicensed to Kill.\" The reports showed that one-fifth (20%) of all fatal crashes involve an illegal driver of which 79.8% are males and less than 5% were strictly unlicensed. For younger drivers under 20 years of age, 32% of all crashes in their age group involved an unlicensed driver (Griffin & DeLaZerda, 2000;Scopatz et al., 2003). A wide geographic distribution of crashes was noted across the states (high of 23.9% in New Mexico and a low of 6.4% in Maine) with an average of 13.8% of fatal crashes involving illegal drivers (AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Unlicensed driving among the young", "text": "Both self-reports and crash studies contribute to the understanding of the scope of unlicensed driving, the identity (who) of the unlicensed drivers (stratified by age, sex, socioeconomic, license status), and location (where) these crashes occur (defined as area differences, urbanicity level). Age is further stratified by distinguishing those who are generally of legal age to obtain a license or age-ineligible (underage) to be licensed based on the setting. The variance in self-reported behaviors and unlicensed driving are partially explained by study methods and to some degree the sociodemographics. These may also be more practical matters such as the availability of a vehicle, licensing practices, or public transport that are influential (Girasek & Taylor, 2010). At the end of the chapter, overviews of the studies are summarized in Table 1 for selfreports and associated behaviors and Table 2 for crash studies for those who are both age-eligible to be licensed and underage with accompanying circumstances. Underage drivers. The focus of many of the early unlicensed driving studies includes those who are not yet age-eligible to be licensed or underage (Williams et al., 1985). Technically any young person who can physically access a car and controls could be considered a potential unlicensed driver at any age. Underage drivers are a concern for three reasons. First, dangerous attitudes about driving that can begin well before the licensing age contribute to unlicensed driving (Waylen & McKenna, 2008). Secondly, underage drivers may not be capable of recognizing the enormity of the task or the risk and implications associated with unlicensed driving (Arnett, 2002). Third, self-reports (Begg et al., 1992;Ferguson et al., 1996;Muilenburg et al., 2007;McDowell et al., 2009) and crash studies (Lam, 2003;Huber, 2006) indicate that underage drivers can spend an inordinate amount of time on the roads prior to licensing."}, {"section_title": "Self-reported behaviors of unlicensed driving", "text": "Self-report studies provide a feasible, but limited, means to estimate and gain insights into unlicensed driving. These self-reports from various settings provide findings across the age groups, sex, settings, and crash circumstances. Three regional studies, two in the US (Williams et al., 1985;Ferguson et al., 1996) and one in NZ (Harr\u00e9 et al., 1996), all done with students, found a wide variance of unlicensed driving from 18 to 58% (higher percent also included permitted drivers). In the US studies the driving patterns were generally those of supervised practice driving patterns with a family member present. It was found that males reported more driving alone, speeding, and driving after drinking compared to females. The unlicensed driving experiences varied with states in the south and those that allowed earlier ages of licensure reporting more unlicensed driving. A similar study of 15-16 year-olds in Auckland, NZ reported 18% of males and 28% of females reporting unlicensed driving at least three times per week. Unlicensed driving was also associated with speeding and alcohol drinking. These early studies establish some of the base of age and unlicensed driving behaviors for future studies. More recently in the US, a select group of schools in California (Heck et al., 2008) and a national sample (Elliott et al., 2008) found 12.4% and 4.2% reporting unlicensed driving respectively. The lower percent represents a more restrictive unlicensed driving definition (at least one hour per week). In California driving unlicensed and less likely to be licensed was found by those who attend a low-income school. The national study found risky driving behaviors to be more common among those with lower grades, those using alcohol, minority racial groups, those living in both rural or central city location, and among the unlicensed drivers compared to licensed drivers. Five studies from New Zealand and Australia surveyed young people about their prelicensed (unlicensed) driving at their completion of the first year of restricted driving. They were asked about their crash experience and driving practices in both instances. These studies differed by the fact that they were surveyed at the time of licensing determining that they did indeed get a license. Across the studies it was found that the amount and frequency of unsupervised pre-licensed driving was a good predictor of future risky driving and a crash during that first year of restricted licensing. Prelicensed driver characteristics of those more likely to crash included more frequent driving, starting to drive at an earlier age, males, and living in economically deprived areas. Common driving behaviors among those in a crash included speeding, frequent driving, and non-use of seat belts. Non-traffic behaviors associated with the those drivers in a crash included more frequent health risk behaviors and greater sensationseeking and aggression/hostility measures (Stevenson & Palamara, 2001;McDowell et al., 2009;Boufous et al., 2010;Scott-Parker, et al., 2012;Begg et al., 2011). Two school-based surveys and a qualitative study of age-ineligible to be licensed students provide additional insights to unlicensed driving and related behaviors. In an impoverished area in a southern state (US) of those less than 15 years (all underage) it was found that over one-third of the students (36.8%) reported drinking and driving (Muilenberg et al., 2007). The second survey of 14-17 year-old Italian students reported unlicensed driving by 20% among a profile of health risk behaviors compared to their non-driving peers (Bina et al., 2005). A first qualitative study of underage drivers was conducted in an agricultural area in NZ that reported driving on the road and off the road commenced well before the age of licensing (many before 10 years-old). Unlicensed driving was a common and customary practice in assisting with farm chores. However, the early driving did affect later attitudes negatively for speeding and positively for avoiding drink driving (Knight et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Unlicensed driving in road traffic crashes", "text": "Crash studies of YUDs include RTI outcomes of all young drivers and victims and the drivers' age-eligibility to be licensed. Most of the crash studies of underage drivers are exclusively from the US. Underage drivers. It should be noted that studies of underage unlicensed drivers generally find higher frequency (60%+) of occurrence, as most of the young people in this age group cannot obtain a license compared to studies with age-eligible drivers. Across the crash studies in general, unlicensed driving was more common among males and those approaching the age of eligibility to be license. Some studies highlighted driving behaviors where underage drivers demonstrated dangerous driving practices and assigned greater fault in the crashes (Williams, 1997). Common driving practices included single vehicle crashes, speeding, carrying same age passengers, driving without parental supervision, and night driving (Huber, 2006). A series of three region-specific studies examined underage driving finding a majority of the crashes in southern states, rural and farming areas, and states with early licensure. Males were found to be more associated with crashes and dangerous driving behaviors such as speeding and low restraint use (Frisch et al., 2003;Frisch & Plessinger, 2007;Frisch, 2007). Two additional findings were that females had the twice the risk of an occupant injury in the crash and 13% of the crashed involved a police chase (Lam, 2003). Similar in the US over four years there 49 fatal police pursuits of underage drivers that most occurred in urban areas and four states (Plessinger & Frisch, 2005). Finally, in the US 13-15 year olds in fatal crashes (some driving with a permit) were mostly males with six-fold higher fatality for occupants than the underage driver. Single vehicle crash, speeding, and no restraint use were frequent (Williams & Tison, 2012). Age-eligible young drivers. On the other hand, age-eligible to be licensed drivers represent an older age range and present a different set of driving practices. A US study of fatal crashes of 16 year-olds, unlicensed drivers were involved in 9% of the crashes (Williams et al., 1995). Next, in the US over 10 years, 16-24 year-olds reported 7.3% of all fatal crashes. Females were involved in 3.8% and males over double (9.6%) of the crashes with alcohol use a common factor for both sexes (Tsai et al., 2008). In Sweden, 7.5% (n= 2448) of crashes of 18-20 year-olds involved an unlicensed driver (licensure age is 18 years). Compared to licensed drivers the crashes were more likely to occur in sparsely populated areas, in single vehicle crashes, crashes at night, alcohol influence, and with severe RTI (Hasselberg & Laflamme, 2009). In California, three studies examining the pre-and post-GDL fatal crash occurrence of unlicensed drivers using different age configurations found elevated proportions. One study found for 16 year olds an increase from 23% to 34%, 17 year olds an increase of 22% to 29% over 11 years (Males, 2007). In the second study those less than 18 yearsold increased from 19.4% to 22.5% and 18 to 19 year-olds from 25.7% to 28.9% over eight years (Males, 2006). One study looking at 35 counties found both lower rates of licensing and elevated YUD fatalities in counties with more poverty (Males, 2009a). The author attributed the higher rates to not only GDL restrictions on disadvantaged youth, but also to the on-going economic and immigration issues in the state. Similar economic downturns have also had an influence on licensing practices for young people recognized in Sweden (Murray, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The knowledge at hand about unlicensed driving among young people primarily rests on studies based on self-reports and road traffic crashes.

Three studies deal with the US context and one is from Sweden. The Swedish study allowed the incorporation of individual socioeconomic register data not readily available in the US. In the remainder of the thesis, young unlicensed driver(s) will be referred to as YUD(s). Aspects and concepts central to the thesis are clarified and defined below. Study designs. All three studies from the US are cross-sectional and the Swedish one has a cohort design. In Study I, a focus on the crashes involving YUDs, the question of \"who\" and \"where\" of fatal crashes are described with driver characteristics and crash circumstances. Study II, area-based, looks at the \"where\" crashes occurred in relation to county-level material deprivation and urbanicity. Study III in Sweden looks at the \"who\" and \"where\" of the YUDs involved in fatal and non-fatal crashes and the circumstances of their RTIs. Study IV considers \"who\" with self-reported health risk behaviors based on driving practices and licensing. The focus of the studies included driver characteristics (who) such as age (Studies I, III) described below, sex which is self-explanatory (Studies I, III, IV), and socioeconomic position (Study III) described under the study. \"Where\" is the location of the residence of the young person (Study I, II) or the site of the crash (Study III) described below. Age. The studies altogether cover a range of ages, from pre-to post eligibility for a license that allows for investigation in two contextsage ineligible at 14-15 and ageeligible at 16+ in the US and two years later in Sweden. The two US national crash studies considered young drivers up to the age of 18 years. In the US, the age of driver licensing varies from 14 years in a few states to 16 years in most states (Williams, 2009). In Study I, the lower age limit was not restricted (and turned out to be 8 years). In Study II, the lower limit was set at 11 years due to the very low number of cases under that age. In Sweden, 18 years is the age of driver licensing. Given the design of the Swedish study (Study III; see below), no age limit was set; age at time of crash ranged between 11 to 27 years of the cohort. The study on health risk behaviors (Study IV), focused on high school students, included a limited age range from 16 (corresponding to the age of eligibility to be licensed in the state) to 19 years (typical age of high school completion). Unlicensed driving. In the three crash studies, unlicensed driving means operating a motor vehicle on a road when one does not have a driving license and to the best of our knowledge has never been licensed to drive. It excludes those driving with a learner's permit or a provisional license as well as those who have their driving privileges suspended or revoked. In the health risk behavior study, unlicensed driving also deals with \"never been licensed\" youth and is defined by the survey question about driving practice and license (Study IV). The scope of the problem is described as the overall frequency of occurrence and circumstances of crashes or behaviors of unlicensed driving/drivers."}, {"section_title": "Area.", "text": "In the three studies that examine area, the first two are area-based on the residence of the YUD (US) and the third study is individual-based on the location of the crash. Each crash study examines various geographic area configurations and attributes described as \"where.\" In Study I, crashes were assigned to one of the US four Census regions (see Figure 2). In Study II, the unit of observation was the county with each assigned an urbanicity designation based on the Rural Urban Continuum Codes (USDA, 2003) and material deprivation score based on the county. Counties were also grouped into nine US Census divisions (see Figure 2). In Study III, an individual-based study, the place of occurrence of a crash was classified in one of five area levels of urbanicity based on population and distance from city center derived from the Swedish Population Register information. Crash. In Studies I, II, III the term crash includes the event and circumstances where at least one car is driven by a YUD as the outcome measure. In all studies, the crash information is extracted from official registers based on police reports. Crashes were also restricted to those involving four-wheeled passenger motor vehicle(s). Farm machinery, off-road recreational vehicles, and three-or fewer-wheeled vehicles were excluded. Differences exist in recording the crash events between the US and Swedish registers. The US register includes only crashes that result in a fatality on a public road without individual identifiers. As such, the observation unit is the crash in Study I. There are no national registers of non-fatal crashes in the US. The Swedish register includes all crashes on private and public roads regardless of injury outcomes identified to the individual as the observation unit. Both registers update the records for a fatality that occurs 30 days after the crash event."}, {"section_title": "Study Settings", "text": "US motor vehicle transportation. Motor vehicle transportation includes a network of over 3.9 million miles (6,237,290 kilometers) of roads. Vehicles that include cars, trucks, vans, and motorcycles account for 86% of passenger-miles traveled on roads. In 2003, there were 759 automobiles per 1,000 US inhabitants compared to 472 per 1,000 inhabitants of the European Union. In the US there are an estimated 205.7 million licensed drivers, 6.4% (13.2 million) are young people between 15 and 20 years old. In the US, there were 43,443 fatalities in 2005. Source: http://www.nationalatlas.gov/transportation.html The US has a relatively low age of licensure, less restrictive laws governing issuance of driving license, and availability of cars. Obtaining a license upon becoming age-eligible is relatively easy and inexpensive by global standards (Patel et al., 2000). Each state establishes their own licensing regulations. To obtain driving privileges some states allow provisional driving/learner's permits for 14 year-olds; most allow drivers to begin learning at age 15, and in all but one state 16 years is the minimum age to obtain a driver's license (age 17 in New Jersey). All states have some form of a graduated drivers licensing system (GDL) that modulates the risk with increasing driving privileges for novice drivers through to age 18 (cite). In other motorized countries, the minimum licensing age is 18 or a learner/practice license can be obtained license at age of 16 but this involves great cost and extensive training. Sweden motor vehicle transportation. The Swedish National Road Administration manages the country's road network and safety. The road network totals about 420,000 km (261,000 miles) with two-thirds that are primarily private, unpaved forestry roads open to the public. The distance of State-owned roads is 98,000 km (61,000 miles), while municipal road and street networks total about 40,000 km (25,000 miles). Much of Sweden is also covered by a well-organized, reliable, and efficient public transport network connected to most of the country. In Sweden, there were approximately 3.9 million registered cars among 8.9 million inhabitants (44 cars per 100 inhabitants) in 2000. The current basic speed limit is between 30 mph (19 mph) in built up areas and on highways the typical speed limit is 90 kph (56 mph) and freeways (motorways) it is usually 110 kph (68 mph). Already with the lowest number of traffic fatalities in relation to its population among motorized countries, Sweden has a long-term commitment to road safety goal of no road traffic fatalities or serious injuries. The 2005 Swedish road traffic fatality count was 440. Source: Swedish Institute-www.sweden.se In Sweden, there is no GDL system but young people may start to learn at the age of 16 with a learner's permit. Driver education for learner-drivers can choose professional education at a driving school and/or private education by a lay instructor who is at least 24 years-old and who has held a driving license for a minimum of five years. There is a three-stage process of driver training and education for 18 year-olds to obtain a license. The first stage is the human factor and knowledge of other dangers in traffic. Secondly, a practice driving course to learn how to control a car during a spin. Finally, to determine if the student has gained competence of the curriculum, a driving-license test that consists of practical and theory components is taken. Upon passing, the driving test allows a temporary driver's license (valid for a year) is issued (Henriksson et al., 2004). Approximately 27% of Swedish youth have a driving license at the age of 18 with 31% among males and 22% for females ."}, {"section_title": "US fatal crash studies", "text": "Both US crash studies (I and II), presented first, drew their respective crash and population data from the same national register. \uf0b7 What are the driver characteristics and crash circumstances involving YUDs?"}, {"section_title": "Fatal Analysis Reporting System (crash data", "text": "\uf0b7 Are there age and sex differences in fatal crashes involving YUDs?

Urbanicity. Urbanicity was based on the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) (cite). The RUCC provides a county-level classification scheme that considers population and proximity to a metropolitan area or areas status in June 2003. In the RUCC all US counties are codified into nine levels, either one of three metropolitan or six non-metropolitan groupings. The county distribution of crashes occurring in less than half of the counties necessitated the construction of nine levels to one metropolitan and two nonmetropolitan county groups as described in Table 6. For more information about RUCC: http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/RuralUrbanContinuumCodes/ Data treatment. The outcome was dichotomized by counties with at least one fatal crash and those without a crash. The distribution of fatal crashes across counties was highly skewed, with many counties having none or two or fewer crashes. A single material deprivation score was derived and calculated and urbanicity level were assigned at the county level. The first of two steps used an unconditional model to test the main effects and interactions of census division, urbanicity, and material deprivation to assess the necessity of the use of the conditional model on census division. No significant interactions with census division would indicate that the main effects and interaction were uniform across census divisions and no need for further analysis. A significant interaction with census division would indicate the need to test conditionally to account for variations across divisions. The conditional logistic model was used to test the main effects and interactions of urbanicity and material deprivation conditional on census division. Both models used logistic regression with odds ratios calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). family relationships of each resident. Record linkage with the various registers summarized in Table 7 was made using the Swedish personal identification number.  Sweden (1990). The Population and Housing Census information on the family social position, welfare recipients, family disposable income, and urbanicity of living area of the cohort was presented. The family social position was constructed based on a classification scheme of the dominant parent's occupation. The scheme divides occupations into six socioeconomic groups based on production, type of production, and education required for their occupation. These include intermediate and high-level salaried employees; farmer (small-scale and medium-scale farmers); self-employed (self-employed without employees or small-scale entrepreneurs); assistant non-manual employees; manual workers (skilled and unskilled); and others (such as students, persons on sickness leave and disability pensions, and the long-term unemployed).

The Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) is a biennially (odd years) state-based epidemiologic surveillance conducted in selected states by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Brener et al., 2004). CDC developed the YRBSS to monitor priority health-risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth in the US. The YRBSS uses clusters to construct samples proportional to each state's school enrolment in grades 9-12. State data are weighted to adjust for students' grade, sex, and race/ethnicity. CDC is committed to ensuring that the data are of the highest quality beginning with questionnaire items subjected to reliability and validity testing. Surveys are self-reported and administered by using standardized procedures in each state (Brenner et al., 2004). The survey measures 90+ individual demographic and selfassessed health characteristics and risk behaviors. Data treatment: Nine topical questions were selected based on the frequency and overall health and safety risks of high school students. The question topics included: behaviors related to car driving/riding (4 questions) and non-traffic behaviors that include alcohol use (2 questions), tobacco use (1 question), use of marijuana (1 question), and violent behavior (2 questions).

Those different aspects are discussed in turn below."}, {"section_title": "Scope of unlicensed driving", "text": "Two studies documented the frequency of occurrence of unlicensed driving based on data from crashes. They considered both those under age and those age-eligible using different age ranges (13-19 and 11-27 years), contexts (US vs. Sweden), and outcomes. Articles I and III indicate that respectively 10.8% and 7.7% of the crashes involved a YUD. Those findings echo earlier American and Swedish studies. One US study, with a broad age range (16-24 year-olds) and considering fatal crashes found that 7.3% involved an unlicensed driver (Tsai et al., 2008). In Sweden, looking at the crash involvement of 18-20 year-olds, a study found that 7.5% of those involved in fatal and non-fatal crashes were unlicensed (Hasselberg & Laflamme, 2008). Similar level of fatal RTC involving unlicensed driving in the US is also reflected in regional and state-based studies that consider limited age ranges and the driving status is sometimes defined differently, which make comparisons difficult (Williams et al., 1995;Williams et al., 1997;Huber, 2006;Males, 2006;Frisch et al., 2007;Frisch & Plessinger, 2007;Males, 2009a;Williams & Tison, 2012). Article IV for its part gives an indication on how prevalent unlicensed driving can be in that age group. The study was carried out in a region where the involvement of YUDs in fatal crashes is one of the highest in the country (as shown in Article I). The number of students reporting unlicensed driving was 5.2% a figure that otherwise is in line with the previous studies from two different locations (Elliott et al., 2008;Heck et al., 2008) in spite of variations in definition, difference in settings, and restricting to only those who were age-eligible. Unlicensed driving remains a heterogeneous concept. It may occur on a more or less regular basis, from a one-time supervised driving session with a parent (which can be considered to be the least risky) (Berg et al., 2004) to repeated unsupervised episodes which may involve very dangerous driving practices such as a police chase (Rivara & Mack, 2004). Unlicensed driving is illegal and occurs often with unauthorized use of the family car or to a lesser extent with a stolen car as seen in Article I. Further, driving unlicensed and unsupervised among young people provides no future crash protection benefit (Stevenson & Palamara, 2001;McDowell et al., 2009;Scott-Parker et al., 2011) and endangers all road users (Kallail et al., 2008;Winston et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Who are the young unlicensed drivers (socio-demographic)", "text": "Age. Across the studies, age was defined in different groupsand periods of adolescence and youth. Yet, in Articles I (US) and III (Sweden) show that a majority of the crashes occur when young people are age eligible to be licensed and thereafter. Article IV supports this notion with self-reports on driving practice of high school students showing that unlicensed driving practices were stable beginning at age 16 (age of eligibility in Montana) through age 19. The increase in crashes in each country occurs within the designated transition age to driving as described in the TTT model. A similar pattern for unlicensed driving was also found in the US with states that allow younger people (14-15 years) to be licensed also reported unlicensed driving commenced at earlier ages compared to states who licensed at older ages (Ferguson et al., 1996;Frisch et al., 2003). Age influences not only the frequency of unlicensed driving, but also driving practices. In general, the younger the unlicensed driver the more common driving practices such as speeding, single vehicle crashes, and no restraint use. Older YUDs also drive dangerously as shown from the crash circumstances of Article I that are contingent on weekends, late at night, and drinking and driving. Although age can be incrementally associated with unlicensed driving, it is just one of the individual influences. Additional influences reflected in the TTT model include biology, attitudes and personality, and demographic attributes (Shope et al., 2003;Allen & Brown, 2008), lifestyle (Gregersen & Berg, 1994;Bina et al., 2006), and academic achievement (Murray, 1998;. It was beyond the scope of the studies to consider those factors. Sex. As could be expected, the majority of YUDs involved in RTCs were male (across the studies). These differences are also reflected in crash circumstances of male YUDs who are more likely to be involved in more dangerous driving practices (i.e., stolen car), late night driving, driving alone, no restraint use, and to die as the result of the crash in Articles I and III. In contrast, self-reported unlicensed driving practices such as how frequently they drive and driving practices such as neglect to wear a seat belt as a passenger and a driver and drinking and driving were similar between the sexes in Montana in Article IV. In light of the TTT model one could attribute sex differences in unlicensed driving practices to developmental and external influences. Promotion of driving to males begins at earlier ages, to drive more often, and to do so recklessly as a way of obtaining manhood (Suitor & Reavis, 1995;Marshall et al., 1996;Knight et al., 2004;Bingham & Shope, 2004b;Steg, 2005). Developmentally, young males possess a greater propensity for sensation seeking, aggression and risk taking that is biological and externally driven (Dejoy, 1992;Jonah, 1997;Turner & McClure, 2003). The sex differences in male unlicensed drivers are not unique to license status (NHTSA, 2004;Twisk & Stacey, 2007;Zhang et al., 2010). When it comes to self-reported unlicensed driving the weak differences between the sexes observed in Article IV concur with recent studies (Elliott et al., 2008;Heck et al., 2008;Scott-Parker et al., 2011). It could be part of a wider proliferation of unlicensed driving by females. Alternatively, it could reflect imprecision or priorities in the survey tools from the lack of driving practice measures. Many studies of unlicensed drivers do not consider driving practices and supervision levels that could help highlight differences in the sexes (i.e., same age passengers, late at night). The few studies that do cover driving practices found that YUD males do indeed spend more time driving, drive greater distances, and more often drive alone or with peers as YUDs compared to females (Williams et al., 1985: Heck et al., 2008Begg et al., 2011;Scott-Parker et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic position.", "text": "The results from Article III indicate that YUDs from families with lower socioeconomic position are more at risk of severe RTI compared to those from families in the highest socioeconomic positions. Social and economic disadvantage can establish barriers to licensing, perceived or real, contributing to unlicensed driving in different groups and context. Barriers could include the costs of training and driving, access to training programs, (Williams, 2006) and the geographical and social isolation in remote areas (Zwerling et al., 2005;Scott-Parker et al., 2012). In some areas where segments of the population are proportionately unbalanced by sex, age, or disadvantage can be prone to escalate licensing barriers and accumulate more unlicensed driving (Stamatiadis & Puccini, 2000;Braver, 2001;Williams & Collins, 2001;Campos-Outcalt et al., 1997;Murray et al., 2006;MMWR, 2009;Laflamme et al., 2010). The risk of severe RTI for YUDs from lower socioeconomic groups is echoed in earlier Swedish studies of all young drivers (Hasselberg & Laflamme, 2003;Hassleberg & Laflamme, 2005;Hasselberg & Laflamme, 2008). Several factors can partially explain the differences in risk from the physical and social contexts that young people from different socioeconomic positions travel and live in. Risk may be moderated by how much a young person needs and values a license or a car for transport (Berg et al., 1999) or the availability of public transport in their particular area . When involved in a crash, lower socioeconomic groups may also be driving less crashworthy vehicles and travel under more dangerous conditions resulting in the severity of RTI (Williams et al., 2006;Hellinga et al., 2007;Laflamme & Vaez, 2007). As the TTT model suggests, parents play a pivotal role in supervising and facilitating young people during the transition to independent driving. The age range (children to young adults) in the cohort in Article III represents various socioeconomic relationships with their families. As they grow older, the more likely young people are to be more independent where their driving practices would not be monitored as closely by parents when they were younger (Hasselberg, 2003). As well, for some groups, driving before a license is essential to support their families for farmworkers (Stiles & Grieshop, 1999;Heck et al., 2008;Knight et al., 2012) and the self-employed . This could account for the continued and steady unlicensed driving crashes by young adults after the age of eligibility."}, {"section_title": "Who are the young unlicensed drivers (behavioral)", "text": "The self-reported findings in Article IV demonstrate the clustering of non-traffic health risk behaviors of YUD among both sexes. Health risk behaviors are a normative part of the developmental process during the transition. However, the students in Montana who identified as unlicensed drivers (Article IV) exceeded the normative limits of health risk behaviors compared to state (MOPS, 2010) and national findings (Eaton et al., 2008). The TTT model would offer that their behaviors were overly-influenced by external factors such as peer influences tending to more deviance (Voas & Kelley-Baker, 2008). Unlicensed driving is not an isolated problem and appears to be part of an interrelated profile of health risk behaviors (Jessor, 1991;Petridou et al., 1997;. At least among unlicensed drivers, health risk behaviors are not discriminated by sex (Elliott et al., 2008;Heck et al., 2008) as across the general public (Begg & Gulliver, 2008;Eaton et al., 2012). Health risk behaviors tend to cluster with YUD as they have established themselves as risk takers (Jessor, 1991). Whether unlicensed driving serves to initiate, proliferate, or compound health risk behaviors or if the behaviors have the opposite effect on unlicensed driving needs to be better understood (Chliaoutakis et al., 1999). Alcohol use and the lack of safety restraints among unlicensed drivers were common across age, sex, and socioeconomic groups studied. The TTT model suggests that these behaviors can proliferate in the absence of parental and community influence as part of a broader risk profile influenced by peers. This is not unique to unlicensed drivers as other studies of young licensed drivers have found similar findings Voas et al., 2012). Both behaviors associated with dangerous driving practices can be influential in the severity of RTI (Jones & Shults, 2000;Shope et al., 2003;Williams, 2003;. Alcohol can play a duel role in unlicensed driving: both as a motivation to join peers in unregulated environments and lowering of inhibitions to drive unlicensed (Bingham et al., 2008;Fell et al., 2009). The use of restraints is well documented as proven safety measure for reducing RTI in vehicles (Phebo & Dellinger, 1998;Garc\u00eda-Espa\u00f1a et al., 2012). Addressing these two specific health risk behaviors individually and together among young people can serve to minimize the risk of RTI for all youth (Waylen & McKenna, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Where do crashes involving YUDs occur", "text": "Geographic distribution. Across the studies, the geographic distribution of crashes has been measured on the individual (Article III) and area levels (Articles I and II). In Sweden, crashes clustered in individuals living in rural areas. As well, crashes with severe RTI involving YUDs in rural were more common in all areas below metropolitan designations. In the US on the area level, a concentration of crashes involving YUDs were found in regions (Article I) and divisions (Article II) in those sections of the country that tend to be least densely populated, more youthful population, without public transport, more poverty, and similar geographic patterns to all driver crashes (Baker et al., 1987;Clark & Cushing, 1999: Gonzales et al., 2005. The individual findings from Sweden and those on the area level in the US suggest a pivotal but preliminary role in unlicensed driving on geographical differences. The more complicated task is to identify the specific area influences that differentiate outcomes beyond the geographic designations, as crashes involving YUDs are relatively infrequent. To study crashes of unlicensed drivers would require a large area to incorporate enough events to assess risks. The size of the area also needs to be sensitive to encompass both the daily living and travel zones of young people without being too large (Noland & Quddus, 2004;Imai & Mansfield, 2008). It was necessary in the studies to aggregate smaller somewhat more meaningful areas into larger units, sacrificing some specific daily patterns. Examples include individual states were aggregated into four regions (Article I), rural counties were aggregated into nine divisions (Article II), and multiple urbanicity levels were aggregated into five levels (Article III)."}, {"section_title": "Material Deprivation.", "text": "In considering all counties together, there was a positive association between material deprivation and a county-level fatal crash involving a YUD. Material deprivation possibly contributes to a void in community and parent support (Voas & Kelley-Baker, 2008), opening opportunities for unlicensed driving and other health risk behaviors from enhanced peer influence (Abdalla et al., 1997;Voas & Kelley-Baker, 2008). Material deprivation can contribute obstacles to safe driving that include driving conditions (Fleury et al., 2010) and less crashworthy vehicles (Laflamme & Vaez, 2007) as well barriers to licensing that include demographic profiles (Braver, 2001) and reduced opportunities to practice driving and obtain a timely license (Berg et al., 1999). To a lesser degree in Article II, the interaction of material deprivation and urbanicity were associated with reduced odds for a fatal crash only in suburban counties compared to urban counties. A partial explanation is that outlying suburban counties where public transport is limited and services are spread out over greater distances, enough so young people are more likely to obtain a timely license and affluent enough to have access to a car (Trowbridge & McDonald, 2008;McDonald & Trowbridge, 2009). Anecdotally rural youth have a greater need and opportunity to drive with or without a license as compared to urban youth (Blatt & Furman, 1998;Peek-Asa et al., 2010). Whether or not this is true, highlights one of the challenges in examining area differences in identifying area-specific driving practices. The evidence is clear that that there are differences in unlicensed driving and severity of RTI at differing levels of urbanicity lacking specific determinants at this time. Some settings face special challenges such as those with high deprivation and rural remote areas for unlicensed driving (Blackman et al., 2008;Males, 2009). This will be important for consideration for future resource allocation and developing area-specific countermeasures (McDowell et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Strengths.", "text": "The thesis was able to provide insights into unlicensed driving from the context of the three national crash studies in the US and Sweden. Fatal crashes derived from national registers are generally inclusive of all events providing comprehensive coverage of the studies. The ability to link multiple Swedish databases provided insights into the distribution of individual unlicensed drivers across socioeconomic groups as a valuable dimension. The studies included a variety of levels of area measures from counties, state, divisions, regions, to nationwide offering multiple perspectives and increasing the confidence in our findings. The studies also included a wide span of ages including prior to the age of eligibility to be licensed through early adulthood adding multiple developmental perspectives to the findings. Finally, the selfreport came from an on-going CDC national surveillance, deemed a valid and reliable tool that protects anonymity assuring the best possible responses (Eaton et al., 2012). Limitations. It was unclear whether the reported unlicensed driving practices and crashes were part of an incidental or a routine act that can change within, or across studies further limiting presumptions about individual practices. The studies are silent regarding area affect from traffic density and driving behaviors. The findings are further restricted to the absolute number of crashes due to the inability to identify unlicensed drivers in the general population. Both these may contribute to underestimating both crashes and driving of YUDs. Reliance on self-identified health risk behaviors can succumb to social desirability bias in reporting of illegal activities, leading to underestimation of unlicensed driving (Af W\u00e5hlberg, 2010). In Article IV, the responsibility of assigning driving group relied on one question. Any misinterpretation of that question could alter the allocation to driving groups of unlicensed drivers and ultimately raising or lowering the odds ratios depending on the response (Article IV). Crash data are limited by the accuracy and completeness of information collected by the reporting law enforcement . Crash data in Sweden is not exhaustive for crashes without serious injuries. Minor injuries were not a primary focus of Article III, not influencing the main findings. In the case of young and unlicensed drivers, the police may unintentionally assign greater crash culpability to YUDs, overestimating the assignment of crash circumstances (Williams & Shabanova, 2003). Both in the US and Sweden crash databases are limited in their capacity to assess alcohol and other drug use, underestimating the involvement on crashes of YUD (Hubicka et al., 2007). The crash studies sought an indication of the \"who\" and \"where\" of unlicensed driving that similar behaviors/groups/areas might benefit from the findings of young drivers. A focus on passenger cars, young people without a driving license, and in car dependent countries with formal licensing systems limiting the global generalizability."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH, POLICY AND PRACTICE", "text": "The current level of research, policy, and practice is not in proportion to the scope and public health impact of unlicensed driving. Unlicensed driving is a complex behavior requiring contributions from youth development, engineering, insurance, law enforcement, education, policy development, health care, traffic safety, and public health toward solutions. Emphasis in the short term should be placed on addressing crosscutting issues as license access, mobility, and health risk behaviors. Careful consideration should be applied that any solutions do not impact unequally on more disadvantaged youth.

Studies on RTC and self-reported health risk behaviors suggest that driving unlicensed among the young is a common health risk behavior, even past the age of eligibility of licensing. It is more frequent among males and some socio-demographic groups of young people. It is accompanied with other health risk behaviors and can be more prevalent is some area types. To address the issue will require multi-disciplinary targeted efforts to both discourage unlicensed driving and promote developmental opportunities with safe youth mobility options."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "First, to my fellow PhD students who turn first to the acknowledgements to see their name, I salute you all. Those that impacted my \"going\" experience at KI are too numerous to mention from recall. You know who you are, and I acknowledge you foremost. Thank you for welcoming a road traffic thesis to your global health agenda. Long distance education has not been easy, but the support from KI and IHCAR faculty and administrative staff made the process seamless. On the journey, I appreciated my halftime committee and the pre-defense seminar. I owe special appreciation to Klara Johannson, Lisa Blom, Netta Beer, and Berty Elling who were my eyes, ears, arms, and legs at KI in my absence. The members of the ISAC group are my heroes and source of encouragement. When I struggled, I was encouraged by an expression that was shared with me: \"if research were easy, everyone would be doing it.\" My family and children, Christina, Grace, and H\u00e4kkon (Hawk) who I am so proud of and inspire me; my Mom (M) and Dad (H) and in-laws Rosemary and Tom (RIP) whose support was appreciated; continuing gratitude to my brothers Mark and Matthew and their families; and the dance partner for the rest of my life---my dear wife Loretta who without question made the biggest sacrifices. This could not have been possible without my co-authors Dexter Taylor, Monique Sheppard, Marie Hasselberg, Jette M\u00f6ller, C. Raymond Bingham, Berty Elling, and Lucie Laflamme whose support and guidance through the publication process was priceless. Visiting Sweden and Stockholm has been a pleasure and a chance to get in touch with my Nordic roots. I enjoyed the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells, and the weather on occasion. My visits have been boosted by staying with Christina & Sten Noren as a home away from home and a great service to international students. Along the way, folks that include the EloQuents Toastmasters Club in Okemos; Michigan State University graduate writing group; friends and colleagues that include Barbara Marlenga, Takashi Nagata, Patrick Tobin, Alda Pires, and Peter Lindqvist have taken an interest. Finally, a special dedication to a fellow Toastmaster and bicyclist, Sue Maus, who was hit by a young driver while bike riding on September 9 of this year. Sue lost her leg---but not her spirit. Last, but not least Professor Lucie Laflamme, a supervisor with patience and persistence, who ALWAYS made the time and energy to guide me gracefully toward being an independent researcher/scientist. I hope my future contributions can equal the opportunity given to me. Your commitment to the KI, Department of Public Health Sciences, IHCAR, ISAC, students, travels, and global obligations speaks of your commitment to public health. Fellow students were envious of my supervision for which I always felt privileged. I wish you, Lars, and Catherine all the best from my family to yours. Peace."}]
