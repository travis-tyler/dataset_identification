[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the American Geological Institute (AGI) have been collecting data on recent PhDs in the geosciences for six years. Each year, letters are sent to Earth and space science departments requesting addresses of their recent PhD graduates. The graduates are then contacted directly and asked to answer questions about their education and employment specialties, information on efforts to find their first job, experiences in graduate school, as well as demographic information. The National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates reported a total of 749 PhDs in the Earth and space sciences in 2001. We sent surveys to 347 doctorates, of whom 223 responded, for a response rate of 64%. This report does not include new PhDs who left the US or those who earned their degrees from departments that do not have a geoscience term in their name. In 1996 and 1997, the data were collected as part of a multidisciplinary effort coordinated by the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology (CPST) and sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Since 1998, AGU and AGI have continued the effort with their own funds and included additional questions to provide a more complete picture of the graduates. This report draws on the results of the surveys of six PhD classes (1996 to 2001) in the Earth and space sciences as well as data from the NSF."}, {"section_title": "The Job Market", "text": "Over the last six years, a general improvement has been recorded in the job market through indicators such as time to find employment and starting salaries. As these indicators continue to improve, so too does the perception of the job market in general. This change in perception has been documented. In 1996, about three-fifths of the recent graduates felt that the job market was hopeless or bad, and only 6% felt it was good or excellent. By 2001, only one-fifth found the job market bad and 30% believed it was in good shape for geoscientists (see Figure 1). Over the past five years, the time to find employment has been decreasing steadily. In 1998, graduates spent an average of 5.5 months looking for a job. In 1999, the average was 4.7 months and by 2000, it was only 3.4 months. In 2001, the time spent seeking employment rose only slightly, to 3.6 months. Starting salaries for permanent employment have increased over the previous year's levels in all areas (postdoc salaries for 2000 and 2001 remained the same). Figure 2 shows the range of typical starting salaries by employer category (note the large salary range for government and non-profit sector). (Refer to Interestingly, important differences were noted in the emphasis placed on particular job-searching strategies utilized versus their effectiveness in finding a job. For example, although more than 61% of postdocs relied on their advisors for assistance during the search, only about a quarter of the group felt their advisors had played the most important role in the process (see Appendix, Figure Al). Academe is still the most popular employment sector for recent PhDs (see Table 1). More than half of all respondents work at universities. About one-sixth of the class of 2001 went to work in the industrial sector. Government employees make up another 24% of the working graduates. The increase in the percentage of those going into academic postdoc positions may reflect a tightened job market, especially considering the decrease in government postdoc employment (see Figure 3 and Table 1).  Respondents were asked to give their opinions on the extent to which they agreed with the above statements on a sca e of 1 to 5 where 1=Strongly Agree, 3=Agree, and 5=Strongly Disagree. The above data reflect the percentage of respondents who chose 1, 2, or 3. Graduates may be forced into postdoctoral positions when permanent employment is not available. As Table 2 shows, postdocs still find their work substantively rewarding, slightly more so than non-postdocs. Graduates are not limited to employment in the field of their doctoral dissertation. PhDs may find work in a different subfield, or in a field outside of the Earth and space sciences.  Respondents were asked to rate the degree to which they use the above skills and knowledge on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1=Extensively and 5=Not at all. Those who chose 1 or 2 are said to use that skill, while those who chose 4 or 5 are said not to use that skill. to choose all reasons that applied. The above list represents the five reasons cited most often. While the majority of respondents indicated that they used the skills learned in graduate school at work, there were substantive differences by employment sector. PhDs in industry are less likely than those in academe to use their knowledge of their dissertation field or their knowledge of principles that govern the physical world. Industrial PhDs are more likely to use cognitive skills but less likely to use technical skills than PhDs working at universities (see Table 3)."}, {"section_title": "The Graduate School Experience", "text": "The most recent graduates had a more positive experience in school than did graduates five years ago. Half of the PhD class of 1996 thought about dropping out regularly or constantly. In the class of 2001, only one-tenth reported that they had considered dropping out of their PhD program regularly or constantly. The vast majority considered it only occasionally or never. The most common reasons cited for considering dropping out of graduate school were financial worries, poor relationship with one's advisor, doubt about one's intellectual abilities, and family responsibilities. A poor job market was also a source of concern (see Table 4). When asked what they would change about their graduate school experience if they had it to do over, 32% said that they would change nothing. The changes suggested most frequently include taking more technical classes (25%), working in a different subfield (19%), working at a different institution (14%), and working with a different advisor (13%). Respondents were asked to rate how strongly they agreed with the phrase \"My advisor was helpful in my career planning,\" on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 represents \"extremely helpful,\" 3 is \"helpful,\" and 5 \"not at all helpful.\" Most (76%) respondents chose 1, 2, or 3. When asked similar questions about other sources of career support, 57% said that their scientific society was helpful, 49% agreed that their department was helpful, and only 34% found their university to be helpful."}, {"section_title": "Special Populations", "text": "There are several characteristics that are unique to PhDs in the geosciences. Unlike other physical science graduates, a significant number have been working full-time prior to earning their PhDs. Ten percent of geoscience graduates over the past six years started their current job more than one year before formally receiving their degrees. By way of comparison, new physics PhDs are half as likely as geoscience PhDs to have worked for one or more years prior to formally receiving their degrees. On average, these geoscience PhDs have been working for almost eight years by the time they finished their doctorates. This tendency for finding employment prior to completing a PhD appears to be a positive trend in several respects. First, the majority of graduates in the geosciences incur little debt related to their education. Two-thirds accumulated no debt and only 11% owed more than $20,000. Second, PhDs employed while in school tend to have full-time salaries that are 37% higher than their counterparts finding initial employment after graduation. They are nine years older and start graduate school four years later on average than those who do not work, giving them the opportunity for more work experience. Of those working full-time at least one year prior to earning their PhDs, almost half (40%) were employed in government, while 13% were in industry ( see Table 5). The PhDs who were government employees while in school are concentrated in federal agencies, particularly the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Over this six year period, there were no discernible annual differences among those working prior to earning a PhD in the distribution across employment sectors. Differences in employment subfield are also apparent for this group. Recent graduates employed prior to graduation are heavily concentrated in solid earth geology (30%) followed by atmospheric sciences (17%), hydrology and environmental science (13%), and oceanography (11%). (see Appendix, Table A2 for a breakdown of subfields by category.)   Figure 4). These older graduates differ from younger PhDs in several respects. Those over 40 are concentrated in chemical earth science employment subfields (especially volcanology and geochemistry) and they are much less likely to take postdoctoral appointments. Of those who had been employed more than one year before finishing school, one-third were over 40. Another distinctive characteristic of Earth and space science graduates is the length of time they spend in school and length of time they wait to begin graduate school. In 2001, the average time between earning a bachelor's and starting the graduate program from which they earned this PhD was 5.2 years. Almost a third (29%) of the graduates enter a PhD program less than two years after earning a bachelor's (see Figure 5). According to National Science Foundation data, because of the amount of time Earth and space science PhDs wait to begin school, coupled with employment for some during periods of graduate work, Earth and space science students allow the most time to lapse (10 years) between earning their undergraduate degrees and their PhDs (see Figure 6). 10 or more years 5.9 9 1'; EST COPY AVAIIIIABILIE Although many PhD students in the Earth and space sciences are delaying entry into graduate programs, the amount of time spent earning a doctorate does not vary by how long one waits (see Table 6). "}, {"section_title": "Men", "text": "Survey of Earned Doctorates, which showed 31.5% for 2001 (see Figure 7). While this is not comparable to the proportion of women in the general population, it is among the higher of the scientific disciplines in granting PhDs (see Figure 8). Only the life sciences and chemistry produce a higher proportion of female science PhDs than the Earth and space sciences. Computer science, physics, and engineering have the lowest concentrations of women, with 16% or less each. The women who graduated with a PhD in 2001 reported employment characteristics similar to those of their male colleagues, with no substantial gender differences for any of the items we surveyed. Average salaries are not significantly different. The amount of time reported to finish school and to find a job were virtually identical for both sexes. This equity in employment characteristics is encouraging news for current female graduate students. The overall number of female graduates has increased from 19% in 1990 to almost 32% in 2001.  does not make sense given other factors. Twenty-two who have been working at their current job for more than one year were excluded from all salary analyses to restrict such results to starting salaries. Our focus is on initial employment in the US only.   Note: Respondents were asked to select all job search methods they used from a list of 11 choices. Figure Al shows the most common job search methods used, while Figure A2 shows the job search methods that respondents felt were most effective. \"Other\" includes newspaper advertisements, employment agencies, sending unsolicited vitae, receiving unsolicited offers, and mentors."}]
