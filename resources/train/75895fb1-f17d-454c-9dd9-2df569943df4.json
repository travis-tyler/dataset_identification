This program is designed to:\n\u2022 Empower members to make healthy behavior changes.\n\u2022 Establish future members' healthy behaviors and rewards.\n\u2022 Begin to integrate HRA data with providers for clinical decisions at or near the point of care.\n\u2022 Encourage members to take specific proactive steps in managing their own health and provide educational support.\n\u2022 Encourage providers to engage members in completion of the healthy behaviors by offering incentive payments.\nStarting in 2015, a small monthly contribution by the member may be required depending on family income, although there are no copayments for health care services and prescriptions under the plan. Some Wellness Plan members will contribute $5 per month, while Iowa Marketplace Choice Plan members will contribute $10 per month. Wellness Plan members with individual earnings less than 50 percent of the Federal Poverty Level ($5,835 per year for an individual, or $7,865 for a family of 2) will not have monthly contributions. IHAWP members who complete the wellness exam and the HRA will not be responsible for a monthly contribution.\nEarly survey results of IowaCare members who transitioned into IHAWP found that the vast majority (90%) were not aware that completing a wellness exam would be part of the program to have their contributions waived.\nMembers earning over 49% of the FPL are given a 30-day grace period after the enrollment year to complete the healthy behaviors in order to have the contribution waived. If members do not complete the behaviors after the grace period has ended, members will receive a billing statement and a request for a hardship exemption form. For members of the Wellness Plan, all unpaid contributions will be considered a debt owed to the State of Iowa but will not, however, result in termination from the Wellness Plan. If, at the time of reenrollment, the member does not reapply for or is no longer eligible for Medicaid coverage and has no claims for services after the last premium payment, the member's debt will be forgiven. For members in Marketplace Choice, unpaid contributions after 90 days result in the termination of the member's enrollment status. The member's outstanding contributions will be considered a collectable debt and subject to recovery. A member whose Marketplace Choice Plan benefits are terminated for nonpayment of monthly contributions must reapply for Medicaid coverage. The IME will permit the member to reapply at any time; however, the member's outstanding contribution payments will remain subject to recovery."}, {"section_title": "Health Risk Assessment", "text": "A health risk assessment (HRA) is a survey tool that can be used by members and providers to evaluate a member's health. IME has identified Assess My Health as one such tool, although providers can select their own tool if it asks similar questions. Assess My Health is an online form that takes members between 15 and 40 minutes to complete on the computer. Wellness Plan members who complete the assessment receive a one-page report and their provider is able to receive a report automatically. Members of the Marketplace Choice Plan also receive the report, but their provider does not automatically receive the report; Marketplace Choice Plan enrollees must share the report with their provider. HRA information can be used by providers to develop plans addressing member needs related to health risk determinants. The HRA could be completed online at any location, including the health care provider's office. Some clinics may have contacted patients to fill out the HRA over the phone, with the clinic inputting the data into the online system."}, {"section_title": "Provider Incentives", "text": "Providers also have incentives available to them, so that they encourage and support their patients in completing the wellness exam and HRA. Providers should be assisting members with the HRA before or during their wellness exam. For every Wellness Plan member who completes the HRA with the assistance of the provider, the provider will receive $25.00. The only HRA which qualifies for this incentive is the Assess My Health tool."}, {"section_title": "Further Behavior Incentives", "text": "Based on research indicating incentives can be used to change behavior, a program of incentives will be developed to encourage behavior change among enrollees.

Data for 2012 and 2013 include members enrolled in the Medicaid State Plan on the basis of income or disability, and IowaCare members. As of January 1, 2014, the IowaCare program was discontinued, so there are no IowaCare members in the 2014 data.

It is administered by the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise (IME). Members will have access to the Medicaid provider network established for this program.\nDepending on their county of residence, Wellness Plan members may be enrolled in one of three programs: fee-for-service, HMO, or Wellness Plan PCP.\nThe Marketplace Choice Plan provides coverage for adults aged 19-64 years and members enrolled via three methods: 1) approximately 6,700 people previously enrolled in IowaCare who had incomes from 101 to 133% FPL, 2) people who have been enrolled in Medicaid but due to increased income are now eligible for the Marketplace Choice Plan, and 3) those who have never been in a public insurance program but meet the income eligibility for Marketplace Choice (101-133% FPL)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison Group 1: Medicaid State Plan (Income Eligible)", "text": "Comparison Group 1 is composed of Medicaid State Plan members enrolled due to FPL between 0 and 66%.

It was for adults, not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, with incomes up to 200% FPL. IowaCare enrollees were distributed in three places following the elimination of this program: 1) those with incomes 101-133% FPL were enrolled into Marketplace Choice, 2) those with incomes 0-100% FPL were enrolled in Wellness Plan, and 3) those whose income could not be verified were not enrolled in any program."}, {"section_title": "Assigning Medicaid Plan Members to Programs", "text": "Before proceeding with analyses, we assigned Medicaid plan members to 1 of the 5 groups described above. For the expansion population, we assigned plan members to either the Iowa Wellness Plan or the Marketplace Choice Plan. We assigned other individuals to 1 of the 3 comparison groups which included income-eligible Medicaid State Plan members, disability-eligible Medicaid State Plan members, and IowaCare members.\nWe attributed individuals to a program if they were enrolled in that program for at least 6 months during the year. Because individuals can move into and out of Medicaid programs for various reasons, we created a churn variable to identify instances when a member changed programs from one month to the next or experienced a gap in coverage. We then aggregated the monthly data to the annual level and counted the number of these transitions in enrollment, as shown in Figure 1 .\nTo ensure that program assignment resulted in mutually exclusive groups, we required that members never enrolled in another program or experienced a gap in coverage during the year (in addition to the minimum 6 month enrollment criterion). We were not comfortable assigning individuals who moved between programs or experienced gaps in coverage to any particular program. However, we also wanted to avoid simply dropping these data from our analyses. Therefore, we examine the group of individuals experiencing churn separately."}, {"section_title": "Page 7", "text": "Return to TOC We also included a group of individuals from any of these programs who experienced any churn or gaps in coverage as a distinct group. This measure (completion of wellness exam) was derived using Medicaid claims data, as these were the only data available for all programs (Department of Human Services is only tracking completion of wellness exams among the Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice Plan members). As baselines for comparison, these analyses uses data from 2012 and 2013 in addition to the 2014 data. T-tests were used to compare the means between program pairs, and all differences were statistically significant at p<0.001.\nSecond, we examined the completion rate for health risk assessments among the Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice Plan members in 2014. We also included a group of individuals who were enrolled for 6 months in the Wellness Plan and/or 6 months in the Marketplace Choice plan, but who experienced any churn or gaps in coverage. Because three different data sources were available, we report the completion rates using each measure available to us. These included data collected by 3M/ TREO Solutions (under contract to the state), records maintained by the Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS), and Medicaid claims.\nThird, we examined the rate of completing both activities (wellness exam AND health risk assessment) among the Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice plan members in 2014. We also included a group of individuals who were enrolled for 6 months in the Wellness Plan and/or 6 months in the Marketplace Choice plan, but who experienced any churn or gaps in coverage. This outcome is important as completion of both activities is required to avoid being charged a monthly premium. Because the state will be using DHS records to make premium and disenrollment determinations, we rely on these DHS records for wellness exam and health risk assessment completion in constructing this outcome."}, {"section_title": "Bivariate Analyses", "text": "Fourth, we separately explored the demographics of Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice plan members in 2014, stratifying them on the basis of whether or not they had completed their HRA, wellness exam, or both. Specifically, we included analyses of age, gender, race/ethnicity, metropolitan area of residence, number of emergency department visits, number of prescription drugs, and number of chronic conditions. We used rural-urban continuum codes (RUCCs) to categorize members' county of residence as either metropolitan, non-metropolitan urban, or non-metropolitan rural."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Analyses", "text": "Finally, we ran a series of logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice plan members completing an HRA, wellness exam, or both during CY 2014. Specifically, we modeled each of these outcomes as a function of age, gender, race/ethnicity, metropolitan area of residence, number of moves during the year, number of emergency department visits, number of prescriptions, number of chronic conditions, and number of months with full Medicaid coverage (which could range from 6 to 12 months).\nDepending on the year, between 7% and 10.5% of our sample moved during the year as shown in Figure 2 . When individuals relocate for any reason, it is likely to be a disruptive event. Therefore, we include a variable in our models that indicates the number of times a member moved to a different county in Iowa during the year.

However, to date, no additional healthy behaviors or incentives have been identified beyond the completion of the wellness exam and the health risk assessment. Since completion of both activities is required to avoid being charged premiums, we modified this part of the evaluation to instead determine the proportion of WP/MPC members who completed both activities (wellness exam and HRA). The following results are organized by the questions and hypotheses as outlined in the original evaluation proposal. Descriptive statistics for our populations of interest who had either 6 months of exclusive enrollment in either the Iowa Wellness Plan or the Marketplace Choice Plan are shown in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\nOf the 131 clinics in the sample, 52 clinics were interviewed. After removing ineligible clinics, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR; https://www.aapor.org/ ) response rate was 49%, with a 71% cooperation rate. AAPOR sets the industry and academic standards for calculating response rates for surveys and polls. Table 7 illustrates responding and non-responding locations. No statistically significant differences were found in the number of well visits or HRA completed between those clinics that completed the interview and those that did not. The completion of HRA by clinics ranged from zero to 54. Of the 131 clinics sampled, 109 clinics completed zero Health Risk Assessments, accounting for an average of less than one (0.9) completed HRA per clinic. Of the 22 clinics that completed at least one HRA, the average was 5.5. The clinic sample excluded clinics who had four or fewer completed wellness exams, so the number of completed wellness exams at each clinic ranged from five to 221, accounting for a 21.5 average across the 131 clinic sample. A total of 52 interviews were completed and sorted into three groups based on the completeness and accuracy of clinic manager responses. One interview was excluded from analysis, since the clinic only provided obstetrics services. The remaining 51 interviews were categorized based on the content of the respondent's narratives.\nAccording the Medicaid administrative data, 61.8% had completed an HRA at some time during their enrollment and 56.6% had completed a well visit at some time during their enrollment. We wanted to ensure that we were interviewing enrollees who had completed the healthy behaviors and those that had not. From the respondents 26.3% had only completed the HRA, 21.1% had only completed a well visit, 35.5% had completed both the well visit and the HRA, and 17.1% had completed neither healthy behavior. Based on the Medicaid administrative data, 76.3% of the interviewed enrollees were in the Iowa Wellness Plan (IWP) and 23.7% were in Marketplace Choice (MPC).\nNote for the results below, the study ID is included after the respondents' quotes."}, {"section_title": "Question 1 Which activities do members complete?", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 1 .1", "text": "The proportion of Wellness Plan (WP) and Marketplace Choice (MPC) members who complete a wellness exam is greater than the proportion of Medicaid State Plan (MSP) or IowaCare members."}, {"section_title": "Measure 1 Proportion of members who had a preventive care visit", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Protocol-NCQA HEDIS AAP", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source-Administrative", "text": "Analyses-Means tests between WP/MPC members and three comparison groups before and after implementation\nWe were able to document the proportion of members completing a wellness exam both pre and post using Medicaid claims data. This allows us to compare trends among the 3 comparison groups with the first year of data available for Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice Plan members. As Figure 3 shows, our hypothesis 1.1 is partially supported. Therefore, row percentages will not sum to 1, but column percentages (e.g., for race) will (with differences due to rounding). Compared to individuals living in non-metropolitan urban areas, individuals in metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan rural areas had higher odds of completing an HRA, and the effects were larger among Wellness Plan members than Marketplace Choice members. In the Wellness Plan, residents of metropolitan areas had 67% higher odds of completing their HRA, while those in non-metropolitan rural areas had 14% higher odds of completing their HRA, compared to those in non-metropolitan urban areas. In the Marketplace Choice Plan, residents of metropolitan areas had 21% higher odds of completing their HRA compared to those in non-metropolitan urban areas. The number of times an individual moved from one county to another was not a significant predictor of HRA completion among Marketplace Choice Plan members, but each move was associated with a 13% reduction in the odds of completing an HRA among Wellness Plan members, suggesting that relocation may be especially disruptive among those with extremely low incomes.\nThe proxy variables for health status include the number of annual emergency room visits, the average number of monthly prescription drugs taken, and the number of chronic health conditions. We find that each additional emergency room visit is associated with 6% lower odds of completing an HRA for Wellness Plan members and 9% lower odds for Marketplace Choice Plan members. By contrast, each additional prescription drug is associated with a 12% increase in the odds of completing an HRA among both Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice Plan members, and each additional chronic condition is associated with a 7% increase in the odds of completing an HRA among Wellness Plan members and a 10% increase in the odds among Marketplace Choice Plan members. Taken together, this suggests that individuals who have more frequent interactions with the healthcare system (as evidenced by having more chronic conditions and more prescriptions) will have more opportunities to be prompted to complete their HRA, while those who are more reliant on the emergency room for their care are not getting their HRA as often because they are more likely to be receiving fragmented care as opposed to patient-centered care.\nFinally, we find that each additional month of coverage (beyond the 6 month minimum required for inclusion in our sample) is associated with 29% higher odds of completing an HRA for Wellness Plan members and 27% higher odds of completing an HRA for Marketplace Choice Plan members. This is as expected, given that the more time a person has to complete the activity, the more likely they are to complete it."}, {"section_title": "Page 15", "text": "Return to TOC Compared to individuals living in non-metropolitan urban areas, individuals in metropolitan areas had higher odds of completing a Wellness Exam, and the effects were larger among Wellness Plan members than Marketplace Choice members.

In the Marketplace Choice Plan, residents of metropolitan areas had 10% higher odds of completing their Wellness Exam compared to those in non-metropolitan urban areas. There was no difference between individuals living in urban versus rural non-metropolitan areas. The number of times an individual moved from one county to another was not a significant predictor of Wellness Exam completion among Marketplace Choice Plan members, but each move was associated with a 7% reduction in the odds of completing a Wellness Exam among Wellness Plan members, suggesting that just as was observed for the HRA, relocation may be especially disruptive among those with extremely low incomes.\nThe proxy variables for health status include the number of annual emergency room visits, the average number of monthly prescription drugs taken, and the number of chronic health conditions. We find that each additional emergency room visit is associated with 7% lower odds of completing a Wellness Exam for Wellness Plan members and 8% lower odds for Marketplace Choice Plan members. By contrast, each additional prescription drug is associated with a 12% and 11% increase in the odds of completing a Wellness Exam among Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice Plan members respectively, and each additional chronic condition is associated with a 10% increase in the odds of completing a Wellness Exam among members of both plans. These results are very similar to those for the HRA model, and again suggest that individuals who have more frequent interactions with the healthcare system (as evidenced by having more chronic conditions and more prescriptions) will have more opportunities to be prompted to complete their Wellness Exam, while those who are more reliant on the emergency room for their care are not getting their Wellness Exam because they are more likely to be receiving fragmented care as opposed to patient-centered care.\nFinally, we find that each additional month of coverage (beyond the 6 month minimum required for inclusion in our sample) is associated with 27% higher odds of completing a Wellness Exam for Wellness Plan members and 29% higher odds of completing a Wellness Exam for Marketplace Choice Plan members. This is as expected, given that the more time a person has to complete the activity, the more likely they are to complete it. Table 6 presents the results of the logistic regression models predicting completion of both the Wellness Exam and the Health Risk Assessment. Overall, with the exception of a major difference by gender, the results are fairly consistent between Wellness Plan members and Marketplace Choice Plan members. In both plans, each additional year of age was associated with 3% greater odds of completing both activities. Interestingly, although men were less likely to complete their HRA or their Wellness Exam when modeled separately, we find here that men in the Wellness Plan have 3% greater odds of completing both activities compared to women, while men in the Marketplace Choice Plan have 32% lower odds of completing both activities compared to women. Among Wellness Plan members, non-white race was associated with between 13 and 20% lower odds of completing both activities relative to whites. In the Marketplace Choice Plan, the only significant racial difference was seen among Hispanics, who had 29% lower odds of completing both activities compared to whites.\nCompared to individuals living in non-metropolitan urban areas, individuals in metropolitan areas had higher odds of completing both activities, and the effects were larger among Wellness Plan members than Marketplace Choice members. In the Wellness Plan, residents of metropolitan areas had 53% higher odds of completing both activities, compared to those in non-metropolitan urban areas. In the Marketplace Choice Plan, residents of metropolitan areas had 18% higher odds of completing both activities compared to those in non-metropolitan urban areas. In the Wellness Plan only, individuals living in rural non-metropolitan areas had 19% greater odds of completing both activities compared to those living in urban non-metropolitan areas. The number of times an individual moved from one county to another was not a significant predictor of completing both activities among Marketplace Choice Plan members, but each move was associated with a 16% reduction in the odds of completing both activities among Wellness Plan members. This figure is more than double the figures for completing either one of the activities separately, suggesting that the disruption of relocation makes it especially difficult to complete both activities in a year.\nThe proxy variables for health status include the number of annual emergency room visits, the average number of monthly prescription drugs taken, and the number of chronic health conditions. We find that each additional emergency room visit is associated with 9% lower odds of completing both activities for Wellness Plan members and 11% lower odds for Marketplace Choice Plan members. By contrast, each additional prescription drug is associated with a 10% and 11% increase in the odds of completing both activities among Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice Plan members respectively, and each additional chronic condition is associated with a 9% increase in the odds of completing both activities among members of both plans. These results are very similar to those for the other two models, further indicating that individuals who have more frequent interactions with the healthcare system (as evidenced by having more chronic conditions and more prescriptions) will have more opportunities to be prompted to complete both their Wellness Exam and HRA, while those who are more reliant on the emergency room for their care are not completing these activities because they are more likely to be receiving fragmented care as opposed to patient-centered care.\nFinally, we find that each additional month of coverage (beyond the 6 month minimum required for inclusion in our sample) is associated with 37% higher odds of completing both activities for Wellness Plan members and 42% higher odds of completing both activities for Marketplace Choice Plan members. Given findings from the prior two models that more time enrolled translates to a greater likelihood of completing each of the activities, it is to be expected that completing both activities will benefit from a greater length of enrollment in the program.

After informal discussions with health care providers, we determined that health care providers are often removed from the billing and logistic practices of clinics. Frequently providers are not aware of type of insurance a patient has. Clinic managers were identified as the people who most likely understand the programs and insurance of patients. Managers are often responsible for clinic processes as well. Through research we have conducted on clinic systems to encourage immunizations, we knew that clinic managers are very easy to access and willing to participate in surveys and interviews. The final change in this evaluation activity was related to the analysis. In the proposal, we had indicated that we would be using Grounded Theory for the analysis.

In response to this question, four of the 19 most knowledgeable clinic managers reported no barriers. Eight clinic managers reported being unable to collect information from IHAWP members who lacked material resources like transportation, computers, internet access, or phones, resulting in low participation rates.\nClinic managers reported several factors that discouraged patients from completing the HRA, such as low health literacy, time commitment, lack of awareness, and low interest. One clinic manager reported, \"they are often, um, not informed...They aren't aware, you know, they haven't even heard of it, um, I know we have an employee here that never received information on it. Um. And many of them don't have their own, um, computer\u2026.We haven't had that many participate, unfortunately.\" [143] Another clinic manager said, \"I do think the risk assessment is way too long\u2026 When they start doin' it themselves they get sick of it and stop.\" [123] Three clinic managers reported complications in tracking and linking HRA information, one said, \"We were having troubles getting logged on to the system. And therefore the patients were not actually getting attached to our clinic, they were having to use that MBR11. Um, which was the code that they were to apply to use on the health risk assessment.

These interviews were not used to answer the research questions and hypotheses proposed in the evaluation plan, but do provide us with some valuable information about program implementation. We collapsed Groups 2 and 3 and identified the following themes. These respondents were not aware of the expanded definitions for well visits. A few of the respondents indicated that their billing staff might be more knowledgeable about these issues. One manager stated, \"Like I said, I'm not sure if our insurance would know that either.

When asked if the clinic manager was aware of HBI, the person said that had not received any information, but their patients told them about it. When asked if she had received any information she said, \"Yeah, not that I'm aware of, that they were doin' this, um, but just patients callin' and sayin' that, oh I have a wellness exam, blah, blah, blah.\" [216] . Another manager indicated, \"'cuz I think, if anything, we were, who were we talking to? We just had a meeting and I remember that coming up. Because somebody mentioned something. Um. Maybe it was a patient.\" [111] Some clinic managers mentioned that they had very few patients who were insured through IHAWP; therefore they did not know much about the program. A few clinic managers indicated that they did not believe any of their IHAWP patients paid contributions, so they did not believe this program applied to them. When the interview explained the HBI program and asked if the program sounded familiar one clinic manager said no and explained \"But let me tell you the reason why, to us, it probably doesn't apply too much. We, they, they don't pay a premium, our patient population\u2026. they don't pay any type of premium\u2026they don't pay copays or anything like that.\" [169] One clinic manager insisted they had not signed up to participate in the HBI and would not sign up in the future.

After a manager indicated that he/she did not know about the HBI, the interviewer provided a brief description, and the managers response was \"Does this one stay around or is that one wiped off the map too when Medicaid has, you know, has it, it's already selected four, um insurances to, er managed care organizations or whatever.\" [127] Outreach to patients about program Although these managers did not understand enough about the HBI to be included in the findings above, there were still outreach efforts done by clinics that might lead to the completion of a wellness exam. These respondents did indicate some efforts to do outreach to their patients about well-exams but these efforts were not because they were conscious of the program and wanted to encourage participation, but because it was standard practice to do some type of reminder (call, letter, and postcard) for all patients."}, {"section_title": "Communication with Medicaid/IME/DHS", "text": "The majority of these clinic managers reported that their communication with Medicaid/IME/ DHS was positive.

In addition, results from the clinic manager interviews suggested that there was a general lack of awareness about the program, so we believed that it was important to talk to more members to find those who are very aware of the program. Note: There were no expanded healthy behaviors in the program, so we could not ask about completion of these.\nThe sample was drawn from IHWAP enrollees whose ages were 19-64 as of August 14, 2015 with a valid telephone number and mailing address, who had been in the program at least 6 months. The sample was pulled in four groups: those who had completed only the HRA, those who had completed only the wellness exam, those who had completed both, and those who had not completed either. Each group was drawn to have an equal number of enrollees who identified as being black, Hispanic and white. Each group also contained roughly equal numbers of men and women.\" We oversampled for enrollees who identified as black or Hispanic in order to ensure that we had completed interviews from the most diverse sample possible.\nA team of nine interviewers completed a training session to ensure adequate familiarity with the HBI program, the IHAWP, informed consent procedures, and the interview script. HIPPA training was also completed by all interviewers. Interviewers were trained to use neutral, non-leading language and prepared prompts when interacting with interviewees. To promote consistent interviewing styles across members of the team, interviewers were required to practice and record mock interviews. Interviewers were evaluated and given feedback about their performance from the project manager. This process was repeated as needed until the project manager approved each interviewer to make telephone calls to enrollees.\nA total of 468 IHWAP enrollees were sent a letter explaining the study and inviting the enrollee to participate. The letter included the telephone number on record for the enrollee and a tear-off form for enrollees to send back to provide us their current/preferred phone number where they could be reached. A business reply envelope was also included for the enrollee to return the form at no cost. Trained interviewers called the sample in a random order. No more than 10 attempts were made to each enrollee. The attempts were made on rotating times and days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and 12 to 5 p.m. on Sunday. The interviews ranged between 5 and 51 minutes. Microsoft Access software was used to track and document call disposition (see Table 8 )\nThe interview script included all elements of consent in the introduction. Enrollees were offered a $25 gift card to their choice of Wal-Mart, Target, or Casey's for completing the interview. A language interpreting service, CyraCom, specializing in interpretation and translation of healthcare related contexts was used for non-English speaking enrollees. Additionally, one of the interviewers, a native Spanish speaker, conducted 5 interviews in Spanish. All interviews were recorded and transcribed.\nA total of 152 interviews were completed for a response rate of 46%. Of the 152 interviews, 85 were women and 76 were men. Their ages ranged from 19 to 64 based on ages calculated from birth dates available in the Medicaid claims data (M= 41.84, SD = 13.51). Thirty-six percent of the respondents were categorized at 0% FPL, 8.6% at 1-50% FPL, 51%-100% was 30.3%, 21.1% were in 101%-133%, and 3.9% were over 134% FPL. According to Medicaid claims data 36.8% identified as white, 32.9% as African American/Black, and 30.3% as Hispanic. We looked for differences between those that responded and those that did not. There were no statistically significant differences between the respondent and non-respondents related to percent federal poverty level, number of well visits completed as determined by Medicaid claims data, no difference between the groups in whether the enrollees were from Marketplace Choice or Iowa Wellness Plan. There were also no differences in race/ethnicity between the respondents and nonrespondents. Respondents were more likely to have completed an HRA as measured by the HBI dataset from 3M. The mean age of respondents (M = 41.84, SD = 13.51) was slightly older than the mean age of non-respondents (M = 37.72 years, SD= 13.41). Non-respondents were more likely to be male.

Coded content from these three interviews were then compared across individual coders to ensure a common understanding of the parameters outlined in the code definitions. The codebook was further refined and additional training of coders was completed before each individual member of the coding team was approved to continue coding new transcripts.

Nineteen MPC members and 86 IWP reported never receiving an invoice for monthly premiums/contributions or did not believe they had. Thirty of these interviewees stated that they did not know why they did not received an invoice or bill for monthly premiums or contributions, nineteen stated it was due to their low income, and sixteen stated it was because of the insurance plan they were covered by.

Eighteen interviewees enrolled in the Marketplace Choice and 76 interviewees enrolled in the Iowa Wellness Plan responded that it was important or beneficial to have a way to avoid paying monthly premiums with many stating their belief was due to financial constraints.

Well it took, like, three or four months to get the approval.\n[1013]\n\u2022 They only changed a few of my meds 'cuz they wanted generics instead of names\u2026 And I'm a diabetic so they were more into the auto inject pens than they were into the vials of insulin. So that was the only thing that was different from anything else I've ever had.\n[1072]\n\u2022 The only problem that I really have with the insurance is I live in a small town so a lot of the, like if you need something major done. You cannot find it in this town, you have to travel. Then you come, you get to the point where, well how in the heck am I gonna get two and a half hours away? That's about the only complaint that I have is because people don't know that they. That they assist you with that. And if they do assist you with that, it's like they expect you to pay outta pocket, they reimburse you, I really don't know how it works, but.\n[2050]\n\u2022 I had to find a new doctor\u2026Only downside is how long you have to wait for someone to get back to you.

First, there is the challenge of identifying and assigning individuals to the correct coverage group. While we used a minimum enrollment period of 6 months as an eligibility criterion, this does mean that we exclude individuals who got enrolled later in the year or who otherwise had less than 6 months in at least one program. As the program continues, this should become less problematic, unless disenrollment causes it to be a perennial issue. For now, however, it does raise a question about the generalizability of our findings to the programs as a whole. Second, there is the challenge of data sources. We were able to identify wellness exams using DHS records as well as Medicaid claims. However, these data are often in disagreement. At the same time, we were able to identify HRA completion using DHS records, 3M/ TREO Solutions records, and Medicaid claims. Again, these data are often in disagreement. To the extent that completion of these activities is a metric of program success, the data source used will yield different results of how successful (or unsuccessful) the program is. Generally, we find that DHS records, which are being used to make determinations around exemption from monthly premiums, and subsequent disenrollment decisions, are the most generous measure. However, it is concerning that these records indicate completion of activities that cannot be confirmed by either Medicaid claims or by the very firm contracted by the state to collect these data (3M/TREO Solutions). Finally, our logistic regression models are limited by the fact that there may be unobserved factors that differ between individuals, for which we are unable to adequately adjust our models. This may bias our results. However, the direction and magnitude of any such bias cannot be well predicted.\nThe qualitative data and analysis also had some limitations. First because few clinic staff or enrollees were aware of the Healthy Behaviors Program, it was difficult to assess awareness and knowledge of the program. Second, because there have been and continue to be many different programs associated with Medicaid, for example IowaCare, Integrated Health Home, the Medicaid Health Home it was clear that clinic managers were confusing other programs with the Healthy Behavior Program. This confusion made it difficult for interviewers to tease out actual knowledge and experience related to the Healthy Behaviors Program separate from other programs. Many enrollees also had experience and knowledge of other programs. It was difficult to ensure that the experiences they were reporting on were experiences related to the Healthy Behaviors Program and not experiences they had under other Medicaid programs."}, {"section_title": "Future Evaluation Activities", "text": "Projecting ahead to the next 12 months, this evaluation will evolve as the Medicaid Modernization happens. We will continue the proposed evaluation, assuming that we will continue to have timely access to data. Below are the evaluation reports for the next year and amendment's we will be making to the evaluation activities in response to program changes.\nClaims based outcomes report June 30 2016 will be completed on time assuming we continue to have timely access to data.\nProvider survey report July 31 2016 will be modified. We will not conduct a survey with providers because the findings from the current report indicate that providers will not have enough knowledge to generate accurate data about the program through a survey. Additionally, Medicaid Modernization will be occurring at the same time the survey would be fielded. This transition would likely influence the data gathered and present bias that we could not account for. As an alternative to a provider survey we are proposing in-depth telephone interviews with representative from the Medicaid MCOs. These interviews would document the MCOs plans related to the Healthy Behaviors program and identify how this information is communicated to enrollees and providers. The data gathered will provide a baseline for understanding systems level program components and challenges.\nOther healthy behaviors completion report Nov 31, 2016 will not be completed. Because no additional behaviors were selected for the program during the previous program years, we do not have data to complete this report. Interviews with representatives from the MCOs will provide us with information about what other behaviors will be in incorporated and we can plan data collections and analysis based on those MCO specific behaviors.\nACO interviews report Dec 31, 2016 will be completed. We will be interviewing ACO representatives about the program. Based on the clinic manager interviews, ACO were key in decision making about how the program was promoted.\nDisenrollment interviews report Jan 31 2017 will be completed and modified from the original proposal. The original proposal assumed disenrollment would begin after the first group of enrollees failed to complete their healthy behaviors and pay their premiums. This process was not in place until late 2015. Assuming we receive disenrollment and bad debt data in early spring 2016, we will begin in-depth interviews in late summer 2016. The interviews will assess knowledge of disenrollment, the path disenrolled individuals took to become re-enrolled, find other health care coverage or remain uninsured and how health care needs were/are being addressed. Based on initial interview findings we will work with DHS to determine if a disenrollment survey is feasible.\nEnrollee survey was scheduled to be developed from the in-depth interviews and fielded early 2016. Because Medicaid Modernization was scheduled to happen January 1, 2016, we had postponed the survey. Fielding a survey during the transition time would have created confusion for enrollees and contributed to unreliable survey data. Following the delayed start of Medicaid Modernization, we will be fielding the survey when enrollees/members have been assigned/selected their MCO. This survey will be a baseline for an MCO-specific Healthy Behaviors Program."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The HBI program is designed to encourage enrollees to take an active part in maintaining their health and to promote accountability among enrollees, but the combination of a general lack of awareness and understanding about the program at the enrollee and provider level have stunted the program's ability to achieve significant participation in the first phase. The number of members who have completed either the wellness exam or the HRA is suboptimal. More efforts need to be directed at increasing awareness about the program. Clinic managers demonstrated very limited awareness and knowledge of the program. While some larger organizations or ACOs may be encouraging the completion of the behaviors at an organization level, clinic staff needs to be more aware of the program in order to encourage the completion of the behaviors and answer questions members may have. Enrollees and clinic managers pointed to specific instances when the clinic staff assisted the enrollee in completing one of the behaviors. Specific efforts should target member populations that are less likely to complete the behaviors. These populations include younger members, men, nonwhites, members with less interactions with the health care system and those that have been enrolled in the program for fewer months. These populations might have limited exposure to the information about HBI through clinics. It is also not clear how much of the lack of awareness about the program is related to general confusion about health insurance coverage, what it is called, and how it works. There was also confusion about what a premium or contribution is compared to a co-pay and a bill from a health care provider. Many members reported little access to health insurance or interaction with the health care community before enrolling in IHWAP, this lack of experience might be related to difficulties understanding the program. In addition to increasing awareness about the program, barriers such as scheduling, health care providers not accepting insurance, access to the internet/ computer, and time prevent members who know about the program from actually completing the behaviors. In general enrollees had positive perceptions of getting a wellness exam and completing an HRA. There was a consensus that these activities would improve health. While clinic managers report that the communication with IME is positive, clinics may also require more detailed information about how the HRA can be integrated into patient-provider communication, medical care, and treatment plans. Additionally the incentives for health care providers to encourage their patients to complete the behaviors are not well understood by clinic managers. Clinic managers also indicated that there is confusion about the various Medicaid programs and concern about additional changes in future."}]
