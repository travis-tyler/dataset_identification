Despite a large number of sequences being available, it is still not clear how fast the virus mutates and if the mutations impact its virulence in the context of the growing pandemic. In addition, very little information is available regarding the clinical proteome of the virus. Until recently, only a few proteins, mainly including structural proteins N and S have been identified from clinical swabs. Besides, host proteome studies from clinical samples are necessary to fill the void in understanding the host response to viral infection.\nIn this study, genomic analysis of COVID-19 was performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) on swab samples of Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive individuals, collected from Bangalore, India. Variant analysis of these samples showed a high mutation rate, with \u226511 mutations observed per sample. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences with other variants from India as well as across the world revealed their close relation to one of the Bangladesh isolates, which had showed European origin. SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny indicated the prevalence of isolates showing multiple origins within a country. Overall, through genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, our study highlighted increasing variations (SNPs) in the viral genome and their role to understand its evolution and virulence.\nIn addition to sequencing the genome by NGS, our study also explored the COVID-19 clinical proteome and host-protein responses by using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We performed HRMS on swab samples of both RT-PCR positive and negative patients. In total, we identified 41 peptides matching to 13 different COVID-19 proteins, including proteins from ORF1ab polyprotein, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a, ORF9b and Nucleocapsid. Additionally, the host proteomic analysis revealed significant differences between RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR .
