Thus, age and gender each have a significant impact on the cardiac response to exhaustive upright cycle exercise.\ngender; cardiovascular performance THE CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSE to aerobic exercise is influenced by many factors, including the nature of the exercise stimulus itself (5,20,22); the posture in which exercise is performed (23); and constitutional variables such as age (19, 21,24, 27, 36), gender (13, 21,34, 36), fitness level (13), and cardiovascular health (10, 26). Although there is general agreement that women have lower peak exercise capacity than men even after adjustment for body size (9, 15), considerable uncertainty persists concerning the effect of gender on ventricular volumes, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and derived hemodynamic variables during exercise. Much of this uncertainty may arise from differences in the populations studied, including varying age ranges, exercise habits, and prevalence of undetected cardiac disease.\nPrior studies across limited age ranges have found a 890 lesser augmentation of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) from rest to peak exercise in women than in men (1, 14, 17) . Recently, Spina et al. (32) demonstrated that women, in contrast to men, did not increase their stroke volume in response to exercise training. This finding suggests that the mechanisms for enhancement of cardiac performance during aerobic exercise may differ between the sexes. However, the impact of age on any such gender differences in cardiac performance is unknown. The present investigation was designed to examine gender differences in the LV responses to peak upright cycle exercise, with use of radionuclide ventriculography, in a large group of healthy community-dwelling volunteers carefully screened to exclude latent coronary artery disease. Because a major goal was to determine whether age differentially modified the physiological response to exercise in males and females, we enrolled individuals across a broad age range. To minimize the confounding effects of widely varying exercise habits across age and between sexes, we excluded subjects who regularly engaged in endurance training activities (~3 times/wk) and whose peak aerobic capacity exceeded our normal age-adjusted mean values by >l SD. Finally, multivariate analyses were performed to assess the independent contributions of age, gender, and work capacity on exercise hemodynamics. large manually drawn region of interest and was corrected for background activity with the use of a region of interest drawn lateral and inferior to the LV in the end-systolic frame. Attenuation correction was determined individually in each subject by the use of an opposed static view to measure the attenuation distance from a chest wall marker to the count center of the LV, assuming that the linear at,tenuation coefficient was equal to that of water. A blood sample was drawn at the end of exercise, counted with the same camera-collimator system used for the scintigraphic study, and corrected for time delay between the scintigram and the counting of the blood sample. In a subset of 26 subjects, venous hematocrit, measured at rest and at peak effort, increased only minimally with exercise (1.7 t 1.2%), and this change was unrelated to age in both men and women. LV end-diastolic volume was obtained from the ratio of the attenuation-corrected end-diastolic count rate from the gated study to the count rate per milliliter from the sample of venous blood drawn 5-10 min after the completion of exercise. EF was calculated by a semiautomated algorithm after background subtraction. index (SWI); EF; cardiac index (CI); and total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR). Additional characteristics, i.e., peak cycle work rate, treadmill maximal oxygen consumption at peak effort <VO, max>, weight, body mass index, and 24-h urinary creatinine excretion (an index of muscle mass; 11) were also regressed across age in each of the sexes. Age-gender interactions were examined by covariance analysis. Physical activity habits for nine aerobic and semiaerobic activities were derived from a detailed activity questionnaire and were summed and expressed as total minutes per day. The nine activities included brisk walking, running, swimming, bicycling, tennis, golf, sit-ups, vigorous calisthenics, and weight lifting. Total minutes per day spent on these activities was regressed on age for each sex and was also examined as a determinant of exercise hemodynamic parameters in multivariate analyses."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "To examine the effect of gender on the hemodynamic response to progressive effort, we also compared young men (aged <40 yr) with young women and older men (aged >60 yr) with older women across relative work rates by repeatedmeasures analysis of variance.

One hundred twenty-one men and 79 women fulfilled the screening criteria and had technically adequate rest and exercise gated blood pool cardiac studies. Both sexes were broadly distributed across age (men: 22-85 yr, mean 51.2 5 16.8 yr; women: 22-86 yr, mean 48.0 t 16.9 yr). Average weight and body surface area were greater in men than in women (80.7 2 12.5 vs. 63.6 t 9.9 kg and 1.98 2 0.17 vs. 1.69 t 0.14 m2, respectively; each P < 0.0001). Although body weight declined 10% (r = -0.21, P < 0.02) and surface area declined 7% (r = -0.26, P < 0.01) over the six age decades in men, neither variable was significantly related to age in women. Total body muscle mass, as indexed by 24-h urinary creatinine excretion, was greater in men than in women (1,501 t 355 vs 925 + 212 mg; P < 0.0001) and declined with -age in'both sexes (men: r = -0.27, P < 0.01; women:\n---0.46, P < 0.002). Similarly, v02max was also higher in men than women (35.8 t 8.7 vs. 28.9 t 6.3 ml l kg-' l min-'; P < 0.0002) and declined with age in both groups (men: r = -0.57, P < 0.0001; women: r = * Significant gender differences (P < 0.05) for specific age decades after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.\n-0.67, P < O.OOOl>, as shown in Table 1 . In all individuals, VOZ max was within 1 SD of the sex-specific limits for each age decade derived from a prior BLSA study (7). Total ph ysical activity time per day was nearly identical in men and women (34.0 t 4.8 and 37.3 ? 4.0 min./day, respectively) and declined weakly but nonsignificantly with age in both men (r = -0.16, P = 0.14)\nand women (r = -0.22, P = 0.09). Thus, physical activity was well maintained with age in this population. No age-gender interactions were observed for any of these variables.\nExercise hemodynamics at peak effort. Age regressions and mean values of hemodynamic variables at peak effort are listed in Table 2 . Per decade plots of these variables are shown in Figs. l-3. Peak HR declined -25% across the age span in both sexes (Fig.  lA) . Although DBP and MBP at exhaustion increased significantly with age in both sexes (data not shown), peak SBP (Fig. 1B) increased with age only in women. All arterial pressures were higher in men than women by covariance analyses. CI at exhaustion decreased with age in both sexes by -25% across the age span (Fig. 1C ). TSVR at exhaustion (Fig. 10 ) rose significantly with age in both sexes, although the increase was steeper in women than in men (56 vs. 30%). A 35% age-associated augmentation of EDVI over the six decades was observed in men but not in women at peak effort (Fig. 2B ). ESVI at peak effort with age in both sexes nearly tripled in men and doubled in women across the six decades. However, SVI was maintained across age in both sexes. EF (Fig.  3A) and SBP/ESVI (Fig. 3B ) demonstrated a similar age-associated blunting in both sexes. SW1 rose 19% with age in men but not women (Table 2 ) and was higher in men than women across decades (Fig. 3C) . Concordance between age regressions (Table 2) and per decade analyses (Figs. l-3) was generally quite strong. Resting hemodynamics.

CI 6). In younger individuals, HR increased more steeply (Fig. 1C) declined 16% from the third through eighth across work rates in men than in women (Fig. 5A) .

CI Resting EDVI, ESVI, and SVI ( Fig. 2A) increased (Fig. 5E ), cardiac volume indexes (Fig. 6A> , and EF and -20% across age decades in men but not in women, TSVR (data not shown) were similar in young men and resulting in gender differences in resting EDVI and women across relative degrees of effort. Young men ESVI that were most prominent in later decades. Rest-demonstrated a steeper increase in SBP/ESVI and a ing indexes of LV systolic pump performance are shown in Fig. 3 . EF was not age related in either sex but was consistently higher in women across age decades (Fig.  3A) . SBPESVI, an index of myocardial contractility, increased 37% with age in women but did not change in men (Fig. 3B) , whereas SW1 showed an age-associated augmentation in both sexes (Fig. 3C) .\nPeak cycle exercise capacity. As anticipated, the peak work rate achieved during upright cycle exercise was higher in men than in women (148.6 t 36.5 vs. 101.9 + 27 4 W* P < 0.0001) and declined significantly with -age in both sexes (men: r = -0.65, P < 0.0001; women: r= -0.68, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A ). The decline averaged -36% in men and 42% in women across the six decades. After normalizing peak work rate for body weight, the age decline was still present (men: r = -0.55, P < 0.0001; women: r = -0.61, P < 0.OOO.l; Fig.   4B ). The ratio of peak cycle work rate in watts to VO larger SW1 across progressive work rates than did their female counterparts (data not shown).\nThe comparison of men and women >60 yr differed in some respects from the results seen in younger subjects. HR (Fig. 5B ) was higher across relative work rates in older women, and SBP (Fig. 50 ) rose more rapidly in older men. All cardiac volume indexes (Fig.  6B ) averaged 5-10 ml/m2 higher in older men than women across these relative work rates, maintaining their tendency for larger volumes observed at rest. Neither EF nor SBP/ESVI responses (data not shown) differed statistically between sexes with progressive exercise. Older men demonstrated larger CI (Fig. 5F ) and more pronounced reductions in TSVR than did older women with progressive effort. SW1 was significantly higher across work rates in older men due to their greater SBP and SVI responses (data not shown).\nFigures 2 and 6 and Table 2 indicate that, with advancing age, men make greater use of the Frank-Starling mechanism than women do both at rest and during exercise. To further illustrate this point, SVI was plotted as a function of EDVI in younger and older men and women at rest and across common external work rates. In subjects <40 yr old (Fig. 7A) , this relationship followed a nearly identical pattern in both sexes. For individuals >60 yr old (Fig. 7B) , however, it is evident at rest and for any given work rate that the data points for men lie upward and rightward to those for women. Furthermore, a comparison of Fig. 7, A and B, plotted with identical axis scales, indicates that the coordinates for older women during exercise resemble those for both younger groups, whereas those for older men lie upward and rightward of the other three groups. Thus, whether examined across relative effort levels or fixed external work rates, older men utilize the FrankStarling relationship to a greater extent than do older women, which is a gender difference not present in young adults.\nCardiovascular reserve. To assess cardiovascular reserve, i.e., the ability to augment cardiovascular performance from resting levels in men and women, we performed regression analysis on the change in each hemodynamic variable between seated rest and peak effort (Fig. 8) . HR reserve (Fig. 8A ) declined with age in both sexes, but the rate of decline was greater in men than in women. Blood pressure reserve was not age related in either sex but was greater in men than in women across the age span (data not shown). EF (Fig. 8C) , SBP/ESVI (data not shown), and CI (Fig. So) reserve and the reduction in ESVI from the resting level (Fig.  8B) were blunted with age in both sexes, with men demonstrating greater EF, SBP/ESVI, CI, and ESVI reserve (i.e., greater reduction in ESVI) at any age. SVI (Fig. 8B), SW1 (Fig. 8E) , and TSVR (Fig. 8F) reserve were unrelated to age; however, SW1 reserve was higher in men than in women across age. EDVI reserve (Fig. 8B) is similar in men and women, with each sex augmenting EDVI almost 2 ml/decade from rest to peak effort. Thus, the gender differences in the absolute EDVI-age relationship at peak exercise (Table 2 and Fig. 2 ) and in the SVI vs. EDVI relationship in Fig. 7B are attributable to a greater resting heart size in older men than in women. It is also noteworthy that the ageassociated increase in TSVR at peak exercise (Fig. 10 ) was abolished in both sexes when expressed as the change from rest (Fig. 8F) .\nMultivariate determinants of resting and exercise hemodynamics. To examine the independent effects of age, gender, and exercise capacity (i.e., peak cycle work rate achieved) on hemodynamic responses at rest and during exercise, multiple regression analyses were performed using the entire sample. The multivariate analysis generally confirmed the results of the prior univariate analyses.\nResting. When gender and age were controlled, greater exercise capacity was associated with lower resting HR and borderline higher resting EDVI and borderline lower resting SBP/ESVI (Table 3) . After adjusting for exercise capacity and gender, resting HR declined with age, whereas SBP, EDVI, SVI, SW1 and TSVR showed age-associated increases. After controlling for exercise capacity and age, women demonstrated lower resting SBP and MBP but higher EF than did men. Significant age-gender interactions were present for EDVI and ESVI, consistent with larger resting cardiac volumes in older men than in older women. Age-gender interactions were also found for SBP/ESVI, CI, and TSVR. When total physical activity time was substituted for cycle exercise capacity in the model, no resting hemodynamic variable was significantly related to this variable, independent of age and gender. Peak effort. At peak effort (Table 3) , after controlling for gender and age, greater exercise capacity was associated with higher peak HR, SBP, SVI, CI, and SW1 and a lower TSVR. When the effects of gender and exercise capacity were controlled for, the effect of age on hemodynamics during exercise was more striking than that at rest. Thus, exercise blood pressures, SVI, and SW1 all showed age-associated augmentation, whereas HR, EF, and SBPESVI declined with age. At maximum effort, after controlling for age and peak workload, men demonstrated lower HR and CI but higher blood pressures than did women. Age-gender interactions were observed for EDVI, ESVI, and TSVR, paralleling those seen at rest. As observed at rest, total physical activity time was not a significant determinant of any peak exercise hemodynamic variable, independent of age and gender. Results similar to those of the multivariate analysis were obtained in an additional analysis (data not shown) in which hemodynamic variables were compared at rest and peak effort in men and women matched for age and peak achieved cycle work rate. To examine whether the age-associated increase in peak exercise EDVI in men but not women was related to gender differences in the relationship between peak HR and EDVI, we performed a multiple regression analysis to determine the effect of HR on EDVI, independent of age in both sexes. In men, peak HR correlated inversely with EDVI (r = -0.40; P = 0.02); in women, however, peak HR was not related to EDVI.\nEstrogen status as a determinant of rest and exercise hemodynamics. To determine whether supplemental estrogen administration might alter the hemodynamic response to exercise, we compared the six premenopausal women receiving oral contraceptives with their age peers not taking these drugs. No differences in hemodynamics between the two groups were observed at rest, at peak effort, or in cardiovascular reserve (all P > 0.2). Similarly, the 10 women ~60 yr receiving estrogen replacement therapy were compared with their unmedicated age peers. At rest and at peak effort, all hemodynamics variables were similar in the two groups. Only the change in ESVI from rest to peak effort differed between groups, decreasing 5.9 t 3.5 ml/ m2 in unsupplemented women vs. 1.0 t 4.2 ml/m2 in estrogen users (P < 0.02)."}, {"section_title": "AGE CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSE TO EXERCISE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The major findings in these carefully screened men and women of a broad age range were as follows. 1) Both sexes demonstrated parallel declines in peak cycle work rate with age, although men had higher exercise capacity than women did across the age spectrum even after normalization for body weight. 2) Men but not women experienced age-associated increases in cardiac volumes at rest, across relative work rates, and at exhaustion. 3) Peak pump performance, whether defined by CI, EF, or SBPESVI, declined similarly with age in both sexes; however, SVI at exhaustion was not age related. Neither the administration of exogenous estrogens nor the level of daily caloric expenditure on physical activity appeared to have a significant influence on these hemodynamic findings. 4) Cardiovascular reserve declined at similar rates with age in men and women except HR reserve, which declined more rapidly in men.\nThe recent availability of accurate noninvasive methods for measuring LV performance has allowed gender differences in resting and exercise hemodynamics to be probed. Early studies using exercise radionuclide ventriculography were limited to the determination of EF and qualitative wall motion (3, 4). Several laboratories have subsequently shown that cardiac volumes can be accurately measured during vigorous exercise with this technique (6, 3 1, 36) . The radionuclide methodology used in the current study avoids geometric assumptions regarding ventricular shape and calculates an individualized attenuation coefficient for each subject (18).\nOur laboratory (18) and others (31,33,36) have validated cardiac volumes from this technique with those from cardiac catheterization at rest and during exercise. Although the correlations of radionuclide and catheterization LV volumes has been very high in these studies (r 2 0.9), standard errors of the estimates (SEE) were generally large. For example SEE for ESV in our laboratory was 33 ml between these techniques; however, when individuals with regional wall motion abnormalities were excluded, as was done in the present study, SEE was reduced to only 11 ml. As suggested by Rabinovitch et al. (25), count-based radionuclide measurement of LV volumes are probably best suited for group analyses and cases in which an individual serves as his or her own control, which are the uses employed in our study. Nevertheless, any factor that introduced a systematic error related to age or gender in these radionuclide measurements of LV volumes could bias the results. Our laboratory has found similar high correlations of radionuclide and catheterization LV volumes in men and women across an age range of 25 -76 yr (18). Furthermore, exercise-induced hemoconcentration, a possible source of error in calculating cardiac volumes during exercise, was minimal and was unrelated to age or gender. Finally, it must be emphasized that even the \"gold\" standard of catheterizationderived cardiac volumes has significant technical limitations and variability. Prior radionuclide studies have shown minimal gender differences in resting hemodynamics (1, 14, 34), although gender differences with aging, i.e., age-gender interactions, were not specifically examined. In the present study a prominent gender difference observed at seated rest was that EDVI and SVI increase with age in men but not women. As resting HR declined with age in part to women's higher resting HR. Furthermore, the in both sexes, the augmented WI in older men pre-HR reserve (Fig. 8A ) declined less steeply with age for vented an age-associated decline in resting CI, whereas women than for men.

The accentu-ma1 work rates is illustrated by their higher cardiac ated HR response across relative exercise levels in volumes values in Figs. 6 and 7. In comparing Fig. 7, women suggests a specific effect of gender on HR due A and B, it is noteworthy that these EDVI and SVI At exhaustive effort, just as at rest in our study, EDVI increased with age in men but not in women. ESVI, however, increased with age in both sexes, and SVI was not age-related in either sex. There was no gender difference in peak exercise EF, which declined with age in a similar manner in both sexes. Younis et al. (36) observed age-associated increases in EDVI and ESVI and declines in EF, HR, and CI similar to our present results but found no gender difference except for a greater EF response in men. These results differ from those of Higginbotham et al. (14) , who observed a 30% increase in end-diastolic counts from rest to peak effort in a small sample of women aged 32-68 yr but no change in men of similar age during a peak upright cycle protocol similar to our own. They observed no gender difference in stroke counts because of a greater EF response of the men. However, a more recent study by these investigators in a larger cohort aged 20-70 yr revealed no gender difference in either LV volumes or EF at peak effort (34), which is similar to the present findings. A major difficulty in making such gender comparisons over a wide age range without considering age as a covariate is the complex interaction among age, gender, and fitness. In Fig. 7 , for example, EDVI and SW1 are similar in young men and women across fixed external workloads, whereas the older men have larger EDVI and SW1 than older women do. The higher EDVI in older than younger men may be mediated at least in part by the age-associated decline in peak HR. It is unclear from the current results why the predictable inverse relationship between HR and EDVI at exhaustion was observed in men but not in women.\nOur study demonstrated that women exhibit a higher resting EF than men do across the age span but a similar EF at peak effort. Thus, women displayed a lesser augmentation of EF from rest to peak effort than do men, consistent with several prior studies (1, 14, 17, 34). Our results extend this finding across a very broad age range in highly screened subjects, indicating that at any age the increase in EF reserve with exercise is lower in women. Because of the age-associated decline in EF augmentation in both sexes, this physiological finding has practical diagnostic implications: if a-normal exercise EF response is defined by an increase 15 points from rest, -50% of normal women >60 yr old but only -30% of older men will be misclassified as abnormal (7).\nOur finding of preserved SVI across age in both men and women at peak effort differs from the results of several prior studies using cycle (12, 16) viduals with silent coronary artery disease, which increases dramatically with age (8). Because these earlier studies used invasive dye dilution techniques to derive stroke volume, methodological differences may also account, in part, for the discrepancy between their findings and our own. In addition, no screening for physical conditioning status was employed in those prior studies. Deconditioning in some of their older subjects or inclusion of younger subjects with vigorous exercise habits might cause such a result, since deconditioning is associated with reduced blood volume and stroke volume as well as aerobic capacity, whereas endurance training has opposite effects.\nStudies using cardiac output estimates derived from regression equations (15) and acetylene rebreathing (2 1) during peak treadmill exercise have suggested ageassociated decreases in SVI in both sexes. Noteworthy differences between those studies and ours are their much higher peak HR, especially in the older subjects. The higher HR attained during treadmill than cycle exercise results in shorter diastolic filling periods, which when coupled with the greater orthostatic stress of walking vs. cycling might favor less use of the FrankStarling mechanism.\nThose studies also included very few subjects >70 yr, which could have limited their ability to detect age-associated cardiac dilatation during exercise.\nBecause the absolute level of any given hemodynamic variable during exercise is determined in part by the resting value for that variable, a useful concept for examining the hemodynamic response to exercise is that of cardiovascular reserve, i.e., the difference between the resting and peak exercise values. In the current study, a major blunting of HR reserve with age (-44% in men and 30% in women over 6 decades) was solely responsible for the age-associated decline in CI reserve, as the SVI reserve was unrelated to age; these aging changes in reserve function, as well as the ageassociated increases in ESVI and decline in EF, resembled those at peak effort. However, the EDVI response to exhaustive exercise, expressed as the change from rest, did not show a gender difference, as both sexes exhibited similar age-associated LV dilatation from rest to peak effort. Thus, the greater age-dependent use of the Frank-Starling mechanism (i.e., higher EDVI and SVI) in men than women at exhaustive effort is primarily due to the older men's greater use of this mechanism at rest. The age-associated increase in EDVI from rest to peak effort in both sexes may be a compensatory mechanism for the diminished ability of the older heart to empty as completely as its younger counterpart, as evidenced by the smaller exercise-induced reduction in ESVI and the resultant lesser augmentation of EF. This increase in EDVI allows SVI reserve and peak SVI to be successfully maintained across the adult age span, at least through the eighth decade. Whether this age difference in hemodynamics is due to reduced myocardial reserve or to increased impedance to ejection in older subjects (35) cannot be resolved from the present data. Both myocardial reserve and aortic impedance during exercise are modulated by ,0-adrenergic tone, which declines with age (35). However, the afterloadincorporating ratio of SBP to ESVI exhibited an ageassociated decline at peak effort and in reserve function virtually identical to that observed for EF, strongly suggesting that is due primarily the lesser emptying of the older heart to a reduction in contractile reserve. Although the present results in men share several similarities with our earlier results in a predominantly male population (27), certain important differences are evident. First, the decline in peak work rate with age in the present study (36% between ages 25 and 80 yr) is nearly twice the 2 1% decline noted previously (27). Paralleling these results, the present decline in peak CI of 27% between ages 25 and 80 yr was statistically significant, whereas the 16% reduction in cardiac output between these ages in the 61 subjects from our earlier study was not. However, the ratio between the age-associated reductions in exercise capacity and peak CI is consistent between these two studies. Furthermore, the men in the current study exhibited a hemodynamic profile of higher EDVI and ESVI and a nonsignificantly larger SVI with age coupled with a 1 beat/ yr decline in peak HR, closely resembling our earlier findings (27). Our previous study did not contain sufficient women to compare with men across age. However, examination of our earlier data at peak effort on 14 women suggests less augmentation of EF than in men, an observation confirmed by the current results. In summary, normative aging among sedentary healthy individuals of both sexes was associated with significant attenuation of peak aerobic capacity, HR, EF, and CI and in the reductions in ESVI and TSVR during exhaustive upright cycle exercise. SVI, however, was well maintained across age in both men and women. Older age and male sex were associated with higher blood pressure responses to peak as well as submaximal effort. EDVI increased with age only in men both at rest and at peak effort. The relationship between SVI and EDVI was shifted upward and rightward in older men at fixed external workloads, providing evidence of their greater utiliza tion of the Frank-Starling mechanism to enhance exercise cardiac performance. Worn sponse to exercise .en demonstrated a greater HR than men did across relative w reork rates as well as a less prominent age-associated reduction in HR reserve.\nWhen hemodynamics were expressed as the change from rest to peak effort, both sexes showed age-associated increases in EDVI and ESVI and reductions in EF, HR, and CI. However, the exercise-induced reduction in ESVI and the increase in EF, CI, and SW1 from rest were larger in men. These res for ults indicate gender augmenting cardiac differences i performance -n the mechanisms during upright ex---ercise, particularly in older subjects. "}]
