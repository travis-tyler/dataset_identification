[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition between healthy elderly people and alzheimer's disease (AD). At present, brain network analysis based on machine learning methods can help diagnose MCI. In this paper, the brain network is divided into several subnets based on the shortest path, and the feature vectors of each subnet are extracted and classified. In order to make full use of subnet information, this paper adopts integrated classification model for classification. Each base classification model can predict the classification of a subnet, and the classification results of all subnets are calculated as the classification results of brain network. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, a brain network of 66 people was constructed and a comparative experiment was carried out. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the integrated classification model proposed in this paper is 19% higher than that of SVM, which effectively improves the classification accuracy."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Mild cognitive disorder is a state between healthy elderly and Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive disorder can effectively reduce the conversion rate of Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of brain network can help [1] diagnose mild cognitive disorder .With the development of machine learning, machine learning classification algorithm is applied to the analysis of brain network. Using classification algorithm to classify brain network has become a new way to diagnose mild cognitive impairment.\nAt present, many researchers at home and abroad use machine learning method to analyze the brain network.In terms of measuring the similarity of brain networks, standards and others constructed a new sub network core to measure the similarity between brain networks, and applied it to the [2] classification of brain diseases .The sequential pattern proposed by Zhang Daoqiang can not only make full use of the weight information of the edge, but also explicitly simulate the ordinal relationship of the weighted edges in the brain connection network. The sequential pattern proposed by Zhang Daoqiang can not only make full use of the weight information of the edge, but also explicitly simulate the ordinal relationship of the weighted edges in the brain [3] connection network ; Liu Yu et al. Constructed the whole brain stratification for each experimental object Network, the brain is divided into 90, 54, 14 and 1 region. According to Pearson's correlation coefficient, connectivity between each pair of regions is calculated, and it is used as a classification feature. After dimensionality reduction, multi-core boost [4] algorithm is used for classification ."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH ON CLASSIFICATION METHOD \u0178 Division and characteristic calculation of subnets", "text": "Given a brain network data g (V, e), V is any node in the brain 0 network. The shortest path length from this node to all other nodes is calculated with this node as the starting point. The node with the shortest path length less than K between V0 is regarded as the node set of the subnet, and the edge related to these nodes in the original network is regarded as the edge set of the subnet.In order to use the traditional classification model to classify the brain network, this paper can extract the characteristics of the subnet, including the degree of nodes, the number of nodes and clustering coefficient as the classification feature vector. \u0178 Integrated classification model In this paper, an integrated classification model for subnet is constructed based on decision tree.For a given brain network data set {G , G ,..., G ,..., G }.First of all, GI is divided into 116 1 2 I M subnets, and M group of subnets are obtained. Each group of subnets contains 116 subnets.\nFrom each set of subnets, the same 40 subnets are randomly selected to get another m-set of subnets, each of which contains 40 subnets.\nFor the above m*40 subnet, the feature calculation and feature selection are carried out to get the n-vector data set.For any K , i we can get the sample set composed of M eigenvectors\nThe ith decision tree is constructed through the sample set Xi.Through the above process, 40 decision trees can be constructed and combined into an integrated classification model.\nAfter the integrated classification model is built, the model is tested through the test set.The classification accuracy rate is recorded as R, the classification accuracy rate of each decision tree is recorded as R , four decision trees with the I lowest prediction rate are selected as the elimination objects, and four subnets are selected from the rest subnets. Through the above process, the new decision tree and the original decision tree are combined into a new integrated classification model, and the test set is classified and predicted, and the classification accuracy rate is recorded as t.If R < T, replace the original model with the new one; if r > t, do not replace.Repeat the above process until the classification accuracy of the integrated model tends to be stable or meets the classification requirements."}, {"section_title": "VERIFICATION TEST \u0178 Experiment flow", "text": "The proposed classification method firstly divides the brain network into subnets and extracts the feature attributes (feature path length, degree of nodes, clustering coefficient or graph core) of the subnets, then uses the feature selection method to reduce the dimension, and finally uses the proposed integrated model to classify."}, {"section_title": "\u0178 Data acquisition", "text": "The experimental data in this chapter are also from the ADNI database.
