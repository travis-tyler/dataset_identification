[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Covid-19 is a highly contagious disease. A report published by the CDC in the US suggested that the median R0 value was 5.7 during the early outbreak in Wuhan, China (1). The first Covid-19 infection case was reported in the US in Jan 2020. Since late March, the total number of confirmed infections and mortalities in US has superseded other countries in the world.\nThe 1918 Spanish flu pandemic suggests that socio-economic factors can affect the mortality rate, though their effects on the infection rate is minimal. Although it is generally believed that the chance of getting an infectious disease and dying from it is equal across different socio-economic status (SES) groups (2) , epidemiological studies have suggested that the risks of mortality may be unevenly distributed across these groups (3, 4) . People having a lower SES in the States are more susceptible to Covid-19 infection due to much more limited access to preventive care and poorer living conditions. The pandemic is a new and highly contagious respiratory disease; no effective medical prevention/treatment is .

We hypothesize that at the beginning, a higher SES will suffer a higher infection rate due to the following reasons:\n1. People of a higher SES travel more: Surveys have unequivocally shown that the frequency of travel is correlated with income. A survey of 6 million people in 25 cities conducted by VISA group has confirmed that the fraction of people who undertake international flights increases with the increase in annual incomes, irrespective of age (5) .\nAnother survey by Ipsos has also found that the number of airline trips increases with an increase in annual household incomes in general (6).\n2. People of a higher SES would engage in more social contacts: Literature reveals that people of a higher SES generally are more inclined to engage in group activities (organized by churches or NGOs) and socialize with others. Saffer (2005) also finds that an increase in incomes generally increases the number of memberships of and visits to social organizations (7) . Brehm and Rahn (1997) 3. People of a higher SES tend to send their kids to travel/study in other states or countries;\nEvidence shows that students from a higher income family are more likely to study abroad. Open door survey finds that the majority (70%) of the US students studying abroad are white(12). Dessoff (2006) notes that for the working-class, sending their children to study abroad may seem an unreachable task (13) . Salisbury et al. (2008) finds that household income is an important factor determining whether students would choose to study abroad (14). A higher income also leads to a higher chance of enrolling in out-ofstate colleges. Curs and Singell (2002) finds that students from a well-off family tend to attend out-of-state colleges than those from a lower income family (15) . Perna and Titus (2004) finds that fewer low-SES high school students (5%) have enrolled in out-of-state institutions as compared to high-SES counterparts (31%) (16) .\n.

Previous studies have shown that SES could be linked to influenza infection and mortality in the US (3, 4) . Recent evidence in New York City suggests that people with a lower SES is more likely to get infected, though the correlation is relatively weak (23) . Some recent US news articles hypothesize that SES could affect Covid-19 infection (24) and/or mortality in the country (24, 25) . (24) .
