Knowledge of these inherent optical properties of phytoplankton is therefore a necessary requirement for models of light penetration , of light utilisation by phytoplankton (Dubinsky et al. 1986 , Sakshaug et al. 1989 , Smith et al. 1989 , and even of mixed-layer dynamics (Lewis et al. 1983 , Platt et al. 1984 , Kamykowski 1987 , Sathyendranath et al. 1991 . Bio-optical models for remote sensing of phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity of the oceans are also based on the optical properties of phytoplankton (Gordon & Morel 1983 , Sathyendranath & Morel 1983 , Platt 1986 , Sathyendranath & Platt 1989 . The biomass models are more sensitive to changes in the characteristics of spectral absorption by phytoplankton than to changes in their scattering characteristics (Gordon & Morel 1983) . Absorption by phytoplankton has therefore been the subject of many studies, and some of these studies have paid particular attention to separation of absorption by To identify the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at any wavelength A, it is common practice to express the total absorption coefficient a,@) in terms of a 'specific absorption coefficient ', a'(),) , and C, the concentration of chlorophyll a (chl a), which is the main pigment in phytoplankton:\nNote that phytoplankton absorption is due to absorption not just by the chl a but also by all the auxiliary pigments present. Therefore, a'()L) is not a true specific absorption by chl a, but only a n apparent one. The composition of the auxiliary pigments and the relative importance of their absorption are variable. This variability in pigment composition has been shown to b e 1 of the 2 important factors responsible for the observed variability in the magnitude and spectral form of a'(h) (Sathyendranath et al. 1987) , the other factor being the particle effect (also known as the 'flattening effect' or 'package effect'; see Duysens 1956 , Kirk 1975 , Morel & Bricaud 1981 . Indeed, the magnitude of a ' a t 440 nm has been shown to vary over a factor of 3 (Sathyendranath 1986) . The choice of chl a alone for normaliza-tion is dictated primarily on practical grounds -chl a is the pigment that is easiest to measure, and it is routinely measured on most biological oceanographic cruises. Its choice is also justifiable in primary production studies because of the central role it plays in photosynthesis. With recent technical developments, however, measurement of auxiliary pigments is becoming more common, and therefore it would be useful to develop techniques that would account, in a systematic manner, for the consequences of changes in pigment composition on phytoplankton absorption. To do this, we must rewrite Eq. (1) as:\nwhere C, is the concentration of the ith pigment, a@) is the 'true' specific absorption coefficient of the ith pigment, and n is the total number of pigments considered (note that chl a is one of the n pigments). To make use of Eq. ( 2 ) , we need not just the concentrations of the n pigments, but also their specific absorption coefficients.\nVery little is known about the in vivo, spectral, specific absorption coefficients of the major phytoplankton pigments. Bidigare et al. (1987) tried to account for the influence of auxiliary pigments, but in the absence of information on the in vivo specific absorption coefficients of the pigments, they were obliged to use the values for extracted pigments from a single culture (Mann & Myers 1968) . However, absorption by phytoplankton pigments is known to change with extraction; besides, estimates from a single culture can hardly be considered statistically valid for application to natural populations. Sathyendranath et al. (1987) tried to estimate the specific absorption coefficients of major phytoplankton pigments, after correction for the particle effect. But the multiple regression method they used did not yield acceptable values of the specific absorption coefficients because of non-zero covariance among the pigments in the sample set used.\nIn this paper we outline a method for the estimation of in vivo specific absorption coefficients of major phytoplankton pigments. We reanalyze the data of Sathyendranath et al. (1987) but, instead of using multiple regression, we have decomposed the spectra into Gaussian absorption bands. This method is statistically more valid, and is backed by theory as well. The results are based on in vivo spectra that have been corrected for the particle effect, and therefore the specific absorption spectra proposed are not influenced by cell size or intracellular concentration of the pigments. Also, the method is designed for separating absorption by active pigments from any background absorption that may be present. We used in vivo absorption spectra of 20 monospecific cultures that were selected to cover 3 major phytoplankton groups, and therefore we are able to discuss variations in the absorption characteristics between groups. Also, the method does separate successfully the absorptions due to the different pigments, and we show that the specific absorption bands proposed can be used to reconstruct the total absorption coefficient, provided the pigment concentrations are known."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Bio-optical data. In vivo absorption spectra, pigment concentrations (chl a, b, c and carotenoids), particle size distribution and cell numbers of 20 different cultures were taken from Sathyendranath et al. (1987) . Species in culture included 3 diatoms (Chaetoceros protuberans, Chaetoceros didyrnum, Skeletonema costatum), 4 Chlorophyceae (Dunaliella marina, Platymonas suecica, Platyrnonas sp., Tetraselmis maculata) and 2 Prymnesiophyceae (Hyrnenornonas elongata, Emiliana huxleyi), representing major pigment compositions commonly observed in the marine environment (Gieskes & Kraay 1986 ).\nThe spectrophotometer was designed with a scattered transmission accessory. It consisted of the sample and reference cells placed very close to the detector, with diffusing plates in front of them, to ensure capture of most of the forward scattered light. The absorption spectra were measured from 340 to 760 nm. The cell size for each culture was estimated from cell volume measurements, and expressed as the diameter of an equivalent sphere. Number of cells per unit volume was estimated with hemacytometers. To remove the effects of changes in cell size and intracellular pigment concentrations on absorption, all spectra were corrected for the particle effect (Duysens 1956 ). This effect is known to flatten the shape of absorption spectra of pigments embedded in particles, compared to that of homogeneous solution of the same pigments. More1 & Bricaud (1981) and Sathyendranath et al. (1987) have shown that this effect can lead to significant modifications in the absorption spectra of phytoplankton. We used the same algorithms as in Sathyendranath et al. (1987) , which assume spherical particles and uniform distribution of the absorbing material within the cells. Each absorption spectrum was then corrected for the value at 737 nm, as in Sathyendranath et al. (1987) .\nPigment concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically after extraction in 90 % acetone. Chl a was estimated using the equations of Lorenzen (1967) ; SCOR/UNESCO (1966) equations were used to calculate chl b and c, and the method of Richards & Thompson (1952) was used for carotenoids.\nDecomposition of absorption spectra. The absorption spectrum from 400 to 750 nm of photosynthetic organisms is characterized by a continuous envelope. reflecting a strong coupling in the transfer of energy between the plgment molecules (Forster 1965) . The continuous nature of the spectrum renders it difficult to estimate the contribution to the total absorption by each pigment species, unless the spectrum can be suitably decomposed.\nOne of the simplest theoretical models of absorption is that of Lorentz, which predicts the shape of absorption bands based on the assumption that electrons and ions can be treated as simple harmonic oscillators in an electromagnetic field (Bohren & Huffman 1983) . This model has been successfully applied to decompose the spectrum of the imaginary part of the refractive index of the alga Platymonas suecica (Bncaud & More1 1986 ). The Lorentz model, however, does not fully account for the effects of overlapping absorption bands and of strong, vibrational interaction between molecules (Knox 1963) , as is found in photosynthetic pigments. Toyozawa (1958) proposed a general formalism, which considers the strength of the electron-lattice coupling, for computation of the absorption coefficient. He concluded that, in the presence of a strong interaction between oscillators, an absorption band assumes a Gaussian shape, whereas if the transfer coupling is weak, the absorption tends toward a Lorentzian shape.\nEmpirical evidence on the decon~position of absorption spectra of chl a in solution (Cotton et al. 1974 , Shipman et al. 1976 , Katz et al. 1977 , and of chlorophyll-protein complexes (French et al. 1972 , Larkum & Barrett 1983 , also favours use of Gaussian curves for approximating the individual absorption bands of pigments.\nBased on these considerations, absorption spectra in the present study were decomposed using Gaussian curves. A curve-fitting program, initially described by French et al. (1967) , was slightly modified and adapted to the needs of this study. The input specifications for each absorption spectrum were as follows: (1) only Gaussian curves were used for the curve-fitting analysis; (2) no weighting of the data was done, i.e. all parts of the spectrum were treated as equally important; (3) the program was set u p to run a maximum of 20 iterations per spectrum; (4) the wavelength positions (band center) and the half bandwidths were not allowed to change by more than 1 nm per iteration.\nSince the spectra were corrected for particle effect, the spectral features were emphasized, facilitating initial estimation of the band parameters according to the presence of peaks and shoulders on the observed spectrum. In the initial runs, 8 absorption bands were specified, but it was observed that a better fit was achieved by adding 3 more bands: one at each extremity of the spectrum, and another at around 550 nm. Therefore, a total of 11 Gaussian curves was used to represent the absorption spectra. Further increases in the number of bands did not improve the fitting procedure significantly for most of the cultures. Table 1 summarizes the input parameters of the Gaussian curves. Wavelength positions and halfwidths (in nm) of the initial guesses were kept the same for all analyses, whereas the initial height of each band (in m-') was changed according to the biomass in each culture. . 1 shows the observed and estimated absorption spectra for 3 phytoplankton species from distinct taxonomic groups, together with the results of the decomposition program. In all cases, 20 iterations were sufficient to allow the convergence criterion (percentage d~fference in standard deviation between successive iterations of the curve fitting) to be < 0.1 \"h. Maximum deviation of the fitted curve from the observed spectrum was < 1 O/O of the band heights. Maxima of errors were in the 450 to 600 nm region of the spectrum and around 650 nm, which corresponds to absorption by accessory pigments. Table 2 indicates the average positions and the halfwidths of the 11 Gaussian curves estimated for the 3 algal groups. The peak positions changed little compared to the initial inputs. The halfwidths, however, changed by a s much as 19 nm during the computation. Analyses of variances were applied to each of the bands to detect any trends in the variations of the Gaussian parameters (Table 3 ). In almost all cases, the parameters of different algal groups differed more from each other than did the individual values within any one group. In other words, the null hypothesis that the Wave l e n g t h (nm) Fig. 1 .

Each error curve is magnified by a number (indicated in the panel) to avoid changing the ordinate scale. A larger magnification implies a better fit (Table 3 ) showed a significant difference between groups in its position (p < 0.05) and in its halfwidth (p < 0.01). A multiple-range test (Tukey, p < 0.05) tended to differentiate the position of this band for the Chlorophyceae from that for the Prymnesiophyceae, whereas the position for diatoms did not seem to be statistically different from that of the other 2 groups. On the other hand, the diatoms had a substantially narrower band than the other 2 groups (Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Fig", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "W a v e l e n g t h (nm) ( c )", "text": "Gaussian Bands 2 and 3 were centered at 412 and 435 nm respectively. The analysis of variance on the position of these bands (Table 3) did not suggest any difference between the groups of algae. The halfwidths were, however, slightly different (p < 0.05) between diatoms (18.8 and 29.3 nm) and Chlorophyceae (23.3 and 34.7 nm). The Prymnesiophyceae had intermediate halfwidth values of 21.7 and 32.4 nm for Bands 2 and 3, respectively, which tended to be similar to those of both the other groups.\nThe parameters of Band 4 were statistically very different between the groups of phytoplankton species. The position of this band was 460.9 nm for diatoms, which was significantly different from 463.6 nm, the position observed for the Chlorophyceae. The Prymnesiophyceae had a n intermediate value of 462.1 nm, not different from that of the other 2 groups. The halfwidth of Band 4 varied very strongly between species, being larger by a factor of 1.7 for Chlorophyceae compared with the other 2 groups ( Table 2) .\nGaussian Band 5 was centered at 490 nm and this position did not seem to b e influenced by taxonomic group. Its halfwidth, however, varied significantly between the algal groups, with the diatoms having a slightly larger band (53.6 nm) than the Chlorophyceae and the Prymnesiophyceae (41.3 and 41.2 nm respectively). Gaussian Bands 6 and 7 were located in the region of minimum light absorption by phytoplankton cells. They were centered at 529.7 and 579.9 nm respectively for both the Chlorophyceae and the Prymnesiophyceae, whereas the diatoms tended to absorb a t a longer wavelength in both cases (536.3 and 586.2 nm for Bands 6 and 7 respectively). The statistical analysis on the halfwldths suggested a different behavior of these bands between groups. Indeed, each of the 3 algal groups presented a significantly different halfwidth for Band 6, ranging from 44.5 to 47.4 nm ( Table 2) . On the other hand, Band 7 was significantly narrower for diatoms (43.3 nm) than for the other 2 groups (48.7 nm on average).\nNo difference between groups was observed in the position of Gaussian Band 8 , centered at 623.5 nm. This band had a small peak but was proportionately very broad. As with the previous band, its halfwidth was significantly narrower for the diatoms (26.0 nm) than for the other 2 groups (40.4 and 38.5 nm for Chlorophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae respectively).\nThe parameters of the absorbing Bands 9 and 10 showed significant differences between the groups of algae. Band 9 was centered at 643.5 nm on average for the diatoms and for the Prymnesiophyceae, which is 10 nm less than the position for the Chlorophyceae (654.9 nm). The halfwidths were significantly different for each of the 3 groups, varying from 20.8 nm to 37.1 nm ( Table 2) . The difference in the position of Band 10 was not so large. Diatoms presented a peak absorption at 674.1 nm, which differed from the corresponding peak in the other groups by only 4 nm. The halfwidth was narrower for Chlorophyceae than for the other 2 groups (Table 2) .\nFinally, the last absorbing component of the spectra "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Previous studies using curve decomposition methods were concerned mainly with the absorption properties of the chlorophylls in the red part of the spectrum. The results showed the complexity of the pigment system in algae a n d higher plants, in which the absorption maximum of chlorophyll at 670 to 680 nm could be the result of 6, 10 or even more absorbing components (Katz et al. 1977 and references therein) . A more simplistic view of the light-harvesting system in algae, such as the one presented here, has the advantage of ease of use in ecological applications such as estimation of the optical properties of natural phytoplankton communities and their variation in time and space. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the present model and the associated statistical data must b e tested on some physiological basis."}, {"section_title": "Biological interpretation of Gaussian bands", "text": "The first band has a maximum absorption in the UV range of the spectrum. Physiologically, such a strongly absorbing band is likely to include several components, starting with the absorption by the particulate material itself (i.e., the non-photosynthetic pigments). The absorption spectra of natural communities of phytoplankton, after pigment extraction, often display a monotonous increase from the red to the blue regions of the light spectrum (&shin0 et al. 1984) , similar to the absorption spectra of detritus or yellow substances. Also, some recent studies (Yentsch & Phinney 1989) have demonstrated the presence of mycosporine-like UV-absorbing pigments in significant amounts within several algal species commonly found in the marine environment.\nGaussian Bands 2, 3, 8 and 10 with their maxima at 412, 435, 623 and 675 nm respectively correspond to in vivo absorption by chl a. Goedheer (1970) observed that the in vivo absorption spectrum of the brown benthic alga Laminaria digitata had chl a peaks at 418, 437, 618 a n d 673 nm. Similarly, the absorption spectrum of P700-chla-protein complex from Glenodinium sp. (Prezelin 1980) showed peaks and shoulders at 419, 437, 618 and 675 nm. Owens & Wold (1986) found that the presence of chl a in different pigment-protein complexes was indicated by absorption at 418, 440 and 670 to 678 nm. The statistical analysis of our data suggests less significant differences between groups for these bands, in agreement with the ubiquitous properties of chl a m autotrophic organisms. Band 10 represents a particular case in the sense that, for the diatoms, the chl a absorption in the red seems to be shifted significantly to a shorter wavelength (674 nm) than for the other 2 groups (678 nm). Such a difference can b e explained by a variation between groups of algae in the ratio of the photosystem I (PSI) to the photosystem 11 (PSII). The red absorption band of photosynthetic reaction center PSII occurs at shorter wavelengths (670 to 675 nm) when compared with the position of the absorption band associated with the PSI reaction center (677 to 680 nm) (Larkum & Barrett 1983). A change in the ratio of PSI to PSII should then induce a slight variation in the wavelength position of the chl a absorption maximum. Falkowski et al. (1981) observed a PSI:PSII ratio of ca 1 for the Chlorophyceae, whereas the ratio was found to be only 0.44 in diatoms. The red absorption maximum of chl a for diatoms would then be shifted to shorter wavelengths compared with Chlorophyceae. It is also very likely that this ratio may vary in response to other factors, such as environmental light conditions (Melis & Brown 1980 , Owens 1986 ).\nThe parameters of Bands 4 and 9 correspond to the absorption characteristics of other groups of chlorophylls, particularly chl b for Chlorophyceae and chl c for diatoms and Pryrnnesiophyceae. The 2 types of algae cannot be differentiated on the basis of the position of the absorption band in the blue. On the other hand, the halfwidth of Band 4 differs very significantly (p < < 0.01) between the groups of algae, with the cells containing chl c having a much narrower band than the Chlorophyceae. A broad absorption band for chl b should allow Chlorophyceae and other cells containing chl b to utilize blue light with h~g h efficiency. In this context, it is interesting to note that Chlorophyceae and Prasinophyceae are now generally considered to contribute to a high proportion of ultraphytoplankton in the deep chlorophyll maximum of oligotrophic oceans (Gieskes & Kraay 1986 , Hooks e t al. 1988 ). In the red part of the spectrum, the wavelength position of Band 9 varies by 10 nrn between Chlorophyceae (655 nm) and the other 2 groups (643 and 644 nm). The results are in complete agreement with absorption spectra of pigment-protein complexes containing chl b (Prezelin & Boczar 1986 , Fawley et al. 1990 ) and chl c (Friedman & Alberte 1984 , Owens & Wold 1986 , Rhiel et al. 1987 , Boczar & Prezelin 1989 .\nAbsorption Bands 5 and 6 on the decomposed spectra correspond to absorption by carotenoids. The position of Band 5 seems to be common to the 3 groups of algae, whereas Band 6 is positioned at a longer wavelength for the diatoms (536 nm) than for the other groups (529 and 530 nm). From this result, it is tempting to identify Bands 5 and 6 as representative, respectively, of the carotene and the xanthophyll groups of pigments. Indeed, carotenes, and particularly 6-carotene, are present in most algal taxa (Rowan 1989) , Also, the presence of fi-carotene in the absorption spectra of pigment-protein complexes is indicated by a shoulder at 485 to 495 nm (Thornber & Alberte 1977 , Boczar & Prezelin 1989 ). On the other hand, the hypothesis that xanthophylls are responsible for Band 6 is supported by the work of Owens & Wold (1986), who pointed out that an increase in the background absorption within the 480 to 550 nm range on the absorption spectra of pigment-protein complexes of diatoms was attributable to fucoxanthin. They also noticed a large decrease in absorption at these wavelengths for P700-chla-protem complex and chla-chic light harvesting complex, both containing very little or no fucoxanthin but having some p-carotene, as indicated by a shoulder at 490 nm. Fucoxanthin was also detected in the in vivo absorption spectrum of Laminaria digitata as a feature at 530 to 545 nm (Goedheer 1970) . Such a differentiation between carotenes and xanthophylls, although an attractive idea, may be too simplistic. In fact, up to 500 carotenoids occur naturally (Liaaen-Jensen & Andrewes 1985) and all of them absorb light within the 400 to 550 nm region. Their absorbing properties are known to change with some differences in their chemical structure, such as the number of double bonds and the degree of cyclisation (Britton 1983) . Although xanthophylls differ from carotenes by the presence of oxygenated groups in their molecules, such a factor is not sufficient to distinguish specifically the absorption properties of the 2 types of pigments. Therefore, both Bands 5 and 6 may very well correspond to the absorption of light by a mixture of carotenes and xanthophylls. The small Gaussian Band 7 contributes to the optical properties of phytoplankton in the region of minimum absorption. Its position varies from 579 to 586 nm according to species. Such a band may represent a small absorbing component of the chlorophylls. The presence of a small feature at 585 nm due to chl c was observed in the in vivo absorption spectrum of Laminaria digitata (Goedheer 1970) . The same feature was observed in some absorption spectra of chla-chlcprotein complexes (Rhiel et al. 1987 , Boczar & Prezelin 1989 . On the other hand, chl a may also contribute to absorption in that region of the spectrum. Prezelin (1980) and Fawley et al. (1990) observed a slight absorption at 470 to 600 nm in the spectra of P700-chlaprotein complexes. An in vivo spectrum of Nannochloris salina, containing neither chl b nor chl c, also\nshowed an absorption at around 580 nm due to chl a (Owens et al. 1987) .\nBand 11 does not have a clear physiological explanation. The decomposition of the chl a peak in the red by French et al. (1972) produced a similar unexplained Gaussian component with a peak position varying from 700 to 706 nm. Later, Katz et al. (1977) postulated that all chlorophyll structures absorbing at 685 nm and higher wavelengths are mainly the results of different interactions between the chl a molecules and other compounds such as water or phaeophytins."}, {"section_title": "Specific absorption coefficients", "text": "A non-linearity in the relationship between the absorption coefficient ap(X) and the concentration of chl a has often been observed in natural environments, particularly a t low chlorophyll concentrations (Prieur & Sathyendranath 1981 , Kiefer & Soohoo 1982 , Yentsch & Phinney 1989 . Such a discontinuity has been related either to the particle effect, the pigment composition effect, or a combination of both.\nIn the present study, the relationship between the height of each Gaussian band and the pigment concentration to which it corresponds is expected to b e linear since the particle effect and the differences in pigment composition have been successively removed from the initial absorption spectra. In Figs. 2, 3 , 4, 5, a linear fit has been applied to the data. In most cases, the fitted curves explained more than 80 % of the variances and the correlations were significant at the 0.01 probability level. Note that here, the linearity is malntalned for a multi-species sample set. Until now, a linear relationship had been observed between the absorption coefficient a,(h) and the concentration of chl a on only monospecific algal cultures (Sathyendranath et al. 1987 ). An increase in the scatter amongst the data points was observed with the low-amplitude Gaussian bands (Figs. 2a, c, 3b ). In these particular cases, the linear fit still explains more than 50 % of the vanances but the data were probably affected by covarylng absorption by more than 1 pigment, which failed to be separated by the method. For example, it has already been ment~o n e d that Band 7 (Fig. 3b ) most likely included absorption by chl c as well as a small contribution from chl a. A multiple regression analysis describes the relationship between the height of Band 7 (y) and the concentrations of chl a and c as follows:\nwith a regression coefficient r2 of 0.89. At these low levels of absorption, the data might also be affected by instrumental noise.\nA linear relationship between the Gaussian absorption at 460 nm and chl c concentration (Fig. 3a) explained only 33 % of the variances, but the correlation was still significant at the 0.05 probability level. Note, in this case, that the data points representing the Prymnesiophyceae tend to lie above the regression line and above the data obtained for diatoms. The same trend is maintained in Fig. 3b, c . Most of the diatoms, particularly the species used in the present study, are known to contain chl c, and c2 (Stauber & Jeffrey 1988) . In addition to these 2 pigments, the Pryrnnesiophyceae have a third form, chl c3, which possesses sl~ghtly different optical properties (Fawley 1989) . This difference may explain the higher absorption coefficient of Pryrnnesiophyceae when compared with that of diatoms. As a result, the regressions in Fig. 3 are probably biased by the preponderance of diatoms. We corrected for this effect by using the geometric regression Iine whose slope is given by the ratio of the actual slope to the correlation coefficient (Ricker 1984) . This procedure gave a value of (a',,,,) at 460 nm of 0.045 rn2 mg-' chl c. The true specific absorption of chl a at 435 nm is given in Fig. 2b by the slope of the regression line. Note In the red part of the spectrum, the particle effect is not as important as at shorter wavelengths where the absorption is higher (Kirk 1983) . On the other hand, the contribution to total absorption a t 675 nm by pigments other than chl a is minimal (Fig. 1 ) . As a result, the range of values for a ' a t 675 nm, 0.010 to 0.030 m2 mg-' chl a (Maske & Haardt 1987 , Bricaud et al. 1988 ) is much narrower than for a' in the blue region and tends on average to become reconciled with the present value for a'chl, of 0.015 m2 mg-' chl a (Fig. 2d) .\nThe decomposition of absorption spectra also gives the true specific absorption coefficient of chl b (Fig. 4 ) and carotenoids (Fig. 5 ) at their wavelengths of maximum absorption. The intercepts of the regression lines relating absorption Bands 5 and 6 to the carotenoid concentrations (Fig. 5 ) were significantly different from zero. Problems with carotenoids, however, are not unexpected, considering the imprecise method used to measure their concentrations (Parsons et al. 1984) .\nRegression analysis should give the specific absorption coefficient for each band.

The resulting spectrum represents the absorption properties of cells containing both chl b a n d chl c. In the decomposition of spectra of monospecific cultures, Bands 4 and 9 were used to represent either chl b or chl c. However, since both these pigments are present in the mixture of species considered here, w e used 13 bands in this reconstruction instead of the 11 used for individual species. Each band is characterized by the parameters in Table 4 , where we have given average characteristics for each pigment, ignoring inter-specific differences. The reconstructed absorption spectrum closely matches the observed curve. Slight differences occur in the region of minimum absorption, where the estimated absorption coefficient is systematically lower than the observed values. This discrepancy probably results from an underestimation of the height of Band 7, which was computed using the concentrations of only chl c."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The present study has shown that the in vivo absorption spectra of phytoplankton cells, after correction for the particle effect, can b e represented as the sum of a dozen or so Gaussian absorption bands. Linear correlation of the different peak heights with the concentrations of any one of the 4 major pigments in the samples indicates that the method has been successful in separating the absorptions due to each pigment. One exception to this is the small absorption band at the 579 to 586 nm region, which appears to be influenced by both chl a and chl c. The role of UVblue absorbing material appears to be non-negligible in the samples, but we are unable to propose a specific absorption coefficient other than one normalized to chl a for the Gaussian peak associated with this absorption, since no measurements were made of the concentrations of the pigments that may be responsible for this absorption.\nThe relationship between peak heights and pigment concentrations are hardly affected by the phytoplankton species. This may be considered an indication of the validity of the simple model of particle effect applied to the data set: if this effect had not been corrected for adequately, the consequence would have been a greater dispersion between the results for different species. On the other hand, some interspecific differences in peak characteristics were noted, especially in the peak positions and in the bandwidths. These differences, however, can be explained in terms of the known variations in pigment composition from species to species. Note that the possibility exists that these differences could be exploited in the identification of major phytoplankton species present in a natural sample from an analysis of its absorption spectrum. Admittedly, the problem would become more complicated, the greater the number of species present in the sample.\nThe cultures used in the present study cover 3 major phytoplankton groups, but the list is by no means exhaustive, and future studies would be necessary to extend the results to other groups. One of the important groups that remain to b e studied is of course the marine cyanobacteria, known to b e abundant in oligotrophic waters.\nWe have presented here the first estimates of the 'true' in vivo specific absorption coefficients of 4 major pigments, after correction for particle effect. This opens the possibility of estimating the absorption spectrum of a phytoplankton sample from measurements of its pigment concentrations and cell size. With the advent of the modern techniques of flow cytometry and HPLC, the measurements required for apphcation of these results are becoming ~ncreasingly common. The method proposed for estimating the absorption spectrum of phytoplankton is indirect, but has the advantage that it circumvents the problem of separating absorption by live phytoplankton from background absorption by covarying substances. This method is also free of some of the pitfalls of other methods that have been proposed, such a s the problem of obtaining measurements on a representative sample set for microphotometry (Iturriaga & Siege1 1989) , and the problem of quantifying the results from the filter technique of Yentsch (1962) and Mitchell & Kiefer (1984) . The analysis presented here is based on estimates of pigment concentrations from the absorption spectra of acetone extracts. We do not yet know how well these results would apply to concentration data estimated by other techniques, for example the HPLC method. But we anticipate that in the future, as more accurate HPLC measurements become more routine, they will facilitate refinement of the results presented here.\nAcknowledgements.
