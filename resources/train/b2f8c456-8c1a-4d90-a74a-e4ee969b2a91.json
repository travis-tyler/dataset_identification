[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Reference tissue model (RTM) is a compartmental modeling approach that uses reference tissue time activity curve (TAC) as input for quantification of ligand-receptor dynamic PET without blood sampling. There are limitations in applying the RTM for kinetic analysis of PET studies using [\n11 C]Pittsburgh compound B ([ 11 C]PIB). For region of interest (ROI) based kinetic modeling, the low specific binding of [ 11 C]PIB in a target ROI can result in a high linear relationship between the output and input. This condition may result in amplification of errors in estimates using RTM. For pixel-wise quantification, due to the high noise level of pixel kinetics, the parametric images generated by RTM with conventional linear or nonlinear regression may be too noisy for use in clinical studies. Methods: We applied RTM with parameter coupling and a simultaneous fitting method as a spatial constraint for ROI kinetic analysis. Three RTMs with parameter coupling were derived from a classical compartment model with plasma input: an RTM of 4 parameters (R 1 , k\u2032 2R , k 4 , BP) (RTM4P); an RTM of 5 parameters (R 1 , k 2R , NS, k 6 , BP) (RTM5P); and a simplified RTM (SRTM) of 3 parameters (R 1 , k\u2032 2R , BP) (RTM3P). The parameter sets [k\u2032 2R , k 4 ], [k 2R , NS, k 6 ], and k\u2032 2R are coupled among ROIs for RTM4P, RTM5P, and RTM3P, respectively. A linear regression with spatial constraint (LRSC) algorithm was applied to the SRTM for parametric imaging. Logan plots were used to estimate the distribution volume ratio (DVR) (=1 + BP (binding potential)) in ROI and pixel levels. Ninety-minute [ 11 C]PIB dynamic PET was performed in 28 controls and 6 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on a GE Advance scanner. ROIs of cerebellum (reference tissue) and 15 other regions were defined on coregistered MRIs. Results: The coefficients of variation of DVR estimates from RTM3P obtained by the simultaneous fitting method were lower by 77-89% (in striatum, frontal, occipital, parietal, and cingulate cortex) as compared to that by conventional single ROI TAC fitting method.\nThere were no significant differences in both TAC fitting and DVR estimates between the RTM3P and the RTM4P or RTM5P. The DVR in striatum, lateral temporal, frontal and cingulate cortex for MCI group was 25% to 38% higher compared to the control group (p \u2264 0.05), even in this group of individuals with generally low PIB retention. The DVR images generated by the SRTM with LRSC algorithm had high linear correlations with those from the Logan plot (R 2 = 0.99). Conclusion: In conclusion, the RTM3P with simultaneous fitting method is shown to be a robust compartmental modeling approach that may be useful in [ 11 C]PIB PET studies to detect early markers of Alzheimer's disease where specific ROIs have been hypothesized. In addition, the SRTM with LRSC algorithm may be useful in generating R 1 and DVR images for pixel-wise quantification of [ 11 C]PIB dynamic PET."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2006). [ 11 C]PIB is the most widely used PET imaging agent (the other is [", "text": "18 F]FDDNP) in research studies aimed at improving early detection of AD, monitoring progression of A\u03b2 deposition in the brain, and evaluating anti-amyloid and other therapies to stop progression of AD (Shoghi-Jadid et al., 2002; Mathis et al., 2005; Mintun, 2005; Nichols et al., 2006; Nordberg, 2004; Small et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2005) .\nThe standard compartmental model with plasma input as well as model-independent spectral analysis and graphical analysis (Logan plot) with plasma input was used for [ 11 C]PIB kinetic analysis Verhoeff et al., 2004) . Consistent results from the two previous studies demonstrated that (1) a 2-tissue compartmental model provided better curve fitting than 1-tissue compartmental model; (2) the Logan plot with plasma input is a robust approach to estimate [ 11 C]PIB distribution volume (DV) as compared to the 2-tissue compartmental model; and (3) there was no significant difference in the DV estimates for reference tissue (cerebellum) between controls and AD patients. The plasma input is usually obtained by arterial blood sampling during the PET study period, and tracer metabolism in plasma is corrected using the HPLC technique. This procedure is laborious and is associated with experimental errors and risks to subjects, particularly in the context of frequent longitudinal follow-up. Thus, the ability to conduct accurate studies without arterial sampling will increase the feasibility of [ 11 C]PIB for clinical practice and increase recruitment and retention of participants within the context of large, longitudinal studies. To quantify [ 11 C]PIB dynamic PET without arterial blood sampling, compartmental model with the plasma input derived from dynamic image data, graphical analysis (Logan plot) and a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with reference tissue input, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) or target to reference tissue concentration ratio were evaluated (Edison et al., 2007; Fagan et al., 2006; Kemppainen et al., 2006; Lopresti et al., 2005; Price et al., 2005) .\nReference tissue model is a compartmental modeling approach that uses the reference tissue time activity curve (TAC) as input (Cunningham et al., 1991; Gunn et al., 2001; Morris et al., 2005; Watabe et al., 2000) . In contrast to graphical analysis, the parameters of reference tissue model are estimated by fitting the model to the full time course of tissue TAC measured by PET. Analogous to the classical compartmental model with plasma input, the reference tissue model can be used to predict and simulate tissue tracer kinetics with given model parameters and reference tissue input. Compared to graphical analysis, the reference tissue model is commonly used to extract more physiological information from measured tracer kinetics, such as the relative tracer transport rate constant from vascular space to tissue. In addition, reference tissue models have been extended for kinetic analysis of dynamic PET with pharmacological challenges or cognitive activation during PET (Alpert et al., 2003; Votaw et al., 2002; Watabe et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 2006a) .\nOn the other hand, in theory, there is a limitation in using reference tissue models for the tissue tracer kinetics of low or even negligible specific binding. This is because the low and negligible specific binding of [ 11 C]PIB in target tissue can result in a high linear relationship between the output and input for the reference tissue model. This situation may amplify the errors noticeably in estimates obtained through the reference tissue model. For example, a convergence problem in nonlinear fitting of SRTM to [ 11 C]doxepin ROI TAC occurred in tissues of low H 1 receptor binding protein (BP) (Suzuki et al., 2005) . It was also reported that the estimates of low BP obtained by conventional nonlinear SRTM fitting were not reliable in [ 11 C]PIB and [ 11 C]SB-13 PET studies (Verhoeff et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2006b ). Previous [ 11 C]PIB studies have reported that BP was close to 0, or the distribution volume ratio DVR (= 1 + BP) was close to 1, in most cortical regions in controls. Estimates of PIB retention were also low in brain regions with negligible A\u03b2 load in MCI and AD patients Price et al., 2005) . It has been demonstrated that the accuracy of estimates can be improved by simultaneously fitting a compartmental model with plasma input or reference tissue input to multiple ROI TACs (Buck et al., 1996; Cunningham et al., 2004; Endres et al., 2003; Ginovart et al., 2001; Raylman et al., 1994; Zhou et al., 2006b) . For this approach, the coupled parameter or parameters can be estimated simultaneously for all ROIs. In contrast, the coupled parameter estimated by fitting the model to each single ROI TAC, the conventional ROI TAC model fitting procedure, usually varies among ROIs and this is not consistent with model assumption.\nThe use of higher order reference tissue models, i.e., more compartments used for target and reference tissues, has been proposed to reduce the bias of BP or DV ratio of target tissue to reference tissue (DVR) estimates from the SRTM Kropholler et al., 2006; Wu and Carson, 2002; Zhou et al., 2006c) . In this study, three reference tissue models were used for ROI kinetic modeling and their estimates were compared to investigate if there are any significant improvements using higher order reference tissue models. To obtain reliable estimates of model parameters, reference tissue models with parameter coupling were derived and implemented by simultaneous fitting for ROI based quantification. As a comparison, a reference tissue model with the conventional single ROI TAC fitting method was also applied to same ROI data set.\nThe parametric images that represent both the spatial distribution and quantification of the physiological parameters are generated by fitting a tracer kinetic model to the measured individual pixel TACs. However, due to the inherent high noise level of pixel kinetics of PET, the parametric images generated by conventional linear or nonlinear fitting are usually less accurate than those obtained by model fitting with spatial-temporal analysis (Gunn et al., 2002; Kimura et al., 1999; Turkheimer et al., 2003a; Zhou et al., 2002 Zhou et al., , 2003 . In this study, a linear regression with spatial constraint algorithm (LRSC) we previously developed (Zhou et al., 2003) was applied to the SRTM model for pixel-wise quantification of [ 11 C]PIB kinetics. The R 1 and DVR images generated by the SRTM with the LRSC algorithm were compared to the estimates from ROI kinetic analysis and pixel-wise Logan plot. The [ 11 C]PIB dynamic PET data for 28 controls and 6 individuals with MCI were used in the study."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Theory of reference tissue model with parameter coupling", "text": "The reference tissue model is derived from classical compartmental model theory by eliminating plasma input with reference tissue TAC. In clinical ligand-receptor PET studies, a 2-tissue compartmental model with plasma input (Fig. 1) is commonly used to fit the measured reversible tracer kinetics for both target and reference tissues (Huang et al., 1986; Koeppe et al., 1991; Mintun et al., 1984; Price et al., 2005) . The tracer kinetics described by Fig. 1 are based on the following assumptions: (1) rapid equilibrium between free and nonspecific binding in target tissue is attained; (2) the concentrations of tracer are homogenous in vascular space (C P ), free plus nonspecific binding compartment (C F + NS ), and specific binding compartment (C S ) for target tissue, free and nonspecific binding compartments (C F and C F + NS ) for reference tissue; and (3) the transport of tracer between compartments has first order kinetics. Based on above assumptions, the tracer kinetics in target and reference tissues are described by the following differential equations:\nReference tissue model assumes that the tissue tracer activity contributed from vascular space is negligible, i.e., C T = C F + NS + C S , and C R = C F + C NS , where C T and C R are the tracer concentrations in target and reference tissues measured by the PET scanner, C F + NS (0) = C S (0) = C F (0) = C NS (0) = 0, K 1 (ml/min/ml) is the transport rate constant from vascular space to target tissue, k 2 (1/min) is the efflux rate constant from free plus nonspecific compartment to blood, k 3 (1/min) is the rate of specific receptor binding, and k 4 (1/ min) is rate of dissociation from receptors, K 1R (ml/min/ml) is the transport rate constant from vascular space to reference tissue, k 2R (1/min) is the efflux rate from free compartment in reference tissue to blood, k 5 (1/min) is the rate constant of nonspecific receptor binding, and k 6 (1/min) is rate of dissociation from nonspecific binding. One common measure of tracer binding kinetics is the DV. The tracer DV in tissue or compartment is defined as the ratio of the tracer concentration in tissue or compartment to the tracer concentration in plasma at equilibrium condition. The primary measure for quantification of ligand-receptor dynamic PET is BP that is defined as BP = f 2 B\u2032 max / K D , where f 2 is the free fraction of tracer in the free and nonspecific binding compartment, B\u2032 max (nM) is the available receptor density for tracer binding, and K D (nM) is the tracer equilibrium dissociation constant. BP is an index of tracer specific binding to receptor (Huang et al., 1986; Mintun et al., 1984) . In terms of model micro-parameters, BP in target tissue, DV in free plus nonspecific binding compartment (DV F + NS ), in target tissue (DV T ), and in reference tissue (DV REF ) can be expressed as BP = k 3 /k 4 , DV F + NS = K 1 / k 2 , DV T = (K 1 / k 2 )(1 + k 3 /k 4 ), and DV REF = (K 1R / k 2R ) (1 + k 5 / k 6 ). The essential assumption to derive the reference tissue model is that the tracer distribution of volume in free plus nonspecific binding compartment is identical between reference tissue and target tissue, i.e., DV F + NS = DV REF . The estimation of micro-parameters can be affected by spatial heterogeneity of tracer kinetics, and so the estimated values may not be consistent with the assumed physiological meaning (Cunningham et al., 2004; Herholz et al., 1990; Reimold et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 1997) . Thus, the reliable and robust estimate for BP is often estimated as BP = DV T / (\nis the distribution volume ratio between target and reference tissues.\nThe DVR or BP can be estimated directly by reference tissue models using the reference tissue TAC as input. The reference tissue model derived from a 2 compartments for both target and reference tissues (Fig. 1 ) has 7 parameters, and it usually results in model identity problems in clinical situations (Kropholler et al., 2006; Wu and Carson, 2002) .

The estimates of k\u2032 2R vary from 0.01 \u00b1 0.02 for prefrontal cortex to 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 for thalamus in the control group, and from 0.01 \u00b1 0.01 for occipital cortex to 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 for thalamus in the MCI group.

The k\u2032 2R (mean) in the control group tends to be lower than that in the MCI group (0.04 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, p = 0.09), while the coupling method yields greater similarity between k\u2032 2R for the control and MCI groups (0.05 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, p = 0.42). R 1 estimates from the conventional and simultaneous fitting methods do not differ significantly (p = 0.77). It was also found that R 1 estimates from the conventional fitting method were high linearly correlated with those from the simultaneous fitting method as R 1 (simultaneous fitting) = 0.96R 1 (conventional) + 0.03 (R 2 = 0.95).\nThe reduction of variation for k\u2032 2R and DVR estimates in parametric space for the simultaneous fitting approach is at the cost of higher residual sum of squares in kinetic space (cost function values) or AIC as compared to the conventional single ROI fitting approach. For the RTM3P model, the AIC of model fitting with the simultaneous fitting approach is higher (6 \u00b1 3)% than that from the conventional fitting method. Note that the better fit or lower AIC mostly occurs in ROIs of lower DVR (< 1.5). Representative TACs are shown for a control in Figs. 5A1 and A2 and an MCI individual in Figs. 5B1 and B2. As demonstrated by Fig. 5 , the fitted ROI TACs from the simultaneous fitting and single ROI TAC fitting methods were quite comparable visually for (6 \u00b1 3)% difference in AIC. Fig. 5 also illustrates that, as DVR increases, for example in posterior cingulate cortex, from controls to MCI, the difference in the fitted curves between the simultaneous fitting approach and conventional method tends to be smaller."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of reference tissue models", "text": "The results presented above suggest that estimates of the reference tissue model from the conventional single ROI TAC fitting method show high variability under conditions of low binding.

Similar statistical inferences were also obtained for Logan plot and parametric image approaches."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Three reference tissue models, RTM3P, RTM4P, and RTM5P, were compared for 28 controls and 6 individuals with MCI, who had been studied using [\n11 C]PIB dynamic PET studies. Compared to the RTM3P model, RTM4P and RTM5P models did not yield significant improvements in AIC or estimates. It is notable that Table 1 Statistics of ROI based estimates for control (n = 28) and MCI (n = 6) groups these results were based on a sample with relatively low cerebral [ 11 C]PIB specific binding. To generalize this comparison of the three models, it will be important to evaluate the three reference tissue models for [ 11 C]PIB PET with AD patients in future studies. In general, the performance of reference tissue models is dependent on the tracer kinetics in target tissue and reference tissue. For example, the underestimation of BP from SRTM was significantly reduced by a reference tissue model derived from 1 compartment for target tissue and 2 compartments for reference tissue (equivalent to RTM5P) in [ 11 C]carfentanil and [ 11 C] diprenorphine dynamic PET studies (Zhou et al., 2006c) . As compared to a 2-tissue compartment model with plasma input, the underestimation of [ 11 C]flumazenil BP estimates was (15 \u00b1 0.6)%,\n(1 \u00b1 1)%, and (15 \u00b1 0.5)%, for RTM3P, RTM4P, and RTM5P, respectively (Zhou et al., 2006c) . Variability in the estimates of DVR and k\u2032 2R was noticeably reduced by the simultaneous fitting approach. Simultaneous fitting of multiple ROI TACs to the model of coupled parameters can be viewed as an approach that applies spatial constraints in parametric space to the model fitting in kinetic space at the ROI level (Zhou et al., 2002 (Zhou et al., , 2003 . However, as the DVR increases, for example in tissues with high density of A\u03b2, these improvements tend to be smaller. In other words, the DVR estimates from the conventional SRTM (R 1 , k 2 , BP) model fitting tend to be similar to those from RTM3P(R 1 , k\u2032 2R , BP) with simultaneous fitting methods if DVR \u226b 1 (e.g., DVR \u2265 2 or BP\u2265 1). To compare the data from our study to previous results, a concentration ratio (CR) based semi-quantitative method was applied to the measured dynamic PET data for DVR estimates. As demonstrated by Fig. 8 , the DVR estimated by CR was more sensitive to the pre-determined time frame. Consistent with TACs in Fig. 6 , the mean of first 20 min scan [\n11 C]PIB images appears to be an appropriate time frame in trade off between contrast (gray matter versus white matter) or structural information and image noise level. The spatial distribution of CR images tends to be stable in time frames after 40 min post tracer injection. The CR over frames from 40 to 90 min is higher (13 \u00b1 9)% than the DVR estimated from the Logan plot. However, the CR and Logan plot are highly correlated: CR\u00f0\u00bd40 90\u00de \u00bc 1:39DVR\u00f0Logan plot\u00de \u00c0 0:33\u00f0R 2 \u00bc 0:94\u00de:\nThe ROI based kinetic analysis showed that the statistical power to distinguish between control and MCI group for CR ([40 90] ) method is the same as that for the Logan plot and the RTM3P or SRTM model. These results were quite consistent with previous results .\nIt is important to note that 11 C]PIB in spatial accumulation over brain tissues in MCI or AD patients, and less structural information, the CR images from the later phase are not recommended for use in spatial normalization or as a template. Fig. 9 showed that the statistical power to distinguish between controls and MCI individuals by DVR estimates from RTM3P fitting tends to be stable if PET study time is more than 60 min. The difference in DVR from RTM3P between 60 min and 90 min study is less than 4% in the ROIs including caudate, putamen, thalamus, cortex, pons, and midbrain for both controls and MCI. Compared to a 90 min study, the DVR in white matter from a 60 min study is higher by 12% for controls and 10% for MCI group on average. In addition to DVR estimates from RTM3P, the R 1 estimates from SRTM model with linear regression provide relative tracer transport rate (from blood) information, and R 1 images appear reliable for MRI-PET coregistration and spatial normalization. Taking these factors into consideration, the reference tissue model RTM3P is suggested for kinetic analysis, especially where shorter (< 90 min) PET imaging times are required.\nIn summary, reference tissue models with parameter coupling were derived and implemented by simultaneous model fitting for ROI kinetic analysis. A previously developed parametric imaging algorithm, linear regression with spatial constraint for the SRTM model, was evaluated. For comparison, the Logan plot with reference tissue input was applied to both ROI kinetic analysis and parametric imaging. Twenty-eight controls and six MCI participants, imaged with [\n11 C]PIB dynamic PET, were evaluated in this study. Compared to conventional individual ROI TAC fitting, the variation of DVR estimates was reduced by the simultaneous ROI fitting approach, especially in tissues of low or negligible specific binding in this group of individuals with generally low PIB retention. There were no significant differences in both ROI TAC fitting and DVR estimates between the RTM3P and the RTM4P or RTM5P with simultaneous fitting for parameter estimation. As it produces similar results to the more complex RTM4P and RTM5P models, the simpler RTM3P model is proposed for ROI TAC based kinetic analysis in studies using [ 11 C]PIB PET. Thus, we compared the R 1 and DVR images generated by the SRTM with LRSC algorithm to those from the RTM3P ROI kinetic analysis and the DVR images from Logan plot. The RTM3P with simultaneous fitting method is shown to be a robust compartmental modeling approach that may be useful in [ 11 C] PIB PET studies to detect early markers of Alzheimer's disease where specific ROIs have been hypothesized, especially in situations where PIB retention is not high. In addition, the SRTM with LRSC algorithm is recommended for generation of R 1 and DVR images for pixel-wise quantification of [ 11 C]PIB dynamic PET."}]
