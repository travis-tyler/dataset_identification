This suggests that at fixed temperature a chemical means of reversibly changing the hydrophobicity could be used for mechanochemical coupling. Evidence for this mechanism of mechanochemical coupling is given here with a 4%-Glupolypentapeptide, in which the valine in position 4 is replaced in 1 out of 5 pentamers by a glutamic acid residue. Before cross-linking, the temperature for aggregation of 4%-Glupolypentapeptide is remarkably sensitive to pH, shifting from 250C at pH 2 to 700C at pH 7.4 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 370C, the cross-linked 4%-Glu-polypentapeptide matrix in PBS undergoes a pH-modulated contraction and relaxation with a change from pH 4.3 to 3.3 and back. The mean distance between carboxylates at pH 4.3 in the elastomeric matrix is greater than 40 A, twice the mean distance between negatively charged species in PBS. Accordingly, charge-charge repulsion is expected to make little or no contribution to the coupling. Mechanochemical coupling is demonstrated at fixed load by monitoring pH dependence of length and at constant length by monitoring pH dependence of force. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of mechanochemical coupling in a synthetic polypeptide and the first system to provide a test of the recent proposal that chemical modulation of an inverse temperature transition can be a mechanism for mechanochemical coupling. It is suggested that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may modulate structure and forces in proteins by locally shifting the temperatures of inverse temperature transitions.\nThe polypeptide ofinterest is the polypentapeptide of elastin, (L-Val-L-Pro-Gly-L-Val-Gly)n, discovered in porcine elastin (1, 2) . In bovine elastin, the longest sequence between lysine residues, which can form the cross-links, is 72 residues; for a continuous and unsubstituted sequence of 57 residues, this is the polypentapeptide (3) . The synthetic polypentapeptide is soluble in water in all proportions below 250C, but when the temperature is raised above 250C, aggregation occurs, followed by settling and phase separation. At 40'C, the more dense viscoelastic phase is 38% peptide and 62% water by weight (4). On y-irradiation cross-linking at a dose of 20 Mrad (1 rad = 0.01 Gy), this viscoelastic phase, called a coacervate, forms an elastomer that exhibits dominantly entropic elastomeric force in the 40-60'C temperature range (5) . Numerous physical characterizations* have demonstrated this transition to be an inverse temperature transition, in which the order in the polypeptide part of this twocomponent system increases as the temperature is raised through the transition. Those physical characterizations include (i) self-assembly studies, in which the polypeptide is found to assemble into several-micrometer-diameter fibers composed of fibrils that in turn are composed of approximately 50-A-diameter filaments (8-10); (ii) circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, in which the polypeptide chains within the coacervate are seen to have a repeating p-turn conformation (11, 12) ; (iii) nuclear Overhauser effect studies, which demonstrate the specific hydrophobic side chain associations (ref. 13 , D.W.U., D. K. Chang, R. Krishna, D. H. Huang, T. L. Trapane, and K.U.P., unpublished data); (iv) NMR studies, which show a decrease in backbone mobility as the temperature is raised through the transition under conditions of constant composition (14, 15) ; (v) dielectric relaxation studies, which show the development of an intense, localized, Debye-type relaxation near 10 MHz requiring the development of a regular dynamic backbone conformation (16); (vi) elastomer length studies, in which the elastomer shortens to less than 45% of its low-temperature length when the temperature is raised from 20'C to 40'C (17) ; and (vii) studies of slow thermal denaturation at 80'C in which the circular dichroism indicates the loss of order (4), composition studies show a dramatic expulsion of water to a new composition of 68% peptide and 32% water by weight (4), and, for the elastomer, there is a decrease in length and loss of elastic modulus (ref. 18 and references therein).\nIn thermoelasticity studies when the synthetic elastomer is stretched and held at fixed length and the temperature is raised through the transition range from 20'C to 40'C, there is a dramatic increase in elastomeric force (5) . Above 40TC, however, in a plot of In(elastomeric force/temperature) versus temperature the slope is nearly 0 (5); these data, along with composition studies that show a near constant coacervate volume and composition in the 40-60'C temperature range (4), provide one basis for indicating that the elastomeric force is dominantly entropic in origin.

A less hydrophobic elastomeric matrix has also been made with the des-Val4-polypentapeptide-i.e., (L-Val-L-Pro-Gly-Gly)n; in a thermoelasticity study this cross-linked matrix develops elastomeric force with the midpoint of the transition at 50'C (18) . These studies of changes in hydrophobicity must be done with an understanding of the structure and mechanism of elasticity. For example, the [Ile1]polypentapeptide analog represents the insertion of a CH2 moiety on the side chain of residue 1; if the CH2 moiety is inserted instead at residue 5, as in [L-Ala5]polypentapeptide, there is a total loss of elastic properties (18) . The above findings, that appropriately changing the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide chain can change the temperature range at which elastomeric force develops in a thermoelasticity study, provide the basis for a mechanism of mechanochemical coupling; it should be possible to turn \"on\" and \"off\" elastomeric force at a fixed temperature by reversibly changing the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide chain by means of changing the chemical potential. This can be achieved by including in the polypeptide an occasional residue in Which a change in chemical potential would change the hydrophobicity of the residue. In the present report, the\nGly and L-Val-L-Pro-Gly-L-Glu-Gly at a mole ratio of 4:1. This gives a polypentapeptide matrix in which there are 4 Glu residues per 100 residues of polypentapeptide (abbreviated 4%-Glu-PPP). The change in chemical potential to be used is a change in pH. On ionization of the Glu side chains the polypentapeptide chain becomes less hydrophobic and, as reported here, the transition shifts to higher temperature and the elastomeric force turns off. To our knowledge, this report represents the first demonstration of mechanochemical coupling in a synthetic polypeptide and one in which the principle is to vary reversibly the hydrophobicity of a polypeptide to shift the temperature of an inverse temperature transition."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Peptide Synthesis and Product Verification. For brevity, the details of peptide synthesis and product verification will be presented elsewhere. Here it is noted that the synthesis was by mixtures of two monomers, Boc-Gly-Glu(OMe)-Gly-ValPro-ONp and Boc-Gly-Val-Gly-Val-Pro-ONp (19, 20) , which were mixed in a 1:4 ratio with polymerization initiated on removal of the Boc group by trifluoroacetic acid treatment (Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl; ONp, p-nitrophenoxy). The purity of the intermediates and the final products was checked by thin layer chromatography, elemental analysis, amino acid analysis, and C-13 NMR spectroscopy.\nTemperature Profiles for Aggregation. Profiles for aggregation as a function of temperature were obtained by observing the turbidity of 40-mg/ml samples at 300 nm in a Cary 14 spectrophotometer with a 300-Hz vibrator to prevent settling. Also referred to as temperature profiles for coacervation, these data provide a means of monitoring the temperature of the inverse temperature transition, and the midpoints of the profiles are given in Fig. 1 as a function of pH for the polypeptide dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.15 N NaCl/0.01 M sodium phosphate); the titration curve shows a pKa of 4.5. The curves for the parent polypentapeptide at pH 2.1 and 7.4 show no pH dependence.\nCross-Linking. The 4%-Glu-PPP, 400 mg/ml in distilled water, was formed in the bottom of a cryotube, and a pestle in which a channel had been turned was inserted, causing the viscoelastic material to flow into and to fill the circular channel. The sample was then y-irradiated at a radiation absorbed dose of 20 Mrad. After cross-linking at 20 Mrad, the sample is designated by the prefix X20-. This dose causes no significant changes in the carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 NMR spectra of isotopically enriched samples (14, 15) , but it results in an insoluble matrix with an initial elastic modulus of 1 x 106 dynes/cm2 (15) .\nStress/Strain Apparatus and Thermoelasticity Experiments. The custom-built stress/strain apparatus was as previously described (17, 19) . Elastomers were equilibrated in PBS: 370C for X20-polypentapeptide at pH 7.4, 370C for X20-4%-Glu-PPP at pH 2.1, and 50'C for X20-4%-Glu-PPP at pH 4.5. The samples were gripped; stress-strain data were taken; then samples were equilibrated below 15'C; the temperature was increased in 1PC increments, and the force was monitored to constancy.\nForce Measurements at Constant Length. At 370C, at constant length and at the completion of a pH 2.1 PBS thermoelasticity experiment involving X20-4%-Glu-PPP, the changes in force due to changing the pH to 7.4 and then back to 2.1 were monitored with time.\nLength Measurements at Constant Force. At 370C, at constant force and at the end of a pH 2.1 thermoelasticity experiment to 350C, the X20-4%-Glu-PPP elastomer was placed under constant load of 1.5 g and the pH was varied between 3.3 and 4.3 with monitoring of the length change resulting from the pH change."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Thermoelasticity Studies. The temperature dependence of force development for elastomers held at a fixed extension are given in Fig. 2 for pH 2.1 and pH 4.5. The choice of pH 2.1 gives the state of essentially complete protonation-i.e., 4%-Glu(OH)-polypentapeptide. The choice of pH 4.5 derives from the data in Fig. 1-i. e., only two carboxylates per 100 residues are expected to shift the transition sufficiently such that the turn on of elastomeric force would begin above 37\u00b0C at pH 4.5. This is verified in Fig. 2 . Elastic force development is seen to begin just above 40\u00b0C. As irreversible loss of elastomeric force occurs for X20-polypentapeptide in distilled water above 60\u00b0C, this temperature was not exceeded (18) .\nWhen the pH was lowered to 2.1 and the temperature was equilibrated below 200C before the temperature increase was started, the development of elastomeric force was seen to begin at about 20\u00b0C. Thus the introduction of two charged groups (two carboxylates) per 100 residues causes the inverse temperature transition to shift by about 20\u00b0C to higher temperatures. Therefore, it should be possible to hold the temperature constant at 37\u00b0C and turn the elastomeric force on by lowering the pH to 2.1 and to turn it off by raising the pH to a value of 4.5 or above. force. An elastomeric matrix 5.3 mm in length was loaded with 1.5 g and stretched to 6.3 mm at pH 3.3. When the pH was changed to 4.3, the sample elongated to 8.7 mm; returning the sample to pH 3.3 caused contraction to 6.5 mm with the lifting of the weight. This cycling was repeated. Finally, after waiting long enough, the limiting work is seen to be the shortening of the elastomer from 9.2 mm to 6.6 mm. There was a slow swelling as the sample was exposed for a prolonged period to the acid pH. (B) Force changes at constant length. An elastomeric matrix at pH 2.1 was stretched such that in a thermoelasticity study, the force of 6.8 g was reached at 370C. When the pH was changed to 7.4, the force turned off; when the pH was returned to 2.1, the force turned on to 4.8 g; the force shifted between 4.8 g at pH 2.1 and 0 g at pH 7.4 until the sample began slipping in the lower grip, at which point the experiment was terminated.\nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988) to the work of Frank and Evans (21), which was then considered for proteins in the classic paper of Kauzmann (22) and was extensively developed with emphasis on membrane systems by Tanford (23) and in general by Ben-Naim (24) . The basis of an inverse temperature transition may be referred to as the hydrophobic effect (23) . As commonly stated, at temperatures below the transition the hydrophobic side chains are surrounded by clathrate-like water-i.e., by water that is more ordered than bulk water. As the temperature is raised through the transition, the clathrate-like water surrounding the hydrophobic side chains becomes less ordered bulk water as the hydrophobic side chains associate, increasing the order in the polypeptide part of the system. The transitions are endothermic with relatively small heat absorbed. For the polypentapeptide, the change in heat content is of the order of 1 cal/g (1 cal = 4.18 J) and, of course, there is a net increase in entropy for the complete system, polypentapeptide plus water. As detailed in the introduction, it is well established that the transition involved in the present studies is an inverse temperature transition. (27) , where the mechanism was charge-charge repulsion and the charge density changes were very large. In considering mechanochemical coupling, Katchalsky et al. (28) began with the general expression dE = TdS -PdV + fdl +E Adni, [3] where dE, dS, dV, dL, and dni are the change in internal energy, entropy, volume, length, and the number of moles of the ith chemical species introduced, respectively; and P and IL, are the pressure and chemical potential of the ith introduced species, respectively. In an isothermic mechanochemical process, it was written (28) dE= 0, dS = 0, dV= 0, [4] such that the change in the Helmholtz free energy (i.e., the work function, A) becomes dA = fdL = -> Ldni. [5] This provides a simple expression for analyzing mechanochemical coupling under isothermal conditions, but it is not appropriate for the mechanochemical coupling reported here, which is due to chemical modulation of an inverse temperature transition and involves a dominantly entropic elastomer such that dS cannot be taken as 0.\nCharge Distribution in the X20-4%-Glu-PPP Matrix. The concentration of polypentapeptide in water at 37TC is 400 mg/ml (4) . With this concentration, with 4 carboxyls per 100 residues and with a mean residue weight of83, there is a mean volume per carboxyl group of 8600 A3. In Fig. 2 Glu at a ratio of 4:1, has been synthesized and partially characterized. This Ile' analog exhibits transitions that are shifted to lower temperature, which provides the opportunity of adding additional polar residues. For example, in place of the Glu residues could be introduced a Ser or Thr residue in proper relationship to an Arg or Lys residue in an effort to have a protein kinase site for phosphorylation. In such a case, phosphorylation could cause a relaxation, whereas dephosphorylation could cause a contraction. The proposal that the hydrophobicity be modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in order to turn off and on elastomeric force and therefore to cause relaxation and contraction or other structural transitions has been made recently (29, 30) . This brings the work reported here to the issues of free energy transduction in biological systems so elegantly treated by Hill and colleagues (31) (32) (33) (34) , whether the molecular system be a soluble enzyme, a contractile filament, a cytosolic component of a membrane pump or channel, or a coupling component of oxidative phosphorylation."}]
