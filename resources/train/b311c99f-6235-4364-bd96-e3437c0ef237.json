Random walks 5 , the processes by which randomly-moving objects wander away from their starting location are commonly used to describe diffusion processes. In the past decades, there has been considerable progress in characterizing first passage times, or the amount of time it takes a random walker to reach a target [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, previous works have neglected the study of the temporal dynamics of the information flow in the network, which depends on how the walkers move and not just on their arrival time. Thus, we lack knowledge about how the different temporal scales in the diffusion processes arise from the topological structure of the network, whether they interact, and how they do it.\nDiffusion processes on different complex networks may have associated multiple temporal scales.\nPopular methods such as Fourier transform allow for the identification of main oscillatory features of a system but struggle with nonlinear and nonstationary signals 10 . These issues can be addressed by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) 10 , an adaptive and data-driven method that decomposes nonlinear and nonstationary signals, like the movement of the random walkers, into fundamental modes of oscillations called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), without the need for a predefined model as is the case for Fourier and wavelet transforms.\nIn this paper we study the interaction between IMFs extracted from diffusion processes occurring in simulated Erdos-Renyi (ER) 11 and scale-free (SF) 12 networks, as well as in real brain networks estimated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) data recorded from healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since IMFs are associated with different oscillatory modes, their are constructed with the Barabasi and Albert's (BA) model 12 , or \"rich-gets-richer\" scheme, which assumes that new nodes in a network are not connected at random but with high probability to those which already possess a large number of connections (also known as hubs). In the BA model, ( ) decays as a power law, which yields scale-invariance and allows for large degree fluctuations. We generate ER and SF networks by means of the MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) toolbox CONTEST 19 .\nFigures 1a and 1c show an example of connectivity (adjacency) matrices for ER and SF networks, respectively. Both networks have the same number of edges , and nodes, corresponding to a sparsity, , value of = 1 \u2212 2 = 0.9. A number of 10 4 random walkers were placed onto these networks and diffused for 5000 time steps. One realization of node activity is shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d for ER and SF networks, respectively. We then applied a recent version of the EMD method 20 to these two time series (see Materials and Methods). Figure 1e shows the first 7 IMFs and residue ( ) for the ER and SF networks. The first IMF (IMF1) corresponds to the fastest oscillatory mode and the last IMF to the slowest one. Note that IMF7 is the sum of all the slow IMFs up to IMF7. As seen in Fig. 1e , the EMD method produces amplitude and frequency modulated signals. By applying the Hilbert transform to each IMF, instantaneous amplitudes, phases, and frequencies can be obtained and a time-frequency representation of the original signal (known as the Hilbert spectrum) can be constructed 10 . Since each time instant in Fig. 1e corresponds to a different node in the network, computing the instantaneous frequencies of the 7\nIMFs yields a Hilbert spectrum 10 that links the frequency of the oscillatory modes recorded at each node to the node's degree. Fig. 1f and Fig 1g show the Hilbert spectrum for the ER (Fig 1a) and SF (Fig 1c) networks, respectively. The color scale represents the energy of the spectrum. Our results show that ER networks have more energy in the low frequencies and present a narrow range of node degrees. On the other hand, SF networks present a wide distribution of node degree values where nodes with low degrees are more associated to low frequency oscillations, whereas high degree nodes relate to high frequencies. These results indicate that random walkers strongly link low and high frequency dynamics when they diffuse in SF networks. Panels f, and g show the spectrum of the diffusion process organized by the node degree for ER and SF networks, respectively.\nTo characterize the interaction between frequencies, we computed three types of CFC interactions, Fig. 2a ), (amplitudes of IMF7 and IMF6 in Fig. 2b ) and between fast\nIMFs for (phases of IMF2 and IMF1 in Fig. 2c ). When we decreased the level of sparsity (i.e.\nthe network became more connected), the results for SF networks turned similar to the ones in ER networks. In conclusion, interactions in SF networks were the strongest CFC found (as reflected by the -scores) and, when compared to results from ER networks, the main difference was the existence of strong between slow and fast oscillatory components of the diffusion process. quantifies a network's resistance to failure on a small scale; the clustering coefficient ( ), which measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together; assortativity ( ), which indicates if a node tends to link to other nodes with the same or similar degree; betweenness centrality ( ), which is the fraction of shortest paths in the network that contain a given node (a node with higher betweenness centrality has more control over the network because more information will pass through it); eigenvector centrality ( ), which is another measure of centrality where relative scores are assigned to all nodes based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes; subgraph centrality ( ), which is a weighted sum of closed walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at the node; and the product of the three centrality measures ( * * ). \u0394AAC was most strongly correlated to topology ( Fig. 3b) , specifically with centrality measures, followed by \u0394PAC. \u0394PPC was weakly correlated to the topology of the network.\nNext, by using the degrees we classified nodes in the network into hubs if their degree was at least one standard deviation above the network mean 22 , and into non-hubs otherwise. We then computed the average \u0394PAC of all frequency combinations involving the amplitudes of fast frequencies ( 1 and 2) and the phases of slow frequencies ( 5, 6, and 7). Note that the correlations between \u0394PAC corresponding to these frequency combinations and the product * * are between 0.24 and 0.47 ( Fig. 3a) , which suggests that other mechanisms are needed to explain these \u0394PAC values. Fig. 4b shows the probability that nodes in the four groups (hubs and three non-hubs groups) have of connecting to nodes of certain degrees. We see that top non-hubs connect to high degree nodes (hubs in Fig. 4a ) with higher probability than middle and bottom non-hubs. On the other hand, hubs connect with high probability to low degree nodes. Since PAC is defined as the coupling from a low to a high frequency, its highest contributor will be the nodes associated more with low frequencies (i.e.\nnodes with low degrees, see Fig. 1g ) and that also connect to nodes that are more associated to high frequencies (i.e. nodes with high degrees, see Fig 1g) ; that is, the top non-hubs. Accordingly, hubs, which are more connected to low frequency nodes contribute less to PAC, except for only one hub which presented the largest \u0394 of all nodes in the network ( and top (0.45 \u2212 0.6). In this case, the probability for the top non-hubs decreased and the results for the top and middle groups were more similar (see Fig. 4f ).

Since both the FC and the anatomical backbone are symmetric matrices, we have: = , and = .\nFor each AD and HC subject, we obtained 8 IMFs from the time series generated by the activity of the random walkers. We then focused on PAC since it was the strongest CFC type obtained for both ER and SF networks in our simulations ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Figure 5b shows the PAC between all possible combinations of the 8 IMFs, averaged over 10 4 realizations and over the 44 HC subjects, denoted as . The strongest PAC values were obtained for interactions between slow IMFs (the phase of IMF8 and the amplitudes of IMF5, IMF6 and IMF7). We also computed the average PAC across AD patients ( ) and compared it to the HC group by computing the measure \u2212 1. Our results (Fig. 5f) show that PAC between fast frequencies (IMF1) and slower modes (IMFs 3 to 8) weaken during AD as compared to HCs. Additionally, for each subject, we generated 500 ER and 500 SF networks of the same size and number of edges as their W matrices, computed PAC for these matrices and averaged the results, obtaining , and , respectively. We then computed the following measures: \u2212 1, \u2212 1, \u2212 1, and \u2212 1. Figures 5c,d ,g, and h show that interactions between phases of slow frequencies (IMF5 to 8) and amplitudes of high frequencies (IMF1) are stronger in real brain networks than in simulated ER networks but weaker than in SF networks. This result is not surprising since we know that the degree distribution of brain anatomical networks do not follow a pure power law, as in SF networks, and is better described by an exponentially truncated power law 25 .\nThe contribution of each area to the generation of the PAC phenomenon (\u0394PAC) was computed following the procedure described in the previous section. Figure 6a and 6b shows the average \u0394PAC across subjects for the areas with the strongest influence on PAC, for the HC and AD groups, respectively. In both groups the two areas with the strongest influence were the right superior frontal followed by the right medial orbitofrontal. We also computed the measure 1 \u2212 \u2206 \u2206 to determine the areas that changed more between HC and AD. Figure 6c shows the areas for which the influence on PAC was stronger in HC than in AD, whereas figure 6d displays the opposite case. We obtained that the influence of the right precentral and right superior parietal areas decreased in AD as compared to HC, whereas the influence of the right amygdala increased.\nWe also extracted all possible shortest paths 21 in the HC and AD brain networks, and computed the average \u0394PAC of the areas involved in those paths. We found that the \u0394PAC pathway right superior frontal-right medial orbitofrontal-left superior frontal presented the strongest \u0394PAC in both HC and AD groups (red path in Fig. 7 ). On the other hand, the \u0394PAC pathway that decreased the most during AD was left insula-left pars opercularis-left superior temporal (cyan in figure 7 ), whereas the PAC route that increased the most in AD was right precentral-right paracentral-right precuneus (green in figure 7 ). This clearly demonstrates an interhemispheric difference in PAC generation during AD.\nHere, we also looked at how the scores of two customarily-used cognitive tests are related to the flow of information in AD networks as reflected by PAC. The individual clinical diagnoses assigned by the ADNI experts and used to define the HC and AD groups were based on multiple clinical evaluations 30 . The first test was the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDRSB), which provides a global rating of dementia severity through interviews on different aspects 30, 31 .\nAn algorithm conduces to a score in each of the domain boxes, which are later summed. The final score ranges from 0 to 18, with a 0-value meaning \"Normal\". CDRSB is a gold standard for the assessment of functional impairment 30 . The second test was the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), where an informant is asked to rate the subject's ability to perform 10 different activities of daily living 32 . The total score ranges from 0 (independent) to 30 (dependent).\nFor each brain area the linear fit between \u0394PAC and CDRSB, and \u0394PAC and FAQ was computed. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In summary, we employed random walkers to sample the spatial structure of complex networks and converted their diffusion into time series. To estimate the different temporal scales, these time series were further decomposed into intrinsic mode functions, or IMFs by means of the empirical mode decomposition technique 10 . Expressed in IMFs, the temporal scales have well-behaved Hilbert transforms 10 , from which the instantaneous phases and amplitudes can be calculated.\nAnother advantage of using EMD is that it is an adaptive and data-driven method that does not require prior knowledge on the number of temporal modes embedded into the time series. The interaction between IMFs, or cross-frequency coupling, was analysed, obtaining that crossfrequency interactions were stronger in SF than in ER networks, especially for the case of phaseamplitude coupling. SF networks presented strong PAC between slow and high frequency components of the diffusion process, whereas ER networks presented the strongest PAC between slow-frequency components. Since EMD acts essentially as a dyadic filter bank 33 , some overlapping between consecutive IMFs is expected, which can result in strong CFC. This phenomenon can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 1 for the cases of PAC (interaction between the phase of IMF7 and the amplitude of IMF6), AAC (interaction between the amplitudes of IMF2\nand IMF1) and PPC (interaction between the phases of IMF2 and IMF1). When filtering the data using non-overlapping bands ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) the strength of these couplings decreased, but the CFC patterns, specifically the strong PAC connection between slow phases (IMFs 5 to 7)\nand fast frequencies (IMF1) was preserved, supporting the use of EMD in our analysis.\nGiven a complex network, it is of interest to determine which nodes contribute the most to CFC.\nWe studied in more detail the generation of PAC between low (IMFs 5 to 7) and high (IMF1) frequencies and found that hubs, the most connected nodes in the network were not involved in the strongest PAC (with the exception of one super-hub 23 ). The most significant influence on PAC was exerted by a group of non-hubs, which connected with high probability to high degree nodes (figure 4). This facilitated the generation of PAC (information flow from low to high frequencies 13 ) since low and high degree nodes were generally associated with low and high frequencies,\nrespectively.\nWe applied the methodology to brain networks from HC subjects and AD patients and found that PAC activity between slow frequencies and IMF1 decreased during AD. The IMFs obtained from simulated ER and SF networks correspond to different oscillatory modes, with normalized frequencies ( figure 1f and 1g ). In the case of HC and AD networks, it is tempting to analyse the frequencies in Hz, in order to compare the frequency range of the different IMFs to the known frequency bands registered in the human brain. For this, we need to know the conduction delays for signals coming from different brain areas. Delays can range from a few milliseconds to several hundreds of milliseconds depending on the regions involved and the species considered [34] [35] [36] . For the human brain, there is lack of information about conduction delays between all the combinations of areas. However, if we assume the same delay of 2ms for all connections, we obtain the estimated IMFs ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ) corresponding roughly to frequency bands known in the EEG (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low-gamma, middle-gamma, and fast-gamma). If the delays are increased to 10ms, the frequencies of the IMFs decrease ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ).\nWhen analysing the influence of specific brain areas, we found the right superior frontal and the right medial frontal to be the areas that contributed more to PAC in both HC and AD subjects.\nThese areas belong to the default mode network (DMN), a collection of brain structures which intertwined activity increases in the absence of a task and has been associated with memory consolidation. The right superior frontal and the right medial frontal are also involved in the strongest PAC-based information flow pathway found in AD and HC: right superior frontal-right medial orbitofrontal-left superior frontal. The DMN is of interest to AD research given the amyloid deposits found in its regions 37, 38 . We also found that the influence of the right amygdala on PAC increased during AD (figure 6d); the amygdala is known to be severely affected in AD 39 .\nOur results also demonstrated a marked interhemispheric difference in the generation of PAC, with areas within the left hemisphere being more correlated to the cognitive scores ( figure 8 ).\nFurthermore, the PAC pathway that decreased the most during AD consisted of left hemisphere areas only (left insula-left pars opercularis-left superior temporal), whereas the PAC pathway that increased the most in AD was formed by areas from the right hemisphere (right precentral-right paracentral-right precuneus). A tentative explanation is that the brain must enhance traffic over this specific pathway we have obtained to maintain at least a minimal information flow on the right hemisphere in AD. The interhemispheric functional disconnection suggested by our results has been previously reported in mild cognitive impairment and AD subjects [40] [41] [42] , and has been associated with white matter degeneration 40 .\nOne important challenge for the AD research field is the development of efficient biomarkers.\nNeuroimaging biomarkers in AD are based on brain signals such as MRI, fMRI, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). For instance, there is a consistently reported decrease in restingstate functional connectivity in AD patients compared to HCs in the DMN 43 .

An IMF satisfies two criteria: 1) the number of zerocrossings and extrema are either equal or differ by one, and 2) the mean of its upper and lower envelopes is zero. Thus, to be successfully decomposed into IMFs, a signal must have at least one maximum and one minimum. The sifting process of decomposing a signal ( ) into its IMFs is described by the following algorithm 10 :\n1.
