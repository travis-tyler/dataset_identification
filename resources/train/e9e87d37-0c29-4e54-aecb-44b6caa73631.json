The goal of this research was to evaluate the impacts of Hurricane Sandy on surface elevation trends in estuarine marshes located across the northeast region of the United States from Virginia to Maine using data from an opportunistic (in other words, not strategic) and collaborative network (from here on, an opportunistic network) of surface elevation tablemarker horizon (SET-MH) stations. First, we built a database of metadata for 965 individual stations from 96 unique geographical locations that included the location, geomorphic setting, and wetland type for each SET-MH station. The dominant estuarine settings included in the analyses were back-barrier lagoonal marshes and emergent marshes along embayments and tidal tributaries. We then calculated prestorm elevation trends to compare to poststorm elevation measurements to determine the storm impact on each station trend. We hypothesized that the effect of Hurricane Sandy on marsh elevation trends would differ by position relative to landfall (right or left) and distance from landfall in southern New Jersey, as both of these variables influence the presence or absence of storm surge as a result of the physical characteristics of tropical cyclones (in other words, strongest winds typically occur to the right of landfall). Storm surge was spatially less extensive and less deep (~1 meter [m]) in marshes located to the left (in other words, south) of landfall compared to marshes located to the right (in other words, north) of landfall where storm surge covered a larger area and was deeper (3-4 m). About 63 percent of 223 eligible stations had a poststorm trend that was similar to the prestorm trend (in other words, less than \u00b15 millimeters [mm]), indicating little storm impact on elevation trends at those sites. The remaining 37 percent of stations exhibited significant poststorm deviations from the prestorm trend (in other words, greater than \u00b15 mm). Of these, stations located to the left of landfall had a significant and greater deviation in their elevation trend, and the deviation was more likely to be positive (elevation gain) compared to marshes located to the right of landfall, which had a significant deviation in their elevation trend that was more likely to be negative (elevation loss). This finding is directly related to storm surge impacts on marsh sediment deposition, where deep storm surge (3-4 m) results in sediment deposition in habitats inland of coastal marshes but less so in the marshes themselves. Substrate compaction by the storm surge overburden may have contributed to elevation loss, but this was not measured because sufficient marker horizon data were not available for analysis. In contrast, to the left of landfall the wind-driven flooding of sediment laden water pushed into the headwaters of rivers and small bays with an ~1 m surge, and resulted in more prevalent sediment deposition on the marsh surfaces and elevation gain. In general, the findings support previous research showing that the physical characteristics of the storm (for example, wind speed, storm surge height, impact angle of landfall) combined with the local wetland conditions (for example, marsh productivity, groundwater level, tide height) are important factors determining a storm's impact on soil elevation, and that the soil elevation response can vary widely among multiple wetland sites impacted by the same storm and among different storms for the same wetland site. The final objective of this project was to create a framework using metadata from the opportunistic network of SET-MH stations that could be used to develop a strategic monitoring network designed to address specific climate change impacts and related phenomena identified by land managers and stakeholders. We evaluated the spatial distribution and density of SET-MH stations in relation to geographic coverage, marsh setting, availability of public land, and historical storm surge footprints and hurricane return intervals in order to identify gaps in our understanding of risk and our ability to assess it. Analyses revealed that the general geographic coverage of SET-MH stations is limited given the low percentage of marsh patches with stations, low density of stations, the clumped distribution of stations, and the often limited and uneven distribution of stations in wetlands with a high historical frequency of hurricane strikes and storm surge impacts."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall as a large (1,611 kilometers [km] diameter) post-tropical cyclone near Brigantine, New Jersey, with maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (km/h) (70 knots [kn]) and minimum pressure of 94.5 kilopascals (kPa) (945 millibars [mb]; Blake and others, 2013). The storm affected, in varying degrees, the entire Atlantic seaboard of the United States from Florida to Maine (Blake and others, 2013;Valle-Levinson and others, 2013). Understanding the ecological and physical impacts of hurricanes on coastal wetlands and their interaction with local conditions is important for identifying resilience of these marsh communities. In light of the projected increase in the frequency of intense storms and in storm intensity (Knutson and others, 2010;Bender and others, 2010;Peduzzi and others, 2012;Emanuel, 2013;others, 2011, 2014), the physical (for example, storm surge, sediment deposition) and chemical (for example, salinity, pollutants) impacts associated with hurricanes need to be understood to efficiently and effectively protect and restore these critical habitats. Some of the potential long-term impacts of low-frequency, highmagnitude storm events such as Hurricane Sandy on marsh surface elevation include sediment deposition and erosion, storm surge-related soil compaction, and altered community dynamics, which includes mortality of existing vegetation or promotion of growth through increased availability of nutrients from newly deposited sediment (Cahoon and others, 1995a;Cahoon, 2006). Death of wetland vegetation can lead to loss of elevation by increased root zone decomposition and erosion, whereas increased root growth can lead to elevation gain by root zone expansion (Cahoon and others, 2003). The goal of this study was to evaluate Hurricane Sandy's shortterm impacts on marsh surface elevations within 1 year after the storm. To assess the impacts of Hurricane Sandy on marsh surface elevation dynamics, we evaluated elevation and accretion data collected with the surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH) method (Cahoon and others, 1995a) throughout marshes of the northeastern region of the United States both before and after the storm. The SET-MH method directly measures both surface elevation change (SET) and vertical accretion (MH). These two measurements can be used to calculate subsurface process influences on elevation change, namely shallow subsidence or shallow expansion (for example, root zone expansion from enhanced root growth; others, 1995b, 2002a,b;Callaway and others, 2013). A more detailed description of the SET device and the marker horizon method, including photographs and a diagram, is provided in appendix 1. Previous research using the SET-MH method has shown that hurricanes are powerful agents of geomorphic change (Cahoon, 2006), resulting in both positive and negative changes in elevation trajectories through impacts on both the surface and subsurface soil processes controlling marsh surface elevation. The physical characteristics of the storm (for example, wind speed, storm surge height, impact angle of landfall) combined with the local wetland conditions (for example, marsh productivity, groundwater level, elevation relative to the tide, tide height) are important factors determining a storm's impact on marsh soil elevation. In addition, the soil elevation response can vary widely among multiple wetland sites impacted by the same storm and among different storms for the same wetland site (Cahoon, 2006). Thus, findings should not be extrapolated from one wetland to another for any given storm, or from one storm to another for any given wetland. However, using a large number of SET-MH stations across a large geographic area that spans a variety of wetland settings, as well as storm exposures, and intensities can improve our understanding of wetland vulnerability to severe storm effects on marsh surface elevation change.\nThe next step in the project was to evaluate the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the elevation trajectories of coastal marshes located across the northeast United States within the area of storm influence (for example, wind field and storm surge). This analysis requires an understanding of both the physical characteristics of the storm and the nature of coastal landforms in the northeast United States it impacted. Some fundamental physical characteristics of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere include elevated wind speeds that push and pile up seawater as the storm advances over the ocean and counterclockwise winds. The latter characteristic means that a storm's physical impacts are typically greater in the northeast quadrant (in other words, the upper right quadrant relative to storm direction) caused by winds blowing onshore when the storm makes landfall. In contrast, winds in the northwest quadrant are blowing offshore at the time of landfall. Yet, every storm is unique in terms of its wind speed, size (storm diameter), rate of forward motion, amount of rainfall, timing of landfall relative to tide height, angle of approach to the shore, and the local nearshore bathymetry and coastal geomorphology at the point of landfall (Resio and Westerink, 2008). This unique set of physical characteristics determines the intensity and duration of a storm's impact on coastal landforms it encounters. As a result of this turn, coastal habitats located to the right of the landfall point continued to be inundated by winds of the northeast quadrant pushing water ashore. In contrast, coastal habitats located to the left of the landfall point experienced strong winds out of the northwest shifting to out of the southwest during storm passage ( fig. 1B,C), thereby limiting the extent and depth of storm surge in this region (Dennison and others, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Study Area and SET-MH Stations", "text": "The study area includes estuarine tidal wetlands along the northeastern coast of the United States from Virginia to Maine, an area that spans the track of the storm as it turned north towards the U.S. coast ( fig. 1) and includes the areas of greatest storm surge impacts. High-resolution wetland surface elevation change and accretion data were collected from Virginia to Maine ( fig. 2), both before and after the storm, using the SET-MH method. These SET-MH stations were installed during the past two decades independently by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a number of other Federal and non-Federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and academic institutions to investigate or monitor elevation dynamics in coastal wetlands. The SET-MH method originally consisted of an SET device attached to a pipe benchmark driven 3-6 meters (m) into the substrate (appendix 1, fig. 1.1;Cahoon and others, 2002a) and typically was used to address hypothesis-driven research questions. Later, the Rod SET with deep and shallow benchmarks (10-25 m and <1 m, respectively) was developed to provide greater flexibility in addressing research questions (appendix 1, fig. 1.1;Cahoon and others, 2002b). Although the SET-MH method continues to be used to address research questions, over time it has been used increasingly to monitor long-term elevation change relative to local sea-level trends, especially in National parks and wildlife refuges. Overall, 60 percent of SET stations in the northeastregion inventory were located on Federal lands. Hence, SET stations are located in wetlands best suited to address specific research questions or monitor the habitat sustainability at a specific wetland. Thus, the collection of stations represents an opportunistic regional network, not a strategically planned regional network, to assess storm impacts. Nevertheless, data from this opportunistic network enabled large spatial-scale assessments of storm impacts and wetland responses along a gradient of impact intensity by quantifying the overall change in marsh surface elevation."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The objectives of this project were to 1.

Use assessments of coastal wetland responses to estimate the impact of Hurricane Sandy on marsh sustainability and the potential impact of similar future storms; and 4. Use the database to develop a framework that could support the development of a strategic monitoring network of SET-MH stations in the northeastern United States to assess impacts of storms on coastal wetlands."}, {"section_title": "Inventory and Distribution of SET-MH Stations Along the Atlantic Coast", "text": "The initial step in this project was to collate known surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH) stations in the northeastern United States by contacting and requesting information from organizations and scientists working in the area. Important activities included (1) contacting all investigators to collect poststorm elevation (SET) and accretion (MH) data, which were gathered in marshes throughout the northeastern region in the weeks and months immediately following the storm; and (2) developing a preliminary spreadsheet to collect metadata (for example, location, setting, wetland type, and so forth) and sending it to each network investigator to fill out. In the first months of this project, the SET-MH metadata spreadsheet developed immediately following the storm was updated to match a similar SET-MH spreadsheet developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for its Sentinel Site Cooperatives and the North-and South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. In this way, SET-MH metadata will be available in the same format for the entire east coast of the United States, parts of the U.S. gulf coast, and the five pilot sites in NOAA's Sentinel Site Cooperative to assist in development of plans for a strategic SET-MH network for these parts of the country. The updated spreadsheet was distributed to SET colleagues in the northeastern United States. Significant efforts were made to ensure that all known SET practitioners and SET-MH stations were included in the requests for information. These data were collated into an inventory of SET-MH stations along the Atlantic coast from Virginia to Maine inclusive (objective 1). Additionally, metadata were submitted for several stations from NOAA   Figure 2.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach (Moher and others, 2009) was used for identifying, screening, and determining eligibility of sites based on the following criteria: 1. Within study area for monitoring network (Virginia to Maine), 2. The original pipe SET or deep rod SET method was used (shallow SET benchmark method was excluded), 3. Estuarine emergent marsh habitats (freshwater tidal marshes, forested, and highly managed sites excluded), and 4. SET-MH station was functional (not damaged). An explanation of the criteria and the exclusions are provided below."}, {"section_title": "Location and Distribution of Stations", "text": "For all SET-MH stations included in the inventory, we verified geographic location and assessed geomorphic setting with high resolution aerial photography following the broad setting and subsetting classification scheme in Cahoon and others (2009). See table 1 for more details. Furthermore, the study area between Maine and Virginia (inclusive) was partitioned into ten subregions ( fig. 2): (1) coastal Maine, (2) Cape Cod and Casco Bay, (3) southern New England, (4) Long Island, (5) coastal New Jersey, (6) Delaware Bay, (7) Coastal Delmarva, (8) eastern Chesapeake Bay, (9) western Chesapeake Bay, and (10) coastal Virginia. These subregions were based on major tidal systems as defined in Conway and Droege (2006). The boundaries of the subregions are described in table 2. A hexagon sampling grid (40 square kilometers [km 2 ]) was used to partition the subregions into smaller units, to aid assessment, and to graphically represent marsh and SET-MH information at a scale appropriate for the large study area (Weist and others, 2016). This tessellated hexagon sampling design (Stevens and Olsen, 2004) can be used for comparison across subregions with uniform-sized sample units ( fig. 2). A preliminary evaluation of the database revealed a majority of stations occurred in estuarine emergent marsh settings. Thus, hexagons were limited to locations that contained the estuarine emergent marsh setting identified using National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) estuarine emergent marsh data (NWI code E2EM) acquired in 2010 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (http://www.fws.gov/Wetlands/NWI/). NWI emergent marsh polygons were assigned unique marsh patch identification, and adjacent polygons within a 50-m buffer were considered the same patch (Wiest and others, 2016) and given a single identification. We assigned the estuarine emergent marsh identified by NWI to one of two possible geomorphic settings: estuarine marsh or back-barrier lagoonal marsh (Cahoon and others, 2009). For each marsh patch, marsh area (in hectares [ha]) was calculated (ArcMap 10.1) and the primary broad geomorphic setting assigned using high resolution aerial photography. When a patch included two or more broad geomorphic settings, the dominant broad setting was used. Table 1.

This SET-MH inventory (appendix 2) resides at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Of the 1,230 SET-MH records, 85 were duplicates, and 180 did not meet the criteria described above and were removed from the inventory ( fig. 3). Shallow SET stations were excluded because they were not commonly used in the region and not well represented in the dataset, limiting their value for testing regional hypotheses. But more importantly, they measure elevation change relative only to the depth of the root zone. In contrast, both the pipe SET and the Rod SET were used commonly throughout the region. They measure elevation change to a depth of several tens of meters, thereby measuring both root zone and deeper compaction processes in the substrate. Excluding shallow SET stations reduced confounding effects related to their methodological difference in elevation measurements and their limited spatial coverage. Freshwater tidal marsh settings were excluded because they contained only 30 stations within four geographical locations and all the locations were skewed geographically to the left of Hurricane Sandy landfall. Forested wetland settings were less represented with SET-MH stations than tidal freshwater marsh. Thus, data from these two habitats were not well suited for testing regional hypotheses of storm impacts. SET-MH records were excluded if they were established for experiments: fertilization, exclusion fences, burn, restoration, saltwater addition, elevated carbon dioxide, marsh plugging, and vegetation removal treatments. The inventory of SET-MH stations used in this study presently includes 965 individual stations ( fig. 3) in 96 unique geographical locations, based on general area descriptions provided by SET practitioners."}, {"section_title": "Physical Characteristics of the Storm", "text": "The major impacts of Hurricane Sandy on coastal environments were related to the effects of storm surge and associated coastal flooding (Blake and others, 2013;Valle-Levinson and others, 2013). Several factors contributed to the creation of record high storm surge and coastal inundations in the New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut region north of landfall. The storm was very large with the extent (diameter) of tropical-storm-force winds growing to about 1,611 km prior to landfall (Blake and others, 2013). In addition, Hurricane Sandy made landfall at high tide and at an angle closer to perpendicular to the New Jersey shore than any hurricane in the historical record (Hall and Sobel, 2013). The return period for a storm of Hurricane Sandy's intensity with this angle of approach is 714 years (Hall and Sobel, 2013). These factors, combined with the configuration of the New Jersey-New York-Connecticut shoreline and New York Bight bathymetry, caused the storm surge to rise up to 3.86 m in the vicinity of New York City (Blake and others, 2013). A record storm tide (the combination of the storm surge and astronomical tide) of 4.28 m was recorded at the Battery in New York City (Blake and others, 2013). Historical increases in sea level and mean flood heights contributed to the record high storm surge and storm tide heights at New York City generated by Hurricane Sandy (Kemp and Horton, 2013;Talke and others, 2014;Kemp and others, 2017;Reed and others, 2015). Another contributing factor was the three-fold decrease in the return period for a storm of Hurricane Sandy's flood height during the past two centuries (Lin and others, 2016). Consequently, the inundations above ground level (in other words, upland surfaces) for parts of this region of the coast were as much as 3 m (Blake and others, 2013) during Hurricane Sandy. In contrast, the peak in storm surge height to the left of landfall in the coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula behind Fenwick and Assateague barrier islands was only ~1.2 m (Dennison and others, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "We hypothesized that differences in physical drivers of storm surge extent and duration on either side of a storm's point of landfall could differentially influence the coastal marsh processes related to sediment deposition, sediment erosion, soil compaction (from storm surge water overburden), and ultimately marsh elevation change (Cahoon, 2006). Based on our understanding of the physical characteristics of Hurricane Sandy, we used existing knowledge to develop a hypothetical structural equation model (SEM) describing the processes driving post-storm deviation from expected surface elevation change in millimeters ( fig. 4). Structural equation modeling is a methodology to address questions about complex systems; it is best understood as a framework for quantitative analysis that uses statistical techniques, rather than a statistical method itself, and permits the evaluation of networks of direct and indirect effects (Grace and others, 2012). The SEM approach used in this study examines both direct and indirect influences on deviation from expected change. Variables representing storm exposure and intensity (for example, distance from landfall and position relative to storm landfall [left or right]), and geomorphic setting are predicted to directly influence both presence of storm surge and deviation from expected change. Additional variables that may account for unexplained variance (for example, the rate and variation in prestorm surface elevation change) are not predicted to influence storm surge exposure and are therefore included only as possible direct effects on deviation from expected change."}, {"section_title": "Methods Eligible SET-MH Stations", "text": "Although the SET-MH inventory contains 965 stations ( fig. 2), after determining eligibility for inclusion in our analyses (see description below; eligible stations include SET=223 and MH=107), only the SET elevation data were included in our analysis of Hurricane Sandy effects. Accretion data had an inadequate level of replication for inclusion because a large number of stations with eligible SET data were missing marker-horizon data (55) or had insufficient prestorm (160) or poststorm data (93). Without including the accretion data, it was not possible to calculate shallow subsidence at the stations, so this variable is not addressed in this report. Of the 965 stations eligible for inclusion in the SET-MH inventory, data were not provided for 482 stations owing to insufficient data record (420), experimental treatment applied (28), or unidentified reasons (34). Eligibility for analysis of the remaining 483 stations was determined using a stepwise exclusion process. Station data ( fig. 3) were excluded by criteria in the following order: experimental treatment applied (80), insufficient prestorm data (156), insufficient poststorm data (22), inconsistent trend in prestorm data (1), and a poststorm residual distance outlier (1). In some cases, data were not provided if the provider knew a site was ineligible for assessment; however, a reason was not always given. In order to minimize seasonal variation, we chose one eligible season per SET (either winter/spring or summer/autumn) and only included data from within that season in an analysis. A season was eligible if it had at least one measurement within 1 year poststorm and had \u2265 3years of prestorm data (table 3). Poststorm data were ineligible if there was no poststorm measurement in an eligible season (\u2265 3 years in prestorm record) within 1 year following Hurricane Sandy (October 2012-October 2013).

The simplest model was submodel 3, which consisted of distance from, and position relative to, landfall with no interaction (table 6). See table 3.2 in appendix 3 for model summary information. Submodel 3 was therefore considered the best model available for predicting storm surge presence during Hurricane Sandy. We calculated effective sample size and used this to calculate an adjusted AICc value for the two models with  the lowest AICc value (table 10). The \u0394AICc based on the adjusted sample size (\u0394AICc=1.31) was greater than the unadjusted value (\u0394AICc=1.27); however, the order did not change (tables 10 and 12). Based on submodel 3 (best model), the probability that a station was exposed to the storm surge was predicted to decrease with increasing distance from landfall ( fig. 13; table 3.2 in appendix 3). Submodel 3 also predicted a shorter distance of influence to the left of landfall than to the right ( fig. 13; table 3.2 in appendix 3).

There were a greater number of eligible SET stations with storm surge present than absent (175 and 48 respectively; fig. 14). The deviation from the expected elevation change trend had both greater positive (elevation gain) and negative (elevation loss) values and greater mean values at stations exposed to the Hurricane Sandy storm surge (range=\u221269.4 to 60.0 mm, mean gain=7.9\u00b11.0 mm, mean loss=\u22127.5\u00b11.7 mm) than those outside storm surge influence (range=\u221211.5 to 20.4 mm, mean gain=4.3\u00b11.1 mm, mean loss=\u22122.5\u00b10.6 mm, table 11).

Rather, deviation from expected elevation change was explained by the interaction between distance from landfall and position relative to landfall (see for example, figs. 10 and 12).

The SET stations are located in wetlands that are best suited to address specific research questions or monitor the habitat sustainability of important biological resources at a specific wetland. Thus, this existing network of stations represents an opportunistic collection of sampling locations that are not a strategically deployed collection of stations designed to evaluate wetland elevation dynamics on broader regional scales or across a suite of geomorphic settings and environmental stressors. One purpose of this report was to provide a framework that can be used to develop a strategically designed SET sampling network for the northeastern region of the United States. The intended audience consists of policy makers, government resource management agencies, and SET practitioners. The goal is for this information to be used in decision-making regarding where new SET stations are installed in the northeastern United States, filling in gaps in the existing opportunistic network when possible, to better address priority concerns for the region. To this end, the report provides examples of how a regional inventory of SET station metadata can be used to identify limitations in an opportunistic network, which can inform decisions on future installations. For example, our evaluation of the northeastern region assemblage of stations reveals that the general geographic coverage of SET stations is limited, given the low percentage of marsh patches with stations, the low density of stations (number per 1,000 ha of marsh), and the clumped distribution of stations in 8 of the 10 subregions. Furthermore, each rod SET station covers only ~1.37 square meters of marsh surface area, leading to a recent    Figure 19.

In addition, coverage of the two dominant geomorphic settings in a subregion is often skewed to one of the two settings, and the distribution of stations in wetlands with a high probability of hurricane strikes and storm surge impacts is often limited and uneven. These analyses can be used to address priority regional concerns such as a broader geographical understanding of the vulnerability of coastal marshes in the region to relative sea-level rise, including a comparison of geomorphic settings, and the impacts of storms on wetland resilience. Such a strategic network can provide data to managers and policymakers that better inform the development of management and adaptation plans for coastal resources in the region."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Variation in Storm Impacts", "text": "Understanding the impact of Hurricane Sandy on coastal wetland elevation change requires knowledge of both the physical characteristics of the storm and its interaction with coastal landforms it encounters. Our analyses indicate there are important landform differences in coastal geomorphology and wetland setting on either side of the point of landfall at Brigantine, New Jersey. To the right of landfall the predominant wetland type is back-barrier marsh, whereas to the left of it is predominantly estuarine marsh along tidal tributaries of Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay. Hurricane Sandy's physical characteristics meant that storm surge area was more extensive right of the landfall in the northeast quadrant of the storm than left of the landfall where winds switched from out of the northwest to out of the southwest during storm approach and passage (Dennison and others, 2012; Middleton, 2016; see fig. 1). This difference in surge dynamics resulted in important differences in wetland impacts to the right and left of the landfall point. The smaller surge area to the left of landfall indicates a shorter distance of surge influence there compared to the right of landfall ( fig. 13). To the left of landfall, elevation gain was more prevalent than elevation loss, and the greatest elevation gains for the northeast region were found in these stations. To the right of landfall, stations were located closer to landfall. These stations experienced the greatest elevation loss and range in deviation from expected, and the maximum elevation gains were lower than stations to the left. These effects appear to be the result of the interaction between distance from, and position relative to, landfall as shown in the causal model ( fig. 15). This finding is supported by a remotesensing study of Hurricane Sandy's storm surge impact on salt marsh condition (Rangoonwala and others, 2016), where salt marshes located within 20 km right (north) of landfall experienced high surge persistence and high salt marsh condition change compared to marshes further north of the storm track. Rapid assessment of Hurricane Sandy impacts based on qualitative visual observations made in the weeks immediately following the storm revealed low levels of impacts to coastal marshes in general across the northeast region (American Littoral Society, 2012; Grubel and others, 2012; Dennison and others, 2012). For example, along the shores of New Jersey, Long Island Sound, and New York Harbor-Raritan-Jamaica Bays, 14-17 percent of marshes experienced moderate levels of damage, whereas 54-64 percent of marshes experienced low levels of damage (American Littoral Society, 2012). Only a few marshes exhibited high levels of impacts (for example, Little Egg Harbor). Typically, wrack deposits were visible at the marsh upland edge in many back-bay marsh areas but not in the marsh itself. Marsh-edge erosion was observed in some locations (for example, Barnegat Bay marshes located at the point of landfall; Martha Maxwell-Doyle, Barnegat Bay Partnership, oral commun., May 18, 2017), but no quantitative data were available to evaluate its extent across the region. A geographic information system (GIS) analysis of Hurricane Sandy impacts to coastal wetlands of New Jersey revealed that salt marshes were impacted by either erosion or sediment deposition (Hauser and others, 2015). Although such visual observations can be useful, they also can be misleading because they do not account for the storm's influence on subsurface processes such as shallow subsidence or shallow expansion (for example, root zone expansion from enhanced root growth or dilation water storage), which can vary widely among sites and storms and are often the dominant control on elevation change (Cahoon, 2006). For example, compaction by storm surge, when it occurred, ranged from 3 to 33 mm in a recent review of major storm impacts (Cahoon, 2006). In an empirical, quantitative evaluation of three marshes in Delaware Bay left of landfall and three marshes in Barnegat Bay right of landfall where SET-MH sampling stations had been established 1.5 years prior to Hurricane Sandy, Quirk (2016) found little evidence of widespread wrack, sediment deposition, or vegetation removal on the marsh surface. Over the poststorm period, surface accretion/erosion was within the range of variability prior to the storm in all six marshes. Surface elevation change over the poststorm period was within the range of variability of prestorm trends for four of the six marshes, with one of the remaining marshes exhibiting significant shallow expansion and the other significant shallow subsidence. Similar storm surge effects on sediment deposition processes were observed in 1989 by Gardner andothers (1991, 1992) in a South Carolina salt marsh impacted by Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm whose approach was perpendicular to the shore. Mud was deposited in the forest located inland of the salt marsh, but not in the marsh itself (Gardner and others, 1991). They hypothesized that the 3-to 4-m-deep surge protected the marsh surface from wind, wave action, and currents. Quirk (2016) also hypothesized that much of the material carried by Hurricane Sandy flood waters passed over the marsh and was deposited along areas of taller structure than marsh grass, such as the upland-forest edge. Indeed, recent investigations using large-scale experimental flumes demonstrate that vegetated marsh surfaces effectively attenuated waves and prevented erosion of the marsh surface during storm surge flooding (Moller and others, 2014;Rupprecht and others, 2017). See Leonardi and others (2018) for a review of the interaction between storm surge and salt marsh vegetation as it relates to surface sedimentation and erosion. These observations may explain why surface elevation gain was lower and surface elevation loss more likely in marshes located right of landfall, where storm surge was more extensive and strongest during Hurricane Sandy. It is likely there were fewer opportunities for sediment deposition on the marsh surface and more opportunities for compaction of the marsh substrate by the overburden of the 3-to 4-m storm surge compared to marshes located left of landfall. It may also provide insight into why marsh surface elevation gain was more prevalent in the marshes to the left of landfall, where the surge was less extensive and less deep, such as Chesapeake Bay. In Chesapeake Bay, Dennison and others (2012) reported that winds during Hurricane Sandy started from the northwest as the storm approached the mid-Atlantic (blowing water to the south, out of the bay) and transitioned to the southwest as the eye of the storm passed inland north of Chesapeake Bay (fig. 1). The wind shift to the southwest blew water from the west side to the east side of Chesapeake Bay, causing winddriven flooding on the east shore. Thus, deviation from the expected poststorm elevation trend was greater on the east side than the west side of the Chesapeake Bay (5.4\u00b11.7 mm versus 0.7\u00b10.9 mm). Poststorm field observations by Cahoon at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (NWR; east side) revealed storm-related sediment deposits on some brackish marsh surfaces along the Blackwater River that flows into Fishing Bay on the east shore of Chesapeake Bay. Apparently, sediment-laden water pushed up into the headwaters of rivers and small bays along the east shore of the bay associated with the ~1 m surge resulted in more prevalent sediment deposition and elevation gain in those marshes. These results are consistent with the physical characteristics of Hurricane Sandy, but the range of variation in poststorm residual distance from predicted surface elevation change both left and right of the storm (fig. 12), and in the presence and absence of storm surge ( fig. 14), indicates that a combination of factors beyond just the physics of the storm influenced wetland responses. Some of these factors likely include sediment supply, wetland productivity and integrity, wetland elevation relative to mean sea level, and the degree of hydrologic alterations by human activities."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Marsh Resilience", "text": "The long-term impacts on marsh resilience of a highmagnitude, low-frequency event like Hurricane Sandy are variable and may appear incongruous with such a physically powerful event. For example, although we do not know the impact of Hurricane Hugo on marsh surface elevation change throughout the entire coastline it affected, that storm had no long-term impact on salt marsh integrity at North Inlet in South Carolina (Gardner andothers, 1991, 1992). Similarly, Rachlin and others (2017) report that species composition of vascular flora of salt marshes in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut showed a high degree of stability (in other words, little change) following Hurricane Sandy. Longenecker and others (2018) report that vegetation cover and composition were similar before and after Hurricane Sandy in tidal marsh at Edwin B. Forsythe NWR in New Jersey, which is located at the point of landfall. In addition, Wang and others (2017) report a very complex pattern of accretion and erosion of marsh surfaces for salt marshes across Jamaica Bay, but eroded marsh surfaces recovered from the sediment loss after 1 year. Quirk (2016) hypothesized that Hurricane Sandy impacts on marsh surface accretion and elevation change will have little influence on longer-term elevation trends as well. Given the degree of spatial variation we found in Hurricane Sandy surge effects on marsh elevation change, the implications for marsh resilience to future storms also will vary spatially across the northeastern United States. Our analyses provide inferences for storm impacts in the short-term (1-year poststorm). Namely, those stations located left of landfall, compared to those on the right, experienced a greater deviation from expected elevation change, and the deviation was more likely to be positive (elevation gain). Stations to the right of landfall experienced smaller maximum deviations from expected, and the deviations were more likely to be negative (elevation loss). Although long-term inferences (>1 year poststorm) cannot be drawn from our analyses, it is clear that the more prevalent gain in elevation in the marshes located left of storm landfall more likely resulted in gains in elevation capital (marsh elevation in relation to mean sea level; Reed, 2002;Cahoon and Guntenspergen, 2010) for those marshes. In contrast, the predominance of elevation loss in marshes to the right of landfall in the barrier island systems of northern New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut likely indicates those marshes lost elevation capital. Another potential factor contributing to elevation loss in the northern marshes to the right of landfall is that they are all built on underlying coarse-grained parent materials deposited during and immediately after the last glaciation. This has implications for sediment transport and trapping, with northern marshes often considered sediment starved and more dependent on organic matter accumulation, which ultimately impacts long-term marsh stability (Stevenson and others, 1988). Hurricane Sandy came ashore just south of the glacial deposit line, which adds another confounding factor in understanding the geomorphic setting along this coastline. Future coastal flood risk for the east coast of the United States will be strongly influenced by sea-level rise and changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones (Tebaldi and others, 2012;Woodruff and others, 2013;Little and others, 2015). The return period for Hurricane Sandy's flood height is predicted to decrease during the next century by a factor of as much as 17-fold, owing to both sea-level rise and changes in storm climatology (Lin and others, 2016). The frequency of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease, although the frequency of more intense storms (category 4 and 5) is projected to increase, as is overall tropical cyclone intensity (Knutson and others, 2010;Bender and others, 2010;Peduzzi and others, 2012). For the northeastern U.S. coast (Virginia and northward), relative sea-level rise is projected to be greater than the global average for most future Global Mean Sea Level rise scenarios (for example, 0.3 to 0.5 m or more by the year 2100 under the Intermediate Scenario [Sweet and others, 2017]), and the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States is considered a hotspot of accelerated sea-level rise (Sallenger and others, 2012). Furthermore, acceleration in flooding, including minor flooding, is predicted to occur for the northeast region (Ezer and Atkinson, 2014), although the existence of coastal wetlands is known to reduce flood damage to human infrastructure on the coast (Narayan and others, 2017). Thus, gains in marsh elevation capital are needed to offset the projected increases in sea level and coastal flooding frequency (Cahoon, 2015), and to sustain existing marshes. Notably, as a result of Hurricane Sandy, more marshes in the Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay region gained short-term resilience than marshes in the New Jersey to Connecticut region. Yet, each future major storm to make landfall in the northeastern United States will have its own unique characteristics and storm surge impacts on coastal marsh elevation that will have a cumulative effect on future marsh elevation capital and resilience. The impact of each high-magnitude, low frequency storm event (in other words, hurricanes) will be additive to the impacts of the low-magnitude, high-frequency storm events (in other words, northeaster storms) that typically occur in the northeast region of the United States each year and can generate substantial storm surges during the winter and spring (Davis and Dolan, 1993;Booth and others, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Factors to Consider in Development of a Strategic Monitoring Framework", "text": "Objective 4 of this project is to develop a framework for a strategic monitoring network of SET-MH (from here on SET) stations in the northeastern United States to improve assessments of climate change impacts and related phenomena on coastal wetlands.

With this approach, five of the subregions (Cape Cod-Casco Bay, Long Island, coastal New Jersey, Delaware Bay, and coastal Delmarva) are fairly evenly represented with 18-22 percent of hexagons containing some SET stations. However, southern New England and coastal Virginia have few hexagons with stations (approximately 9.5 percent), and coastal Maine, as well as both western and eastern Chesapeake Bay, are much less represented with less than 8 percent of the hexagons in those regions containing stations. SET stations are also unevenly distributed within each subregion ( fig. 17). For example, most of the SET stations in the coastal Maine subregion are in the northern portion ( fig. 2). Subregions are not equivalent with respect to marsh area, marsh patch size, and geomorphic settings. Therefore, we summarized the number and size of marsh patches per subregion and the density of SET stations relative to existing estuarine emergent marsh (table 14). Two of the four subregions with the greatest number of SET stations (coastal New Jersey=141 and eastern Chesapeake Bay=102) have large areas of marsh (>50,000 ha) and consequently low densities of stations per marsh area (2.8 and 1.51 stations per 1,000 ha of marsh, respectively; table 14). Coastal Maine, eastern Chesapeake Bay, and western Chesapeake Bay are underrepresented by percent of marsh patches with SET stations (less than 1 percent of marsh patches containing stations), and the density of SET stations was low in the southern portion of the region (fewer than 3 stations per 1,000 ha of marsh) and in coastal Maine (4.8 stations per 1,000 ha of marsh) compared to the midregion from Long Island to Cape Cod/Casco Bay (>9 stations per 1,000 ha of marsh; table 14). The percent of hexagons with SETs per subregion was not evenly distributed (\u03c7 2 =42.5, df=9, P<0.001), and the density of SETs (number of stations per 1,000 ha estuarine emergent marsh) was strongly clustered (Global Moran's I=0.157, P<0.001), confirming that SET stations are not evenly distributed. Within each subregion, SET stations were generally clustered on the basis of Global Moran's I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, calculated for number of stations per 1,000 ha of estuarine emergent marsh in each hexagon (table 13). Southern New England and coastal New Jersey subregions were exceptions, in that distribution of SET station density was not significantly different from random (Global Moran's I P-values>0.1). Each subregion also had at least one pair of adjacent hexagons that both contained some SET stations. Therefore, the overall minimum distance between hexagons with SET stations was 0 km. However, the mean minimum distance (or the mean distance to the nearest hexagon with Table 13. Summary of the spatial distribution of surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH) stations, hexagons (with estuarine emergent marsh [E2EM]), hexagons (with E2EM marsh) with SET-MH stations, mean minimum distance between hexagons with SETs, and Global Moran's I (measure of clustering) across 10 subregions between Maine and Virginia (inclusive). [km 2 , square kilometer; m, meter; ha, hectare; <, less than]   SET stations) ranged from 0 km in coastal Virginia (where there are only two hexagons with SET stations) to 7.4 km in western Chesapeake Bay (table 13). The maximum distance to the nearest hexagon with SET stations ranged from 0 (coastal Virginia) to 34 km (southern New England)."}, {"section_title": "Subregion", "text": "\nThe priority concerns for the northeastern region will have to be developed by the target audience of this report, namely, the regional policymakers and resource managers charged with maintaining these critical biological resources. During planning for a strategic distribution of SET stations, there are other issues to be addressed before the plan can be implemented, specifically, financial and infrastructural support. Development of a regional monitoring network requires not only financial investment in the SET-MH equipment but also in the personnel to install the stations and collect and manage the data over the long-term (Webb and others, 2013). This typically requires institutional commitment and support; see for an example the Louisiana Coast-wide Reference Monitoring System (https://www.lacoast.gov/crms/Home.aspx). At the local or subregion scale, SET stations can be strategically installed in locations and settings gradually over time, and for a lower initial investment, to fill in the existing gaps in the opportunistic network. Finally, the analyses of regional storm impacts were limited by the exclusion of a majority of stations where SET data did not meet the criteria needed for the analyses. There  are several steps individual data collectors can take to improve the quality of their SET-MH data and its potential for inclusion in future regional data analyses. First, collect data on a regular multi-seasonal basis to develop long-term data records. The single largest reason for data being excluded from our analysis was that data records were less than 3 years duration, largely as a result of stations being installed less than 3 years prior to the storm. Data from these stations will be available for use in future regional assessments so long as regular data collection continues. Furthermore, data collection should occur in multiple seasons to allow better comparisons to poststorm readings (table 3) and should be conducted before and after severe storm events. Other data quality factors to consider include diligent quality assessment/quality control checks to minimize data processing time, storing the data in an R-user friendly format, conducting routine elevation surveys to certify the stability of the SET benchmarks, and where regional networks have been established, standardizing data collection of potential covariates (for example, wetland elevation within the tidal frame) by all data holders in the region.    .

For example, we quantified the broad geomorphic settings present in the marsh patches of each subregion and then compared the broad geomorphic settings of the existing SET stations (table 15, figs. 18 and 19). This comparison is not relevant for subregions where there is only one broad geomorphic setting present, such as eastern and western Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Bay. For several subregions, however, this comparison highlights existing gaps. In coastal Virginia, all stations are located in back-barrier lagoon settings, even though the percentage of total marsh area in this geomorphic setting is only 29.1 percent (table 15). In the Cape Cod/Casco Bay subregion, most stations (by count, number of marsh patches, and number of hexagons) are located in backbarrier lagoon settings, even though there is a mix of estuarine and back-barrier lagoon marsh patches in the subregion (26.2 percent and 73.8 percent of marsh area, respectively; table 15). The inverse is true in southern New England, where most stations (by count, number of marsh patches, and number of hexagons) are located in estuarine settings, even though there is a fairly even mix of estuarine and back-barrier lagoon marsh patches in the subregion (37.7 percent and 61.8 percent of marsh area, respectively; table 15). At the subregion level, the amount of marsh area ( fig. 16) can be used to identify areas/hexagons in which multiple SET stations would be recommended (a greater number of replicate stations for those hexagons with more marsh area). At a local level (within a hexagon), there are other details to be considered, including marsh patch ownership (for example, Federal lands, fig. 20A) and availability of observers. Additionally, the presence of publicly owned marsh ( fig. 20B) could be used within an area identified as a spatial gap to highlight candidate hexagons for future installations. Additional information about SET station distribution within a marsh or study area is presented in the SET-MH protocol manual (Lynch and others, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Risk", "text": "This report includes spatial representation of two risk factors associated with hurricanes that could be considered when identifying spatial gaps in an opportunistic network: the return interval of hurricanes by county ( fig. 21) and the potential storm surge footprint ( fig. 22-25).

However, this subregion has among the lowest number of SET stations per 1,000 ha of marsh (1.52) in the entire study area (table 14). A much greater portion of the study area, in particular the central portion, experiences a 10-30 year return interval, including parts of western Chesapeake Bay, coastal Delmarva, Delaware Bay, coastal New Jersey, Long Island, southern New England, Cape Cod/Casco Bay, and coastal Maine (fig. 21). The Long Island, southern New England, Cape Cod/Casco Bay and coastal Maine subregions have the highest number of SET stations per 1,000 ha of marsh in the study area (table 14). Yet the percent of marsh patches with SET stations is low in many of these subregions, especially western Chesapeake Bay, coastal Delmarva, southern New England, and coastal Maine (table 14), such that many areas of these subregions do not have any SET stations. A smaller portion of the study area that includes western Chesapeake Bay, coastal Delmarva, and coastal New Jersey experiences a 30-50 year return interval, and there are only about 2 SET stations per 1,000 ha of marsh in these subregions. The longest hurricane return intervals (50-100 years and >100 years) occur primarily in the eastern Chesapeake Bay, Cape Cod/Casco Bay, and coastal Maine subregions. The predicted worst-case scenario storm surge footprints acquired from the SLOSH model for the MOM for storm categories 1-5 are presented in figure 22 for the entire study area and for the northern, central, and southern portions of the study area in figures 23-25. Storm surge footprints are most prevalent in the southern portion of the study area from coastal New Jersey to coastal Virginia (figs. [23][24][25], where all subregions are broadly impacted except for the western Chesapeake Bay. For the southern portion of the study area there are less than 2 SET stations per 1,000 ha of marsh, except for coastal New Jersey where there are 2.80 SET stations per 1,000 ha of marsh. A higher resolution view of storm surge footprints for each subregion is presented in figures 26-32. In the coastal Maine subregion, SET stations are not located within the storm surge footprints. In the remaining subregions, there is much stronger overlap between SET station locations and storm surge footprints, although there are no SET stations in some prominent storm surge footprints."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Using data collected from an assemblage of SET-MH stations spread across the northeast U.S. coastline from Virginia to Maine, we evaluated the effects of Hurricane Sandy on marsh elevation trends by comparing prestorm and poststorm data. We hypothesized that the effect of Hurricane Sandy on marsh elevation trends would differ by position relative to landfall (right or left) and distance from landfall in southern New Jersey, as both these variables influence the presence or absence of storm surge as a result of the physical characteristics of tropical cyclones ( fig. 4). As expected, storm surge strength and extent were greater to the right of landfall in the northeast quadrant of the storm, compared to the left of landfall. Thus, the interaction of position relative to landfall with distance from landfall significantly influenced marsh elevation trends ( fig. 15), indicating significant spatial variation in Hurricane Sandy effects and potential resilience to future storms across the region. The majority of SET stations had a poststorm deviation from the expected elevation change trend that was within a range commonly observed in prestorm data (<5 mm). For the SET stations where deviation from the expected trend was greater than 5 mm, position relative to landfall had a significant influence. More marshes located to the left of landfall, where storm surge was less extensive and less deep, had a significant and greater deviation in their elevation trend that was more likely to be positive (elevation gain), compared to marshes located to the right of landfall where the surge was more extensive and deeper. Fewer marshes located to the right of landfall had a significant deviation in their elevation trend, and that trend was more likely to be negative (elevation loss). In addition, positive trends (elevation gain) were lower compared to left of landfall. The cause for this finding apparently is directly related to storm surge impacts on marsh sediment deposition. Other researchers (Gardner andothers, 1991, 1992;Quirk, 2016) have shown that 3-to 4-m-deep storm surge results in sediment deposition in habitats inland of coastal marshes but less so in the marshes themselves, and the deep surge water apparently protects the marsh surface from erosive forces related to currents and waves that would affect more shallowly flooded surfaces. Substrate compaction by the storm surge overburden may have contributed to elevation loss in marshes located to the right of landfall, as has occurred in other marshes during previous storms (Cahoon, 2006), but this was not measured because marker horizon data were not available from all sites. In contrast, wind-driven flooding of sediment laden water pushed into the headwaters of rivers and small bays on the east shore of Chesapeake Bay associated with an ~1-m surge resulted in more prevalent sediment deposition and elevation gain on the marsh surfaces there. Consequently, as a result of Hurricane Sandy, more marshes located left of landfall (for example, Chesapeake Bay region) gained more elevation capital (Cahoon and Guntenspergen, 2010), and hence resilience, than marshes located to the right of landfall. Even though marsh settings were separated geographically with more back-barrier lagoon settings right of landfall and estuarine marsh left of landfall, estuarine marsh setting did not influence marsh elevation trends or the presence/absence of storm surge (fig. 15). The spatial characteristics of the storm apparently overwhelmed any influence that geomorphic setting had on storm impact. Lastly, we developed a framework that will enable conversion of the opportunistic assemblage of 965 stations in the northeast United States into a strategic monitoring network designed to address specific climate change impacts and related phenomena identified by land managers and stakeholders. To accomplish this, we evaluated the spatial distribution and density of SET-MH stations in relation to geographic coverage, marsh setting, availability of public land, and historical storm surge footprints and hurricane return intervals in order to identify gaps in our understanding of risk and our ability to assess it. The analyses revealed that the general geographic coverage of SET stations is limited, given the low percentage of marsh patches with stations, low density of stations, and the clumped distribution of stations in 8 of the 10 predefined subregions. Also, spatial coverage of the two dominant geomorphic settings in a subregion is often skewed to one of the settings, and the distribution of stations in wetlands with a high probability of hurricane strikes and storm surge impacts is often limited and uneven. These findings can be used by managers and planners to inform the creation of a strategic monitoring network by providing a guide to future SET station installations at regional and local scales, the results from which can inform management and adaptation efforts for coastal resources in the region. These management concerns will have to be identified and prioritized by the target audience of this report, the local and regional policymakers and resource managers charged with maintaining critical biological resources. Final plan designs will have to incorporate financial and infrastructural support required to collect and manage the data over the long term.
