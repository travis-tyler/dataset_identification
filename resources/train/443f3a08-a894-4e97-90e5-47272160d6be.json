The data were developed as part of the Longitudinal Doctorate Project.' Current information on the supply and utilization of doctoral personnel in science and engineering (S&E) reflects the results of the 1991 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), the 10th in a biennial series. The population of the 1991 survey includes persons under the age of 76 who hold doctorates from U.S. institutions in science or engineering. This population differs from prior surveys in the series, which encompassed a 42-year period of Ph.D. cohorts. The change to an age-based cohort in 199: was made to accommodate policy interest in retirement patterns and to make the sample frame compatible with other National Science Foundation (NSF) surveys of science and engineering personnel. NSF also introduced a number of other improvements into the 1991 SDR in an effort to enhance the quality and utility of the SDR data.2 These improvements may affect comparability with SDR data published for prior survey years, however. One of the factors contributing to the data incomparability was the change in the definition of doctoral scientists and engineers. Prior to 1991 the NSF defined scientists and engineers as individuals with (1) U.S.-earned doctorates in S&E; (2) U.S.-earned doctorates in humanities, education, or professional fields who were employed in S&E; or (3) foreign-earned doctorates who were working in S&E in the United States. In 1991 only individuals with U.S.-earned doctorates in S&E were classified as scientists and engineers, because over time the coverage of individuals in categories 2 and 3 had become less and less complete. Another 1991 change affecting comparability was the introduction of more intensive followup of mail I The Longitudinal Doctorate Project consists of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, a biennial survey conducted since 1973, and the Doctorate Work History File, a longitudinal file of data from the surveys. nonrespondents in order to raise the survey response rate. This followupin the form of telephone interviewing--was financed through a reduction in the sample size of about 50 percent from 1989. However, because a higher response rate was achieved in 1991-87 percent compared with 55 percent in 1989the effective sample size was reduced by only 22 percent. Because of these changes, only data from the 1991 survey are included in this report. Information is provided on the number of employed scientists and engineers by demographic characteristics such as citizenship, place of birth, and field of degree and by employment-related characteristics such as occupation, sector of employment, median salary, and various labor force rates. Of further note, some tables in this report provide estimates for doctoral scientists and engineers employed in 4-year colleges and universities. a In addition to these general notes, this report includes detailed statistical tables, technical notes, and the survey instrument. The detailed statistical tables unit includes employment and salary detail tables. The \"Technical Notes\" section contains information on survey methodology, coverage, concepts, definitions, and sampling errors.

Median annual salaries of employed doctoral scientists and engineers, by employment-related characteristics and primary work activity: 1991 In 1991 the general form of the SDR sample was a stratified, proportional design with a minimum cell size requirement. This design effectively forced some small cells to be oversampled. However, sampling rates were constrained to a 5 to I range in order to control the disparity in sampling weights. In earlier survey ,.ears these sampling rates had been allowed to vary widely. In selecting the samp'e, we deleted a portion of the core that is conveyed nom year to year and selected a new sample from cells containing the cohort graduating since 1989. The overall sampling rate for scientists and engineers was 7.1 percent, yielding a final sample size of 37,996 drawn from a sampling frame of 537.425."}, {"section_title": "DATA COLLECTION", "text": "Between 1973 and 1989, data collection for the SDR was accomplished through a mail survey. In 1991 there were two phases of data collection: a mail survey and telephone followup interviewing. The mail survey consisted of three waves of a personalized mailing package, with a reminder postcard between waves one and two. The first wave mailing was sent in October 1991. with followup mailings in December 1991 and January 1\")2. Phase 2 consisted of telephone interviews. For this phase a 60-percent subsample of nonrespondents to the mail survey was selected and followed up using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In addition to questions on the mail survey. several others were added to the telephone interview regarding address verification and reasons for not returning the mail questionnaire. Telephone interviewing was conducted between March 1992 and July 1992."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY CONTENT", "text": "It is important to note that survey content, i.e., the wording of the questions. did not change between 1989 and 1991. with the exception of the question about disabilities (question 24 in 1989 and questions 30-33 in I 99 ). However, there was a change to the reference period. In 1991 respondents were asked about September of the survey year. In predecessor years the reference month was February. Therefore, there is a greater time interval between the 1989 and 1991 surveys (31 months) compared with the interval in earlier years (24 months). Although the content remained the same between 1989 and 1991, the format and layout of the questionnaire was changed to a more \"respondent friendly\" design. The effects of this change are difficult to identify, but in some cases item nonresponse rates were reduced because of improved instructions to the respondent."}, {"section_title": "RESPONSE RATES", "text": "In 1991 the final response rate for the SDR was approximately 80 percent (87 percent weighted). This rate marked a 25-percentage-point increase from the 1989 final response rate of 55 percent. The increase is due primarily to the addition of CATI to the data collection plan but also to changes to the mail survey that made it more productive. The higher response rate should improve the quality of the 1991 SDR estimates, because it reduces the likelihood of nonsampling errors in the estimates caused by nonresponse. Note, however, that the improved response rates and the expected lessening of bias should be considered additional sources of change in time series and longitudinal analysis."}, {"section_title": "RELIABILITY'", "text": "The statistics in this report are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling variability occurs because a sample rather than an entire population is surveyed. Sampling errors are determined using a generalized procedure. Approximations were required in order to derive sampling errors that would be applicable to a wide variety of items. As a result, The data and material on sampling reliability presented here arc from National Academy of Sciences, Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel, The Methodological Report of the 1991 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (Washington, DC: NAS, forthcoming). these sampling errors provide an indication of the order of magnitude of a sampling error rather than a precise sampling error for any specific item. The sampling error tables are derived from standard error equations and special parameters developed by the Bureau of the Census. Table A-3 provides information that permits the user to calculate approximate standard errors for totals using the formula Sx=lax2+bxJ1/2 where \"x\" equals the estimated total and \"a\" and \"b\" are regression coefficients. Values of \"a\" and \"b\" by S&E fields for selected groups are given.2 Tables A-4 through A-7 present approximate standard errors associated with total subgroup size for different segments of the doctoral population. Tables A-8 through A-11 present standard error estimates for the estimated percent3 of a subgroup having a particular characteristic. The approximate standard error of percent variables may be estimated directly using the formula: where \"p\" equals the percent possessing the specific characteristic and \"x\" and \"y\" represent the enumerator and denominator, respectively, or the ratio that yields the observed percent. In addition to sampling error, data are subject to nonsampling error. Sources of nonsampling error include nonresponse bias, which arises when individuals who do not respond to a survey differ significantly from those who do, and measurement error, which arises 2 the generalised error estimates in this report were based on a set of assumptions that in the case of some small subpopulations did not appear to hold. In such cases the parameters listed tOr a higher level field within a demographic group or a higher level demographic group within a field were considered a useful substitute as a generalized error estimate Based on the ratio of two estimated totals. where the numerator is a subset of the denominator. when we are not able to precisely measure the variables of interest. These sources of error are much harder to estimate than are sampling errors. There is little direct information about measurement errors in the SDR. However, experience with minor questica changes indicates that some variables may be subject to measurement problems. For example, in 1987 the question on primary work activity was reworded by providing definitions of basic and applied research."}, {"section_title": "NOTES ON THE TABLES", "text": "The following notes facilitate use of data in the detailed tables. Because of the changes (described above) introduced into the 1991 SDR, users are advised that data in this report are not comparable with SDR data published by NSF for prior survey years. Additionally, demographic and employment characteristics are presented by field of doctorate in this report rather than by field of employment as in prior publications. Field of doctorate is the field of degree ac specified by the respondent in the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) at the time of degree conferral. Field of employment was derived primarily. from responses to question 9 that requested the name and title of the specialty most closely related to the respondent's principal employment. The code was selected by respondents from the Employment Specialists List included with the questionnaire. Sector of employment was based on responses to question 7. The category \"educational institutions\" includes junior colleges; 2-year colleges; technical institutes; medical schools (including universityaffiliated hospitals or medical centers); 4-year colleges or universities; and elementary, middle, or secondary school systems. Geographic division was based primarily on responses to question 6 on the location of employment Individuals not reporting place of employment were classified by their mailing address. 0 Australasia -= Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines Primary work activity was determined from responses to question 12. \"Development\" includes that development of equipment, products, and systems as well as the design of equipment, processes, and models. The 1987 questionnaire was reworded to include definitions of basic and applied research. Federal support was determined from responses to question 17. The reference period used for this question changed in 1987. The 1989 and 1987 questionnaires used \"the past year\" as the reference period, whereas prior surveys varied from the month of February to the week defined by a particular day in February. Therefore, the data from survey years prior to 1987 are not comparable. Tenure status was obtained from the response to question 11. The question was reworded in 1979 to gather information on tenure track in addition to the basic question on tenure. Due to the introduction of additional categories in 1979, the data from prior survey years are not comparable. Salary data were derived from responses to question 14, which requested information regarding annual salary before deductions for income tax, social security, retirement, etc., but excluding bonuses, overtime, summer teaching, or other payment for professional work. Salaries reported are median annual salaries, rounded to the nearest $100 and computed for full-time employed civilian scientists and engineers only. Differences between calendar-year salaries (11 to 12 months) and academic-year salaries (9 to 10 months) for individuals employed in educational institutions have been accommodated by multiplying academic-year salaries by eleven-ninths to adjust to a calendar-year scale. For individuals not reporting whether their salary was for an academic or calendar year, calendar year was used as the default category. Approximately 10 percent of full-time employed scientists and engineers failed to make this distinction, and approximately half of those had not reported any salary. Racial/ethnic data were based on questions relating to race and Hispanic heritage. The race/ethnic data appearing in the time-series tables of this report may differ significantly from estimates published prior to 1983. At that time an analysis of racial/ethnic information found that there were inaccuracies in these data, especially in the reported numbers of Hispanics and Native Americans. Accordingly, racial/ethnic data . for all previous survey years were modified before being entered on the 1983 files. For subsequent doctorate recipients racial/ethnic identity is not changed once an SED response has already been received. As a result of these Modifications, race/ethnic data have become more accurate and stable over time."}, {"section_title": "SELECTED EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "This report contains several derived statistical measures reflecting labor force and employment rates as of September 1991: Labor, force participation rate.
