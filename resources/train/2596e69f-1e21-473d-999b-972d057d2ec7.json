[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The adoption of several basic financial management practices is examined for a group of New York dairy farms. The study provides estimates of the extent to which various business analysis and control, investment analysis and decision making, and capital acquisition practices have been adopted. Many practices, such as net present value analysis, are not widely adopted by farmers. The relationship between the adoption of financial management practices and farm profitability is also examined. Results suggest that the adoption of financial management practices, such as using investment analysis techniques, significantly impacts farm financial performance."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Financial management topics are given considerable emphasis in nearly every farm management course and text. Among the most common topics are financial control systems, budgeting, investment analysis, and securing credit. Although these topics are treated as basic management skills, relatively little is known about the financial management practices actually used by farmers. For instance, most financial management texts contain numerous pages and even chapters on capital budgeting, but the extent to which these techniques have been adopted by farmers is generally not known.\nIn addition to the lack of information about farmers' adoption of many basic financial management practices, little is known regarding the relationship between adoption of these practices and farm profitability. While many studies have examined the linkage between technology adoption and profitability, few studies have assessed the empirical relationship between the adoption of financial management practices and farm profitability. The lack of knowledge regarding these two basic issues is somewhat surprising given the amount of time and effort spent teaching, researching, and extending concepts related to agricultural finance.\nTwo primary goals guide this study. First, we seek to determine the extent to which farmers have adopted various financial management practices. While this is a relatively simple question, such an assessment is critical in order to understand how widely the concepts and principles taught in the classroom and extension have been adopted. Second, we propose to examine the relationship between the adoption of these practices and financial performance.\nBoth questions are obviously important to farm management and finance researchers and educators. Results associated with the second objective are also of potential interest to farm managers. The findings should help identify practices that have been widely adopted, practices that have not been widely adopted, and practices that have a large impact on profitability. These results can then be used to prioritize educational offerings and research agendas."}, {"section_title": "Financial Management", "text": "A variety of definitions have been offered to characterize financial management. Barry, Ellinger, Baker, and Hopkin describe financial management as \"the acquisition and use of financial resources and protection of equity capital from various sources of risk\" (p. 3). Lee, Boehlje, Nelson, and Murray define agricultural finance as the \"economic study of the acquisition and use of capital in agriculture\" (p. 3). Brealey and Myers summarize the corporate financial manager's responsibilities by noting, \"the overall task of the financial manager can be broken down into (1) the investment or capital budgeting decision, and (2) the financing decision. In other words, the firm has to decide (1) what real assets to buy and (2) how to raise the necessary cash\" (p. 13).\nThese definitions emphasize the importance of acquiring and investing resources. Certainly, capital acquisition and investment are critical financial management responsibilities, and both are examined in this study. The financial manager also performs a variety of tasks which both ensure the efficient operation of the business and support capital acquisition and investment activities. These supporting responsibilities include activities such as maintaining financial records, implementing control systems, and analyzing whole-farm profitability. In this study, these tasks are referred to as business analysis/control functions. Although the groupings are not entirely mutually exclusive, the business analysis/control, investment analysis/ decision-making, and capital acquisition functions capture many of the responsibilities of the agricultural financial manager. Some examples of basic responsibilities associated with each of these functions are detailed in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Business Analysis/Control", "text": "One of the most important responsibilities of the farm manager is to monitor and ensure the profitability, liquidity, and solvency of the business. These activities are crucial for the short-term operation of the business. Among business analysis/ control practices are activities related to financial control systems and the purchase of operating inputs (Table 1 , column 1). Business analysis and control functions also support capital acquisition and investment analysis decisions. For example, a financial budget forms the basis for cash flow projections and loan requests.\nThe use and impact of business analysis and control practices has not been widely studied. In their review of farm management studies from 1980 to approximately 1993, Fox, Bergen, and Dickson identify no studies examining the relationship between the use of business analysis/control practices and farm profitability. More recently, Mishra, El-Osta, and Steele, and Mishra, El-Osta, and Johnson examined the relationship between the use of record-keeping practices and farm profitability. Mishra, El-Osta, and Steele report that 39% of limited resource and 54% of other small farms used a formal record-keeping system. Both studies found only modest evidence of a statistical relationship between record keeping and performance. It would seem that relatively little is known regarding the use of business analysis/ control practices and their impact on profitability. "}, {"section_title": "Investment Analysis/ Decision Making", "text": "The farm manager must evaluate alternative investments, determine whether the investments are profitable, and decide whether they present an acceptable risk-return tradeoff. This study focuses on investment analysis and decision making related to long-term investments. As a result, most of the practices listed in column 2 of Table 1 "}, {"section_title": "Capital Acquisition", "text": "Capital acquisition refers to the process of raising debt and equity funds. In agriculture, and particularly for most farms, the options for raising equity funds are limited and debt funds are typically obtained with standard loan agreements.\nWhile farmers can access loan funds from a variety of sources, traditional mortgage lenders constitute a primary source of funds. When comparing lenders, the most basic evaluation technique is to compare rates and services across lenders.\nRespondents were asked when they compared the rates and services offered by lenders (Table 9 ). Approximately one-fifth (21%) of the respondents indicated they never compared the rates and services offered by lenders. This proportion seems rather large given that most of the farms in the sample borrowed funds. Failing to compare rates is potentially rational if the benefit of comparing lenders is small. For instance, if significant fees associated with refinancing make it costly to refinance, there would be less incentive to periodically check rates. This finding could also reflect perceptions that all lenders charge the same rates, or that the current lender will provide a favorable interest rate and services. Moreover, due to poor credit capacity, some borrowers may have few financing options.\nWith respect to lender rate and service comparisons, only 43% of respondents made a comparison when borrowing a significant amount of money. This, too, appears to be a particularly small percentage, because the cost of financing at higher rates is potentially quite high. Clearly, farmers might obtain benefits from shopping more diligently before borrowing money. On the other hand, 24% of the farmers surveyed reported they compared rates and services every time they borrowed additional funds.\nIn addition to traditional lenders, nontraditional lenders-such as equipment manufacturers-offer financing for intermediate-term assets. Farmers may also take advantage of short-term vendor financing for operating inputs. Using a five-point Likert scale (where 1 = never and 5 = always), farmers were asked how frequently they used dealer/supplier financing when making purchases of feed, machinery, etc. The results of our study indicate these sources are \"frequently\" and \"sometimes,\" but rarely \"always\" used to finance purchases. For instance, 17% of the 92 farmers responding to this question indicated they never used these sources of financing. Thirty-five percent stated they sometimes used these sources. However, more respondents reported they seldom (33%) or never (17%) used these sources than indicated they always (1%) or frequently (14%) used the sources.\nA series of questions were asked to identify the methods used by farmers to calculate the effective interest rates for various types of financing (Table 10 ). The responses suggest farmers examine offers from traditional lenders less rigorously than they investigate lending offers from nontraditional lenders or vendors. For example, only 14% of the respondents always evaluated the impact of fees, patronage refunds, or stock purchase requirements on the effective interest rates. In fact, more producers seldom or never considered these factors (44%) than always or frequently considered these important terms of a loan agreement (32%). This result reveals that many producers make rate comparisons based on stated rates of interest, and are not calculating the impact of fees on rates.\nIn contrast, 32% of the respondents claimed to always calculate the effects of cash discounts foregone on the effective interest rate for feed/seed financing. Likewise, when financing machinery, 30% indicated they always considered the impact of rebates, terms, and interest rates on the effective interest rate. In aggregate, the results reported in Table 10 point to a perception by some farmers that the financing offered by nontraditional lenders may be significantly influenced by the fees or costs associated with the purchase. Yet, there are also many among the surveyed farmers who either are not concerned with non-interest costs or perceive these fees do not differ substantially across lenders.\nMany nontraditional lenders, as well as some traditional lenders, offer a variety of leasing programs. Leasing is not frequently used by the farmers in our survey (Table 11) .

With this in mind, we focus on responsibilities related to acquiring debt capital and leasing. Generally, the financial manager must identify lenders, evaluate the cost of credit, determine an appropriate capital structure for the 1 It is still somewhat unusual for a farm to issue debt securities which are traded in public markets. The options for raising equity are also limited. It is very unlikely that a farm's equity claims will be traded in a liquid market. While these methods of raising capital are important, the current study focuses primarily on raising funds through loan agreements or controlling assets through leasing. business, and acquire necessary capital (Table 1, As hypothesized by Nasr, Barry, and Ellinger, leverage could be related to efficiency because lenders prefer to lend to more efficient farmers (the credit evaluation concept), or farmers with more debt are forced to become more efficient to satisfy their creditors (the free cash flow argument). Studies of the determinants of capital structure have typically examined how various factors, such as tax rate, government policy, risk, and the costs of raising various types of funds, influence capital structure (Collins; Featherstone, Moss, Baker, and Preckel; Ahrendsen, Collender, and Dixon; Jensen and Langemeier; Barry, Bierlen, and Sotomayor) ."}, {"section_title": "Description of Data", "text": "The financial data used in this analysis were obtained from Cornell University's Dairy Farm Business Summary (DFBS) program (Knoblauch, Putnam, and Karszes) . The DFBS records of each farm include a complete set of financial statements, detailed data regarding production practices and efficiency, and operator characteristics. The financial information collected and the statements produced by the DFBS generally conform to the guidelines established by the Farm Financial Standards Council (1997).\nCooperative Extension educators enroll farms in the DFBS program, and collect and verify financial information provided by the farmers. Dairy is the primary enterprise for all of the farms in the DFBS, with dairy sales accounting for 90% of cash receipts for nearly all of the farms in the 2001 summary. A mail questionnaire was used to collect supplementary information concerning the financial management practices of participating farms. All of the farmers who returned a DFBS report in 2000 were identified for sampling, resulting in a sample of 352 farms."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Survey Instrument", "text": "The survey instrument asked farmers to respond to a variety of questions regarding business analysis/control, investment analysis/decision making, and capital acquisition practices.\n3 A pretest of the survey instrument was conducted with extension educators and farm management and finance faculty. The financial management section of the questionnaire contained 79 response variables. As an incentive for participation, farmers were offered an individual report based on their responses to the general management questions and a copy of the results of the financial management study. The survey was mailed to farmers in the fall of 2001, with a reminder post card sent to nonrespondents one month later.\nOf the 352 questionnaires mailed, 149 were returned.

Farmers who reported their 2000 results to the DFBS later than this date were not included in the sample. Of the 352 farmers who completed the report, 21 provided incomplete or inaccurate financial data.\n3 The questionnaire also asked farmers about their goals and included a series of questions from the Management Development Questionnaire. These questions are designed to measure a respondent's capabilities in various general management areas. The responses to these questions are not reported here. they did not wish to participate in the study. The 137 completed questionnaires represent a response rate of roughly 39%. The original sample consisted of farms for which a DFBS report was completed for 2000, and for some of those farms, no DFBS report was completed for 2001. In order to provide the greatest correspondence between the dates of the financial records and the financial management practices survey, the study considers respondents who both returned the financial management questionnaire and submitted a completed DFBS report for 2001.\nThis final screening resulted in 92 of the 137 survey instruments being usable for the analysis. Because respondents occasionally made errors at various places throughout the questionnaire, or chose not to answer a particular question, the number of farms responding to any particular question is potentially less than 92.\nThe farm operators who complete the DFBS do so voluntarily and are not necessarily representative of the New York dairy industry. The respondents also voluntarily chose to complete and return the questionnaire. Completion of the financial management questionnaire was not required for participation in the DFBS program.\nThe dairy farm was a source of full-time employment for at least one manager for all of the respondents, and 10 of the respondents were dairy farm renters. "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A comparison of profitability shows the survey respondents were slightly more profitable than the average DFBS farm ( Table 2 ). The pre-tax rate of return on assets (ROA) was calculated according to equation (1):\nWhen calculating ROA with appreciation, appreciation in the value of capital assets is included in net farm income. When calculating ROA without appreciation, net farm income excludes appreciation in the value of capital assets. In both cases, net farm income is calculated using accrual adjustments. The cost of operator labor and management is the operator's estimate of the value of the labor and management. Neither ROA measure includes nonfarm income.\nAs observed from Table 2 , the general level of profitability of these farms was relatively high in 2001, when the average respondent generated a pre-tax rate of return on assets (ROA) with appreciation of 10.3% and a pre-tax ROA without appreciation of 5.92%. The level of profitability was in part due to high milk prices and low feed prices in that year. In 2000, the average ROA with appreciation was 3.17% and 1.17% for all DFBS participants and survey respondents, respectively. While the relative proportions of debt and equity used to finance the operations of respondents and DFBS participants were nearly identical, interest expenses were greater for the survey respondents. This is due to the fact that respondent farms had larger farms, and thus more debt. In comparison to national farm averages, the average proportion of equity on DFBS farms was relatively low at 65%. Nearly all of the respondents (98%) and DFBS participants (97%) have some debt. This proportion is not typical of the agricultural sector. According to the 1997 Census of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Agriculture), 42% of all farms incurred interest expenses. However, the survey respondents in our study operate much larger farms than the \"average\" U.S. farm.\nFarmers participating in the survey were asked a series of questions designed to provide basic information regarding their use of and attitudes toward financial management practices in each of the fundamental areas of financial management. The results for each of the areas are discussed below. Table 3 presents summary statistics of farmers' use of various business analysis practices. The practice of benchmarking, or comparing the farm's financial performance to other peer farms, was adopted rather widely by the farmers surveyed (66%). This high level of adoption was expected, given that access to benchmarking reports is one incentive for participation in the DFBS. A large proportion of the farm operators (85%) indicated they used a comparison of their farm's annual profitability and the farm's financial efficiency over time in order to make decisions. Surprisingly, 76% of the farmers reported they held a formal business analysis meeting to review financial performance in order to assess and make appropriate changes to their operation."}, {"section_title": "Business Analysis/Control Practices", "text": "The financial budget is a critical financial management and control tool (Table 4) . Slightly over half of the farm operators (52%) reported they prepared annual written financial budgets. This result is consistent with our expectations because nearly all of the businesses are borrowing money, and a budget is an essential tool for preparing to borrow funds and demonstrate repayment capacity. A common point at which farmers may decide to make a budget is when undertaking a major change in their business operation. Although a written financial budget is not prepared annually, 19% of the respondents indicated they prepared a budget when they were making a major change in their business. Combining these two categories, Table 4 reveals that 71% of those surveyed were preparing written financial budgets. While this response rate may appear to be an exceptionally high proportion of survey respondents, it is important to remember that they are participants in the DFBS, which requires preparation and submission of annual financial statements.\nWhen conducting benchmarking or trend analysis, it is necessary to identify appropriate measures of financial performance. Respondents were presented with a list of six performance measures and asked to choose the single performance measure they most frequently used to assess farm performance (Table 5) .\nThree of the six measures-net cash income, accrual net farm income, and rate of return on assets-are measures of profitability. Net cash income was by far the most popular measure (39%) of "}, {"section_title": "% of Farmers", "text": "Net cash income 39\nGross (total) cash income 4\nAccrual net farm income 25\nCheckbook balance 15\nReturn on assets 10\nMilk production per cow 7\nNotes: N = 89; only one response allowed.\nfinancial performance. Although somewhat useful for tracking a farm's profitability over time, net cash income is biased by changes in inventory and unpaid resources. Accrual net farm income was the second most popular measure (25%). Because many farmers used trend analyses to track the performance of their business over time, this is a very appropriate measure of profitability. Ten percent of farm operators reported the rate of return on assets was their preferred performance measure.\nSurprisingly, many farmers indicated a preference for less reliable measures of financial performance. When combined, checkbook balance (15%), milk production per cow (7%), and gross cash income (4%) were used by approximately the same proportion of farmers (26%) as those using accrual net farm income (25%)."}, {"section_title": "Investment Analysis/Decision Making", "text": "Much of the attention in an upper-division agricultural finance class is often devoted to analysis of capital investments. Capital assets, such as facilities or equipment, require large initial expenditures and generate cash flows for a considerable period of time. There are many methods the farm manager might use to evaluate such an investment. Respondents were presented with three possible investments: a major facility expansion of more than 25%, an equipment replacement, and an increase in herd size of 10%. They were then asked to identify the investment analysis techniques they used to evaluate each type of investment. The sample investment analysis techniques listed were the payback period, projected cash flow (or ability to make loan payments), and a discounted cash flow technique such as net present value or internal rate of return (a space was also provided for respondents to write in additional methods).\nIt was expected that more types of analyses and more sophisticated techniques would be used for the facility expansion, which represented the largest investment. For instance, the farmer might examine his or her ability to make loan payments and also conduct a net present value analysis. Because conducting a net present value analysis of equipment replacement is somewhat complicated and generally less critical than a major facility expansion, few producers were expected to use this method of analysis for an equipment replacement decision.\nFor all three investment scenarios, the ability to make loan payments was the most common method used to evaluate an investment (Table 6 ). This analysis technique was most commonly used for facility expansions (75%), which would typically require a loan agreement. Only a small proportion of farmers indicated the use of discounted cash flow techniques like NPV analysis and, as expected, the smallest proportion (8%) were using this technique when making an equipment replacement. The lack of application of discounted cash flow analyses is not necessarily surprising, but rather disappointing. The payback period was used by at least 40% of the respondents to evaluate all of the investments.\nWhile the finding of widespread use of cash flow or loan repayment analysis was encouraging, it is worth noting that 25% of these farmers would not use such a technique when making a major facility expansion. It is also important to remember these farmers are already members of a record-keeping program (the DFBS), suggesting that, on average, they are likely to be more financially sophisticated than the general population of farmers.\nTwo clear challenges arise from this result. The first is to educate the producers not using these techniques by clarifying why such methods are important. The second is to increase the level of sophistication in the educational efforts directed at farmers who are already using cash flow analyses.\nTo better understand how farmers analyzed their investment decisions, survey participants were asked about the process by which they created a cash flow budget for a major capital investment. Questions were posed regarding the process used to develop cash flow budgets (Table 7) and conduct profitability analyses (Table 8) .\nRespondents were asked to select the method they most commonly used for each The combined proportion of farmers not making a cash flow budget (3%) or calculating the budget in their head (18%) was nearly as great as the proportion of farmers who created a spreadsheet budget on their computer (28%) ( Table 7) . Many of the respondents (39%) used detailed written calculations to create their cash flow budgets. Surprisingly, only 4% allowed the lender to make their cash flow budget with little of their input.\nBased on the large proportion of respondents who reported they conduct detailed written calculations (39%), this analysis technique appears to be very important to producers. Consequently, an opportunity may exist to educate these producers about the ease with which computer spreadsheets can be used to create cash flow budgets, or direct them to resources available on many university websites. Similarly, an opportunity likely exists to inform these producers about the importance of sensitivity analyses, and demonstrate the ease with which these analyses can be conducted on the computer. Similar results were found for the case of conducting a profitability analysis for a major capital investment (Table 8) . However, more respondents (12%) reported they did not conduct a profitability analysis, and 17% calculated profitability in their head. These combined responses (29%) represent a surprisingly large proportion of the farmers, suggesting more farmers focus on the ability to repay a loan than on the profitability of a particular investment."}, {"section_title": "Always Frequently Sometimes Seldom Never", "text": "costs of leasing. For example, 37% indicated they never based leasing decisions on tax savings alone. On the other hand, 19% always or frequently based their decision on this factor. Because 48% of the respondents reported they always or frequently considered both taxes and terminal values when making leasing decisions, most farmers likely recognize the importance of these parameters in calculating leasing costs. The magnitude of the lease payment is one of the most easily observed components of a lease. Most farmers understand that basing a leasing decision only on the magnitude of the lease payment is a poor evaluation strategy. Only 6% stated they always or frequently based leasing decisions on the amount of the lease payment alone, while 69% seldom or never used this metric alone.\nUsing a discounted cash flow technique to evaluate tax savings and terminal values is one of the most rigorous methods for evaluating the costs of leasing. Surprisingly, 21% of survey respondents indicated they always or frequently made this comparison (Table 11) . And not surprisingly, 63% either seldom or never used this method in making a leasing decision-presenting a potential instructive opportunity for farm management educators."}, {"section_title": "Financial Management Practices and Profitability", "text": "Next, we examine the linkage between the adoption of financial management practices and profitability. This linkage is likely quite complicated. While efforts were made to select variables that are less likely to be endogenous with profitability, the potential for an endogenous relationship is quite high, and reasonable instruments for the financial management variables are difficult to obtain. Here, profitability is hypothesized to be a function of the farmer's personal and business characteristics, business analysis/control, investment analysis/ decision making, and capital acquisition practices. The general hypotheses to be tested are rather obvious. Farms whose operators have adopted financial management practices are expected to be more profitable than farms whose operators have not adopted the practices.\nROA with appreciation and ROA without appreciation served as the dependent variables in the regression analyses. The models that were estimated are given by equation (3):\nwhere ROA is the percentage rate of return on assets for the year 2001 (e.g., an ROA of 5% was entered as 5.00). ROA with appreciation served as a dependent variable in one model and ROA without appreciation served as a dependent variable in another. The $ i notations are parameters to be estimated, and g is a normally distributed error term. The explanatory variables Cows, Age, Education, and Equity account for the personal and business characteristics of each farm. Cows denotes the average herd size of the farm for 2001, Age is the age of the primary decision maker in years, Education indicates the years of formal education obtained by the primary decision maker, and Equity is the percentage of farm assets financed with equity.\nThe Benchmark, Trend, and Meeting variables measure the use of business analysis/control practices. Benchmark identifies producers who used a comparison of their farm's annual profitability and financial efficiency to other farms in decision making (1 = yes, 0 = no); Trend identifies producers who track and compare measures of profitability and financial efficiency for their own farm over time (1 = yes, 0 = no); and Meeting identifies producers who hold a formal business analysis or review meeting each year (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nThe variables EffRateT, EffRateV, EffRateM, and LsEval measure the impact of strategies to assess or lower the cost of capital. Based on a five-point Likert scale, respondents were asked to indicate how frequently (1 = never, 5 = always) they considered various factors when assessing the cost of capital obtained from various sources.\nEffRateT measures how frequently the respondent determined the effect of fees, patronage refunds, or stock purchase requirements on effective interest rates; EffRateV measures how frequently respondents considered cash discounts foregone when evaluating the effective interest rate for feed/seed financing; EffRateM measures how frequently respondents consider rebates, terms, and interest rates when evaluating the effective interest rate on machinery financing; and LsEval measures how frequently the respondent includes taxes and terminal values in calculations to evaluate leases.\nThe investment analysis/decision making practices of the farmers were measured with the CFMajor and Written indicator variables (1= yes, 0 = no). CFMajor identifies respondents who indicated they used either the payback period, projected cash flow (ability to make loan payments), or discounted cash flow techniques (such as net present value or internal rate of return) to evaluate a major expansion. Written identifies producers who conducted a profitability analysis for a major capital investment using a detailed written analysis, a computer spreadsheet, or hired a consultant or accountant to conduct the analysis (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nThe linear regression models were estimated with ordinary least squares using the REG procedure in SAS version 8.01 (SAS Institute, Inc.). The parameter estimates and model fit statistics are shown in Table 12 (ROA with appreciation) and Table13 (ROA without appreciation). In both cases, the F-statistic for the joint significance of the parameters is large enough to comfortably reject the hypothesis that the parameters explain no variation in the dependent variable.\nThe condition number calculated as the ratio of the square roots of the largest to smallest eigenvalues of the data matrix was 53.8, and the greatest variance inflation factor was 15.5. Because the independent variables were the same for both models, the values were likewise identical. The Breusch and Pagan test for heteroskedasticity failed to reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity for both models. In the discussion that follows, the results for the ROA with appreciation model are presented first, followed by the results for the ROA without appreciation model."}, {"section_title": "Results: Rate of Return on Assets with Appreciation", "text": "ROA with appreciation is an important measure of the economic return generated by the business. Because many of the financial management decisions made by the farmer involve the purchase of capital assets, it is reasonable to include changes in the value of these assets. Of the business and personal characteristics, parameters for the herd size (Cows) and herd size squared (Cows 2 ) variables indicate (other things equal) profitability initially increases as herd size increases, reaches a peak, and then begins to decline as herd size continues to increase (Table  12 ). Based on the estimated parameters, the size effect would turn negative at approximately 816 cows.\nThe proportion of equity used to finance the farm (Equity) also had a positive impact on profitability. Of course, this result is difficult to explain because the dependent variable is rate of return on assets (ROA), and it appears to indicate that, on average, firms with less debt held more profitable assets. The impacts of the Age and Education variables were not statistically different from zero.\nNone of the business analysis/control variables considered had a marginal effect that was statistically different from zero. While the practices are widely adopted, their adoption does not appear to influence profitability in this sample of farms. The lack of variation in the adoption of these practices is one likely explanation for this result.\nIt is worth noting that the analysis did not compare the financial performance of farms whose operators do not keep records to those whose operators maintain financial records. If this comparison were made, the adoption of basic business analysis/control practices would be expected to influence profitability. It is also possible that farmers have not been able to translate the results of these analyses into more effective managerial decision making. It might also be argued that the questions incorporated into the model did not adequately differentiate farmers who employ effective business analysis and control practices. The results for the investment analysis/ decision-making variables are encouraging. Here, farmers who used either payback period, cash flow (ability to make loan payments), or discounted cash flow techniques to evaluate a major expansion were significantly more profitable than their peers. The size of the marginal effect was large. Other things equal, the ROA of farmers who conducted these analyses was 636 basis points greater than the ROA of their peers.\nA similar result was obtained when considering the process a farmer used to evaluate the profitability of a major capital investment. Here, farmers who conducted a detailed written analysis, used a computer spreadsheet, or hired a consultant or accountant to conduct a profitability analysis generated an ROA which was 376 basis points greater than farmers who did not conduct an analysis, conducted it in their head, or let the lender make the analysis with little input.\nThe above findings provide evidence that there are positive returns to investment analysis. It is also interesting to compare the magnitude of the marginal effects of these financial management variables to the herd size variables. While significant economies of scale exist in dairy production, these results suggest the ability to increase profits through the adoption of better investment analysis/ decision-making practices is equal, if not greater.\nWith respect to the variables intended to measure the impact of the role of capital acquisition practices, only one (EffRateV ) was significantly different from zero. The parameter for this variable indicates (other things equal) farmers who more frequently calculate the impact of cash discounts foregone when evaluating the effective rate of interest for feed/seed financing are substantially more profitable than their peers.\nIt is interesting that the variables which measured the evaluation of effective rates on other types of financing were not significant. This finding may suggest there are frequently good and bad deals available on vendor-financed products such as feed and seed, but less variation in commercial lender offerings. Producers who evaluate the effective interest rates would be more likely to identify these good or bad deals."}, {"section_title": "Results: Rate of Return on Assets without Appreciation", "text": "Because the earnings of farm businesses are heavily influenced by appreciation in the value of capital assets, ROA without appreciation was used to examine the impact of financial management practices on the realized earnings of the business. The results for the ROA without appreciation are shown in Table 13 . The conclusions drawn from this analysis are similar to those for the analysis including appreciation, but a few major differences emerge.\nFirst, the parameter estimates are smaller in magnitude because ROA without appreciation is generally less than ROA with appreciation. Most of the statistically significant relationships hold with the same directional effects. However, the parameter estimate for the variable identifying farmers who conducted a detailed written analysis, used a computer spreadsheet, or hired a consultant or accountant to conduct a profitability analysis (Written) is no longer different from zero at the 10% confidence level. This result might suggest that investment analyses are less important when considering only the realized earnings generated by the operation of the business. This outcome is not entirely surprising, as a substantial component of the return to capital asset investments in agriculture is generated by changes in the value of the capital assets.\nSecond, the variable measuring how frequently farmers used rebates, terms, and interest rates to evaluate the effective rate on machinery financing (EffRateM) is negative and statistically different from zero at the 10% level. This result is difficult to explain because it implies farmers who always evaluate these costs are less profitable than peers who evaluate these costs less frequently. A possible explanation is that this variable is identifying farmers who are forced to rely on this type of financing or farmers who more frequently purchase machinery."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This study has examined the financial management practices of a surveyed group of 92 New York dairy farms. Financial management practices were divided into three areas: business analysis and control, investment analysis and decision making, and capital acquisition. The results provide estimates of the extent to which various financial management practices have been adopted. For instance, trend analysis was the most commonly used business analysis method. While many farm operators chose to measure performance with accrual net farm income or the rate of return on assets, many also chose measures such as milk production per cow or gross sales as their preferred approach for assessing performance. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents prepared a written financial budget, either annually or at least before making major changes in their operation. Clearly, many farmers recognize the importance of investment analysis techniques. The most widely adopted investment analysis practice was to conduct a cash flow analysis to assess the ability to repay a loan. Survey results show only 16% of the farms were using discounted cash flow techniques to evaluate a major capital investment. This rate of adoption is substantially below the adoption rate for larger, corporate firms such as those surveyed by Graham and Harvey. Because these techniques have been taught by agricultural economists for quite some time, this finding is disappointing.\nOn the other hand, the survey results suggest a willingness by many producers to analyze investments in a rigorous manner. Roughly half of the farmers surveyed either input data on a spreadsheet or used detailed written calculations to conduct cash flow or profitability analyses. Consequently, there is clearly a continuing need to educate producers on the mechanics and merits of such analyses.\nWith respect to the capital acquisition practices used by farm managers, the results point to the need for additional education to assist producers in accurately estimating the cost of borrowed funds. Farmers appear to realize that credit obtained through vendors and equipment suppliers is sometimes attractive and sometimes unattractive. However, many do not frequently evaluate all of the non-interest costs of a loan and may not fully understand how these features can impact the cost of borrowed funds. Although nearly all of the farmers surveyed were using debt to fund their operations, many did not frequently compare the rates and services of various lenders. Implementing such simple strategies designed to take advantage of the power of competitive markets may improve the financial performance of farm operations.\nThe results regarding the impact of financial management practices on profitability are a first attempt at examining this relationship. Further work is needed to assess the impact of the adoption of financial management practices on farm profitability. It is important to examine the specific mechanisms through which these strategies might impact profitability. For example, it would seem likely that capital acquisition strategies should improve profitability by lowering the cost of capital, investment analysis techniques should result in the acquisition of more productive assets, and business analysis and control practices should help control operating expenses. Additional work is needed to relate the adoption of these strategies to the specific measure of farm financial performance they are most likely to influence. Likewise, it would be useful to gather data on the adoption of these practices from other types of farm businesses.\nThe study also took a first step toward estimating the impact of financial management practices on farm profitability. While the results should be interpreted with caution, the analyses lead to some rather basic conclusions. For instance, the greatest returns to financial management practices appear to be generated in the investment analysis/ decision-making area. Farmers who conducted detailed financial analyses were substantially more profitable than those farmers who performed the calculations \"in their head\" or did not make the calculations at all-a finding which demonstrates there are positive returns to conducting detailed financial analyses.\nEvidence was also uncovered suggesting that producers who used some form of investment analysis-whether it be the payback period, cash flow analysis to assess repayment, or discounted cash flow analysis-were substantially more profitable than their peers. Thus, producers who wish to improve performance may benefit from applying appropriate investment analysis techniques.\nThe results for the capital acquisition and business analysis areas are somewhat less definitive. Given that there appear to be such strong relationships between investment analysis and profitability, it seems likely there are positive returns to the other financial management areas as well. However, with respect to acquiring capital, it must be recognized that producers are constrained by their financial resources and creditworthiness.\nIn addition, competitive markets may result in similar net rates for individual businesses."}]
