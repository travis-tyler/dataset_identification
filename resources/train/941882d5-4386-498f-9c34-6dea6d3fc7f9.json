[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is an incurable neurological condition that results in a progressive mental deterioration. Although definitive diagnosis of AD is difficult, in practice, AD diagnosis is largely based on clinical history and neuropsychological data including magnetic resource imaging (MRI). Increasing research has been reported on applying machine learning to AD recognition in recent years. This paper presents our latest contribution to the advance. It describes an automatic AD recognition algorithm that is based on deep learning on 3D brain MRI. The algorithm uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to fulfil AD recognition. It is unique in that the three dimensional topology of brain is considered as a whole in AD recognition, resulting in an accurate recognition. The CNN used in this study consists of three consecutive groups of processing layers, two fully connected layers and a classification layer. In the structure, every one of the three groups is made up of three layers, including a convolutional layer, a pooling layer and a normalization layer. The algorithm was trained and tested using the MRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The data used include the MRI scanning of about 47 AD patients and 34 normal controls. The experiment had shown that the proposed algorithm delivered a high AD recognition accuracy with a sensitivity of 1and a specificity of 0.93."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Dementia describes a collection of symptoms that are caused by disorders affecting the brain. There are more than 46.8 million people worldwide with dementia today and 131.5 million predicted by 2050 [1] . There are many types of dementia, of which Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form. Although considerable efforts have been made to unravel the pathophysiologic mechanisms of dementia and develop effective treatments, definitive diagnosis of dementia is mostly difficult. In searching for an effective way of diagnosing AD, some computer-aided systems have been investigated to diagnose AD. These systems are based on machine learning using clinical history information and neuropsychological data including magnetic resource imaging (MRI), structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET).\nDeep learning (DL) simulates the hierarchical structure of human brain, processes data from lower levels to higher levels, and gradually composes more and more semantic concepts. As a new machine learning paradigm, deep learning has been increasingly explored in the development of technology for big data and artificial intelligence [2] [3] [4] . Some deep learning based algorithms have been proposed recently to recognise, or detect, AD. [5] presented a deep learning method consisted of sparse autoencoders and 3D convolutional neural networks. It can predict the disease status of a patient based on MRI scan. It achieved 95% accuracy when predicting between AD brains and healthy brains. [6] presented a multimodal neuroimaging feature extraction pipeline for multiclass AD diagnosis. It developed a deep-learning framework using a zero-masking strategy to preserve all possible information encoded in imaging data. It achieved high accuracy of 87%. [7] outlined deep learning-based pipelines employed to distinguish Alzheimer's MRI and fMRI from normal healthy control data for a given age group. It almost perfectly distinguished Alzheimer's patients from healthy normal brains. [8] proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network. The network was built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Experiments on the adopted MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing had shown that it outperformed several conventional classifiers by accuracy.\nThis paper introduces an automatic AD recognition algorithm that is based on deep learning on 3D brain MRI. In Section 2, we describe the algorithm in detail, including its major steps. In Section 3, we describe the results of the experiments of applying the proposed algorithm on real MRI data, and the related performance discussion. Finally, in Section 4, we conclude by summarising the approach and pointing out possible future pursuits in the area."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The proposed AD recognition system can be completed in two processes including system training and practical testing.

In particular, the recognition algorithm starts from using MRI data as input, pre-processes the data to increase recognition accuracy, then completes the recognition using convolutional neural networks. The following subsections describe these steps."}, {"section_title": "Data Collecting and Pre-Processing", "text": "The proposed system is built and tested with the MRI data acquired from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database [9] . The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early AD.\nThe data used include the MRI scans of about 47 AD patients and 34 normal controls (NC) from ADNI1. They are all from different subjects, making the recognition performance test more reliable. The scans are T1-weighted, acquired according to the ADNI acquisition protocol. They are 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. The sequence was undergone a series of pre-processing including Gradwarp, B1 non-uniformity, N3, and scale.\nGradwarp is a system specific correction of image geometry distortion due to gradient non-linearity. B1 non-uniformity correction employs B1 calibration scans to correct the image intensity non-uniformity that results when RF transmission is performed with a more uniform body coil while reception is performed with a less uniform head coil. N3 is a histogram peak sharpening algorithm which is applied to all images. It is applied after grad warp and after B1 correction. N3 will reduce intensity non-uniformity due to the wave or the dielectric effect. In scaling, the image is scaled based on the spatial scale factors that are collected from a local phantom."}, {"section_title": "CNN Network Structure", "text": "The algorithm uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to fulfil AD recognition.
