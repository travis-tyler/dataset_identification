Here we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify novel genetic determinants that were correlated with white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) among non-demented elders.\nMethods: Three hundred and fifty non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects aged 55 to 80 years were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Associations of WMHV with genetic polymorphisms were explored using multiple linear regression under an additive genetic model. Further studies were conducted to explore the influence of genetic variants on cognition-related phenotypes.\nResults: Rs7220676 near HS3ST3A1 and MIR548H3 genes was associated with WMHV levels at genome-wide significance (P = 2.96 \u00d7 10 -8 ). Single nucleotide polymorphisms comprising rs9675262 (near HS3ST3A1 and MIR548H3 gene, P = 1.15 \u00d7 10 -7 ), rs9820240 (in DCLK3 gene, P = 2.23 \u00d7 10 -7 ), rs10916409 (near ISCA1P2 gene, P = 4.55 \u00d7 10 -6 ), and rs540422 (in PICALM gene, P = 9.68 \u00d7 10 -6 ) were identified as suggestive loci linked to WMHV levels. The minor allele of rs7220676 (C) showed association with lower log (WMHV) in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, rs7220676 was correlated with rates of cognitive decline assessed by Mini-mental State Examination and memory scores.\nA novel locus near HS3ST3A1 and MIR548H3 genes was associated with WMHV levels and it may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are regions of increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences of the brain. 1 The extent of WMH has been correlated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 2, 3 , dementia 4, 5 , as well as cortical atrophy 6 .\nBesides, WMH may contribute to the progression from MCI to dementia. 5, 7 The severity of WMH increased among patients diagnosed as clinical or preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), 1, 8 which reliably predicts who are at risk of developing AD, 9 and predicts rate of cognitive decline among AD individuals. 10 As for the interaction between WMH and AD pathology, WMH may not only be an independent process causing dementia in combination with coexisting yet unrelated AD pathology, but also lead directly to AD pathology by increasing amyloid accumulation rates due to ischemic disorders or by inducing ischemia because of amyloid accumulation in the vessels (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). [11] [12] [13] [14] These lines of evidence together indicated that WMH might be involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders and be promising in monitoring cognitive progression at early stage, and assessing treatment efficacy in clinical practice or drug trials.\nAlthough previous articles have uncovered some loci that affect WMH volume (WMHV), the associations of these genetic modulators with disease risk remain poorly understood. A recent meta-analysis revealed that PLEKHG1 was linked to WMHV and ischemic stroke, motivating further identification of WMHV-associated loci. 15 The application of quantitative phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) shed light on associations between genes and their correlated pathways. 16 Moreover, MRI measurements have great strengths in monitoring changes in brain structure and function, such as adequate sensitivity, non-invasiveness, ease of access, and good tolerance. 17 And WMHV can be reliably measured in vivo.

We identified genome-wide significant associations of a novel SNP (rs7220676) near HS3ST3A1 and MIR548H3 HS3ST3A1 gene has been reported to be involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 23 , Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia 24, 25 , lung cancer 26 , and respiratory papillomatosis 27 . However, no research has explored the relationships between HS3ST3A1 gene and cognitive disorders. MIR548H3 gene is a member of micro Ribonucleic Acid (microRNA) family, which participates in the post-transcriptional modulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms through influencing the stability and translation of messenger Ribonucleic Acids (mRNAs). 28 Accumulating evidence showed that microRNAs might play an important role in the development of central nervous system and neuropsychiatric diseases, 29, 30 and the potential 13 associations of MIR548H3 gene with neuroticism 30 , epilepsy and mild intellectual disability 31 have been discussed in previous studies. At present, the specific mechanisms through which MIR548H3 regulates cognition-related diseases remain poorly understood. There are several fundamental issues that need to be addressed, for example, whether microRNAs are particularly important in specific neurodegenerative diseases and which microRNA targets are linked to the disease, etc. Collectively, there is still a long way to go for research on the mechanism between the novel loci and cognitive function.\nThere was a suggestive SNP in the PICALM gene. The involvement of this gene in cognitive impairment has been highlighted. As one of the most highly validated AD risk factors, PICALM\ncan be expressed in all tissues, and it shows prominent expression in neurons, where it is non-selectively distributed in the pre-and postsynaptic structures. 32 Mutations in PICALM can cause synaptic perturbations, possibly through synaptic vesicle cycling, thus increasing the risk of AD. Alternatively, PICALM may influence AD risk through amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking via endocytic pathways, causing changes in amyloid beta (A\u03b2) levels. 32 This evidence also got support from the biological aspect. One experiment in yeast, nematodes, and rat cortical neurons confirmed the role of PICALM in suppressing the toxicity of soluble A\u03b2 oligomers and linking A\u03b2 to the genetics of AD. 33 Moreover, the impact of PICALM on disproportionate frontal damage, executive dysfunction 34 , hippocampal degeneration 35 , Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) 36 provided further evidence support. However, the regions on chromosome 3 (DCLK3) and 1 (ISCA1P2) associated with WMHV have not been previously shown to have correlations with cognitive disorders. DCLK3 can modulate the expression of many genes participating in transcriptional regulation and nucleosome/chromatin remodeling in a kinase-dependent way. The kinase that DCLK3 expressed is preferentially distributed in neurons of the striatum and dentate gyrus, and DCLK3 may produce neuroprotection against Huntington's disease. 37 Also, DCLK3 may promote colorectal cancer progression, 38 and involve in the development of glaucoma. 39 But the function of ISCA1P2 has never been investigated. Further studies are especially warranted to explore how DCLK3 and ISCA1P2 genes mediate the progression of cognitive diseases.\nCompared with previous articles similar to our topic, [40] [41] [42] [43] this study was conducted in a different population and has found novel loci associated with WMHV in non-demented elders.\nAlthough some suggestive SNPs didn't reach the genome-wide significance level, they may have the potential significance in other studies with sample enrichment. When controlling for rs7220676 genotypes, the nearby association signals diminished, which indicated that the associations in nearby loci might be driven by rs7220676. Besides, the associations of rs7220676 genotypes with WMHV were not significant among the population with heart disease or normal BMI, which may be due to the insufficient sample. Given that the relationship between rs7220676\nand vascular factors has never been reported, it's difficult to explain the specific mechanisms.\nAfter the GWAS scan, we assessed associations of rs7220676 with other cognition-related endophenotypes. Interestingly, the minor allele of rs7220676 (C) was associated with change rate of MEM score in HC population rather than in MCI patients. It could thus reasonably be implied that the modifying effects of rs7220676 might be more evident in subjects with normal cognition.\nOur research suggested that rs7220676 might be associated with cognitive disease among non-demented elders, and further studies are needed to confirm this.\nSome limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, the sample size for analysis was relatively small especially in subgroup analyses, leading to limited ability to identify variants with small effects. Secondly, only non-Hispanic Caucasians were included to avoid population stratification across ethnicities, which limited the generalizability of this study. Thirdly, we applied a stringent In conclusion, we identified novel genome-wide significant associations of a SNP (rs7220676) near HS3ST3A1 and MIR548H3 genes and 4 additional suggestive association loci (in DCLK3, PICALM genes, near ISCA1P2, HS3ST3A1 and MIR548H3 genes) with baseline WMHV levels.\nThe mechanisms underlying the associations between these novel genetic loci and cognitive disorders are worth exploring. Besides, further validation of these novel genetic associations in large samples and different populations is warranted. "}]
