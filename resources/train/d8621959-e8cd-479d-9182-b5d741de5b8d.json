[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: This article examines the range of eighth-grade mathematics learning opportunities in the U.S. drawing on data gathered for the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Sources of variation in the provision of learning opportunities are identified and patterns of eighth grade mathematics course offerings are compared across schools. Comparison of students' learning opportunities includes consideration of the specific course in which they were enrolled, the type of textbook employed for the course, and the proportion of time teachers devoted to teaching specific topics. Analyses revealed a mismatch between the mathematics course title and the textbook employed in the course for nearly 30 percent of U.S. eighth grade students. Course-textbook combinations demonstrated significant relationships with the time teachers devoted to specific topics and the international topic difficulty score. Some differences in mathematics learning opportunities were found on the basis of a school's location (urban, rural, suburban), size, and percent minority enrollment. The authors contend that the significant relationships found were not consistent enough to provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed variation and that individual student differences, an often implicit rationale for tracking, also represents an inadequate explanation for the observed diversity in curricular opportunities. They conclude that recognizing the multiple definitions for students' classroom mathematics learning experiences is an important step in reform and policy discussions."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "schools tracking same-grade students into different mathematics courses has provided fuel for the common standards -i.e., the same or high standards-for-all -perspective (Raudenbush, Fotiu, & Cheong, 1998; Oakes & Lipton, 1990) . Indeed, standard U.S. practice in mathematics education appears to be unfocused and to lack coherence reflecting not a clear standard or expectation for students but, rather, a splintered vision.\nIn this article, we examine the diversity in the mathematics opportunities provided eighth grade students, identify sources of variation in what constitutes the mathematics students study, and explore some of the implications this variation holds for mathematics education policy discussions. Our research documents a striking lack of agreement in what constitutes the eighth grade mathematics studied and hence a great deal of diversity in opportunity to learn by U.S. students. Using data from the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), we uncovered considerable discord in the math courses offered eighth grade students, the topics presented in courses, and the type of textbook employed in them.\nVariation in the mathematics curriculum that students follow stems from three different sources: schools, courses, and classes (teachers). Students' mathematics opportunities vary from school to school as school leaders make different decisions about what type of mathematics courses will be offered to students. One school, for example, may decide that all students will follow a traditional eighth grade mathematics curriculum while another school decides to challenge all eighth graders with an Algebra I course.\nSchools create within their own buildings another source of variation when they decide to offer different types of mathematics courses to different groups of students in the same grade. This varies the curriculum from course to course. Depending on the school and the size of the student enrollment, schools may decide to offer two, three, or more different types of mathematics courses to as many different groups of students.\nFinally, given a specific type of course, the curriculum may vary from class to class reflecting variation in the instructional decisions teachers make about the specific topics that will be covered and how much time to spend on each topic.\nStudents' mathematics opportunities vary from school to school when schools, as a whole, specialize in particular academic or vocational areas. This specialization of schools represents the type of student tracking found in Europe in such countries as Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Typically in the U.S. even in those communities where schools do specialize, this does not occur in the middle grades but is reserved for high schools whereas in some European systems this tracking into different types of schools may begin immediately after elementary school (see, for example, Riquarts, 1997) . Nonetheless, in Belgium and The Netherlands, although students may be tracked into different types of schools at the beginning of the equivalent of seventh grade in the U.S., students in all types of schools follow a common core curriculum in mathematics for at least the first two years (Kuiper & Knuver, 1997; Monseur & Brusselmans-Dehairs, 1997) . In fact, in discussions with National Research Coordinators to identify the appropriate curriculum materials for inclusion in the curriculum analysis aspect of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) we discovered that for the vast majority of countries common standards governed the mathematics opportunities of all students across all types of schools at least through the U.S. equivalent of eighth grade.\nIn the U.S., 'tracking' typically refers to within school curriculum differentiation that varies the curriculum from course to course. The U.S. has a longstanding practice of exposing different students to different mathematics curricula providing opportunities for learning different clusters of topics even as early as the middle elementary grades. Typically elementary grade differentiation occurs informally within classrooms with students grouped according to mathematics ability for instructional purposes. Although all students in a given grade may use the same mathematics textbook, students in a classroom may be clustered together into several different ability groups and study different topics from the textbook or study the same topics at different paces (McKnight et al., 1987 , Oakes, Gamoran, & Page, 1992 . More formal differentiation is evident in middle schools and high schools which place students into various streams or tracks thus providing different courses or course sequences.\nSomehow, this practice has been perceived in the U.S. as more egalitarian than the tracking practices in many European and other countries in which students attend different types of schools that may ultimately lead to different types of diplomas, certificates, or degrees. This European-style tracking, representing paths to different end points, appears more similar to the concept encountered in U.S. tertiary education institutions of majors or fields of concentration. The decisions schools make to provide different courses to different groups of students represents an important part of the school to school variation one finds in the U.S. Nonetheless, within each U.S. school, the curriculum varies for students according to the course they follow. This practice we term content tracking to distinguish the peculiar U.S. practice of providing different groups of students within a school different curricula from the tracking in other countries that varies the curriculum across schools for the explicit purpose of arriving at different educational ends.\nWhether students are divided into groups within classrooms or into different courses within schools, the practice of tracking seems driven by the implicit assumption that this represents a reasonable, necessary, and efficient organization of learning in order to accommodate students' individual differences (Oakes & Lipton, 1990; Oakes, Gamoran, & Page, 1992) .\nMuch of the research on student tracking has focused on high schools and the relationship of tracking to school organization, student achievement, student course taking and future academic plans (Gamoran, 1987; Lee & Bryk, 1988; Lee, Smith, & Croninger, 1997; National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 1994; Oakes & Guiton, 1995; Oakes, with Ormseth, Bell, & Camp, 1990; Spade, Columba, & Vanfossen, 1997) . In this article, we extend the examination of tracking to eighth grade with the nationally representative sample of U.S. students in TIMSS. Tracking students into different mathematics learning opportunities dramatically affects what students learn (McKnight, et. al, 1987; Kifer, 1993) . In U.S. school systems, courses often follow a specific sequence, particularly for mathematics which is perceived to be much more hierarchical than other subjects (Stodolsky & Grossman, 1995) . Beyond what students learn in any one mathematics course, therefore, the specific course taken has a profound and lasting impact on students' future course-taking behaviors, academic preparedness for college, and their corresponding career options (Stevenson, Schiller, & Schneider, 1994; Riley, 1996) .\nIn the middle school context mathematics courses are often evoked by their typical titles in U.S. schools, with the implicit assumption that these course titles -such as general mathematics, prealgebra, algebra -have relatively unambiguous referents to a specific curriculum, i.e., the topics actually studied in a particular course bearing a specific title. However, research on the coverage and emphasis of specific topics in classroom instruction has consistently shown that these vary substantially from teacher to teacher (Schmidt, 1993 , Guiton & Oakes, 1995 Oakes et al., 1992; Wang, 1998) . To the extent that specific topic emphasis varies from teacher to teacher for a given type of course, this variation represents yet further evidence of the splintered vision that exists in the U.S. for what students should study and learn (Schmidt, McKnight, & Raizen, 1997) . This type of variation in students' exposure to specific mathematics topics raises concern around issues of access and equity for students. To the extent that specific topic emphasis varies from teacher to teacher within a common type of course this variation raises an even greater concern, challenging the value and validity of using common course titles. Here we consider this through an examination of the specific mathematics course opportunities schools provide and the profiles of topic coverage within these courses.\nThe common U.S. practice in differentially apportioning mathematics learning opportunities is at variance with our nation's democratic ideals of equal access to education opportunities (Guiton & Oakes, 1995; Oakes et al., 1990) . Additionally, it represents a rather unique approach to the first eight years of mathematics education from among those countries participating in the recent TIMSS (Schmidt, McKnight, Cogan, Jakwerth, & Houang, 1999) . In fact, it is this differentiation that makes the question of who takes what eighth grade mathematics a question that both can meaningfully be asked and needs to be critically evaluated. In this article we explore some of the structural resources associated with eighth grade mathematics courses and the specific educational opportunities associated with these. More specifically, we address three basic questions, \"What mathematics opportunities did schools offer?\", \"What type of mathematics did eighth grade students take?\" and \"What did students study in each type of course?\" As these opportunities are defined by schools, we look at these in the context of the school, the school's location and student body composition. In our discussion, we draw conclusions about curriculum differentiation and its role in thoughtful and perceptive discussion about education policy and update the discussion surrounding the practice of tracking and its effect on students' mathematics learning opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Methodology", "text": "The data analyzed were collected as part of the U.S. participation in the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The TIMSS represents an unprecedented study of education in size and scope and, accordingly, an unique opportunity to explore these issues with a nationally representative sample of students that employs a common language system in describing and comparing mathematics curricula -including textbooks -and students' classroom learning opportunities. In the U.S. a representative sample of more than 13,000 students in grades seven and eight were surveyed and their teachers completed lengthy questionnaires about how and what they taught.\nHere we limit our investigation to the eighth grade and principally draw upon two sources of data: a catalog of all the mathematics classes offered in each school recorded on the TIMSS class tracking form and the mathematics topic portion from the Teacher Questionnaire (Schmidt & Cogan, 1996) . From the TIMSS School Questionnaire, an average of the grade seven and grade eight enrollments was employed as an indicator of school size [SIZE] . The average of the two adjacent grades was considered to be a more stable estimate of a typical grade's size of enrollment than any single grade's actual enrollment.\n1 In addition, information about the size and ethnic composition of each school's student body was obtained from the NCES Common Core of Data, an annual summary of reports submitted by U.S. school districts. The percent enrollment of ethnic minorities in each school were added together to create a continuous variable [MINORITY] indicating the school's minority enrollment.\n2 As this information was available only for public schools, the analyses involving the percent minority enrollment in schools are limited to public schools. Combining information from the NCES database and the TIMSS School Questionnaire, schools were also divided into three types of locales -urban, rural, and other. Urban schools were those located within the city limits of metropolitan cities and enrolled about 32 percent of U.S. students; rural schools were those located in remote small towns and enrolled about 26 percent of U.S. students; suburban schools were located either in metropolitan suburbs or mid-sized cities and enrolled about 41 percent of U.S. students."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The TIMSS class tracking form, employed in forming the student sample, listed by title all the eighth grade mathematics classes taught in the school, the track or stream, and the number of students enrolled in each class. In U.S. TIMSS' schools, by far the most prevalent title for a grade eight mathematics class was simply \"math\" or \"mathematics.\" A number of variations on this title were also observed -many of which incorporated the notion of tracking students according to ability. Examples of this approach included \"average mathematics\", \"basic mathematics\", \"advanced mathematics\", \"gifted\" or \"high\" mathematics, \"LD mathematics\", \"remedial mathematics\", and \"resource mathematics\" among others. The only other commonly occurring class titles that did not contain either \"math\" or \"mathematics\" were \"arithmetic\", \"pre-algebra\" and \"algebra.\" Courses in some schools carried such unique titles that their content focus and relation to a progressively unfolding mathematics curriculum was unclear.\nPost-hoc coding of mathematics class titles assigned classes to one of six different curricular types [CLASTYPE: REMEDIAL, REGULAR, ENRICHED, PRE-ALGEBRA, ALGEBRA, GEOMETRY]. Classes with titles such as \"resource mathematics\", \"remedial mathematics\", and \"arithmetic\" were classified as REMEDIAL; \"advanced mathematics\" or \"enriched mathematics\" were classified as ENRICHED classes. Titles that contained \"pre-algebra\", \"algebra\", and \"geometry\" were classified as , ALGEBRA, and GEOMETRY respectively. Otherwise, courses were classified as REGULAR. These classifications were reviewed and revised by the mathematics experts attending a 1996 meeting of the U.S. TIMSS Steering Committee. With the exception of PRE-ALGEBRA, these curricular typologies are the same as those identified in the Second International Mathematics Study (McKnight, Crosswhite, Dossey, Kifer, Swafford, Travers & Cooney, 1987; Schmidt, 1993; Kifer, Wolfe, Schmidt, 1993) .\nIn the U.S., two eighth grade mathematics classes were randomly selected from each school to participate in the TIMSS student assessment. The teachers of the selected classes completed the TIMSS Teacher Questionnaire. This survey included information about the textbook used in the class and asked teachers to indicate how much time they spent teaching specific mathematics topics to the class selected for the TIMSS student assessment. The list of topics presented to teachers was exhaustive of the TIMSS Mathematics Framework which was used to analyze and describe the potential learning opportunities for students found in curriculum standards and textbooks in each TIMSS country 5 (see Schmidt, McKnight, Valverde, Houang & Wiley, 1997 for more complete explanations of the TIMSS mathematics framework and document analyses). Teachers indicated whether they had \"not taught\" a topic during the year or had taught the topic for \"1-5\", \"6-10\", \"11-15\", or \"> 15\" periods during the year by checking the appropriate box. Data were summarized as the proportion of instructional time devoted to each of 21 topics [TIME].\nThe textbooks teachers indicated using in teaching their classes were classified as Regular, PreAlgebra, or Algebra [TEXTTYPE] based on their content. Two new variables were created on the basis of the class type, textbook type, and teacher time variables. One variable combined the ranks of both the class type and textbook type that applied to each class represented in the data. Class types were rank ordered from most to least challenging, i.e., ALGEBRA > ENRICHED > PRE-ALGEBRA > REGULAR > REMEDIAL. The three types of textbooks -Algebra, Pre-algebra, and Regular -were similarly rank ordered. As illustrated in Table 1 , these two ranked types were then added together and rank ordered to form a new variable yielding an overall indication of the challenge of the class [CHALLENGE]. Course-text CHALLENGE indicators were defined according to the top six ranks formed by the combination of course and textbook type. A Regular math class, CHALLENGE level 2, was defined as either a REGULAR mathematics class using a regular textbook or a REMEDIAL class using a prealgebra textbook. Weak Pre-Algebra, CHALLENGE level 3, was defined as either a REGULAR class using a pre-algebra textbook or a PRE-ALGEBRA class using a regular textbook. Strong PreAlgebra, CHALLENGE level 4, included three different combinations: an ENRICHED class using a regular textbook, a PRE-ALGEBRA class using a pre-algebra textbook, and a REGULAR class using an algebra textbook. Weak Algebra, CHALLENGE level 5, also included three different combinations: a PRE-ALGEBRA class using an algebra textbook, an ENRICHED class using a prealgebra textbook, and an ALGEBRA class using a regular textbook. Moderate Algebra, CHALLENGE level 6, represented either an ENRICHED class with an algebra textbook or an ALGEBRA class with a pre-algebra textbook. Strong Algebra, CHALLENGE level 7, described an ALGEBRA class with an algebra textbook.\nAnother variable was created by weighting the international average grade level at which TIMSS' countries focused on each topic by the time teachers spent teaching that topic. 6 For example, the mean grade level at which the majority of TIMSS countries focused instruction on 'percentages' was 6. The proportion of time each teacher indicated teaching 'percentages' was used to weight this topic's international mean grade level focus. These weighted focal grade levels were then summed across the topics teachers taught to yield a measure of each class's topic difficulty [DIFFICULTY] from an international perspective.\nAll analyses were weighted to appropriately represent U.S. eighth grade students. Since the TIMSS sampling design focused on obtaining acceptable estimates of student variables, all TIMSS weights are essentially student weights. 7 Weights employed for teachers' responses or for school characteristics, therefore, do not represent percentages of teachers or percentages of schools but, rather, the percentage of U.S. students exposed to the type of teacher or school being described. 8 The TIMSS sampling and weights enables a nationally representative response to our three basic questions, \"What mathematics opportunities did schools offer?\", \"What type of mathematics did eighth grade students take?\", and \"What mathematics did these students study?\" 6 The international focus data came from Figure I6 .1 in Many Visions, Many Aims, Volume 1, pages 250-251. 7 TIMSS employed a multistage cluster-sampling approach to obtain representative samples of national student populations. A stratified random sample of schools were identified with the probability of selection proportional to the number of students enrolled in the grade level of interest. Mathematics classrooms were then randomly selected within schools and the mathematics teachers of these classes completed the TIMSS Teacher Questionnaire. The sample design for all student populations is detailed in Foy, Rust, and Schleicher (1996) . Design effects and effective sample sizes for all student populations are documented by Gonzalez and Foy (1997) . The design effect for the U.S. eighth grade mathematics score was calculated to be 18.45 with an effective sample size of 384 (Gonzalez & Foy, 1997) . Responses from teachers and schools were weighted by those students and their weights with which the teachers and schools were associated. Thus, although we refer to teacher and school characteristics, technically it is more precise to interpret these in terms of students' exposure to the particular characteristic being considered. 8 Since the weight for describing eighth grade schools is simply the sum of the weights for all eighth grade students in the school (see chapter 3 in Gonzalez & Smith,1977) , this aggregated school weight was divided proportionately among the various mathematics classes in each school listed on the TIMSS Class Tracking Form according to the number of students enrolled in the class to create weights for the mathematics classes. These weights were also multiplied by the ratio of the sample size to the sum of all student weights for use in those statistical procedures that did not allow significance tests to be performed with the sample size rather than the weighted sample size.\nIn addition, we are able to examine how the location or minority enrollment of schools affect our responses to each of these questions."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "What math opportunities did schools offer eighth grade students?\nUsing school level indicators of the types of mathematics courses available within the school we calculated the percentage of students who attended schools offering each of the six types of mathematics courses (Table 2 ). Some may be surprised to find that only about 13 percent of eighth grade students attended schools that offered REMEDIAL type classes and that this was about the same percent that attended schools offering ENRICHED type classes. By far, the largest percentage of eighth grade students -around 80% -attended schools offering REGULAR type classes. PRE-ALGEBRA classes were offered in schools attended by a little more than a third of eighth grade students while nearly two thirds -66.5% -attended schools offering ALGEBRA classes. It may also surprise some to find that courses titled \"geometry\" and \"algebra II\" -courses which typically follow algebra -were available to eighth grade students although they were quite rare. (For this reason, the two together represent the GEOMETRY course type.) An elite six percent of all students attended schools that offered this type of course for eighth grade students. The availability of these six types of math courses, however, was far from consistent from one school to another. In some schools students (around 25% of all eighth graders) had access to a single type of eighth grade math (i.e., a common curriculum for all students in that school) while in other schools there was much more diversity in eighth grade math offerings -what we term content tracking. This type of content tracking characterized the schools attended by about threefourths of all U.S. eighth graders! Nonetheless, even for schools that offered a single type of eighth grade math for all students there was disagreement as to the type of course offered. Schools offering two or more types of eighth grade math exhibited a corresponding increase in disagreement as to the types of courses offered. Where are the various types of math course offerings found?\nDid the types of math courses offered depend on the size of the school, the school's minority-enrollment or location?\nTo examine whether mathematics learning opportunities systematically varied according to certain characteristics of schools, indicators of student access to different course types were developed. Each school was coded into five dichotomous variables corresponding to the five most common types of math courses -REMEDIAL, REGULAR, PRE-ALGEBRA, ENRICHED, ALGEBRA -to indicate whether or not that type of math or a more challenging type (according to the rank ordering previously identified) was the most challenging type offered by the school. The exception to this rule was the REMEDIAL indicator which was constructed to represent those schools only offering this type of math to students. This type of coding represents a threshold approach to analyzing the opportunities schools provided. Thus as a school level indicator, each represents an individual student's potential opportunity for the most challenging type of mathematics offered by the school the student attended. In addition, each successive indicator , e.g., REGULAR to PRE-ALGEBRA, represents a potential opportunity for access to a more challenging type of mathematics. However, the first two indicators yielded no differences among schools: no school offered only REMEDIAL type classes -meaning that this was the most challenging type available -and all schools offered at least REGULAR type classes.\nOpportunity regressions were run, therefore, on three indicators: PRE-ALGEBRA, meaning that one or more classes of PRE-ALGEBRA, ENRICHED, or ALGEBRA were offered in a school; ENRICHED, meaning that one or more ENRICHED, or ALGEBRA classes were offered; and ALGEBRA indicating the presence of at least on class of algebra, algebra II, or geometry in the school. The school's percent of minority enrollment (MINORITY) and typical grade's enrollment (SIZE) were used to predict these opportunity indicators. These three regressions (one for each type of mathematics class available, i.e., PRE-ALGEBRA, ENRICHED, or ALGEBRA) were run for both the U.S. as a whole and within each of three school locales (urban, rural, and suburban). The twelve regressions (three dependent opportunity indicator regressions run for four locations) are summarized in Table 4 . Across all U.S. schools, opportunities for the more challenging types of mathematics -PRE-ALGEBRA, ENRICHED, and ALGEBRA -were all significantly related to both the percent minority enrollment and the grade's enrollment size. More specifically, schools with a larger percent minority enrollment or a smaller enrollment for a grade were less likely to offer the more challenging opportunities. The interpretation of this generalization, however, is substantially altered by the location-specific regressions.\nOf the nine location-specific regressions, only two failed to demonstrate significant coefficients for either the grade's enrollment size or the percent of minority enrollment. While all three opportunity regressions had significant coefficients in both urban and suburban schools, in urban schools opportunity was related primarily to the size of the school (typical grade enrollment) but primarily related to percent minority enrollment in suburban schools. The significant coefficients indicate that urban schools with larger eighth grade enrollments were more likely to offer all of the more challenging types of mathematics but less likely to offer the ENRICHED type as the percent of minority enrollment increased. Suburban and mid-sized city schools with larger percent minority enrollments were less likely to offer any of the more challenging types of mathematics. Rural schools with larger eighth grade enrollments were more likely to offer ENRICHED type courses.\nThe means for these opportunity indicators represent the percent of students enrolled in schools affording the specified type of opportunity. Together with the regression differences according to schools' locale, the opportunity indicator means reveal that access to algebra differed significantly according to locale. In rural and urban settings, about 60 percent of students attended schools that offered algebra or other more challenging classes but over 80 percent of students in suburban and mid-sized city settings attended schools with these opportunities. Opportunity for pre-algebra or more advanced classes similarly differed with around 70 percent of students in urban and rural settings attending schools offering these types of courses while 90 percent of suburban and mid-size city students attended schools that offered this type of opportunity."}, {"section_title": "What type of mathematics did eighth grade students take?", "text": "By far the largest proportion of students were enrolled in the REGULAR mathematics course type. Although classes of this type were offered in schools attended by over 80 percent of U.S. students, as may be seen in Table 5 they enrolled about 57 percent of the total U.S. eighth grade mathematics student population. As can be seen from Table 6 , within schools, these different courses represented widely varying proportions of the student body. In schools offering REGULAR mathematics classes, enrollment in this type of class ranged from around 4 percent to 100 percent with a mean enrollment of nearly 71 percent of the student body. Similar variation was evident for schools having ALGEBRA classes with enrollment ranging from 3 percent to 100 percent. As evidenced in Table 3 , a little over four percent of students attended schools that offered only ALGEBRA to eighth grade students. The percentage of students in each of the other course types also widely varied across schools. ENRICHED classes enrolled a low of 3.5 percent of the students in one school while all students from another school were enrolled in this type of course. The mean percentage of a school's students enrolled in this type of course was about 23 percent. PRE-ALGEBRA classes' enrollment mean was 44.2 percent with a low of 2.2 percent. Less than half of one percent of students attended schools that had all eighth grade mathematics students enrolled in this course type. Algebra II and geometry, which together form the GEOMETRY course type, each represented an elite enrollment of about 0.3 percent of all U.S. grade eight mathematics students. In those schools having a REMEDIAL class, the percentage of students within the school in this type of course ranged from a low of 1.2 percent to a high of 70.8 percent. Across schools having a REMEDIAL class, the mean percent of students in this course type was 21.2 percent. What it means for a student to be in a REMEDIAL class is likely to be very different in a school where only 1.2 percent of the students are taking such a course than in the school where over half the school's student body is enrolled in this type of class."}, {"section_title": "What mathematics do students study?", "text": "What type of textbook did students use?\nWhile course title information was available for all eighth grade mathematics classes in TIMSS schools, textbook information was available for only those classes participating in TIMSS. In most schools, two eighth grade mathematics classes were randomly selected for TIMSS participation. Accordingly, course and text type comparisons were conducted using the TIMSS sample. Considering only REGULAR, PRE-ALGEBRA, and ALGEBRA courses, the textbooks used matched the classification of the course for nearly 70 percent of students. For around 15 percent of students, the textbook used was more advanced than would be expected from the course title, i.e., an algebra textbook being used in a REGULAR or PRE-ALGEBRA course. However, a more problematic situation was found for over twelve percent of students in which a less advanced textbook was being used than the course title would indicate, e.g., a regular textbook in an ALGEBRA course.\nFor students in a REGULAR course it is interesting to note that about one-fourth of them used either a pre-algebra or algebra textbook. Almost one-third of students in PRE-ALGEBRA classes studied out of a regular mathematics textbook as did about one-fourth of the ALGEBRA students. The results from this section leave one with the conundrum of which information should be used to classify a specific class: course title or textbook title? It is clear that for nearly one-third of the students in the United States this was a very real issue."}, {"section_title": "Is the type of textbook used in math courses influenced by the school's characteristics?", "text": "A MANOVA of the six CHALLENGE indicators -REGULAR, WEAK PRE-ALGEBRA, STRONG PRE-ALGEBRA, WEAK ALGEBRA, MODERATE ALGEBRA, and STRONG ALGEBRA representing the various combinations of course and textbook types -by schools' location was not significant (F = 1.18, \u03c1 > 0.29). This means that students' opportunities for the six CHALLENGE course typesrepresented by the means in Table 8 -were not significantly different across urban, rural, and suburban locales. Three out of the six regressions of the school's percent minority enrollment and typical eighth grade enrollment on these course type indicators across all schools were significant. Larger enrollment schools were more likely to have STRONG PRE-ALGEBRA and WEAK ALGEBRA courses but less likely to have MODERATE ALGEBRA course types. Schools with a larger percent minority enrollment were less likely to have a STRONG PRE-ALGEBRA course type.\nHowever, a school's location did affect the nature of these relationships. Although the percent minority enrollment was significantly and negatively related to the opportunity for STRONG PRE-ALGEBRA across all schools, once location was controlled, percent minority enrollment was not significantly related to any course type opportunities in any of the three locations. In all three locations, the size of a school's enrollment was significantly related to these course opportunities but the nature of this relationship with the various opportunities varied. In rural schools, those with larger enrollments were more likely to offer WEAK ALGEBRA and STRONG ALGEBRA courses. This relationship also held for suburban schools offering of WEAK ALGEBRA but in the same locale, large schools were less likely to offer MODERATE or STRONG ALGEBRA. In urban schools, those with larger enrollments were more likely to offer STRONG ALGEBRA courses. "}, {"section_title": "What did teachers emphasize in their instruction?", "text": "A MANOVA of the amount of time teachers devoted to each of the 21 mathematics topics and the total number of topics taught by course type and textbook type yielded significant overall effects for the course type-textbook type interaction as well as the main effect of course type (F= 1.46, \u03c1 < .001 F= 1.61, \u03c1 < .001 respectively). Five out of the 21 topics demonstrated a significant course-textbook interaction as indicated by the univariate F ratios: \"whole numbers\", \"common and decimal fractions\", \"estimation and number sense\", \"equations and formulas\", and \"sets and logic.\" This suggests that the type of textbook employed in a course has an impact on the structure of students' learning opportunities beyond the differences attributable to the particular course in which students are enrolled. Two of the topics exhibiting significant interactions -\"whole numbers\" and \"common and decimal fractions\" -also exhibited main effects for course type along with four additional topics: \"number theory\", \"basics of 1-and 2-D geometry\", \"slope, trigonometry, and interpolation\", and \"functions, relations, and patterns.\" These last two topics -\"slope, trigonometry, and interpolation\" and \"functions, relations, and patterns\" -together with \"equations and formulas\" are the typical mainstays of an algebra course.\nThe significant effects demonstrated by these three topics -either an interaction effect or a main effect for course -implies that there were significant differences across courses in algebra related instruction reflecting the practice of content tracking. The total number of topics taught in courses also demonstrated a significant course-text interaction and a main effect for course type. The general pattern was that for any given course type, except PRE-ALGEBRA, the number of topics decreased from use of the regular textbook to use of the algebra textbook for that course type. For example, ENRICHED classes using a regular math textbook covered more topics than ENRICHED classes using a pre-algebra textbook while those using an algebra textbook covered the fewest number of topics. The exception to this trend in PRE-ALGEBRA courses was the opposite -the number of topics increased with use of a regular to algebra textbook. The absence of a significant main effect for textbooks is consistent with the cautious and inclusive nature of U.S. textbooks -virtually any textbook may support the specific emphasis teachers choose for the course they teach. This encyclopedic characteristic -desirable in a reference tool -reflects the lack of focus found in states' content standards. This diffuse nature of textbooks ends up promoting the teaching of the \"mile wide, inch deep\" math curriculum we've documented elsewhere (A Splintered Vision, page 62).\nThe mean proportion of teaching time devoted to \"equations, inequalities, and formulas\" for a REGULAR class using an algebra textbook was nearly twice that of a REGULAR class using either of the other textbook types (e.g., regular or pre-algebra) and almost as large as ALGEBRA classes using an algebra textbook. REGULAR classes using regular textbooks also spend nearly twice as much time on \"whole numbers\" as did regular classes using an algebra textbook. PRE-ALGEBRA teachers using a regular textbook spent over one-half more time teaching \"common and decimal fractions\" and less than one-third the time teaching \"equations, inequalities, and formulas\" as did those PRE-ALGEBRA teachers that used a pre-algebra book. PRE-ALGEBRA teachers using an algebra book spent about one-third more time teaching \"basics of 1-and 2-D geometry\" as those teachers using either of the other types of textbooks.\nSimilarly, the content students studied in ALGEBRA appeared to differ according to the type of textbook teachers reported using. ALGEBRA teachers using an algebra textbook spent more time teaching \"equations, inequalities, and formulas\" than those using either of the other types of textbooks and about one third the time teaching \"whole numbers\" and \"estimation and number sense\" as those using a pre-algebra textbook. These teachers also taught \"slope, trigonometry, and interpolation\" over twice as much as ALGEBRA teachers using a regular textbook. Teachers of REGULAR, ENRICHED, and ALGEBRA courses using algebra textbooks tended to teach fewer topics overall than their counterparts using either of the other types of textbooks.\nGiven the curricular content range and variation found across these different types of mathematics textbooks (Schmidt, McKnight, Raizen, 1997) , students' opportunities to learn specific mathematics topics in any particular course cannot be concluded with any degree of certainty. The use of different types of textbooks for courses with similar titles compounds and exacerbates the documented curricular splintering previously mentioned and directly challenges the functional equivalency of math course types from one school to another."}, {"section_title": "In what type of class did students study the most challenging mathematics?", "text": "Noting that what students actually study is influenced both by their enrollment in a particular type of course as well as by the type of textbook used for the class, we wanted to examine the relationship between the overall difficulty of the mathematics studied and the course-textbook combinations. Weighting the international mean grade at which instruction focused on the topic by the percent of teacher time spent on the topic and summing across all topics yielded an indication of the international difficulty for each class (DIFFICULTY). This international topic difficulty was plotted against the ranked course-textbook combinations (CHALLENGE). These plots can be seen in figures 1 and 2. Across all schools, the course-textbook combinations explained over 25% of the variance in the international topic difficulty; e.g., more challenging course types that used more challenging textbooks tended to have greater international difficulty indices than those that were less challenging. This relationship held in all three school locations although the amount of explained variance ranged from about 20% in rural schools to around 24% in suburban and mid-sized city schools.\nThe mean topic difficulty in rural schools was significantly less than the means in suburban or urban locations. Across all schools, the typical enrollment for a grade (SIZE) was significantly related to topic difficulty; those schools with larger enrollments tended to have classes with higher topic difficulty scores. In rural schools both SIZE and MINORITY were significant predictors; large schools were associated with higher topic difficulty scores and those with larger minority enrollments were associated with lower scores. Minority enrollment was significantly and negatively related to topic difficulty scores in suburban schools. Neither of these school characteristics were related to topic difficulty scores in urban schools. Did the type of mathematics students studied relate to achievement?\nAs the MANOVA on teaching time made clear, differences in the type of class and the type of textbook employed has practical implications for students' learning opportunities. But are these differences in learning opportunities likely to have any relationship with what students actually learn? The TIMSS design was cross-sectional and so did not lend itself well to such an investigation. As we have argued elsewhere, it is important to distinguish between learning -the actual increase in knowledge acquired over a specified period of time -and achievement statusa measure of cumulative knowledge at a particular point in time (see e.g., Schmidt, Jakwerth, & McKnight, 1998; Schmidt, McKnight, Cogan, Jakwerth, & Houang, 1999; and Schmidt, McKnight, Houang, Wang, Wiley, Cogan & Wolfe, in press ). However, to the extent that DIFFICULTY and CHALLENGE represent general systemic factors that likely influence learning opportunities in prior grades and not only at eighth grade, the relationship these demonstrate with students' eighth grade achievement status could be informative. Table 10 presents the results of regressing the class mean mathematics score from the TIMSS assessment (IRT score) on the class' topic DIFFICULTY and course-text CHALLENGE 10 . Both of these are significant predictors across all schools explaining nearly 40% of the variance across classrooms. Although the strength of these relationships differed slightly across the three locales explaining from 21% (rural) to nearly 60% (suburban) of the variance in classroom mean scores, all relationships were positive. This means that classes exposed to more challenging topics tended to have higher TIMSS scores -on average, 23 points higher for every year increase in the class' international topic difficulty in terms of DIFFICULTY's unique contribution. Similarly, each increase in a class's course-text challenge rank was associated with nearly a 14 point increase on the TIMSS score. In rural schools, topic DIFFICULTY was the only significant predictor while in urban schools course-text CHALLENGE was the only significant predictor. Both DIFFICULTY and CHALLENGE were significant predictors in suburban and mid-sized city schools."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "As the preceding results indicate, there is considerable variation in the mathematics studied by eighth grade students in the U.S. This variation in learning opportunity is evident in the number of different eighth grade mathematics courses available to students in their schools, the percent of students who actually took the different courses, the different course titles employed, the variation in the type of textbooks used for the same type of mathematics course, as well as in the relative emphases teachers give specific mathematics topics as a function of both the type of course taught and the textbook used. This multiplicity with respect to what constitutes eighth grade mathematics yields a chaotic cacophony that precludes any attempt to provide sensible, focused, and challenging opportunities for all children to learn important mathematics. The achievement results, although inconclusive, suggest that all this curricular variation may be related to variation in students' achievement in a non-inconsequential manner (and, perhaps, even in a manner that contributes to our relatively poor international standing at eighth grade). The attendant non-systematic nature of the actual mathematics topics studied jeopardizes the preparedness of all students to study and learn important mathematics in high school, the quest towards a quantitatively literate society, and, ultimately, a technologically prepared work force. Furthermore, it obfuscates discussions around the improvement of mathematics education.\nAn earlier report that focused on the U.S. eighth grade mathematics curriculum labeled this situation as \"splintered\" and lacking coherence -a reference to the lack of a common vision for all U.S. schools (Schmidt, McKnight & Raizen, 1997) . However, as the current analyses have documented, the splintered and fragmented nature of the U.S. mathematics curriculum is exacerbated by the variation from school to school in the very definition of what constitutes eighth grade mathematics especially in terms of which courses are offered. The variation from course to course within schools that track students blurs the school's definition of eighth grade math. Furthermore, the variation from class to class blurs the definition of courses as different textbooks are used for the same course resulting in significantly different content profiles. What, for example, does it mean for a student to study algebra? Does it mean that the student enrolls in a course entitled \"algebra\"? Does it mean that the student uses an algebra textbook in the course? Does it mean either of these or is a student studying algebra only when enrolled in an algebra course that uses an algebra textbook? If the latter is the case, then the percentage of U.S. eighth grade students studying algebra isn't the 20% reported here (see table 5) nor the 25% reported in the most recent NAEP report (NCES, 2001 ) but only about 14%.\nUnlike the situation in virtually every other country involved in the TIMSS study, there is no common, coherent referent or standard for U.S. eighth grade mathematics. The widely encountered practice of content tracking -offering groups of students different eighth grade mathematics courses such as general mathematics, pre-algebra, and algebra -yields unique U.S. chaos with respect to the mathematics studied at this grade level. This arises from the variation evident in the curriculum -the textbooks employed and the relative emphasis given to specific mathematics topics by teachers -that define the learning opportunities of each course thus violating the assumption that courses with common titles represent common educational opportunities. Ultimately, the chaos inherent in U.S. tracking practice obscures an important source of variation and differentiation in students' learning opportunities.\nThe present analyses present a picture of the rather bewildering variety that all passes under the banner of eighth grade mathematics. The calls of the NCTM Standards (1989 Standards ( , 1991 for a mathematics curriculum that brings mathematics power to all students resonates strongly with U.S. democratic and inclusive ideals. However, given the rather lackluster performance of U.S. eighth grade students in TIMSS (NCES, 1996) as well as in the more recent TIMSS-R (NCES, 2000) we strongly question whether this diverse approach to the eighth grade mathematics curriculum is the best way to achieve our democratic educational goals. The prevalence of regular mathematics classes that offer little challenge and rank low in international topic difficulty, the fact that over 20 percent of U.S. students attend schools that offer nothing more challenging than basic eighth grade arithmetic, together with the fact that fully one third of U.S. students attend schools that do not even offer the more challenging algebra course leads us to question what sort of mathematical \"power\" we can realistically expect from our students.\nFrom the analyses presented here, the cross-school variation in students' differential mathematics opportunities did appear to be somewhat related to certain school characteristics such as the school's minority enrollment and the typical number of students enrolled in a grade. However, these relationships did not appear to be consistently defined by these factors wherever schools were located such that they could serve as consistent predictors of students' learning opportunities. For example, schools that offered only algebra courses to all students were evident in rural, urban, and suburban locales. In addition, in the rural and urban locales, these schools had minority enrollments of nearly 50 percent to almost 100 percent. Rather, the implicit tracking which occurs across schools -students in different schools being provided with access to different curricular courses -as well as the content tracking that occurs within schools probably stems from fundamentally different conceptions of what an eighth grade mathematics curriculum ought to be (Oakes & Guiton, 1995) . In fact, the wide variety of approaches to organizing eighth grade mathematics learning opportunities in schools would suggest that all this differentiation is more likely a reflection of different philosophical convictions rather than a pedagogical response to student differences.\nIf the implicit assumption informing U.S. content tracking practices is accepted at face valuethat tracking is a reasonable response to the differential learning needs of students -one would expect to see some sort of consistent pattern of offerings across all schools. However, no such strong patterns were found. What was found was not consistent patterns across schools but, essentially, what appeared to be random. Are we to believe, for example, that rural and urban schools (at least those attended by 40% of students in such areas) do not have students who would benefit from the availability of algebra classes while nearly 80% of students in suburban areas do attend such schools? Are data that reveal one-third of the students taking an algebra course were studying out of a regular or pre-algebra textbook consistent with a tracking structure developed to deal with individual differences? Consider the fact that almost one-third of U.S. students do not even attend schools where algebra is offered. Students cannot take that which is not offered. Therefore, to assume that content tracking is designed to provide a rational basis for instruction, one would have to additionally assume that the distribution of students with mathematical ability is different in those schools in which no algebra course is offered from that in schools that do provide such an opportunity. This does not seem very likely.\nGranted, there were some types of opportunities that differed according to the school's locale, enrollment size, or minority enrollment yet these factors did not begin to explain the great variety of opportunities found within any one location, size of school, or school having a particular minority enrollment status. If content tracking were a well-thought out response to individual differences then the U.S. education system must be applauded for pulling off one of the most monumental feats of social engineering in history. Not only have students been 'properly' sorted into 'appropriate' courses, but they've been sorted into the precise communities and schools that have the 'appropriate' courses available! The findings and curricular implications emerging from TIMSS are remarkably -and disturbingly -similar to the conclusions reached from the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS). On the basis of teacher data and the textbooks used, four distinct types of eighth grade curricula were defined: Remedial, Typical, Enriched, and Algebra. In SIMS, students were tested once at the beginning of the year and again at the end of the year providing a true measure of what students had learned that year in their mathematics classes. Analyses of the four different types of mathematics classes revealed that at the end of the year, students' performance on the algebra items was approximately the same as that of those in the next advanced class type at the beginning of the year. In other words, across the four class types, there was a difference of three years worth of learning algebra content. This, together with other analyses, led to the characterization of the U.S. mathematics curriculum as The Underachieving Curriculum (McKnight, et al, 1987 Finally, we are compelled to note what must be obvious to many: eighth grade mathematics is the culmination of eight years of mathematics instruction and, as such, cannot be reformed without addressing the learning opportunities for students embedded in standards and curricula that are associated with all the prior years' mathematics. The tracking into different types of courses that often is first apparent at eighth grade most likely reflects the culmination of years of differential learning opportunities rather than the widely found spontaneous appearance of efforts to make accommodations for students' differential mathematics learning requirements. While adopting a rigorous algebra and geometry based curriculum for all grade eight students may be a worthwhile goal, doing so without addressing the widely varying student learning opportunities in prior years is not likely to have any impact on the fragmented mathematics learning opportunities students encounter in eighth grade nor on the attendant differences in achievement.\nIn summary, this article has sought to contribute to the current mathematics reform discussion by identifying important sources of variation in the very definition of eighth grade mathematics in the United States by documenting the chaotic nature of this definition evidenced in the multiple meanings exhibited in commonly found course titles and types. In documenting this situation, we hope to bring a degree of focus and coherence in the current reform discussion that would not otherwise be possible and to focus attention on the pressing need for a coherent and challenging mathematics standard for all U.S. students."}]
