[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "On March 11 th , 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic. In December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus [1] , namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China firstly and has been propagated around countries and regions of the world. The contagious COVID-19 devastated normal life around the world. As of November 26 th , 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 60776978 confirmed cases in the world, has killed more than 1428228 people, and has forced more than 7 billion to stay in their homes [3] . In response to this ongoing public health emergency, an online interactive dashboard has been developed, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualize and track in real time reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the world [3] .\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less-severe disease, such as the common cold, and others more severe disease such as MERS and SARS. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others do not.\nAll rights reserved.

It has also affected the cryptocurrency market [4] [5] .\nAlgeria reported its first COVID-19 case, on February 25 th , 2020. In November 26 th , 2020, Algeria has reported 79110 confirmed cases with 51334 recoveries and 2352 deaths by COVID-19 [6] .\nCountries all over the world are challenged with this virus and have declared lockdowns in their various cities and states. The researchers estimate that the virus proliferates to more than two persons from every infected person, highlighting the possibility to infect millions [6] . In order to control this pandemic, Algerian government has instituted on March 23 rd , 2020, several nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies. Thus strategies along with other measures such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine aimed to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 in Algeria [7] . These measures were implemented with the aim to flatten the pandemic curve and prevent an exponential rise in new COVID-19 infections that would allow for the effective management and control of the pandemic.

Time series models such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) have been widely used to statistically model and forecast infectious disease trends [10] .\nARIMA models are preferred in this context as they are suitable for investigations into short-term effects of acute infectious diseases and are a flexible class of models that are appropriate to fit several trajectories, and have been well documented in the literature [10] [11] . ARIMA models have been used in several studies to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak trends [12-13-14-15] . However, to date, there are no studies conducted using ARIMA models to forecast the COVID-19 cases outbreak in Algeria. In this study, ARIMA models were developed using daily COVID-19 confirmed and active cases in Algeria to identify the best fitting model COVID-19 cases from March 21 st , 2020 to November 26 th , 2020. Forecasting future COVID-19 cases using ARIMA models are suitable especially when model parameters that determine the disease dynamics are unavailable or undetermined due to the disease novelty. In addition, ARIMA models are a flexible, empirical method which is able to produce reliable All rights reserved.

This rapid increase of cases has stressed most healthcare systems worldwide and has further made outbreak response and resource planning a challenge. In response, health authorities have attempted to forecast the trend of this pandemic, however this have proven to be difficult as COVID-19 is a novel disease with limited data and knowledge on the disease trends and dynamics [6] . This is especially observed when using ARIMA model to predict disease trends, where ARIMA model require sufficient long time series data to be accurate.\nOur forecast also showed an accurate trend which corresponded to the positive cases observed and reported by the ministry of health in Algeria during three days (252, 253 and 254). The same situation has been obtained for forecasted recovery and death cases. Table 4 , this finding is strengthened by variations of less than 5% between the forecast and observed cases in 100% of the forecasted data points. This paper demonstrates that ARIMA models are a suitable tool to forecast case trends especially during situations where data is limited. All rights reserved.

In addition as with our findings, a study in Italy also reported a high level of forecast accuracy of 95% in predicting COVID-19 trends using ARIMA models [14-19-20] .\nThe strengths of this study include, firstly, this paper is the first to report the use of ARIMA models to forecast COVID-19 cases and trends in Algeria. Secondly, this was the first attempt to use smoothen case data to improve accuracy as compared to similar studies on ARIMA models for COVID-19 conducted in other countries [20] [21] . Thirdly, we used several independent covariates which provided more accurate signals to develop short-term model predictions for immediate outbreak response. And finally, we also optimized the model training and validation period to provide the highest number of data points to generate the best fit model. All rights reserved.
