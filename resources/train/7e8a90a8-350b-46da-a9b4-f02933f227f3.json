[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Currently, there are no tools that can accurately predict which patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Texture analysis uses image processing and statistical methods to identify patterns in voxel intensities that cannot be appreciated by visual inspection. Our main objective was to determine whether MRI texture could be used to predict conversion of MCI to AD. Methods: A method of 3-dimensional, whole-brain texture analysis was used to compute texture features from T1-weighted MR images. To assess predictive value, texture changes were compared between MCI converters and nonconverters over a 3-year observation period. A predictive model using texture and clinical factors was used to predict conversion of patients with MCI to AD. This model was then tested on ten randomly selected test groups from the data set.\nResults: Texture features were found to be significantly different between normal controls (n 5 225), patients with MCI (n 5 382), and patients with AD (n 5 183). A subset of the patients with MCI were used to compare between MCI converters (n 5 98) and nonconverters (n 5 106). A composite model including texture features, APOE-\u03b54 genotype, Mini-Mental Status Examination score, sex, and hippocampal occupancy resulted in an area under curve of 0.905. Application of the composite model to ten randomly selected test groups (nonconverters 5 26, converters 5 24) predicted MCI conversion with a mean accuracy of 76.2%. Discussion: Early texture changes are detected in patients with MCI who eventually progress to AD dementia. Therefore, whole-brain 3D texture analysis has the potential to predict progression of patients with MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive cognitive and functional deficits. It is associated with the accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain and is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for nearly 70% of dementia cases [1] . According to the Alzheimer's Association, the estimated financial burden of AD on the Canadian and United States economy is 10.4 and 236 billion dollars per annum, respectively [2] . In addition to the financial burden, caregivers of patients with AD also have one of the highest prevalence of emotional stress and depression [3] . This unequivocally highlights the need for the development of therapy to target this disease.\nWhile research into AD, vis-a-vis development of animal models to decipher the pathophysiology of this disease and to test novel therapeutics, has yielded a plethora of new data, this has not readily translated to successful therapeutics for this disease. One reason for this includes the inconsistency in diagnosing individuals early on in their disease course when interventions may have a greater chance of being effective before the condition reaches a state of irreversible degeneration. Establishing the initial diagnosis of AD in a patient at an earlier stage (\"prodromal AD\") may be facilitated by recognition of the syndrome of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4, 5] . Present studies show that up to 20% of individuals with MCI will progress to dementia per year [4, 6, 7] . Hence, the establishment of biomarkers to identify individuals with MCI who will convert to dementia is a critical step in the development of novel therapeutics.\nOne particular area that has received extensive investigation is neuroimaging. For instance, MRI measurements of volume reduction in multiple brain regions and in cortical thickness have been predictive of those who will convert from MCI to AD [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . More specifically, the hippocampus has been extensively studied and hippocampal volume and shape have predictive value in conversion [12] [13] [14] . Similar predictions for conversion have also been seen in other imaging modalities including diffusion tensor imaging [15] , magnetic resonance spectroscopy [16] , fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [12, 17] , amyloid imaging [18, 19] , and positron emission tomography acetylcholinesterase activity [20] .\nHowever, despite these various studies, the low accuracy with which clinicians have been able to predict MCI to AD conversion has limited its use in daily clinical practice. This is due in part to the lack of access to some of these technologies at smaller health centers (i.e., radioactive tracers). Another hurdle is that some of these diagnostic tools cannot be used on a mass scale to benefit a large population because of the various barriers associated with their integration into large-scale analysis (i.e., cost, time required for analysis, lack of expertise for manual analysis etc.).\nIn this study, we used an automated whole-brain texture analysis [21, 22] . We used this technology to compare MRI texture in normal controls (NC), patients with MCI, and patients with AD. We further tested whether MRI texture could be used to predict MCI conversion to AD. We predict that MRI texture will be different in NC, patients with MCI, and patients with AD. We further predict that these MRI texture changes can be used to classify MCI converters (MCI-C) from nonconverters (MCI-NC)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Group comparisons incorporated a familywise error correction for multiple comparisons at P , .05 with reporting of clusters greater than 30 significant voxels.

The training set was used to generate a binary logistic regression model, using MRI texture, HOC, and clinical data as variables.

Only patients with MCI who had follow-up for the full 36 months or converted within the 36 months were included in this analysis (n 5 204). Baseline T1 MRI scans of these patients with MCI were selected from the data set and 3D texture maps were generated (Supplementary Fig. 1) . A voxelwise comparison was conducted between MCI-NC and MCI-C, revealing significant texture changes in the mesial temporal region with some involvement of the parietal lobes (Fig. 2) . In particular, we found that MCI-NC had higher texture values for the features autocorrelation, correlation, homogeneity, and sum of entropy. A region of lower texture value for texture feature autocorrelation was identified in the right mesial temporal region in MCI-C compared with MCI-NC. Next, a binary logistic regression model was used to test the ability of each texture feature to predict MCI to AD conversion (Table 3) . Their individual AUCs ranged from 0.709 to 0.794, which were higher than HOC alone (AUC 0.655). The predictive ability was improved with a model combining all five texture features (AUC 0.825).\nTo further characterize the utility of MRI texture in conversion discrimination, we next asked the question of whether the inclusion of additional clinical variables to texture could improve prognostic ability. Our binary logistic regression model determined that among the clinical variables, only APOE-\u03b54 provided a statistical significance of P , .05. In this composite model including texture, HOC, and APOE-\u03b54, an AUC of 0.895 was achieved with a sensitivity of 90.8% and a specificity of 73.6%. A final model which also included MMSE score and sex had a further increase in AUC to 0.905 and a sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 83.0%, respectively (Table 3) . Pairwise comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves using DeLong test showed statistical significance with P , .05 for all comparisons with the exception of (Texture 1 HOC) compared with (Texture 1 HOC 1 APOE-\u03b54) and (Texture 1 HOC 1 APOE-\u03b54) compared with (Texture 1 HOC 1 APOE-\u03b54 1 MMSE 1 Sex).\nNext, the MCI group was further divided into a training set (w75%) and a trial set (w25%). We randomly generated a total of 10 of these sets, with each training set having a total of n 5 80 MCI-NC and n 5 74 MCI-C, whereas the trial set had a total of n 5 26 MCI-NC and n 5 24 MCI-C. Independent sample t-test and chi-square analysis showed no statistical difference between the baseline demographics in the training and trial sets in each iteration. Next, ten binary logistic regression models were determined, corresponding to one for each training set, achieving AUC ranging from 0.896 to 0.930 (Table 4) .\nTo test our discriminant model, we then applied these binary logistic regression models to their corresponding trial sets to determine their accuracy for distinguishing between MCI-NC and MCI-C. The composite model including texture, HOC, APOE-\u03b54 genotype, MMSE score, and sex had a mean accuracy of 76.2 6 6.8% in the 10 trials (Table 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main objective of this study was to characterize cerebral degeneration in vivo using MRI-based texture analysis and to determine whether MRI texture could be used to predict conversion of MCI to AD. We used a whole-brain texture analysis (VGLCM-TOP-3D) to compute eight different texture features from T1-weighted MR images. As we hypothesized, MRI texture was different between NC and patients with AD and could further be used to predict MCI-C from nonconverters. Specifically, MRI texture changes were seen in all eight texture features between NC and patients with AD and in a combined model had an AUC of 0.928. This was superior to HOC, which had an AUC of 0.843. Furthermore, we determined areas of significant texture change between MCI-NC and MCI-C, which alone accounted for an AUC of 0.825, which was higher than HOC at 0.655. The model that yielded the greatest AUC (0.905) incorporated texture, HOC, APOE-\u03b54, MMSE, and sex. We further tested this model on 10 separate data splits, each with 75% training and 25% trial and found accuracy in predicting MCI-C and MCI-NC in the trial group of 76.2%.\nIn this study, we included hippocampal volume (expressed as the HOC score), a previously well-defined biomarker of disease to compare with MRI texture in distinguishing the various AD states [29] . This score has previously been shown to be superior to raw hippocampal volume alone in distinguishing NC and patients with AD [27] . Previous studies have demonstrated that hippocampal volume can be used to classify NC from patients with AD, reaching AUC levels of 0.75 to 0.887 using whole hippocampal volume and 0.81 to 0.895 when using subsegments of the hippocampus [30, 31] . This is comparable with our own hippocampal volume segmentations, which achieved an AUC score of 0.843. When we combined texture and HOC, this achieved the greatest AUC of 0.930.\nThe use of hippocampal volume to distinguish MCI-NC from MCI-C has been demonstrated in multiple previous studies. In particular, a meta-analysis of these various studies concluded that atrophy of mesial temporal lobe structures, specifically the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in the left hemisphere, had the highest predictive value for conversion [32] . Texture changes in these regions were also identified with our texture analysis, in addition to also identifying changes in the right mesial temporal lobe. Khan et al. [31] were able to use hippocampal volume to accurately identify 76.7% of all MCI-C and 50.1% of all MCI-NC. When they used subfield analysis, selecting for the subiculum, the accuracy of identifying all MCI-C increased to 81.1%, with a marginal decrease to 49.0% in MCI-NC. Furthermore, using an automated temporal lobe atrophy assessment, Chincarini et al. [14] were able to achieve an AUC of 0.81 when classifying MCI-NC from MCI-C. We show in our study that using HOC alone achieved an AUC of 0.655. The lower AUC and accuracy may be related to the heterogeneity of our MCI group, which contained participants with MCI-C showing conversion at any time point at 12, 24, and 36 months. This is in contrast to the data set used in the study by Khan et al. and Chincarini et al., which included MCI-C up to 12 months and 24 months, respectively. Despite this heterogeneity, MRI texture proved superior to hippocampal volume in both its ability to distinguish NC from patients with AD (AUC 0.928) and MCI-NC from MCI-C (AUC 0.825).\nOur method of texture analysis is not confined to the use of a priori determined regions of interest, thus allowing for the discovery of novel regions of change. For instance, previous VBM studies showed that amnestic patients with MCI who converted to AD had significant clusters of gray matter volumetric reduction in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. In our present study, we determined hippocampal and parahippocampal texture changes were also present in the right hemisphere. This suggests the possibility that texture change may precede the development of atrophy. However, a specific study designed to longitudinally compare volume changes with texture changes will need to be untaken to further verify this hypothesis. This is in keeping with previous studies on the ADNI data set that demonstrated the utility of hippocampal texture alone to act as a predictor of MCI to AD conversion [33] . Sorensen et al. showed that texture had the ability to predict conversion to dementia independent of volume, with an AUC of 0.740 to 0.742 in those who converted within 12 and 24 months, respectively. Previous studies from Chincarini et al. using texture features from defined volumes of interest with random forest classifiers have also shown that texture can be used to distinguish NC, MCI, and AD groups and MCI-C from MCI-NC. They were able to achieve an AUC of 0.74 with a classification index for the latter [34] . However, given that these previous study also used a region of interest analysis, they were constrained by the a priori selection bias. Our present study was able to determine more specific regions of texture change. In addition, our work builds on original investigations completed by Maani et al., which showed mesial temporal lobe changes in a smaller population of 30 NC and 30 patients with AD from the OASIS (http://www. oasis-brains.org/) database where similar regions of change were identified. However, our present study used a larger population and included patients with MCI in the analysis.\nA previous study using a single hippocampal texture with predefined hippocampus region of interest along with hippocampal volume, shape, and cortical thickness resulted in an accuracy prediction on the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging of 63% after being trained on the ADNI data set [35] . Our present study utilizes random splitting of our data set into both a training and trial group to generate models and test on a trial group not involved in the creation of the model. While these results are not as robust as those seen in the study by Sorensen et al. where the model was tested on an independent test set, we note that our model has average accuracy of 76.2% when tested over 10 times. Future studies would involve testing this model on an independent data set.\nThere are some limitations to our present study in terms of their applicability to the general population. First, the ADNI cohort cannot be generalized to the normal population given the patient recruitment was targeted toward clinical trials in patients with AD. Second, the baseline demographics of these sample patients do not fit with the actual demographics of the broader population. We do also note that although we verified our model using multiple iterations of splitting our data, it was not verified on an independent population. Regardless, this study shows that (1) there are texture differences between NC, patients with MCI, and patients with AD and (2) MRI texture changes may be a viable biomarker in predicting which patients with MCI may convert to AD.\nWhile previous methods of texture analysis and toolboxes have been limited to analyzing region of interest and therefore require a priori analysis, the utilization of VGLCM-TOP-3D in our study allowed for a hypothesis-free analysis [36, 37] . This is the first study to our knowledge that has used a 3D whole-brain analysis to identify novel texture changes in distinguishing NC from patients with AD and MCI-NC from MCI-C. In conclusion, the resulting ability to select patients at highest risk for conversion to AD from MCI will result in a more homogenous population of research participants, enabling more clear therapeutic studies as well as targeting those patients with the greatest benefit."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award number W81XWH-12-2-0012).
