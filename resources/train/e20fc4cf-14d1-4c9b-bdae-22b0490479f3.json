Yasi made landfall in the early morning of 3 rd February 2011, near Mission Beach, as a Category 5 cyclone. Prior to Yasi, the SSTs in the Coral Sea were higher than average by 1-2\u00b0C due to a La Ni\u00f1a event (e.g. Ummenhofer et al., 2015) . A large storm surge was associated with TC Yasi, although it made landfall at low tide, 5 with a 5 m surge observed in Cardwell which is 2.3 m above the highest astronomical tide (BoM, 2011) . This study investigates what impact these higher than usual SSTs might have had on the track, intensity and size of TC Yasi and changes to the (non-tidal) associated storm surge and rainfall.\nThe importance of warm SSTs for the development and intensification of TCs has been long known: surface fluxes of latent and sensible heat from the oceans provide the potential energy to TCs (Ooyama 1969; Emanuel 1986 ).\n10 Palm\u00e9n (1948) was the first to document that TCs only occur over oceans warmer than a critical temperature of Although SSTs are clearly an important factor to consider when examining TCs, recent research has suggested there should be less importance placed on SSTs alone and more on the surface fluxes and wind speed that are the drivers of the energy of the TCs (Emanuel 2007) . This is of particular importance when considering how TCs may 20 change in a warmer world. The initial assumption was that an expansion of the extent and duration of ocean areas above the 26 \u00b0C SST threshold in future will lead to the formation of more TCs. However, this has been found to not necessarily be the case, with many studies projecting a decrease in TC activity in a warmer world (e.g. Knutson et al. 2010) . It is the relative SST (i.e. local SST relative to the global tropical mean), rather than absolute SST, that has been found to be important in determining changes in frequency and intensity of TCs (e.g. Ramsay & Sobel 25 2011) resulting in different projections depending on the region (Vecchi & Soden 2007) .\nIdealised SST sensitivity experiments are not new. Evans et al. (1994) used a regional model to impose SST anomalies and analyse changes in two Australian TCs, showing potential for the intensity of TCs to increase as SSTs increase whilst also pointing out the caveats of an idealised study such as the present one. More recently, Miglietta et al. (2011) examined the influence of uniform SST anomalies on \"medicanes\" (TC-like cyclones in the Mediterranean) finding that when SST is reduced by more than 4\u00b0C the cyclone loses tropical cyclone like characteristics. Kilic and Rable (2013) also use SST sensitivity experiments to confirm the linear relationship between SST and TC intensity. The present study uses a similar methodology to highlight the influence of SST when all other variables remain the same, which is not what we could expect in the real-world under climate change.\nHowever, it allows us to examine the sensitivity of TCs to SST changes alone in a way that would be difficult with 5 real-world observations. A larger focus on precipitation and the influence on storm surge adds an additional new dimension to this work from previous studies.\nSimulations of TC Yasi have been performed previously by Parker et al. (2017) who examined the influence of atmospheric and SST initialisation data as well as the choice of parametrisation schemes on the track, intensity, landfall location and translational speed of Yasi. They found the choice of cumulus parametrisation made the 10 biggest difference with a trade-off needed between accurate trajectory and more realistic intensities.\nTC Yasi occurred during a season when SSTs over the south-west Pacific region remained above average (Imielska 2011) . The fact that this was the most powerful TC to affect Queensland in over 90 years leads to the question of how this storm may have been influenced by these higher than average SSTs. This may also provide insights of how we might expect the potential destructiveness of TCs (track, intensity, size, precipitation and storm surge) to 15 change in a warmer climate. Here we perform a conceptually simple sensitivity study using limited area models to analyse the influence of SST on TC Yasi.\nThe following section describes the numerical modelling setup and the data used to initialise the model. Section 3 evaluates the ability of the model to simulate TC Yasi. The sensitivity of the track, intensity, precipitation and storm surge associated with TC Yasi is presented and discussed in Section 4. A summary is presented in Section 5 20 including a discussion of the limitations of this study. Daily sea surface temperature data from the real-time global SST analysis was obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/Marine Modeling and Analysis Branch (NCEP / MMAB) on a 0.5 degree grid over the same time period as above.\nThe observed track of TC Yasi, as well as central pressure and maximum windspeeds were obtained from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship dataset (IBTrACS; Knapp et al. 2010 ) which incorporates data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology."}, {"section_title": "Model configuration", "text": "The Weather Although the experimental design is conceptually simple, we make use of the simple mixed-ocean layer model capability in WRF due to the SST cooling that occurs after passage of a TC. This is an important feedback and experiments at initialisation were the SSTs. This design will also result in a change in the \"relative\" SSTs as well as absolute since SSTs in the global tropics are not changing, and are outside the domain.\nThe control run was repeated using both ERA-interim high resolution data (0.75 \u00d7 0.75 degree grid) and NCEP-FNL (1\u00d7 1 degree grid; NCEP 2000) data to force the model. Using the high resolution ERA-interim made no significant difference to the simulation. However, there were larger errors in the modelled track when NCEP-FNL 25 data was used to initialise the storm. Using NCEP-FNL resulted in a smaller bias in the intensity, however the storm reached maximum intensity too quickly and started decaying before making landfall. The storm size in the simulations is too large (see Section 3) compared to observations, so we tested the effect of implanting a bogus vortex of different sizes. However, in terms of the track, the simulation without a bogus was more comparable to\nobservations. An additional simulation with the convective parameterisation turned off on the inner grid was performed resulting in a poorer representation of the intensity. Therefore, the control run was initialised using ERA-Interim 1.5 \u00b0 data, with no bogus vortex and convective parameterisation on all grids. Further limitations of this study will be outlined in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "Storm surge model", "text": "The Flow module of the Delft3D modelling system (open-source version 6.01.13.6455) was used to calculate storm 5 surge (wind-setup and inverse barometer effect) along the Queensland coast.

Background sea levels were set to zero for all runs. . Parker et al, (2017) found large errors in the trajectory and landfall when using the K-F scheme but more realistic intensities. These large errors in track are not evident in the current study."}, {"section_title": "Simulation of Yasi in CTRL run", "text": "compared to observations in Fig. 2 . The difference in size due to the large vortex in the initial conditions is clearly evident; in particular the eye is too big. As mentioned in Section 2, the simulations were repeated with the initial vortex removed and a bogus vortex implemented in its place. However, in this case the storm became too small and reached maximum intensity too quickly with the TC tracking to the south resulting in a large discrepancy in 5 the track compared to observations. It is worth noting that Parker et al. (2017) found the K-F cumulus scheme resulted in a larger vortex than other schemes. Despite the large size of the simulated vortex, some of the smallscale features in the OLR (Fig 2a and b) give confidence in the simulation, for example the cloud patterns in the southeast and northeast of the domain. Similarly, the precipitation (Fig 2c and d) show well defined rainbands, with a large rainband swirling round to the northwest in both the model simulation and radar observations. The 10 increased rainfall in the southeast as the system reaches the coast is also evident.\nThe CTRL simulation storm surge's overall extent (Fig 3a) , duration and maximum non-tidal water levels storm surge of around 5 m appear to closely match (de-tided or residual) tide gauge observations (Fig 3b) and indications from debris lines (Queensland Government, 2012) . However, consistent with the earlier and more southerly landfall of the cyclone in the CTRL run, the timing of the simulated storm surge's peak occurs 2-3 hours earlier 15 and further south (within Halifax Bay, red line in Figure 3b ) compared to observations (near Cardwell, black line in Figure 3b ). The influence of the magnitude of SST on the simulations of Yasi will now be analysed."}, {"section_title": "Influence of SST", "text": "The change in SSTs results in only subtle differences in the simulated tracks ( Fig. 4a) with the largest differences occurring after landfall. Landfall timing and location remains similar in all simulations, with all runs making 20 landfall within 1-degree (approx. 100 km) and 4-hours of the CTRL simulation. There is a small but not systematic change in landfall time in the experiments due to deviations in the tracks, with landfall occurring earlier by 1h30 for SST+1, 2h30 for SST+2 and 3h30 for SST+3 and SST+4. In the case of negative SSTs the largest difference occurs with SST-1 which results in landfall 2 hours after CTRL. The other negative SST anomalies only result in landfall 30-mins after the CTRL run. The sign of the SST anomaly has little influence on the latitude of landfall 25 with the largest SST anomalies of both signs making landfall further south. However, after landfall the positive SST simulations have a tendency to move further southwards than the negative SST runs.\nDifferences in intensity between the SST experiments and the CTRL run are shown in Fig. 4b and c. The experiment setup means all simulations are initialised with the same pressure and wind fields. After 24 hours there are clear differences in the intensities, with larger differences occurring with larger temperature anomalies. The larger the positive anomaly the more intense is the storm with lower pressures and higher wind speeds. The larger the negative anomaly the opposite is true with lower intensities occurring. Increasing the SST has a larger influence on the minimum pressure than decreasing it with a maximum difference of -60 hPa occurring in SST+4 and 45 hPa in SST-4. The minimum pressure also occurs earlier in the run as the positive SST anomaly is increased. The 5 earlier landfall is evident in the wind speed differences between the positive SST anomaly runs as the difference becomes negative when they make landfall prior to CTRL.\nThe radius of maximum winds (RMW) increases with cooler SSTs (Fig5a) . This is consistent with the storm becoming less intense and more asymmetric. When the SST is increased by 1 degree, the RMW decreases, however, increasing the SST further doesn't decrease the RMW by much more. A more appropriate definition of 10 the size of the storm is the radius of gale force winds (> 17.5 m s -1 ; R17). R17 increases as SST increases (Fig 5b) .\nThe decrease in R17 with decreasing SST is much smaller. Although positive SSTs result in larger wind speeds at smaller radii (small RMW), the high wind speeds persist to larger radii.\nThe integrated kinetic energy (IKE, Powell & Reinhold 2007) takes into account both maximum wind speeds and storm size and is therefore a good measure of the destructiveness of a TC. Here we measure IKE for wind speeds 15 greater than 17.5 ms -1 (IKE17) over the entire domain of grid 3. Increasing the SST anomaly from -4 to +4 shows a clear increase in the IKE17 (Fig. 5c ). This is due primarily to the increase in wind speeds (squared in the IKE calculation) as the SST anomaly increases.\nThe different characteristics between the sensitivity runs in terms of the location of landfall, translational speed and RMW lead to differences in the simulated maximum storm surge largely due to the complex interaction with local This may be due to a slight shift in the track southward and the TC approaching the coastline from a more northerly (less shore-normal) direction; it may also be due to localized changes in hydrodynamic momentum balances of individual bays and other coastal features, or some combination of the two. However, if the total area affected by 30 storm surge within each simulation is calculated (Fig 6b) , here arbitrarily defined as +1 m of water elevation, there 8 is a clear and consistent increase in the area and duration of storm surge from SST-4 to SST+4, qualitatively similar to the consistent increase in the TCs IKE.\nTCs cause widespread damage due to high wind speeds and storm surge. In addition, extreme precipitation events are also associated with the passage of TCs. Precipitation within 500 km of the TC centre in the control run reaches almost 6 mm hr -1 km -2 which is slightly higher than that recorded in TRMM 3B42 satellite data (not shown); this 5 is expected due to the higher model resolution. The influence of SST on the precipitation is shown in Fig. 7a .\nBefore landfall, the precipitation rate increases as both the SST increases and the intensity of the storm increases.\nIncreases in precipitation rate with increased positive SST anomalies are greater than the decreases with negative SST anomalies as there is a limit by how much the precipitation can decrease. After landfall, negative SST anomalies result in lower precipitation rates. Precipitation rates after landfall in the positive SST anomaly 10 simulations are more variable, with only minor changes from the CTRL run.\nThe spatial distribution of rainfall shown as a 30-min rainfall rate for each of the 9 simulations at landfall is shown in Fig 8. The increase in precipitation with increasing SST anomalies is clearly evident, leading to higher precipitation rates in both the inner and outer rainbands. A cooler upper ocean leads to a less distinct eye of the storm and increases the storm's asymmetry by elongating it in the meridional direction. The distribution of 15 precipitation within the inner rainband shows a shift in position of the maximum rainfall from the front-left quadrant in SST-1 and CTRL to the front-right quadrant in SST+3 and SST+4. This is consistent with observations of TCrainfall (Lonfat et al. 2004) . The increase in the size of the storm, in terms of the extent of its rainbands, as SST anomaly increases is also evident. The extent of the outer rainbands evident in Fig 8 also help to explain the secondary peak in the area affected by storm surge (Fig 6b) when a greater than 1\u00b0C SST anomaly is applied since 20 there will be high wind speeds associated with these.\nIn order to analyse the precipitation distribution in more detail, the precipitation was accumulated over different radii (Fig 7b; 0 -100 km, 100 -200 km, 200 -300 km, 300 -400 km and 400 -500 km). The largest rainfall amounts occur between 100 km and 200 km from the centre of the storm in all simulations. This is in contrary to the maximum within 100 km shown in observations (e.g. Lonfat et al. 2004 ) and can be accounted for by the larger 25 size of the eye relative to observations. A decrease in the SST leads to a decrease in the accumulated rainfall in all radii. However, increasing the SST from the CTRL value makes little difference to the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre (red line Fig 7b) . This is inconsistent with climate change studies which project an increase in the precipitation rate within 100 km (Knutson et al. 2010 ) but, as previously mentioned, is likely to be due to the larger vortex in the current study. The increase in SST results in a change in the distribution of rainfall 30 with more falling in the 200 -300 km band than within 100 km. It could be argued that Yasi was such an extraordinary TC in terms of size compared to other TCs impacting Queensland that it does not necessarily fit climate change studies."}, {"section_title": "Summary and discussion", "text": "This study uses an idealised numerical modelling sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of imposed SST anomalies on TC Yasi. Yasi was a very powerful storm and occurred at a time when SSTs were above average; observations of storm surge extent and maxima (Fig 3) . A set of simulations with uniform SST anomalies applied over the whole region ranging from -4 C and 4 C show the influences of SST on TC characteristics.\nThe simulations indicate that an increase (decrease) in SST results in an increase (decrease) in intensity, radius of gale-force winds, IKE and precipitation (Fig 4b, c and 5 ). However, the track prior to landfall was not affected by SST changes (Fig 4a) . After landfall the higher intensity storms associated with warmer SST's have a tendency to 15 move further south. Cooler upper ocean temperatures result in an increase in the radius of maximum winds, although the high wind speeds do not extend to as large radii; this is consistent with an increase in the asymmetry of the storm. In general, changes in TC properties are larger (smaller) for warmer (cooler) SST's. This may be due to there being a limit by how much the values can decrease whilst still maintaining a circulation. On the contrary changes in maximum storm surge are strongest for SST-1 and SST-2 but increases in SST or further decreases have 20 only a little effect. However, when the storm surge area is considered, an increase in SST results in consistent increases to the total area affected by the storm surge, qualitatively similar to the increases in IKE. Analysis of the rainfall rates shows that as SST increases the amount of precipitation increases and there is a change in the distribution of the precipitation. Both a shift from the front-left to front-right quadrants and to larger radii is evident.\nAs with previous SST sensitivity experiments (e.g. Evans et al. 1994, Kilic and Rable 2013) , this is a highly 25 idealised sensitivity study and there are a number of limitations. As Emanuel and Sobel (2013) point out, changing the SST without changing the surface variables that would cause this change will result in imbalances in the surface energy balance and the observed changes may not be realistic. For example, the stability in the lower atmosphere will have altered which will affect the development of convection and ultimately the intensification of the tropical cyclones and associated rainfall. Therefore, these results are not suitable for quantitative climate change assessments since other changes in the environment important for TC formation and development will also change.\nHowever, this study provides qualitative insight into the influence of SST alone on the intensity and characteristics of a tropical cyclone and the associated storm surge. For example, the results suggest maximum storm surge heights would have been several meters less has a similar TC formed when overall SST were 1-2\u00b0C lower (e.g. during non- "}]
