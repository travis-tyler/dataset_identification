Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) data dating as far back as 1954 have been recovered, and as many as 15 years of additional historical data from the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) have been recovered for large firms. 1 The oldest microdata available to researchers at the Center for Economic Studies (CES) and in the Research Data Centers (RDCs) as of December 2009 were manufacturing data from the 1963 Census of Manufactures (CM).

Jordan (1965) studies the measurement of capacity utilization, and Schaffer (1968) looks at changes in the structure of manufacturing employment. CES recovered not only the original pilot study data, but also what we believe to be the 1954-1964 linked ASM data covering all manufacturing industries discussed in Kallek (1982). The ITS data were abandoned when a new, and ultimately very successful, project to link manufacturing data began in the early 1980s (Kallek, 1982). This project was led by Nancy Ruggles and Richard Ruggles and developed the Longitudinal Establishment Database, a predecessor to the manufacturing microdata available at CES today (Atrostic, 2009). The ITS data were not included in the 1980s project because of anticipated difficulties in linking to the more recent 1972 data. Given the computing capabilities and other data sources available now, there is a good probability these data can be linked to the currently available manufacturing data at CES. 3 \nOne of many drawers full of paper data storage register files, which contain vital information for the recovery of data files stored on the Unisys. Over a decade ago, then-CES researcher, Al Nucci (1998) wrote of the significant technical and institutional challenges in moving historical microdata to modern computing systems: \"In principle, it ought to be a relatively straightforward exercise to obtain these data (i.e., a copy from archival tapes). This is not the case. The Census Bureau's legacy mainframe is a nonstandard UNISYS (a descendant of the earlier UNIVAC computers). Further, the Census Bureau enhanced the capabilities of these computers with a proprietary file system. Hence the migration of data from earlier years not only has the more traditional problem of missing or incomplete file documentation and deteriorating tape files but requires the use of specialized software, often specially written for each file. Further, the skills required for these tasks are no longer common at the [Census] Bureau and becoming increasingly rare as time progresses, in addition to the continuing diminution of Census Bureau institutional memory on the contents of earlier files and at their creation.\" CES assembled team members from a number of professions and divisions across the Census Bureau. Partners from the Research Data Center (RDC) system and the broader research community also joined the data recovery team. See Text Box 4-4. Recovery is only the first step in creating usable research microdata files. CES programmers are working to develop processes that should greatly streamline the last steps of converting the data from legacy formats and character sets to more readily accessible formats, such as ASCII or SAS datasets. After the conversion is completed, substantial work will remain to assess the data and make them consistent with data already at CES. Decommissioning the Unisys closed a long and significant chapter in Census Bureau computing history. Some of the recovered files were likely initially processed on the Census Bureau's UNIVAC I computer, first used by the Census Bureau in 1951.

Griliches led efforts to develop a longitudinallylinked dataset containing 1957-1965 companylevel data from the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) matched to data from the 1958 and 1963 CM and Enterprise Statistics (ES). Griliches (1980) details this effort and discusses limitations of the data. Using these linked data, he found a positive relationship between investments in R&D and company productivity. Griliches returned to the Census Bureau to extend his work in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, the data from his original project had been lost (Griliches, 1986). With Census Bureau staff doing the hands-on data work, Griliches designed a new dataset. The new dataset contained 1957-1977 firmlevel data from the SIRD matched to data from the 1962, 1967, and 1977 ES and data from the 1967 and 1972 CM. The sample was limited to certainty companies from the 1972 SIRD and contains approximately 1,100 companies. Griliches highlights three findings in his 1986 paper: (1) investments in R&D make a positive contribution to productivity growth; (2) basic research is a more important contributor to productivity than other types of R&D; and 3privately-financed R&D expenditures appear to be more effective at the company-level than federally-financed R&D expenditures. The data underlying the findings in Griliches (1986) were recently recovered from the Unisys machine as part of the historical data recovery project. 4 CES currently has data from the SIRD going back to 1972. The addition of the Griliches sample extends our historical information for many large R&D companies back to 1957. While the Griliches sample is limited to large companies and key SIRD variables (e.g., total R&D expenditures, number of scientists and engineers), up to 15 additional years of data will now be available for many large R&D companies. The recovered data have been converted into SAS datasets. Foster and Grim (2010) use these newly recovered data to extend the period covered in their analysis of research and development back to the 1950s.

Staff with the necessary skills and institutional memory retired. The Unisys machine became increasingly fragile, prone to crashes, and difficult to bring back on line. Important data from several censuses and surveys were nevertheless retrieved and some made available for research.

The creation of research-ready SAS datasets was deferred. This change, together with process improvements and increased staffing, led to a dramatic improvement in the flow of data from the Unisys. In the 6 months prior to the change in processing, the data recovery team moved economic data from approximately 20 registers from the Unisys. In the 4 months Moving data from the Unisys was a complicated process with many technical challenges. See Text Box 4-6. The data had to be converted from a variety of formats to a format that could be copied from the Unisys and read on a modern computer. Initially, the unstructured data were read in variable-by-variable and loaded into SAS datasets. This procedure proved to be painstakingly slow. The data recovery team made a major change to this procedure CES researchers examined over 2,000 registers. Consulting with other subject-matter experts as needed, they set priorities for recovery and created electronic scans of hundreds of important registers."}, {"section_title": "Moving Data From the Unisys", "text": "After the data to be recovered were identified, much work remained.

The Census Bureau purchased UNIVAC I, serial number 001, in 1951. It was the first commercial electronic general-purpose data processing computer. However, the lineage of the Unisys Clearpath is better traced back to the UNIVAC 1100 series of mainframe, specifically the UNIVAC 1105 and 1107 models. In 1958, the Census Bureau acquired the first two UNIVAC 1105 computers ever sold. In 1963, the Census Bureau purchased two UNIVAC 1107 computers. 1 Since then, the Census Bureau has had one or more 1100 or 2200 series mainframes in near continual operation. The Unisys Clearpath 4400 is in the same family line as the UNIVAC 1107, sharing hardware characteristics (such as the 36 bit word) and using the same family of operating systems. The Census Bureau's UNIVAC I was retired in 1964. The UNIVAC 1105s were retired in 1967, and the UNIVAC 1107s were replaced in 1971.

Listed below is a small subset of the technical issues that made the data recovery effort such a challenging exercise. 1. The Unisys operating environment. Expertise with the Unisys 1100/2200 series is now rare at the Census Bureau. Most of the data recovery work was done by people who had never previously logged on to a Unisys. Of the Center for Economic Studies staff involved with the recovery effort, only one had prior experience on a Unisys, and that experience ended in 1982. 2. Legacy character sets. Although some of the data recovered were in the ASCII character set, the vast majority of the data were in the less familiar FIELDATA character set. Developed in the 1950s by the Department of Defense, the FIELDATA character set was only used widely in commercial computing on the Unisys 1100/2200 series. EBCDIC data and data in the Excess-3 character set, a character set not widely used since the 1960s, were also recovered. 3. Completely unstructured data. All of the data recovered were stored in files that did not enforce any data structure. To enable users to properly interpret the data, hardcopy record layouts-road maps of the data-were prepared when these files were initially created. In many cases, the record layouts were lost, requiring the data recovery team to develop and implement new methods to move the data off of the Unisys. 4. Unique record and file formats. Much of the data were stored in CENsus Input Output (CENIO) files. CENIO is a unique Census Bureau-developed file structure. Data were also retrieved from \"Algol Direct Access files\" and a \"save file\" from a System 2000 database.

Further processing is required to convert the remainder of the recovered data to modern formats. Record layouts are not available for some data files. These cases will require additional analysis to reconstruct the record layout.
