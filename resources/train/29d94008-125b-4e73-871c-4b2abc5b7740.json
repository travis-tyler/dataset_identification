Methods: Serum levels of 84 TG species were measured using untargeted lipid profiling of 714 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort including 194 cognitively normal older adults (CN) and 351 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 169 AD. Principal component (PC) analysis with factor rotation was used for dimension reduction of TG species. Association of PCs with AD risk and biomarkers was assessed for CSF, MRI and [ 18 F]FDG-PET using Bonferroni-adjusted p-values. Results: The 84 TGs yielded 9 PCs, one of which consisting of long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing TGs (PUTGs), was significantly associated with MCI and AD (corrected p-value < 0.05). Lower levels of PUTGs were observed in MCI and AD compared to CN. This PC was also significantly associated with hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortical thickness (corrected p-value < 0.05). In participants carrying APOE \u03b54 allele, this PC was significantly associated with CSF amyloid-\u03b21-42 values and entorhinal cortical thickness (corrected p-value < 0.05).\nThis study shows PUTGs significantly associated with diagnostic group and AD biomarkers, a finding that was more pronounced in APOE \u03b54 carriers.

TGs are lipids that are comprised of three fatty acids (FA) linked a glycerol backbone. Blood total TG levels are measured in routine clinical check-ups.\nDepending on the FAs that contribute to the TG, many combinations of carbon chains and double bonds result, leading to more than 6,000 species encompassed by the term \"triglyceride\".\nConflicting reports exist in the literature regarding TG homeostasis in AD. No relationship between AD and total TGs has been reported, 1 while others suggest that elevated TGs early in life represented a risk factor for increased amyloidosis 20 years later. 2, 3 Finally, others found that individuals with probable AD had significantly decreased serum TG levels. 4, 5 Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carrier status may serve as a risk factor for altered TG levels in AD.\nTGs are transported by lipoproteins, due to their lipophilic nature. APOE regulates TG homeostasis by acting as a ligand for the TG-rich lipoproteins. APOE is composed of three allele types: \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54. The APOE \u03b54 allele is a major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD and is associated with a significant decrease in blood TG levels in AD. 5 Here, we examined the association between TGs and AD biomarkers, with and without medication adjustment. We also investigated the effect of APOE \u03b54 by stratifying for APOE \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers.

These results suggest that the observed PUTGs are associated with early-disease changes in AD."}, {"section_title": "Bernath 16", "text": "The association of PUTGs with atrophy in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus is noteworthy as these regions are affected in early stages of AD pathophysiology. A\u03b2 accumulation is an important early change in AD and is associated with APOE \u03b54 carrier status. Triglycerides (TGs) have been shown to be particularly associated with A\u03b2. For example, mouse studies showed that serum TG levels were elevated prior to amyloid deposition, 25 while human studies showed increased serum TGs were associated with increased amyloidosis in cognitively normal individuals. 3 Longitudinal studies showed that increased midlife TGs predicted amyloidosis and tau pathology 20 years later, 2 providing additional evidence for the early influence of TGs in AD. Thus, it is particularly interesting that we found a selective association of PUTGs with CSF A\u03b2 only in APOE \u03b54 carriers. The specific mechanistic role underlying the association of decreased PUTGs and early processes involved in AD pathogenesis remains to be determined, but our results suggest a relationship between a decrease in serum levels of PUTGs and earlystage biomarkers in AD. Results remained significant after adjusting for medication use. Thus, exposure to medication by AD and some MCI patients does not appear to account for these results, although some roles cannot be entirely ruled out.\nThe relationship between TGs and amyloid-\u03b2 may be explained through role of TGs in the lipoprotein peripheral transport of A\u03b2. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a plasma protein that is involved in lipid transport and metabolism in lipoproteins, including TG-rich lipoproteins. 26 Studies suggest that TG-rich lipoproteins may participate in peripheral A\u03b2 transport and delivery, as evidenced by a study that showed A\u03b2 accumulated in TG-rich lipoproteins. 27 As discussed above, ApoE exists in three major isoforms, ApoE \u03b54, ApoE \u03b53, and ApoE \u03b52. ApoE \u03b54 has been shown unable to complex with A\u03b2 and, peripherally, to associate with triglyceride-rich, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in contrast to high-density lipoproteins. 28, 29 These studies Bernath 17 suggest an important relationship between A\u03b2 and peripheral TG lipoprotein carriers that may provide further insight into aberrant serum PUTG levels in AD.\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles, as evidenced by their associations with cognitive improvement in the elderly. 30 In blood, polyunsaturated fatty acids travel in different states: esterified, bound to complex lipids (such as TGs) or lipoproteins, or freefloating. Triglycerides are created by incorporating three fatty acids onto a carbon backbone, which can then serve to transport and store fatty acids. A previous study, using the same TG dataset, identified EPA and DHA as the primary polyunsaturated fatty acids contributing to PUTG fatty acids of \"PC5\" (Barupal DK, et al., \"in press\"). Recently published studies have shown that serum DHA and EPA levels were decreased in AD, 31 and that polyunsaturated fatty acid intake acted to reduced risk for AD. 32 We found that lower levels of PUTGs were associated with poorer cognitive performance. Due to the importance of these polyunsaturated fatty acids in cognition and neuroinflammation, we believe our findings need further study to determine the overlapping mechanism that may underlie PUTG and polyunsaturated fatty acid aberrations.\nPUTGs and, by extension, polyunsaturated fatty acids represent links in the gut-liver-brain axis.\nTriglycerides are synthesized in the liver or absorbed from the gut and have recently been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. 33 PUFAs are rapidly and preferentially incorporated into TGs following postprandial ingestion, suggesting an important role for TGs in PUFA supplementation. 34 The gut-liver-brain communicate through neuronal, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrine pathways. These pathways overlap polyunsaturated fatty acids and AD and may serve an interesting direction to study PUTGs."}, {"section_title": "Bernath 18", "text": "A Lipid Hypothesis has been proposed, suggesting that lipid oxidation is the initiating factor for late-onset AD. 35 Lipid oxidation is a key early event in AD that precedes amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle deposition. When lipids are exposed to free radicals, they progress through autoperoxidation, where reactive oxidative species are released. Previous studies have shown that A\u03b2 aggregation occurred more readily in membranes composed of oxidized lipids, 36 and that polyunsaturated lipids were most vulnerable to oxidative stress. 37 Early-stage AD is characterized by an accumulation of A\u03b2, potentially resulting from impaired clearance of pathogenic species by microglia. Early microglial activity is neuroprotective, but progressive cytokine production from microglia, due to aging and disease progression, can reduce A\u03b2 clearance and promote its accumulation. Peripheral inflammatory cytokines have been shown to interact with or pass through endothelial cells on the blood-brain barrier to activate microglia. It is well established that polyunsaturated fatty acid intake is associated with an anti-inflammatory effect. Polyunsaturated fatty acids have been directly linked to the regulation of cytokines by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory pathways. 38 Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acid intake has been shown to decrease microglial inflammatory activation of A\u03b2, supporting a neuroprotective role. 39 Decreases in PUTGs could presumably result in decreased availability for polyunsaturated fatty acids and loss of neuroprotective metabolites, thereby suggesting the need for further study into this relationship.\nNeural connections between the brain and the gut exist through the vagus nerve and enteric system. The vagus nerve originates in the brain stem and complexes onto the enteric plexus in the gut. These neural connections are important for gastric motility and have been implicated in relaying inflammatory, microbial and nutrient information from the gut to the brain. 40 Interestingly, dietary fat has shown to activate the vagus nerve and neuroimmunologic Bernath 19 pathways. 41 Recent work in Parkinson's disease found that severance of the vagal trunk was protective against PD, suggesting that central nervous system (CNS) invasion may occur from the gut, through the vagus nerve. 42 This study provides an interesting avenue of study for AD due to many links between PD and AD.\nThe gastrointestinal tract is home to more than 10 times the number of bacteria than cells in the human body, functioning in a mutualistic relationship with their human host. 43 Gut microbiota are known to function in immune responses, nutrient absorption, and regulate gut motility. 44, 45 When gut microbiota is no longer homeostatic (gut dysbiosis), the CNS receives signals to activate inflammatory processes. Alterations in gut microbiota have been linked to neurological conditions, including AD, 46 where gut dysbiosis was associated with memory dysfunction and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. 47 Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake has been associated with changes in gut microbiota and intestinal excretion of mucosal defense factors that exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. 48 The data suggests an interesting relationship between polyunsaturated fatty acids, gut microbiota and AD and an interesting direction to study PUTGs.\nWe did not see a significant association between saturated TGs and AD, although we did find a significant difference in PUTGs between diagnostic groups. A recent meta-analysis revealed that, over time, saturated fat intake was associated with an increase in AD risk. 49 It is possible that blood TG levels do not accurately represent long-term saturated TG intake and, rather, BMI may better represent the effects of highly saturated diets over time. 50 Further studies are required to investigate these findings.\nThere are some limitations to our study. This is a cross-sectional study investigating early investigations into the cause of decreased PUTGs using mouse models of AD may provide insight relevant to early detection and treatment for AD. Replication in independent samples and longitudinal follow-up of the present cohort will also be important.\nIn summary, our study investigated the relationship between TG species, AD risk and biomarkers for AD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show decreased levels of highly unsaturated, long-chain triglycerides in MCI and AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, an association between PUTGs and extent of brain atrophy and amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, and the effect of APOE \u03b54 carrier status on PUTGs in AD. Moreover, our results provide a potential mechanism to study the relationship of PUFA supplements with memory in AD. Overall, our findings suggest that PUTGs may have potential as an early detection biomarker and a target for therapeutic development. "}]
