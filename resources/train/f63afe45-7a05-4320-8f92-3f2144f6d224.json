[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that can cause problems with human memory, thinking and behavior. This disease causes cell death and nerve tissue damage in the brain. The brain damage can be detected using brain volume, whole brain form, and genetic testing. In this research, we propose texture analysis of the brain and genomic analysis to detect Alzheimer's disease. 3D MRI images were chosen to analyze the texture of the brain, and microarray data were chosen to analyze gene expression. We classified Alzheimer's disease into three types: Alzheimer's, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Normal. In this study, texture analysis was carried out by using the Advanced Local Binary Pattern (ALBP) and the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). We also propose the bi-clustering method to analyze microarray data. The experimental results from texture analysis show that ALBP had better performance than GLCM in classification of Alzheimer's disease. The ALBP method achieved an average value of accuracy of between 75% -100% for binary classification of the whole brain data. Furthermore, Biclustering method with microarray data shows good performance gene expression, where this information show influence Alzheimer's disease with total of bi-cluster is 6."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's is a disease that causes damage to nerve tissue, so the memory cannot work well. Texture analysis is one approach that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Several texture approaches have been introduced to classify Alzheimer's, such as the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Wavelet Transformation, the Statistical Approach, and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). A texture with high correlation can be seen in hippocampal volume changes at Alzheimer's [1] . Reference [2] shows the image texture analysis on MRI brain using statistical feature extraction approach, namely Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and wavelet transform. Whereas in other studies, 3D MRI brain images are used to detect between AD and MCI by looking at the texture of hippocampus [3] . There are also studies that suggest making the detection of AD and normal for 3D MRI brain images using GLCM approach with different size Region of Interest (ROI) [4] . In another study, the use of texture hippocampus to detect Alzheimer's and normal brain MRI of 2D images using statistical methods and wavelet transform was introduced [5] . In the same year, research of texture analysis usage, hippocampus volume and medial temporal lobe in AD patients by using GLCM approach to analyze texture were conducted [6] . The GLCM and Run Length Matrix (RLM) have been used to analyze the texture of hippocampus. A further local statistical method based on co-occurrence matrix texture map is introduced to diagnose the onset of Alzheimer's by classifying between MCI and normal [7] . Result showed that this method outperformed gray matter local density method. The use of 3D Local Binary Pattern (LBP) in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease with FDG-PET images has also been introduced [8] . The proposed LBP is based on its volume.\nThe approach proposed by the authors was to use LBP for feature texture extraction. LBP has demonstrated its simplicity in computing. Basically, a LBP is formed based on the original sign value between the center pixel values and pixel values in the surrounding neighborhood. In this study, the expansion of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) with the magnitude values are also used. This paper investigates the use of the sign value and magnitude of each joint Local Binary Pattern (LBP) that is formed for a 2D brain image. The proposed approach in this study consists of three stages, namely feature extraction, feature selection and classification.\nIn addition, genomic analysis using gene expression data is also used to find out where these genes influence risk for Alzheimer's. Several methods have been proposed previously.\nIn this study, we propose two methods for detection of Alzheimer's disease. As the first method, we used the texture analysis approach based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP) using sign and magnitude values that is called the Advance Local Binary Pattern (ALBP) for analyzing brain images. As the second method, we employed the genomic analysis approach using bi-clustering in microarray data.\nThe goal of this paper is to detect Alzheimer's disease, MCI, and Normal using texture and genomic analysis. Texture features analysis is a powerful quantitative approach for analyzing features in MRI data. An important property of texture analysis that makes it advantageous for use in MRI analysis is its robustness with respect to acquisition parameters. On the other hand, genomic analysis aims to discover how the genes influence risk for Alzheimer's."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "To analysis the performance of the proposed approach in this research, we conducted two kinds of analysis.

This approach utilizes LBP with the use of sign and magnitude value, where pixel values are located at the center of the neighboring values [9] . An LBP with a sign value of the original LBP was introduced by [10] . In this paper, we called this approach as the Advanced Local Binary Pattern of Sign (ALBPS). ALBPS is basically obtained from binary process derivatives with the following formula\nwhere P is the number of neighbors and R is the radius.\nMeanwhile, the LBP that utilizes the magnitude value called the Advanced Local Binary Pattern of Magnitude (ALBPM) is formulated as follows\nwhere c is the average number of magnitude from whole images.\nBoth ALBPS and ALBPM produce binary strings, so they can be used simultaneously for feature extraction. Furthermore, the code of ALBPS and ALBPM can be used to produce a joint 2D histogram. The ALBP scheme is represented as \"ALBPSM\". This method is used for feature extraction of 2D multi slice images.\nIn this research, the authors propose an approach to feature extraction of 3D volume data. This approach begins with the use of three planes of a volume image, namely xy, xz and yz. In a previous study, this approach was introduced with the name of the Local Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) [11] . LBP-TOP apply LBP uniform with sign values for each plane. Meanwhile, the authors use the ALBPSM of each plane as a 3D descriptor in this study. The 3D image is converted into 2D images and then xy, xz and yz are obtained for each plane. Furthermore, ALBPSM is calculated for all slices in each plane in order to obtain the ALBPSM histogram for planes xy, xz and yz. Afterwards, the histograms of the three planes are combined into one, and it is used as the input feature vectors. We represent this method as an Advanced Local Binary Pattern of Sign and Magnitude from Three Orthogonal Planes (ALBPSM-TOP). ALBPSM-TOP also implemented the utilizing rotation invariant and uniform approach [12, 13] . An illustration of ALBPSM-TOP can be seen in Figure 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2. Scheme of ALBPSM-TOP Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Uniform Local Binary Pattern and Rotation Invariant Local Binary Pattern", "text": "An LBP is called uniform if the binary vector T contains at most two transitions 0 and 1 or vice versa when the bit pattern is considered circular. Figure 2 highlights the pattern shapes that are uniform and not uniform. Another approach proposed such as LBP uniform and LBP rotation invariant [14] . Unlike the LBP uniform, the LBP rotation invariant is trying to do the rotations of a textured input image because the LBP patterns are translated into different locations and rotated around their origin. We construct the histogram by using normalization values of LBP codes obtained from rotation invariant mapping. In this mapping, each binary value of the LBP code is circularly rotated into the minimum value with the following formula\nwhere ROR (x, i) is the circular bitwise right rotation of bit sequence of x by i steps. The histogram of LBP ri P,R called invariant if the rotation angle of input image is\u03b1 = x 360 \u2022 P , x = 1, 2, ..., P \u2212 1. This method is robust for analyzing brain images with different angles [4] ."}, {"section_title": "Feature Selection using Factor Analysis", "text": "The purpose of factor analysis (FA) is to reduce the redundancy among variables using the smallest number of factors. FA correlates more between variables that are used for a specific factor. FA models can be simply defined as follows:\nSuppose there is a set of random N observable random variables x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , ..., x n with means\u00b5 1 , \u00b5 2 , \u00b5 3 , ..., \u00b5 n .

The mean of f is equal to 0 and the covariance of f is the identify matrix. This assumption allows computing the factor loadings\u039busing the maximum likelihood approach [15] . Once the factor loadings have been estimated, then this result will be used as a feature vector for classification purposes."}, {"section_title": "Classification", "text": "In this study, Support Vector Machine and the Nave Bayes Classifier are used for classification because of their ability to pattern the classification.

Performance of the classification is influenced by the model used for classification. The authors used k-fold cross validation with k = 10 as a model for learning performance data of the training and testing data.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, the value of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are measured with the following equation\nIn addition to evaluating the accuracy, kappa statistics are also used to measure the agreement between predicted and observed categorizations of a dataset, while correcting for an agreement that occurs by chance."}, {"section_title": "Gene Expression Analysis of Microarray Data", "text": "One of the usual goals in expression data analysis is to group genes according to their expression under multiple conditions, or to group conditions based on the expression matrix. In gene expression, data clustering can be done with a bi-cluster algorithm, which is a clustering method that involves not only the object to be clustered, but also the properties or condition of the object.\nIn this study, the proposed technique is twophase bi-clustering method. The first phase is implementation of parallel k-means to generate k clusters. Furthermore, the H-score of the clusters are calculated and checked to see whether they are within the threshold value. If the cluster's H-score is within the threshold value, then we get the resultant bi-cluster with all the condition (columns). However, with all the conditions, the clusters that are generated may have Hscore values greater than the threshold. So the second phase of the algorithm is required where the residue score of Cheng and Church is applied to each of the columns of the clusters."}, {"section_title": "Bi-clustering of expression data by Cheng and Church", "text": "Bi-clustering of expression data using the method of Cheng and Church involves an iterative greedy search. The greedy algorithm follows the strategy of making a local optimal choice in each step, in order to find a global optimum. This kind of heuristic does not ensure an optimal global solution will be obtained, but approximates it in a reasonable time. They work by either recursively or iteratively constructing a set of objects from the smallest possible constituent parts [16] .\nCheng and Church were the first to apply biclustering to gene expression data. Their algorithm adopts a sequential covering strategy in order to return a list of n bi-clusters from an expression data matrix. In order to assess the quality of a bi-cluster, the algorithm makes use of mean squared residue (MSR). This measure aims at evaluating the coherence of the genes and conditions of a bi-cluster by using the means of genes and conditions expression values in it.\nLet X be the set of genes and Y the set of conditions. Let a i j be the element of the expression matrix A representing the logarithm of the relative abundance of the mRNA of the ith gene under the jth condition. Let I \u2282 X and J \u2282 Y be subsets of genes and conditions. The pair (I, J) specifies a submatrix A IJ with the following MSRscore.\nwhere\nand Figure 5 shows a scheme of CC Biclustering Algorithm. The bi-clustering algorithm takes as input the expression matrix EM and the threshold \u03b4 imposed on MSR. \u03b4 is used to reject non \u03b4-bi-clusters. A list L of \u03b4-bi-clusters is returned as output. After pre-processing the missing values of the input data matrix by replacing them with random numbers, the bi-cluster discovery process is repeated as many times as the bi-clusters are desired. In each iteration, the bi-cluster B is initialized to the whole matrix. Next, three different phases for multiple node deletions, single node deletion, and node addition are applied. These phases iteratively perform the removal and addition of rows and columns, ensuring that the result is a \u03b4-bi-cluster. Finally, a substitution phase replaces the elements of the input matrix that are contained in the recently found bi-cluster with random values. This substitution is applied in order to prevent overlapping among biclusters, since it very unlikely that elements covered by existing bi-clusters would contribute to any future bi-cluster. Although this strategy succeeds in avoiding overlapping, CC has several drawbacks due to element masking and also due to the use of a threshold for rejecting solutions, which is depen-dent on each dataset and must be computed before applying the algorithm [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Algorithm 1.
