[{"section_title": "List of Figures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A persistent gender gap exists in entrepreneurship: men are almost twice as likely as women to start or own a business (Kauffman Foundation, 2017). To understand this gap, researchers have pursued explanations relating to gender differences in risk appetite, competitiveness, internal locus of control, and self-assessed ability (B\u00f6nte and Piegeler, 2013;Caliendo et al., 2015;Th\u00e9baud, 2010), as well as discrimination in access to financing (Bigelow et al., 2014;Buttner and Rosen, 1989;Carter et al., 2007). Not all gender differences advantage men relative to women; for instance, women score higher on some personality traits -openness and extraversion -that relate positively to entrepreneurship. Taking personality, demographics, and labor market characteristics all together, Caliendo et al. (2015) actually find that the unexplained gender gap in entrepreneurship grows larger after controlling for these covariates. Women's stronger preferences for flexible work hours and higher levels of educational attainment deepen the puzzle over low rates of female entry into entrepreneurship. I bring a new perspective to this question by turning to an important determinant of entrepreneurship more generally: a family history of business ownership. Cross-country evidence demonstrates that children of entrepreneurs are much more likely to be self-employed or start a business. 1 However, this transmission is stronger for same-sex parent-child pairs: in particular, fathers affect sons more strongly than daughters (Andersson and Hammarstedt, 2011;Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000;Lindquist et al., 2015;Niittykangas and Tervo, 2005). This transmission differential contributes mechanically to the gender gap in entrepreneurship, but its underlying source is unclear. The gap in transmission from fathers to daughters versus sons could have two components. First, the same paternal inputs may have different effects on sons' and daughters' entrepreneurship outcomes. Second, there could be gender differences in the level of inputs provided by fathers. These inputs include transfers of human capital, financial capital, or other assets. Since inputs cannot be measured perfectly, it is not possible to either estimate the gender gap in inputs or isolate the gender gap in transmission while holding inputs constant. Instead, I use an empirical strategy that varies inputs while holding gender constant: I estimate the effect of brothers on the strength of father-daughter transmission. If fathers prioritize sons, then girls with only sisters will face reduced competition for paternal resources. These sisters-only daughters serve as a counterfactual for the potential level of father-daughter entrepreneurship transmission in the absence of competition from brothers. Since families can select into having sons by having more children, I also estimate a specification comparing the transmission to first-born girls whose next-oldest sibling is male versus female. Families with a first-born daughter and at least one additional child are ex-ante identical regardless of the sex of the second child, allowing me to interpret differences in transmission with respect to sibling sex as causal. Using data on approximately 3,000 father-daughter pairs in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, an intergenerational, longitudinal household survey, I find that brothers significantly reduce the strength of the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship from fathers to daughters. Relative to daughters-only families, around 80 percent of the effect of fathers' selfemployment experience on daughters' entrepreneurship outcomes is eliminated when sons are present. The results are very similar when comparing first-born women with next-younger brothers versus sisters. Moreover, the transmission to daughters in sisters-only households is quite large -roughly a doubling in self-employment probabilities -and is comparable to the transmission from fathers to sons. This suggests that, when offered, paternal investments are valuable inputs into female entrepreneurship. I next look for evidence on which paternal investments are affected by sibling composition, focusing on transfers of money, business stakes, and human capital, which is assumed to be transmitted via training in the father's business. I first rule out that the transmission and crowd-out of entrepreneurship occurs via business inheritance. Since I cannot observe business inheritance directly, I define a potential inheritance as acquiring a same-industry business in the year one's father exits his business, or co-owning a business with a family member other than one's spouse. According to these measures, at most 7.7 percent of second-generation business owners may have inherited or co-owned a family business, and brothers have no effect on women's probability of inheriting a business. I find that sibling sex composition does not affect financial help provided by fathers to daughters. The effect of an additional sibling on the probability or amount of a transfer, while negative, does not depend on the sex of the sibling. However, I do find evidence of a gender gap in family business loans and investments. Among entrepreneurs, having a parent with business ownership experience boosts men's probability of receiving business financing from family members, but has no effect for women. Meanwhile, human capital does appear to be a relevant channel that is crowded out by brothers. I find some evidence that brothers crowd out girls' first-hand experience with their fathers' businesses in two distinct analyses: one using retrospective self-reports of experience in the family business, and the other using time-use data to study whether daughters spend time at work with their fathers. Existing work documents a correlation between work experience in a family business and entrepreneurial outcomes (Fairlie and Robb, 2007) but cannot distinguish causal effects from selection -that is, individuals with a taste or aptitude for entrepreneurship are more likely to both work in the family business and ultimately start their own business. This project is novel in that father-daughter interaction is exogenously affected by the presence of brothers and shown to have a follow-on effect on female entrepreneurship. I expect that these results are at least somewhat generalizable from daughters to sons: human capital investments by fathers in their sons are likely to play an important role in the father-son transmission of entrepreneurship. This would be consistent with other literature highlighting the role of human capital in occupational transmission. For instance, Bell et al. (2016) show that children of inventors are not only more likely to file a patent, but that these patents disproportionately occur in the same sub-class as their fathers' patents. This similarity is much more plausibly attributable to human capital transmission than to genetic ability or role modeling. Laband and Lentz (1983a) frame intergenerational entrepreneurship as a special case of occupational transmission: because proprietors have closer ties between their personal and work life, there is greater scope for human capital transmission to children. While this may be true, it is not the case that children of entrepreneurs follow narrowly into their parents' line of work. Consistent with Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (2000) and Andersson and Hammarstedt (2011), I find that while there is a slight increased propensity for occupational inheritance among self-employed father-daughter pairs, the vast majority of self-employed daughters of entrepreneurs work in distinct broad occupations and industries. Because the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship does not occur strictly along occupational lines, I conclude that the business human capital being transmitted is broadly applicable across occupations. I perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate how the crowd-out by sons of fatherdaughter entrepreneurship transmission contributes to the gender gap in self-employment. If all daughters of self-employed men experienced the sisters-only transmission effect, the gap in self-employment rates between sons and daughters of entrepreneurs would be approximately halved. Combining individuals with and without self-employed fathers, this counterfactual would reduce the overall gender gap in self-employment by about one percentage point, relative to the current gap of 5.5 percentage points. Given the responsiveness of girls in sisters-only households to paternal inputs, interventions that replicate these inputs -for example, placing girls in internships at small businesses -may be effective in increasing female-led business creation and shrinking the gap further. Indeed, these results are consistent with Wilson et al. (2007) who argue that experience in an entrepreneurial setting is essential in developing self-efficacy and increasing women's willingness to pursue entrepreneurship. The current shortage in entrepreneurial human capital held by women is significant both on a private and public level. The fact that more daughters of entrepreneurs select into selfemployment when they have only sisters suggests that many women prefer entrepreneurship to employment when they have the necessary human capital. In other words, acquiring business human capital makes women at least weakly better off by making entrepreneurship a viable career choice. Additionally, there are economic consequences to this entrepreneurship shortfall: business creation is an important source of employment and productivity growth (Aghion et al., 2014;Erken et al., 2016;Glaeser et al., 2015). Women's advances in educational attainment mean that there is more untapped potential for high-growth entrepreneurship than ever before (Mitchell, 2011). The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 1.2 reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on intergenerational entrepreneurship and sibling dynamics that provides a framework for this study. Section 1.3 describes the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in more detail and introduces the other data I will use to test mechanisms. Section 2.4 briefly lays out my main empirical strategy. Sections 1.5 and 1.6 present the empirical results relating to sibling crowd-out and the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. After reviewing some robustness checks in Section 1.7, I discuss my results in Section 1.8 and conclude in Section 1.9.\nSizable post-graduation earnings differences among college majors have been documented, and econometric evidence suggests that at least some portion reflects causal returns (Arcidiacono, 2004;Webber, 2014;Hastings et al., 2013;Kirkeboen et al., 2016). However, a systematic explanation for these differences does not exist. This is an important gap in our knowledge: understanding the reasons for the heterogeneity in earnings by major could provide guidance as to the scope for increasing average returns to college. Different mechanisms would point to different policies: for instance, subsidizing particular majors, modifying major curricula, or re-sorting students among majors. In this chapter I take a human capital approach to understanding the returns to college. 1 I focus on one type of heterogeneity among majors: the emphasis on occupation-specific skills relative to general skills. I hypothesize that differences in the intensity of occupation-specific training by major explain part of the heterogeneity in earnings among college graduates. Existing research demonstrates that major-job match quality is an important determinant of graduates' earnings, and the returns to relatedness are plausibly larger for majors that are relatively intensive in occupation-specific skills (Lemieux, 2014;Robst, 2007). Specific skills may crowd out general skills, meaning the effect of specificity on earnings would be negative when working in an unrelated occupation. If the returns to specific skills in related occupations are large enough relative to the returns to general skills, and graduates with more specific majors are likely enough to work in related occupations, then specificity will be associated with higher earnings on average. I develop two indices for a major's occupational specificity based on the mix of occupations held by graduates. I consider majors whose graduates appear in a concentrated set of distinctive occupations, or in occupations whose requirements are more similar than average, to be those emphasizing occupation-specific skills. I then study how these measures relate to employment and earnings using data on the college class of 1993 from the Baccalaureate and Beyond longitudinal study. I focus on differences in specificity within broad fields of study (e.g. Humanities, Biological sciences and health) because there are likely to be important unobservable differences among students and occupations across different broad fields, and if specificity is not balanced across fields I will attribute the effects of some of these unobservable differences to the effect of specificity. Earnings of graduates with more specific majors are more sensitive to major-occupation match: specificity is associated with lower earnings in unrelated occupations, and weakly higher earnings in related occupations. This pattern, combined with an increased likelihood of working in a related field, means that specificity is associated with a small wage premium on average. I cautiously interpret this as evidence that emphasizing occupational skills in college can increase earnings, at least early in the career. However, without random assignment of specificity to majors, and in the presence of ability sorting, it is not possible to demonstrate causality. Instead, the contribution of this chapter is to highlight one unidimensional characteristic of college majors that appears to be relevant to earnings and point to a potential area for further work. My metrics of specificity also provide a tool for assessing major curricula that could be applied in additional settings."}, {"section_title": "Background and related literature", "text": "Intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship Three main classes of mechanisms have been proposed for the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship. First, there appears to be a genetic component: using data on biological and adoptive parents of Swedish adoptees, Lindquist et al. (2015) estimate that around one-third of the total relationship between parent and child entrepreneurship can be explained by pre-birth factors. For children raised by their biological parents, genetic determinants of entrepreneurship are in general difficult to distinguish from the second mechanism: role modeling. Certain traits such as aptitude, self-esteem, and rebelliousness are strongly predictive of entrepreneurship (Levine and Rubinstein, 2017), and these may be passed from parents to children via genes or role modeling (Wyrwich, 2015). Besides cultivating these traits in their children, a more direct form of role modeling may exist whereby entrepreneurial parents make entrepreneurship a more salient or legitimate career choice (S\u00f8rensen, 2007). In this project, I focus on a third class of mechanisms: costly investments by parents in their children. Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (2000) propose a model in which the choice to become self-employed depends on entrepreneurial ability and, in the presence of liquidity constraints, assets; both ability and assets can be actively transmitted from entrepreneurial parents to their children. For instance, parents may build their children's business human capital by training them inside the family business. Empirically, working in the family business is an important predictor of future entrepreneurship and, especially, entrepreneurial success (Fairlie and Robb, 2007). Entrepreneurial parents may also have accumulated greater wealth that they can invest in their children's businesses. Additionally, they may be more willing to make such an investment, controlling for wealth, if their entrepreneurial history is associated with greater risk appetite or business savvy. Financial transfers have typically not been found to be quantitatively important in explaining the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship, but I will examine this mechanism nonetheless. Finally, while it is natural to expect that the intergenerational transmission of self-employment reflects transfers of family businesses from parents to children, this is relatively rare. Indeed, the majority of second-generation business owners actually work in a different industry than their parents did, suggesting that the transmission is not limited to children narrowly following in their parents' footsteps (Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000;Fairlie and Robb, 2007). Unlike genes and role modeling, costly investments are rivalrous in the sense that attention or money consumed by one child cannot be consumed by another child simultaneously. I consider any inputs that are completely non-rivalrous to be part of role modeling. For example, if children learn about business by overhearing their father's business conversations, this would be a non-rival mechanism. I interpret the fact that brothers crowd out transmission of entrepreneurship from fathers to daughters as evidence that rival mechanisms are active, although my empirical strategy does not test for or rule out passive mechanisms such as heritable ability or role modeling. Next, I describe why it may be the case that brothers influence transfers from fathers to daughters. Sibling gender and parent-child interactions The gender mix of siblings in a household could shape girls' outcomes in multiple ways. In this project I focus on how the presence of a son influences the relationship between fathers and daughters. Having a son may lead fathers to reallocate their attention away from daughters if fathers are more interested in interacting with sons or if parents \"believe they are better able to offer guidance and advice to their same-sex children,\" promoting a gender-specialized parenting strategy when both sons and daughters are present (McHale et al., 2003, 132). On the other hand, girls may benefit from having brothers because sons increase marital formation and stability, perhaps because men feel more responsibility for or attachment to their male children (Dahl and Moretti, 2008;Morgan et al., 1988). This could produce a spillover in which girls with brothers are more likely to be part of an intact family and living with their father. For similar reasons, sons have been shown to increase paternal involvement in childrearing overall. Girls with brothers may therefore interact more with fathers either incidentally or because fathers with sons increase their attention to daughters due to a norm that children be treated equally (Harris and Morgan, 1991;McHale et al., 2003). Data from time use diaries has shown that brothers increase father-daughter co-participation in leisure activities but reduce quality time, including time spent on homework and reading (Bren\u00f8e, 2017;Harris and Morgan, 1991;Mammen, 2011). Overall, the evidence is mixed as to whether the gender of a girl's siblings affects her level of educational attainment (Butcher and Case, 1994;Hauser and Kuo, 1998;Kuo and Hauser, 1996;Peter et al., 2015;Steelman et al., 2002). In contrast, two recent papers show that brothers have a significant negative effect on girls' probability of studying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Bren\u00f8e (2017) finds a small negative effect of brothers on Danish women's enrollment in STEM education: a reduction of around half a percentage point relative to the STEM enrollment rate of 33 percent among women with sisters. Oguzoglu and Ozbeklik (2016) estimate much larger effects of brothers concentrated on women with fathers in STEM occupations: having a brother roughly eliminates the positive effect of STEM fathers on daughters' STEM college major choice of around 16 percentage points for American women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) data and around 10 percentage points for Australian women in the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) data. These results are consistent with the gender-specialized parenting channel described above: fathers with sons are less likely to transmit occupation-related human capital and preferences to their daughters. It is also possible that the gender of siblings directly affects career choices by influencing children's gendered identity and interests. Brothers may pique girls' interest in traditionally male topics, or alternatively prompt them to \"develop different attributes and interests in an effort to establish their own niches in the family and reduce sibling rivalry\" (McHale et al., 2003). If this mechanism were operative for STEM (or entrepreneurship) career choice, one would expect brothers to affect female entry into these masculine fields even in families without a father in STEM (or self-employment), which Oguzoglu and Ozbeklik (2016) and I do not observe. The possibility remains that daughters of self-employed men shy away from entrepreneurship when they have brothers because of a reluctance to compete in the same space, not because fathers are less encouraging or willing to invest in them. I do find direct evidence that entrepreneurship-related human capital inputs are lowered for these girls: girls with brothers are less likely to spend time with their self-employed fathers at work or gain any experience working in the family business. However, it is not possible to say whether these inputs were withheld by fathers or rejected by daughters. The literature on parents' allocations of inter vivos transfers and bequests has centered on (1) altruism, (2) exchange, and (3) evolutionary motives. These three motives, respectively, predict that parents will use transfers to (1) equalize marginal utilities of children; (2) incentivize child actions, such as eldercare; and (3) promote continuation of the genetic line, for instance by rewarding children who produce grandchildren (Becker, 1974;Cox and Rank, 1992;Light and McGarry, 2004). The net effect of sibling gender composition on these motives is ambiguous. To the extent that men have higher earnings and lower marginal utility of income, women with brothers may receive a larger share of transfers than women with sisters because of the altruism motive. On the other hand, if transfers to sons are more productive -for instance, if investments have a larger effect on the probability of starting a successful business for sons than for daughters -then parents might optimally reallocate resources toward sons, at least earlier in the life cycle (Becker and Tomes, 1976). Meanwhile, if women are more likely to than men be caregivers for elderly parents, having more sisters will make any given woman less likely to be the target of transfers intended to incentivize caregiving. The net effect of sibling sex mix on transfers will be tested empirically in Section 1.6."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "\nSince the B&B sample is too small to accurately calculate the major specificity measures, I instead I calculate the normalized major isolation index as described in Section 2.4. I include noncollege graduates in the computation, but do not present results on the \"isolation\" of non-college workers. Table 2.1 lists the top ten and bottom ten ranking majors according to this measure. Consistent with expectations, the most isolated majors are those with a strong occupational emphasis, while those at the bottom of the ranking generally do not have an obvious occupation associated with them. Indeed, some of the most specific degrees are part of the requirements for certification or licensure to practice in the field (e.g. Nursing, Architecture, Engineering, and sometimes Education). Unless these requirements are frivolous, these degrees are likely to contain substantial occupational skills content. I next combine the O*NET data with the ACS data in order to calculate occupational distances. The O*NET data are reported at a finer level of occupational detail than the SOC, so I first collapse to SOC categories using the raw average of the characteristics of the sub-occupations. I then collapse the data to the level of the ACS occupations, this time weighting the averages using each SOC occupation's national employment level in May 2014 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). The complete list of standardized scores for each measure are presented in Figure 2.1. The distance measure is presented reverse coded here, so that a value of positive one indicates an average occupational distance that is one standard deviation smaller, i.e. closer, than average. The two measures have an unweighted correlation coefficient of 0.566, consistent with the prediction that more isolated majors will have lower average occupational distance. This correlation is relatively strong yet suggests that the measures are different enough to serve as a validation check.  Note: Both measures are normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one. Horizontal and vertical lines divide the majors into terciles of isolation and distance, respectively, weighted by the ACS frequencies."}, {"section_title": "Panel Study of Income Dynamics", "text": "To study the relationship between parent and child entrepreneurship, as well as the mediating effects of siblings, I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) 2 , a longitudinal, intergenerational survey of American households spanning the years 1968 to 2013. Starting in 1968, a sample of around 5,000 families were interviewed on topics such as employment (including selfemployment), income and assets (including business ownership), fertility and marital history, and more. All members of these initial families were followed as they formed new households, and children and partners of these individuals were added to the survey. Interviews were conducted annually until 1997, and biannually thereafter. Variables and definitions Self-employment in a given survey wave is defined as being selfemployed in any job asked about in that wave: current main job, previous jobs held since the last interview, or additional current jobs. I define an individual as having a self-employed father if the father was self-employed in at least two survey waves while the respondent was between ages 8 and 18. This is designed to serve as a measure of respondents' exposure to entrepreneurship during their formative years. I also consider alternative measures of entrepreneurship: incorporated self-employment and business ownership. However, business ownership information is only collected beginning in 1985, which limits the usable sample size. Siblings are defined based on the Childbirth and Adoption History file, a detailed retrospective collection of fertility. I define as siblings all children who share a father, whether adopted or biological. This is because the stepfather relationship may differ: stepbrothers or half-brothers with a different father may not have as prominent of an effect on the father-daughter relationship as full brothers or half-brothers who share a father. The main demographic data I use are age, sex, year of birth, and three categories for race: white, black, and other. In some robustness checks I include controls for state of residence and occupation. The PSID relies on the 1970 and 2000 Census occupation codes, which I crosswalk to a balanced panel of 264 occupations created by Dorn (2009) and Autor and Dorn (2013). I aggregate these to a set of 32 broad occupations for some analyses (see Appendix Table A.1). An individual's occupation in a given year is defined based on his or her current or most recent main job. I follow a similar procedure for crosswalking and aggregating industries for jobs (See Appendix Table   A.2). Meanwhile, businesses owned by respondents are recorded in 33 broad industries which are largely consistent over time. 3 Sample selection My analysis sample consists of adult (head, wife, or \"wife\" -cohabiting partner of head) female respondents whose fathers were observed at least four times while the respondent was between ages eight and eighteen. The four-observation restriction is made to reduce noise in the measure of father self-employment, in particular to reduce the chances that a father who really did have self-employment experience is classified as not self-employed simply because he happened not to be observed during a self-employment spell. I also restrict the sample to include only women with siblings to ease interpretation: women with brothers are compared to women with only sisters. Women with no siblings are quite rare during my observation period and their families could potentially differ in important ways. Table 1.1 reports summary statistics for this sample of women. The initial 1968 sample of the PSID consisted of two samples: a nationally representative Source: PSID. Note: Analysis sample includes all adult female respondents (heads, wives, or \"wives\") with siblings whose fathers were observed in at least four waves while the respondent was between ages 8 and 18. Dad self-employed is defined as the respondent's father being self-employed in at least two waves while the respondent was between ages 8 and 18. A respondent is defined as working if she held at least one job since the previous wave. She is defined as self-employed if she worked for herself in at least one job since the previous wave. sample of 2,930 families and an over-sample of 1,872 low-income families. Later, samples of Latinos and immigrants were added to the survey. Given the shorter time frame for which these additional samples are observed, almost none of them enter into the analysis. The questionnaire is structured so that the most detailed employment data are collected for the head, wife, and \"wife\". However, self-employment status is not collected for wives until 1976, and continuously starting in 1979; earlier self-employment data are captured for female heads only. Since respondents must be observed in adulthood, and their fathers observed in their childhood, the usable sample grows over time as girls transition from their childhood home into adulthood. Figure 1.1 shows the number of observations per survey year used in the analysis. My final sample consists of about 3,000 daughters, 1,900 fathers, and 33,000 observations."}, {"section_title": "Additional data", "text": "In addition to the PSID, I use three other survey data sets to study inputs to entrepreneurship.

When studying the relationship between sibling sex composition and paternal inputs, it is not necessary to observe daughter entrepreneurship outcomes. Therefore, the requirements of the data are not as great for this portion of the analysis."}, {"section_title": "National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979", "text": "The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) 4 is a panel survey that began with a sample of 12,686 14-to 22-year-olds in 1979. This sampling frame nests within the PSID sample in terms of birth year: Figure 1.2 depicts the number of observations used in the PSID analysis by year of birth, where the red bars highlight the birth years represented in the NLSY79 sample. The PSID includes both slightly older and much younger cohorts than the NLSY79, but the oldest cohorts take the most weight in the analysis since they are observed for the most years. Another difference between the NLSY79 and PSID respondents is that roughly 4 percent of NLSY79 respondents immigrated to the United States since 1968. Since the PSID did not add its immigrant sample until 1997, post-1968 immigrants make up less than one percent of my PSID analysis sample. 5 NLSY79 respondents were interviewed annually until 1994, and bi-annually thereafter; the most recent data available are for 2014. Data are collected on work, education, household composition, health, attitudes, and more. Only very limited information are available on the respondents' parents, and in particular the data lack parental self-employment status. However, a retrospective business ownership module was administered starting in 2010. In additional to collecting detailed information about businesses owned by respondents since age 18, this module asks respondents whether any family members had ever owned a business, and if so whether the respondent ever worked for those family members. In addition, it is possible to relate this experience in a family business to respondents' own entrepreneurship outcomes. American Time Use Survey The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) measures time spent in various activities by prompting respondents to give a complete accounting of their activitiesincluding paid work, housework, leisure, etc. -in the previous day. 6 Households are sampled monthly as they exit the Census' Current Population Survey (which is itself an eight-month panel survey of civilian, non-institutionalized households). Since 2003, the ATUS has selected one eligible person from each of about 26,000 households per year to be interviewed. In addition to collecting this respondent's activities, the survey asks with whom s/he engaged in each activity. Time spent in paid work was excluded from the \"with whom\" questions until 2010. However, beginning in 2010 it is possible to observe which, if any, of the respondent's children accompanied him or her to work. I consider this to be a measure of occupational training provided by the parent. Finally, the data also include the respondent's self-employment status and whether s/he owns a business. My analysis sample consists of about 3,200 fathers who worked in the reference day and have at least one daughter and at least two children (aged zero to seventeen), spanning the years 2010-2016.

The entrepreneurs are surveyed about business milestones, sources and amounts of funding, and, importantly for my purposes, whether or not their parents had ever owned a business. Data are also collected on the other individuals involved in the business: co-owners, key non-owners (individuals who \"made a distinctive contribution to the founding of the new business\"), and helpers (individuals who \"have provided significant support, advice, or guidance on a regular basis to this (new) business\"). These data include the contributions of these individuals, as well as their relationship to the respondent and some basic demographics. Since the exact relationship is not available, I assume that any male relative between 20 and 40 years older than the respondent is the respondent's father."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "I use a linear probability model to estimate the relationship between father and daughter entrepreneurship, allowing this relationship to vary depending on whether or not there are sons in the household. Specifically, I estimate a regression equation of the form where Entrprnr it is an indicator for respondent i being self-employed in wave t, Dad Entrprnr i indicates that the respondent's father was self-employed while she was a child (as defined above), Bro i is an indicator for having at least one brother, and X it is a vector of controls: year of birth, number of siblings, race, and a quadratic in age. The coefficient b 1 estimates the effect of having an entrepreneurial father for girls with only sisters; b 1 + b 3 gives the net effect of having an entrepreneurial father for girls with brothers. On its own, b 3 estimates the \"crowdout effect\": the reduction in the transmission of entrepreneurship that occurs when girls have at least one brother. One issue with the specification above is that it is possible that the presence of a brother is endogenous: some families may have a preference for sons and will continue having children until they get one. In this case, the fathers of girls with and without brothers are not strictly comparable. If fathers with a son preference would treat daughters differently even in the absence of sons, the effect of father's attitude will be confounded with the effect of brothers in specification (1.1) (Bren\u00f8e, 2017). To address this issue, I use a second specification that restricts the sample to first-born daughters and estimates the effect of the sex of the next-oldest sibling. Since the sex of the second child is random, it is uncorrelated with fathers' pre-existing gender attitudes. Differences between first-born girls with a next-younger brother versus sister can be attributed to the sex of the sibling, not parental attitudes. This alternative specification introduces its own issues. First, the results are estimated for first-born girls; transmission of entrepreneurship could potentially depend on birth order, and thus these results would not be generalizable to second-born or later daughters. Second, the sex of the second sibling could induce a change in family size: families whose first two children are of the same sex are six to seven percentage points more likely to have a third child than families who have both a boy and a girl among their first two children (Angrist and Evans, 1998). The coefficient on \"second child is male\" \u21e5 \"dad entrepreneur\" therefore captures the direct effect of sibling sex as well as the effect of family size on entrepreneurship transmission. I address these issues by directly examining the relationship between birth order or family size and the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship in Section 1.7.\nI propose two new measures that proxy for majors' occupational skill intensity using the similarity or dissimilarity of graduates' occupations. That is, I assume that majors whose graduates are clustered in a few distinctive occupations, or whose occupations are more similar than average, are those whose curricula emphasize occupation-specific skills. I will discuss strengths and weaknesses of this approach below. I then study how these measures relate to the employment and earnings of college graduates in the first ten years of their careers. 2 The first metric I present measures the extent to which graduates with a particular major are found in occupations employing many other college graduates with that major. The measure is borrowed from the segregation literature: the isolation index, which measures the extent to which members of a group come into contact with members of other groups (Massey and Denton, 1988). The isolation index is defined as where m i and j i are dummy variables taking on a value of 1 when individual i has a degree in major m or works in occupation j, respectively. Since I m depends on the share of the workforce with a degree in major m (denoted P m below), I employ a common normalization of the form 3) The normalized isolation index, hereafter simply referred to as the isolation index, takes on values between 0 (graduates with major m are equally represented in all occupations) and 1 (graduates with major m all work in occupations employing only graduates with that major). This measure is related to, but more complete than, Altonji et al. (2012)'s measurement of the share of majors employed in the top three occupations for that major. In particular, the isolation index controls for the size of each occupation, so that common occupations for a particular major are downweighted when the occupation employs a large number of individuals outside that major. The dissimilarity index used by Ransom and Phipps (2016) also shares this feature. The major isolation metric should capture the level of occupation-specific skills conferred by a major for two reasons. First, high-scoring majors are those in which the major is, in a sense, a prerequisite for many of the occupations its graduates are found in; when a particular occupation predominantly employs a particular major, this suggests that relatively intensive occupational training occurred in college. Second, graduates are likely to congregate in a limited set of occupations when they have a comparative advantage in those positions, meaning their occupational skills are relatively strong compared to their general skills. This approach has two main limitations. First, it may be the case that the measure is picking up differences in the probability of working in a related field even in the absence of differences in occupational skills content among majors. In other words, low scoring majors may confer occupational skills but seldom lead to employment in a related field. For example, a major in Art History may be intensive in skills related to occupations like Curator, but the isolation measure would return a low value if few Art History majors work in these related jobs. However, my wage regressions using an interaction specification allow me to isolate the effect of specificity conditional on working in a related field, thus separating the relatedness effect from the specificity effect. If differences in the major isolation index only reflect differences in the probability of working in a related field, there would be no empirical relationship between isolation and earnings conditional on major-job relatedness. A second critique of the isolation measure is that it is sensitive to the way majors and occupations are defined in the data. A major encompassing multiple concentrations with distinct occupational skills content could receive a lower isolation score than the average of its constituent concentrations if their scores were calculated individually. If curricula corresponding to more remunerative careers are more likely to be defined as distinct majors, these majors would also score higher on my isolation measure, leading to upward bias in my estimate of the effect of major specificity on earnings. 3 On the other hand, if there are multiple majors designed to help graduates pursue a particularly lucrative career, these majors will score lower on the isolation index since graduates from multiple majors will be found in the same occupation; this bias runs in the opposite direction. 4 Meanwhile, the occupation classification system also matters for my results: majors whose typical skills used on the job coincide with a single occupation title will score higher on the isolation index but are perhaps not meaningfully different than majors whose graduates use the same set of skills in different occupational titles. To check that the classification issues described above are  This measure is related to the isolation metric because majors whose graduates are clustered in a small number of occupations will also score a low average occupational distance, since the distance between two workers in the same occupation is zero. In addition, those majors whose graduates work in a variety of occupations with similar requirements and tasks, and hence are likely to have developed relevant skills in college, will also have a low average occupational distance. Unlike the isolation measure above, the occupational distance measure is not affected by the share of workers in an occupation that came from the same versus different majors. In other words, if many graduates of a particular major work in a set of similar occupations, the occupational distance measure will be small regardless of how many other majors work in those occupations. With these proxies for occupational skill intensity in hand, I can study how the occupational skill content of a major relates to employment and earnings outcomes of graduates. Given that these indices are at best a monotonic transformation of a true measure of specificity, the relationship between the indices and log earnings is not necessarily linear. As a parsimonious yet flexible alternative, I estimate the effect of specificity on earnings separately for each tercile of specificity (noting that spec m > 0 even in the lowest tercile). Additionally, respondents in the Baccalaureate and Beyond report their major-occupation relatedness in three levels: not at all related, somewhat related, or closely related. I also allow the effect of relatedness to be nonlinear across levels. Accordingly, the empirical model in Equation 2.1 is modified to ln (2.5) In practice, I estimate the effects of specificity relative to the middle tercile to determine whether there is a significant difference in earnings associated with moving from the bottom to the middle tercile and from the middle to the top tercile. The relationship between major specificity and earnings can be interpreted as causal only if selection into majors along the dimension of occupational specificity is uncorrelated with ability or other earnings-relevant characteristics, conditional on observables. This assumption is unlikely to be met, so I examine the effect of adding incremental controls to my regression to get a sense of the magnitude and direction of selection at work. I include fixed effects for five broad fields: Math, Physical Science, and Engineering; Biological Sciences and Health; Social Science; Art and Design; and Humanities. Thus, my empirical strategy identifies the effect of major specificity within broad fields. If there is ability-based sorting into broad fields that is correlated with average specificity in the field, these fixed effects will reduce omitted variable bias in the estimates of the return to specificity. 6 I also include controls for the average Math and Verbal SAT scores of students within a major. The purpose of this is to control for how challenging a major is; more challenging majors could offer higher returns because more advanced skills are acquired or because the graduates completing these majors are of higher ability. Given that a student's own SAT scores are an incomplete measure of ability, including the major average SAT score provides an additional ability control: conditional on own SAT score, students who choose a major with a higher average SAT score may be more ambitious or hard-working. Besides ability sorting, another threat to the causal interpretation is that major skill content may endogenously respond to labor market rewards. If the returns to specific skills are very high in a particular occupation, it makes sense to emphasize these skills in majors related to that occupation. The estimated relationship between specificity and earnings is therefore not causal: adjusting the curriculum of another major to make it more specific would not necessarily yield the same return. Identifying the causal effect of specificity would require the identifying variation in specificity to be uncorrelated with potential earnings. Therefore, while I do my best to control for major characteristics that are correlated with specificity and earnings, such as broad field and average SAT scores, my results are ultimately descriptive and cannot serve as evidence of the causal effect of exogenously varying major specificity. Study, which is itself drawn from a stratified sample of higher education institutions. Due to the sampling design, most sampled institutions have multiple respondents, enabling the comparison of students within institutions. The study began with 10,440 individuals in their senior year, and follow-up interviews were conducted one, four, and ten years after graduation (Wine et al., 2005). 8,090 students participated in all four interviews. Each interview collects information on work, graduate study, family, and finances. In addition to the interviews, data was gathered from government financial aid databases and student transcripts."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The results of the main specification, equation (1.1), can be found in Table 1.2. The coefficient on \"Dad self-employed\" shows the effect of having a self-employed father on the probability of being self-employed in a given year for women with sisters only. The magnitude of the effect in column (1), 9.4 percentage points, is very large relative to the baseline rate of self-employment among women with no brothers and no self-employed father: 7.0 percent. The main effect of \"Brother\" is not significant, meaning that brothers do not affect their sisters' self-employment probabilities in the absence of a self-employed father. Finally, the coefficient on the crowd-out term, \"Dad self-employed \u21e5 Brother\" is a statistically significant 7.6 percentage points. Summing this with the main effect of \"Dad self-employed,\" the net effect of a self-employed father is only 1.8 percentage points for women with brothers. The point estimates are quite similar and also statistically significant in the alternative specification studying first-born daughters and their next-oldest sibling. This suggests that the estimates in the first column are not strongly biased by a risky, potentially high-growth endeavor, as the benefits of incorporation are greater to these individuals (Levine and Rubinstein, 2017). The patterns in Table 1.3 are quite consistent with Table   1.2: having a brother crowds out around three-quarters of the transmission of entrepreneurship from fathers to daughters. However, most of the coefficients on the interaction term are not significant. Appendix Table A.3 replicates these regressions using first-born daughters and the sex of their next youngest sibling. Again, the coefficients are of similar magnitude but not significant.   To understand better the nature of the effects I estimate, I employ a multinomial probit specification to study the effect of father self-employment and brothers on the probability of belonging to each of three categories: never employed during the wave; employed and never self-employed during the wave; and having at least one spell of self-employment during the wave. This third category is the main measure of self-employment used in the analysis above, while here non-self-employment is divided into employment and non-employment. The purpose of making this distinction is to study whether self-employment is transmitted by drawing women from employment to self-employment, from non-employment to self-employment, or both. Table 1.4 presents the marginal effects of father self-employment on each of these three outcomes, estimated separately for women with and without brothers. Within each row, the coefficients sum to zero because these three outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. For women with brothers, having a self-employed father increases the probability of being self-employed in a given survey wave by 1.7 percentage points. The small negative effects on the probability of belonging to the other two categories are statistically indistinguishable from zero or each other. Meanwhile, for women with only sisters, having a self-employed father increases the probability of being self-employed by 6.5 percentage point, and these women are all drawn out of employment. In other words, for daughters with only sisters, the effect of father self-employment seems to be on the type of work they choose -self-employment versus regular employment -not the choice of whether to work at all. \nAfter merging these specificity measures onto the Baccalaureate and Beyond data, I first examine the average return to major specificity without controlling for major-job relatedness in Tables 2.3 through 2.8. The B&B study collects information on respondents' earnings in their jobs as of April 1994 and April 1997, and their current or most recent job in the 2003 wave (one, four, and ten years after graduation, respectively). I estimate hourly wages based on usual weekly hours when hourly wages are not reported by the respondent. As mentioned above, these specifications use terciles of major isolation to allow for nonlinearities in the relationship between specificity and earnings. All specifications include basic demographic controls: gender, race, 8 and age 9 . Additionally, all specifications include institution fixed effects, so the identifying variation is within-college. An alternative specification using controls for institution selectivity produced extremely similar results. This indicates that the relationship between major isolation and earnings does not have much to do with differences in major offerings or choices across institutions. In each table, specification 2 adds field fixed effects and controls for average SAT scores within the major across the entire B&B sample. These scores are expressed in units of standard deviations of the average score across majors. The final specification adds controls for the student's own SAT scores. Tables 2.3 through 2.5 use the isolation index as the measure of specificity and study earnings one, four, and ten years after graduation. In each year, earnings for graduates in the lowest tercile of isolation are significantly lower than those in the middle tercile, but there seems to be no gain from increasing specificity further to the top tercile. The point estimates shrink substantially after including field of study fixed effects and controls for average SAT score in the major, but adding controls for students own SAT scores has very little effect. 10 It is unclear whether the inclusion Does an increased probability of working in a related occupation explain the small premium for major specificity? By construction, graduates with more isolated majors work in a concentrated set of occupations, but to validate that these occupations are related to their field of study I make use of respondents' self-reports about the relatedness of their job to their field of study. Indeed, graduates with more isolated majors are more likely to report working in a job that is somewhat related or closely related to their field of study. Table 2.9 presents the results of an ordered logit Note: Exponentiated coefficients (log odds) from an ordered logit specification. Dependent variable is the self-reported relationship of a respondent's job to their field of study (\"Not at all related,\" \"Somewhat related,\" or \"Closely related\"). In 1994, the question pertains to the undergraduate field of study, whereas in 1997, respondents are asked about the relatedness of their job to their undergraduate or graduate field of study. Specification 2 includes only those respondents without a graduate degree. All specifications include controls for gender, race, and age. Omitted field of study category is Humanities. Standard errors are clustered at the institution level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 regression of the degree of job and major relatedness on major isolation and controls. A one standard deviation increase in major isolation is associated with a 76 percent increase in the odds of being in a somewhat or closely related job relative to an unrelated job one year after graduation, all else equal. By way of comparison, switching from Humanities to Math, Physical Science, and Engineering is associated with a 153 percent increase in the odds of working in a related job, while the effects of Biological Sciences and Health and Social Science are somewhat smaller. In 1997, Note: Exponentiated coefficients (log odds) from an ordered logit specification. Dependent variable is the self-reported relationship of a respondent's job to their field of study (\"Not at all related,\" \"Somewhat related,\" or \"Closely related\"). In 1994, the question pertains to the undergraduate field of study, whereas in 1997, respondents are asked about the relatedness of their job to their undergraduate or graduate field of study. Specification 2 includes only those respondents without a graduate degree. All specifications include controls for gender, race, and age. Omitted field of study category is Humanities. Standard errors are clustered at the institution level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 four years after graduation, respondents were asked how closely related their job was to their undergraduate or graduate field of study, complicating the interpretation. When restricting the sample to only those individuals without a graduate degree, the effect of major isolation on job relatedness is virtually identical in 1997 (column 2). The estimated effects are very similar when all individuals are included, with controls for graduate degrees (column 3). Table 2.10 repeats the analysis using occupational closeness as the measure of specificity. Across the three specifications, a one standard deviation increase in occupational closeness is associated with a 79 to 90 percent increase in the odds of working in a related field one or four years after graduation. In Tables 2.11 and 2.12, I test my key prediction: that graduates with more specific majors should experience higher returns to major-job match quality, and a larger penalty for working in an unrelated occupation. The relative effects of major specificity while working in an unrelated occupation can be found in the first two rows of Tables 2.11 and 2.12. One year after graduation, graduates with majors in the top tercile of isolation experience a 12 percent earnings penalty in unrelated occupations relative to graduates with majors of medium specificity. As predicted, they also experience an additional earnings boost for working in closely related occupations: the coefficient on the interaction of Tercile 3 and Closely related is positive and significant, while the coefficient on the interaction of Tercile 3 and Somewhat related is positive but not significant. There are no significant differences between the earnings of the lowest and middle terciles in related or unrelated occupations one year after graduation.    Table 2.11, Column 1: it depicts the net effects of each cell of isolation and relatedness relative to Tercile 2 \u21e5 Not at all related. Comparing two workers both in closely related occupations, the effect of being in the top tercile of isolation is neutral, as the main effect and interaction effects of Tercile 3 sum to zero. In other words, the earnings of graduates with highly specific majors are more sensitive to major-occupation match quality, but specificity does not generate an earnings advantage conditional on working in a related occupation. Thinking back to Equation 2.1: Note: All specifications include controls for gender, race, age, field of study, major average SAT scores, and individual SAT scores as well as institution fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the institution level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 this result implies b 1 \u21e1 b 2 , since when relatedness close to one, a change in specificity does not affect earnings. At any lower value of relatedness, specificity decreases earnings. Being in the top tercile of specificity seems to have two opposing effects: it increases the probability of working in a related occupation (Table 2.9), but increases the penalties to working in an unrelated occupation (Table 2.11). These two offsetting effects are consistent with the lack of significant difference between average earnings in the second and third tercile of isolation (Table 2.3). Meanwhile, the negative earnings effect of being in the lowest tercile (Table 2.3) can be explained by a reduced probability of working in a related occupation without a large enough return to general skills. Turning to the second column of Table 2.11, in which the outcome is earnings four years after graduation, I find that graduates of the least specific majors experience an earnings penalty in all occupations, even unrelated occupations. This runs counter to my prediction that their emphasis on general skills should benefit them in unrelated occupations, and raises the possibility that even relatively general majors provide few skills that are transferable to an unrelated occupation. The differences between the middle and top tercile are of the same sign and slightly smaller magnitude than in 1994, but are not significant. This pattern is consistent with on-the-job training substituting for specific education and reducing the importance of major-occupation match quality. Table 2.12 repeats this analysis using occupational closeness as the measure of major specificity. The results for 1994 are quite similar to those using major isolation, except that the differences among terciles of specificity are not significant in unrelated occupations (there is no longer a significant penalty to specificity in unrelated occupations). Additionally, the return to specificity in closely related occupations is positive overall: the (insignificant) main effect and interaction terms for Tercile 3 \u21e5 Closely Related sum to 9.5 percent. This can be seen in Figure 2.4: the Tercile 3 \u21e5 Closely related bar is largest of all. Again referring to Equation 2.1, this result implies b 2 > b 1 : when relatedness is high, increasing specificity has a postive effect on earnings. Given that a major's occupational closeness is positively associated with the probability of working in a related field (Table 2.10), this is consistent with the finding of an average earnings premium for being in the top tercile of closeness (Table 2.6). As in Table 2.11, the return to working in a somewhat related job does not differ across terciles of specificity. Finally, in 1997, four years after graduation, the main effects of working in a related job have faded (i.e., for moderate levels of specificity) but the premium to working in a closely related occupation with a major in the top Figure 2.4: Returns to major occupational closeness and major-job relatedness, 1994 tercile of specificity persists. To summarize, both measures of specificity yield results consistent with my prediction that earnings of graduates with more specific majors are more sensitive to major-occupation relatedness (b 2 > 0). However, the two measures provide conflicting answers as to the relative magnitude of b 1 and b 2 . Taken together, this evidence suggests that specificity appears to weakly increase earnings while working in related occupation, and weakly increase average earnings among graduates, at least one to four years after graduation. It is worth noting that even in the most general majors, the returns to working in a related occupation are large: up to ten percent relative to unrelated occupations. There are at least two interpretations for this fact. First, it could be the case that even relatively general majors contain a fair amount of occupational skills content. Alternatively, the pattern could reflect correlation of abilities for majors and occupations: Public Health majors do well in public health occupations because of an innate ability that led them to choose this path, not because they learned relevant skills in college. Still, unless abilities are more strongly correlated in more specific majors, the differential return to relatedness in specific majors likely reflects human capital utilization. In 2003, ten years after graduation, respondents are not asked whether their job is related to their major. However, they are asked, \"Would you say you've had more than one career in the last ten years?\" The effect of career switching on earnings could be positive or negative: it could reflect discovery of an improved job match, but switching careers means some occupational human capital will become redundant (Poletaev and Robinson, 2008). If graduates tend to begin their careers in related occupations and then branch out, major specificity is likely to increase the penalty to switching careers since more human capital becomes redundant. Accordingly, I predict that graduates with more specific majors are less likely to experience a career change. In  Table 2.13, I regress an indicator for \"more than one career\" on measures of major specificity and controls. A one standard deviation increase in major isolation is associated with a 3.5 percent lower probability of experiencing a career change, a small effect relative to the mean of 50.2 percent (column 1). The effect of occupational closeness on career changes is not significant (column 2). In Table 2.14, I study the relationship between career changes, major specificity, and earnings. The main effect of a career change (in a moderately specific major) is negative but only significant Note: \"More than one career\" is an indicator for an affirmative response to the question \"Would you say you've had more than one career in the last ten years?\" in 2003. All specifications include controls for gender, race, age, field of study, major average SAT scores, and individual SAT scores as well as institution fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the institution level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 in the second specification, using occupational closeness. This effect does not differ significantly for graduates with either more or less specific majors. Therefore, major specificity may have a modest positive effect on earnings by reducing the probability of experiencing a costly career change in the first ten years after graduation. On the other hand, if career changers are initially penalized but subsequently experience higher wage growth because of match quality, graduates in more specific majors may be missing out on opportunities for later-career wage growth. I return to the ACS to study the relationship between major specificity and earnings trajectories. \nIn Table 3.2, I present the results from my difference-in-difference competing risks hazard model for quits. The coefficients for dates provide the effect of being in that year on quit hazards, relative to the omitted year, 2Q89-1Q90. \"Sub new MW\" is an indicator for a spell pertaining to a person who earned less than $4.25 in 1989. In column 1, I combine both types of quits so that there are only two failure types in the model: quits, the event of interest; and layoffs, the competing event. I first note that lower earners have higher overall quit hazards: their quit hazards are 1.4 times those of above-minimum-wage earners at any given point in time (coefficient \"Sub new MW\"). The interaction term \"2Q88-1Q89 \u21e5 Sub new MW\" tests for differential changes in hazards for the above-and below-minimum-wage groups between t 1 and t 0 , where t 0 is the period just before the April 1990 minimum wage increase. The coefficient is not significant, indicating that there are not differential pre-trends for the two groups. I now turn to the coefficients of interest: \"2Q90-1Q91 \u21e5 Sub new MW\" and \"2Q91-1Q92 \u21e5 Sub new MW\". These coefficients test for an impact of the 1990 and 1991 minimum wage increases on quit hazards for low earners relative to high earners. Indeed, the first minimum wage increase is associated with a 16.1 percent reduction 2 in quit hazards for the treated group. The 1991 minimum wage increase does not appear to have an effect on this group, perhaps because their earnings growth trajectory lifted them above the minimum wage level by this point. What was the source of this reduction in quit hazards? In columns 2 and 3, I break out quits into job-to-job and job-to-unemployment quits, where the competing events are layoffs and the other type of quit. I find that the post-increase \u21e5 Sub new MW interaction term is only significant for job-to-job quits. This suggests that the classic job-ladder channel is driving the overall reduction in quit hazards: a minimum wage increase reduces the arrival rate of superior job offers, by compressing the wage distribution, lowering the overall hiring flow, or both. Although job-to-unemployment quits are common, a higher minimum wage does not affect this hazard for low-wage workers. This may be because the reservation wages driving job-to-unemployment quits are so high that the increased minimum wage is still largely below this level. For instance, if individuals are drawn out of employment to attend school or care for children, a slightly higher minimum wage does not change this decision. It is interesting to note that females' job-to-job quit hazards are lower than males', while their job-to-unemployment quit hazards are much higher. This is consistent with the idea that women's labor supply decisions are more constrained by family demands; they may quit to care for a child or to follow their husbands who have founds jobs in new locations (Cooke, 2003). To benchmark my results relative to Brochu and Green (2013), Dube et al. (2016), and Portugal Note: Hazard ratios, or exponentiated coefficients, are reported. All specifications include quarter-of-year and region fixed effects. Reference year is 2Q89-1Q90, the twelve months preceding the first federal minimum wage increase studied. \"Sub new MW\" denotes individuals who earned less than $4.25 in 1989. Robust standard errors in parentheses. + p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Note: Hazard ratios, or exponentiated coefficients, are reported.

Robust standard errors in parentheses. + p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. and Cardoso (2006), I report the effects of the minimum wage increases on overall separation and layoff hazards in Table 3.3. Consistent with these authors, I find that both minimum wage increases reduced overall separation hazards by around 14-18 percent relative to the pre-increase level (column 1). Meanwhile, the 1990 and 1991 federal minimum wage increases appear to have had no effect on layoff hazards (column 2). My findings on layoffs contrast with Brochu and Green (2013), who found that the reduction in separation hazards associated with a higher minimum wage was largely driven by declining layoffs. There are several differences in our empirical strategies and settings; in particular, Brochu and Green (2013) use only employment spells that fell entirely on either side of a minimum wage increase, while the spells I study may straddle the policy changes, beginning before and ending after a minimum wage increase. This difference in empirical design may affect the results for two reasons. First, theory predicts that a higher minimum wage can lower layoffs by attracting higher-ability workers (Yellen, 1984); this channel is not active for spells straddling a minimum wage change. Second, Brochu and Green (2013) develop a model in which workers may be laid off after a probationary period, and this motive is reduced in the face of a higher minimum wage because of the reduced value of a vacancy. This applies mainly to workers hired after the minimum wage increase, or perhaps just shortly before, not workers who have already passed beyond the probationary period. Thus, workers with ongoing employment spells before and after the minimum wage increase are not predicted to see a change in layoff hazards in this model. On the other hand, a higher minimum wage could reduce layoffs for continuing workers by reducing shirking, and it would be possible to observe this effect in my analysis. Unlike Brochu and Green (2013), I could also observe some previously-profitable matches being terminated by the employer following the policy change. These considerations, as well as the fact that Brochu and Green (2013) use a different setting (Canada) and identification strategy (province and time dummies as controls, instead of higherearning contemporaries), may explain why this chapter does not find a similar effect on layoffs. Appropriate controls and identification strategies for studying the minimum wage are a matter of some debate (Allegretto et al., 2013;Neumark et al., 2014;Allegretto et al., 2017). In results not reported here, I used an event-study approach with region and year dummies, or region-specific linear trends. I found that these specifications did not adequately control for trends: in placebo tests, I found that minimum wage increases were associated with large separation hazard effects for individuals earning more than twice the minimum wage. Given that spillovers this high up the wage distribution are unlikely, this finding suggests that such a specification is misattributing pre-existing local trends to minimum wage changes. These findings motivated the difference-indifference approach I used here, which directly controls for time variation in separation hazards affecting all individuals by including high earners as controls."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms", "text": "I now turn to the mechanisms that could be driving both the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship and its crowd-out by brothers. I consider four possible mechanisms: business inheritance, financial transfers, human capital investments, and occupational transmission. Business inheritance I begin by ruling out one seemingly plausible explanation: that the inheritance of self-employment reflects transfers of business ownership from parents to children. Businesses may be passed on either by the parent transferring the business to the child all at once, or by making the child a co-owner, and I examine both of these possibilities. To check for potential business transfers, I switch from a static concept of business ownership in a given year to instead studying entry and exit of business ownership. Unfortunately, it is not possible to observe the date of business creation or dissolution. Instead, I define \"starting a business\" as owning a business (stake) in year t but not in year t 2. 9 Similarly, ending a business is defined as owning a business (stake) in year t 2 but not in year t. Based on this measure, 3.4 percent of adult PSID respondents start a business in a given year. This is somewhat higher than the Kauffman Foundation 2017estimate of new entrepreneurship rates of around 2 percent per year. This may be because of false transitions out of and into business ownership in my data, or because respondents are credited with starting a business when they merely acquired a stake in an existing business. Using these measures, I examine whether starting a business often coincides with the timing of a father ending his business. This coincidental timing could suggest that the respondent took over his or her father's business. In the first column of Table 1.5, I regress an indicator for starting a business on an indicator for father ending a business in that same year. The estimate 0.019 suggests that there is indeed a heightened probability of starting a business in the same year the father ends his business. However, closer inspection reveals that this result does not necessarily reflect business takeovers. When I add a control for whether or not the father owned a business two years ago, the effect loads on that variable. In other words, respondents whose fathers own(ed) a business are more likely to start their own business, but this is not any more likely to occur in the year the father ends his business. To quantify the potential role of business inheritence in intergenerational entrepreneurship transmission, I create a sample of \"second-generation business owners\": business-owning respondents whose fathers ever owned a business prior to or during the current survey wave. Even among those respondents who do start a business in the same year their father exits his business, only around one-quarter start a business in the same industry. Overall, only 3.6 percent of second-generation business owners start their business in the same year their father exited his business and in the same industry, and hence could have plausibly inherited a family business. It is possible that businesses change hands after a period of co-ownership, instead of the father handing over the entire business at once. However, only 4.1 percent of second-generation business owners ever report co-owning a business with any family member other than a spouse. In summary, the phenomenon of business inheritance appears to be quite rare, consistent with results by Fairlie and Robb (2007) and Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (2000): summing the rates of potential inheritance and co-ownership, at most 7.7 percent of second-generation business owners may have inherited a business or stake. Additionally, I find no effect of brothers on a woman's probability of inheriting a business, conditional on having a self-employed father. Brothers have a small negative Source: PSID.

Financial transfers I next test the effect of siblings on financial transfers from fathers to daughters. For this analysis I use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) due to its large sample size and clean records of \"financial help\" given to children. 10 I construct a sample of all available fatherdaughter pairs, including those with no siblings for this analysis. As my outcome I use three different measures: an indicator for the father making any transfer in a given year, the dollar amount of the transfer, and the amount of the transfers in logs, with zeros dropped. Table 1.6 shows that siblings do indeed matter, both for the probability of receiving a transfer and for the amount. However, the effects of brothers and sisters are identical: an additional sibling of either Source: HRS. Note: Dependent variables are, from left to right: an indicator for the HRS respondent providing financial help to the daughter in a given year; the amount, including zeros, of the transfer in 2000 dollars; and the log amount of the transfer, excluding zeros. Dad self-employed is an indicator for the HRS respondent being self-employed in at least one wave. Brothers and Sisters are the number of siblings the daughter has.

Standard errors clustered at the father level. sex reduces the probability of receiving a transfer in a given year by about 2 percentage points, relative to the mean annual transfer probability of 46.2 percent among daughters with no siblings. Interestingly, self-employed fathers make more frequent and larger transfers to their children than other fathers. However, the gender composition of children does not affect the amount of resources directed towards daughters. In fact, daughters are, if anything, slightly advantaged relative to sons in terms of the probability of receiving financial help from fathers (Appendix Table A.5). One caveat is that loans or investments by parents in their childrens' businesses may not be considered \"help\" by survey respondents, so the measure in the HRS may not capture this type of transfer. Loans or investments may not be subject to the equal treatment norms or altruism considerations that apply to other kinds of financial transfers; in other words, parents may find Source: PSED.

Par owned bus is an indicator for an affirmative response to the question, \"Did your parents ever work for themselves or run their own businesses, alone or together?\" Baseline mean is the dependent variable mean for male respondents whose parents did not own a business.

Robust standard errors in parentheses. it easier to rationalize funding their sons' business ventures while neglecting their daughters'. to affect these types of involvement. Among male entrepreneurs, those whose parents owned a business are 7.1 percentage points more likely to receive a loan or investment from family members: a roughly 50 percent increase relative to the baseline rate of 14.5 percent among male respondents without an entrepreneurial family background. Although the interaction coefficient Par owned bus \u21e5 Female is not significant, the point estimate suggests that female entrepreneurs receive no such benefit from parental business ownership experience: the coefficient is negative and nearly cancels out the main effect for male entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, the gender gap in non-financial help from fathers is even sharper. Parental entrepreneurship experience more than triples the probability of the respondent's father being involved for males (a 7.3 percentage point effect relative to the baseline rate of 3.0 percent), but no such effect is present for female entrepreneurs. In other words, while being a second-generation entrepreneur confers important benefits for men, women do not experience any increase in financial or non-financial help. While I cannot study the effect of brothers using these data, if sons and daughters in the same family are competing for parental resources, women may experience crowd-out by brothers. Human capital When it comes to human capital investments, I find more direct evidence of crowd-out by brothers. I consider children working in the family business to be a form of investment since fathers likely have to spend time training their children to make them effective helpers. To study these investments, I use two data sources. First, I study the effect of brothers on the probability that a female NLSY79 respondent reports having worked in the family business, conditional on her family owning a business. I test this question in two specifications in Table 1.8: the first estimates the effects of having at least one brother among all women with siblings. The second estimates the effect of having the second sibling be male among first-born women with younger siblings. In both specifications, I find that girls with a brother are around 7 percentage points less likely to work in the family business, relative to a rate of 32 percent among girls with only sisters. Could this gap in experience translate into the lower rates of self-employment transmission I observe among women with brothers? In Table 1.9, I estimate the relationship between family history of business ownership and experience in that business on entrepreneurship outcomes for women. Compared to women whose families owned a business but who did not have work experience in that business, women with such experience are 3.7 percentage points more likely to be self-employed in a given year -roughly a 50 percent increase. Experience in the family business is associated with large effects on other outcomes as well: incorporated self-employment, ever owning a business, and considering oneself to be an entrepreneur. These results cannot be considered causal because women who have an interest in entrepreneurship may be more likely to both work in the family business and, later, start their own business. However, the results do suggest that brothers are crowding out girls' participation in an important entrepreneurship human capital-building activity. As a second test of this mechanism, I use the American Time Use Survey to study whether sons make daughters less likely to spend time at work with their self-employed fathers. I use two measures of paternal entrepreneurship -self-employment and business ownership -and compare the effects of brothers on girls above and below age 13. In Table 1.10, I show that entrepreneurial fathers with only daughters are more likely to bring their teenage daughters to work, but not their younger daughters. This suggests that the time spent together at work is related to human capital formation, rather than childcare or supervision of younger children. Second, I find that there is a large but imprecisely estimated negative effect of brothers on teenage girls' probabilities Source: NLSY79.

Source: PSID. Note: Father's occupation (industry) is his modal broad occupation (industry) while the daughter was between ages 8 and 18. Fathers are defined as self-employed if they were self-employed in at least two survey waves while the daughter was between ages 8 and 18. Daughter occupation, industry, and self-employment status are defined annually: observations are at the daughter-year level. in the PSID, broken down by the self-employment status of the father and daughter. Father's self-employment status is defined as in the main PSID analysis above -while the daughter is aged 8 to 18 -and his occupation (industry) is defined as his modal broad occupation (industry) during those years. 12 The unit of analysis is a daughter-year: daughters may share an occupation or industry with their fathers in some years, but not others, and may move in and out of self-employment over time. Years in which the daughter was not working are dropped. Table 1.11 shows that the highest rate of occupation sharing exists for self-employed fatherdaughter pairs: 13.07 percent. Although this is about twice as high as the probability of sharing an occupation in the other cells, the majority of self-employed father-daughter pairs work in different occupations. The industry-sharing differential is even smaller: daughters are only one or two percentage points more likely to work in the same industry as their self-employed fathers if they are also self-employed, relative to the other cells. Tables 1.12 and 1.13 study more formally how entrepreneurship transmission relates to occupation and industry sharing. Specifically, I use a multinomial probit regression to estimate the effect of father self-employment on the probabilities of the four combinations of two binary outcomes for daughters: working in the same (or different) occupation as their fathers, and being self-employed (or working as an employee). Results in Section 1.5 demonstrated that self-employed fathers make daughters more likely to be self-employed, but are they also leading daughters to select the same occupation or industry? Table 1.12 shows that the effect having a self-employed father on the probability of being self-employed in a different occupation is roughly  double the effect on the probability of being self-employed in the same occupation -1.2 percent versus 0.7 percent for daughters with brothers, and 7.2 percent versus 3.2 percent for daughters with only sisters. However, these effects are not statistically distinguishable from each other. The effect for industry choice is similar but more pronounced (Table 1.13). For daughters with only sisters, having a self-employed father increases the probability of being self-employed but in a different industry than their fathers by 8.9 percentage points. This is significantly larger than the effect on the probability of being self-employed in the same industry, 1.4 percentage points. Among those with brothers, the pattern is the same but the effects are not significantly different. Taken together, this evidence suggests that self-employment is not merely transmitted via occupation or industry: most of the daughters induced into self-employment work in different occupations or industries than their fathers."}, {"section_title": "Robustness checks", "text": "In this section, I lay out some robustness checks to my analysis above. First, I look for differential rates of transmission and crowd-out by family size and birth order. Although my main analyses control for number of siblings, I did not allow the effect of father's self-employment status, or the presence of brothers, to vary with respect to the number of siblings a woman has or what her birth order was. In Table 1.14, I estimate my main specification separately for women with one, two, and three or more siblings. The main effect of dad self-employment is strongest for daughters with two sisters, but the point estimate is not significantly different than the effect for daughters with one sister or three or more sisters. In Table 1.15 I repeat these specifications separately for first, second, third, and fourth or higher born women. The effects of paternal self-employment are largest for first-and second-born daughters with only sisters, but again there are not significant differences across specifications. Only around seven percent of daughters with three or more siblings have only sisters, so it is not surprising that the \"sisters-only\" main effect of father self-employment is imprecisely estimated in the last columns of Tables 1.14 and 1.15. Overall, the results are consistent with the main results: father's self-employment has a substantial effect on girls with only sisters, but a much smaller effect for those with brothers.

This is because these occupations do not fit the traditional paradigm of entrepreneur, and because these occupations may be transmitted through channels unrelated to business human capital: specifically, through intergenerational transfers of farms, or through connections that help children enter the medical profession (Laband and Lentz, 1983b;Lentz and Laband, 1989 Source: PSID.

In this specification, effects of father self-employment are estimated within occupations, to rule out the possibility that the estimated effects of self-employment are spuriously picking up occupation effects. In all three specifications, the results are quite stable: father's self-employment increases the rate of self-employment by around 9 percentage points for women with only sisters, and about 1.5 to 2 percentage points for women with brothers."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "What are the welfare implications of this transmission and crowd-out of self-employment? The evidence on the returns to self-employment is mixed: Hamilton (2000) estimates an earnings loss associated with self-employment, while Levine and Rubinstein (2017) find a premium to incorporated self-employment, and a small wage loss when workers switch to unincorporated self-employment. Second-generation entrepreneurs -especially daughters who did not compete with brothers -may be more productive than average because of their inherited business human capital (Fairlie and Robb, 2007). Even if entrepreneurs earn less, earnings penalties may be offset by nonpecuniary benefits (Hurst et al., 2011) or by the option value of experimentation with entrepreneurship (Dillon and Stanton, 2017;Manso, 2016). If these benefits are large enough, daughters may be better off as entrepreneurs than as wage workers even if they earn less in a given year. With this caveat in mind, I proceed to study the relationship between father entrepreneurship, brothers, and daughters' income and wealth. This reduced-form analysis picks up the effect of family composition on earnings and wealth both via the choice of self-employment or employment and conditional on this choice. In Table 1.17, I estimate an insignificant positive effect of father self-employment on daughters' labor income, family income, and wealth when there are no sons in the family, and an insignificant negative effect of sons on this relationship. These results are noisy but suggest that daughters of entrepreneurs with only sisters are, if anything, better off financially than their counterparts with brothers. While the evidence on the net returns to self-employment (including non-pecuniary benefits) is inconclusive, one way to interpret my main results is that more daughters of entrepreneurs with only sisters opt into self-employment and hence must prefer it to regular employment. In other words, relative to those with brothers, these daughters have an additional feasible career choice -entrepreneurship -and must be weakly better off. They could be made worse off if the transmission of entrepreneurship human capital crowded out other human capital. However, I find no significant gap in educational attainment between daughters of self-employed men with and without brothers (Table 1.17, column (4)). This suggests that entrepreneurship-related human capital is not taking the place of formal human capital accumulation through schooling. Additionally, as demonstrated in Section 1.6, most second-generation entrepreneurs are opening their own businesses, not inheriting a family firm. That is, daughters with only sisters are not being pressured to continue running the family business, which could be worse than the outside option, as in Fernando (2016) (for land inheritance in India) or the film \"It's a Wonderful Life\". 13"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this chapter, I demonstrate that brothers crowd-out the transmission of self-employment from fathers to daughters. This crowd-out appears to be related to human capital investments by fathers: among those whose families owned a business, women with only sisters are 7.5 percentage points more likely than women with brothers to have gained experience working in that business. While this experience gap alone cannot explain the entire transmission gap, it suggests that self-employed fathers with sons allocate attention away from daughters in a way that reduces the probability of daughters becoming entrepreneurs. Female entrepreneurs also are significantly less likely than their male counterparts to receive non-financial help from their entrepreneurial fathers. Meanwhile, business inheritance and general financial help do not appear to explain the crowd-out of transmission by brothers, although there is evidence of a gender gap in parental investments in their children's businesses. This finding is significant to our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship more generally. Since the relationship between father and daughter selfemployment varies with the sex mix of siblings, this implies that the transmission of entrepreneurship is mediated by active investments that can be crowded out, not just passive mechanisms like heritable ability or role modeling. My results also imply that a portion of the gender gap in transmission, and in overall rates of self-employment, can be attributed to differences in paternal investments in sons versus daughters. My empirical strategy does not allow me to estimate the total gender gap in paternal investments, but the level of investment received by daughters with only sisters can perhaps be thought of as a lower bound for the level received by sons. These investments have a powerful effect on female entrepreneurship: among women with only sisters, those with a self-employed father are more than twice as likely to be self-employed. This large effect size could be explained by the fact that the tools acquired by these daughters are to his or her major. This suggests that there are real differences in the generalizability of college skill content across majors and points to the importance of studying the returns to not just the quantity but also the content of education.\nIn this chapter, I extend the literature on the relationship between the minimum wage and separation rates by proposing and testing a new theory for the sources of employee-initiated separations. In my theoretical framework, quits may be driven by the arrival of a superior offer, or by an increase in the reservation wage that makes work unattractive relative to leisure, home production, or study. Empirically, these sources would manifest themselves in job-to-job and job-to-unemployment quits, respectively; this difference allows me to disentangle the channels responsible for a change in quit hazards. Consistent with the prior literature, I find that a higher minimum wage reduces separation hazards for affected workers relative to their higherwage counterparts. Like Brochu and Green (2013), I find that quit hazards fall, and in a novel contribution, I show that this change is driven by a reduction in job-to-job quits specifically. When I focus on this margin, I find that the 1990 increase in the federal minimum wage, from $3.35 to $3.80, reduces job-to-job quit hazards for low-wage workers by 20 percent. A reduction in costly churn may offset some of the payroll expense of a minimum wage increase. Turnover can be expensive because of the direct costs of recruiting and training workers, as well lower productivity of new workers as they climb the learning curve (Hinken and Tracey, 2000). Reich et al. (2003) estimate that the reduction in turnover following the San Francisco Airport living wage ordinance saved $6.6 million per year (at $4,275 per replacement), against a direct payroll cost of $42.7 million. Although these costs can vary widely, high turnover is likely to have a significant impact in many settings; Hinken and Tracey (2000) estimate similar turnover costs in the various hotel positions they study. Knowing that a higher minimum wage reduces employee quit hazards is therefore an important contribution to the debate over the merits of minimum wage policy. Source: PSID.

Altonji et al. (2012)  unobservables is proportional to selection on observables. Arcidiacono (2004) estimates a dynamic model in which students can update their major choice after learning about their preferences and abilities; since sorting into majors is directly modeled, the contribution of field of study to earnings can be estimated. These studies and others conclude that business and STEM degrees offer the highest returns even after correcting for selection. An alternative strategy for estimating major-specific returns makes use of score-based admissions cutoffs to degree programs in a regression-discontinuity design, in which outcomes of students just above an admissions threshold are compared to those just below. In Chile, Hastings et al. (2013) find threshold-crossing effects that are largest for health and social sciences. In this design, returns are estimated for students who applied and were on the margin of acceptance or rejection, and may not be an accurate estimate of the returns other students would realize. However, Hastings et al. (2013) do not find evidence of selection into degrees along the dimensions of gender, socioeconomic status (SES), or comparative advantage in math. In addition, when the authors allow effects to vary by student SES, most of the same subject-specific effects are similar. A notable exception is business, which offers a large, significant return only to high-SES students in selective programs. Using a similar approach for Norway, Kirkeboen et al. (2016) find the largest returns to medicine and STEM fields. In contrast to Hastings et al. (2013), they do find evidence of sorting on comparative advantage: threshold-crossing effects are asymmetric, suggesting that returns depend on being accepted into one's preferred field. More work on the importance of sorting based on field-specific ability is needed to interpret estimates of returns to college majors. To the extent that majors do have an average causal impact on earnings, some studies have attempted to unpack the determinants of differences in returns. The human capital approach emphasizes the material learned in various majors and the associated labor market rewards to this content. Hamermesh and Donald (2008) find that measures of math and science course-taking and grades explain some of the return to \"hard\" business and science degrees. Altonji et al. (2014) explore the role of changing task prices in explaining trends in earnings differentials among majors. Differences in routine, manual, and abstract task intensity by major (driven by the occupational mix of each major's graduates) explain two thirds of the rise in earnings variance among majors between 1993 and 2011. This suggests that differences in the types of skills taught by major play an important role in determining post-graduation earnings. Another strand of literature has examined the role of human capital utilization in mediating the returns to college. Yakusheva (2010) tests for returns to match quality by developing a crosswalk between O*NET knowledge categories and fields of study and scoring major-occupation pairs based on the knowledge match. Using the 1980/1982 High School and Beyond survey, she finds a return to major-occupation \"relevance\" that is robust to ability controls and earnings differences across fields, suggesting that human capital utilization is an important source of heterogeneity in earnings. Yuen (2010) and Nordin et al. (2010)  the returns to working in a related occupation are assumed to be the same for all majors. While these studies suggest that the returns to college depend on skills being put to use on the job, they do not distinguish among majors' intensity of occupation-specific skills. Robst (2007) is the closest in spirit to this chapter, as he also looks for heterogeneity in the effects of match quality on earnings by the skill specificity of a major. He predicts that graduates of degree programs consisting of more general skills will experience a smaller wage penalty to mismatch than graduates with highly specific degrees, and are more likely to experience occupational mismatch due to this lower penalty. Using self-reports of degree-occupation match quality in the In this chapter, I build on the existing literature by exploring how the returns to major-job match quality vary along two novel indices of specificity. The broad goal is to understand whether differences in majors' occupational skill intensity explain part of the heterogeneity in earnings among college graduates, conditional on observables. My specificity indices both use the occupational mix of each major's graduates to proxy for the occupational skill intensity of the major. Using these indices eliminates the need to make judgment calls about the specificity of degree programs. However, they still suffer from the fact that they are based on employment outcomes of graduates rather than a measurement of curriculum characteristics. These limitations are discussed further below."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual framework", "text": "Suppose the skills learned in college can be divided into two categories: specific and general. Specific skills are only valuable in a limited set of occupations, whereas general skills are valued equally in all occupations. If students in all majors learn the same quantity of skills, each major m can be characterized by the share of its curriculum devoted to specific skills, spec m 2 [0, 1]. Majors that emphasize skills like reasoning and writing will have a lower value of spec m , while those that emphasize skills like financial modeling or investigative journalism will have a higher value. Post-graduation earnings of individual i are a function of specific and general skills, as well as the relatedness 2 [0, 1] of the graduate's job j to his or her major: Specific skills are only rewarded in related jobs; the more specific the major, the higher the return to relatedness. Earnings also depend on personal characteristics in X i such as ability, gender, and race. Unlike in Malamud (2011), specificity does not come at the cost of learning about ability, since most American bachelor's degree programs involve course-taking across fields prior to choosing the major. However, barriers to switching majors may differ by specificity, and some majors such as those in Engineering must be chosen at the time of application to the institution. I do not attempt to separately identify the effects of these features of majors. Controlling for covariates, do graduates of more specific majors earn more on average? This depends on the relative size of b 1 and b 2 , as well as the share of graduates of each major working in related occupations. If general skills are only loosely related to job requirements, the returns to general skills are likely to be smaller than the returns to specific skills in a related job (i.e. b 1 < b 2 ). The probability of working in a related occupation is likely to be increasing in the specificity of the major for two reasons. First, graduates with more specific majors face a larger penalty to working in an unrelated occupation and thus have a greater incentive to choose a related occupation, all else equal. Second, to the extent that major curricula are responsive to market factors, having a greater share of graduates working in related occupations increases the value of a more specific curriculum and may lead the course offerings to be designed accordingly in equilibrium. I therefore predict that there is a specificity premium on average, although, among graduates working in unrelated occupations, those with more specific majors should earn less. This effect should fade over time if on-the-job training can substitute for education: graduates with a shortage of occupation-specific training should invest more in this training and experience steeper wage growth (Nordin et al., 2010). Below, I estimate the relationship between specificity and earnings and then examine how this relationship is mediated by differential returns to major-job match quality. I also observe how the relationship evolves over the first ten years after graduation. An integrated model of major choice and earnings is outside the scope of this chapter. Many existing models use (potentially heterogeneous) expected earnings, probability of success, and consumption value of majors to explain major choice (Montmarquette et al., 2002;Arcidiacono, 2004;Arcidiacono et al., 2012;Beffy et al., 2012;Wiswall and Zafar, 2015;Long et al., 2015;Altonji et al., 2015). One additional dimension of major choice suggested by my framework, but not yet explored, is selection into majors based on certainty over occupational preferences. Students who are relatively uncertain about their occupational preferences will tend to choose majors with moderate earnings potential in multiple occupations, rather than one that would prepare them for a particular career. A risk premium for majors with more heterogeneous earnings outcomes across occupations would also be consistent with my empirical model above."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this chapter, I explored a potential explanation for differences in returns to college majors: the intensity of occupational training associated with each major. This explanation builds on existing work showing that major-occupation match quality is an important mediator of returns to higher education. With this context in mind, I propose a wage equation in which earnings depend on general and specific skills, and a greater relative endowment of specific skills makes earnings more responsive to major-job relatedness. Since I do not observe major curricula directly, I design two indices to measure majors' occupational specificity: the isolation index, which describes the way graduates are clustered or spread across occupations; and the occupational closeness index, which summarizes the similarity of a major's graduates' occupations. I estimate the empirical model by combining these measures with rich data on the college class of 1993 from the Baccalaureate and Beyond study. The two indices both suggest that specificity is associated with higher earnings, but the differences between terciles of specificity are at most five percent. Both indices agree that graduates with more specific majors are more likely to work in related occupations, and that specificity makes earnings more responsive to major-occupation relatedness. Finally, graduates with more specific majors are slightly less likely to make career changes in the first ten years after graduation and also experience modestly slower wage growth over the first fifteen years of their careers. Identification is challenged on two levels. First, would switching a randomly-chosen student to a more specific major within his field increase his earnings? The answer is yes only if I have adequately controlled for dimensions of earnings potential correlated with major specificity. This cannot be demonstrated directly, but controlling for field fixed effects, major average SAT score, and a student's own SAT score suggest that there are modestly higher returns to specific majors. Second, would increasing a given major's specificity level increase earnings of its graduates? The occupational skills emphasis of a major is likely to be endogenous to the labor market returns to those skills, so the presence of a positive association between specificity and earnings does not prove that specificity increases earnings. Therefore, the contribution of this chapter lies in the fact that I have documented a previously-unexplored relationship between college majors and earnings that could be explored further by researchers interested in the mechanism for heterogeneous returns by major. increase in the minimum wage, and a mandated minimum wage introduces new complexities; for instance, Brochu and Green (2013) develop a employer-employee match model in which a higher minimum wage can reduce layoffs by lowering the option value of a vacancy. On the other hand, a higher minimum wage could increase layoffs by rendering some matches unprofitable. A relatively new body of literature has estimated a negative effect of minimum wage increases on employee separations, suggesting that on net the former effects dominate (see Wolfers and Zilinsky (2015) for a review). One limitation of this literature is that the majority of these papers have examined only combined separation types, not distinguishing separations by their cause. This makes it difficult to determine which of the mechanisms above are responsible for the documented negative relationship between the minimum wage and separations. This chapter fills this gap by examining the effect of minimum wage increases on three distinct separation types: layoffs, job-to-job quits, and job-to-unemployment quits. This third case in particular has been understudied; the canonical Burdett and Mortensen (1998) job-ladder model assumes employee quits are driven by the receipt of a superior job offer. However, in my data, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), the majority of quits are not followed by entry into new employment within two weeks; I term these job-to-unemployment quits. Therefore, another explanation for this type of quit -and how it relates to the minimum wage -is required. In this chapter, I extend the job-ladder model to allow for quits into unemployment, as well as job-to-job quits. Specifically, time-varying reservation wages generate quits into unemployment when the reservation wage climbs above the current wage. I consider how both changes in one's own wage and changes in the wage distribution, driven by minimum wage increases, can affect this margin of separations. Meanwhile, job-to-job quits are motivated by the usual job-ladder model: workers quit and start working on a new job when they receive a higher wage offer. I use a competing risk hazard model to estimate the effect of the 1990 and 1991 increases in the federal minimum wage on these two types of quit hazards among affected workers -those earning less than the new minimum wage -relative to higher-wage workers. I find that the April 1990 minimum wage increase reduced job-to-job quit hazards, but not job-to-unemployment quit hazards. Job-to-unemployment quit hazards may not be sensitive to the minimum wage because, in the range of minimum wages studied, small increases in the minimum wage are not enough to induce workers to stay in the labor force as opposed to, for example, attending school or caring for children. Meanwhile, I find no effect of the early-1990s federal minimum wage changes on layoff hazards. The chapter proceeds as follows: I review the literature on minimum wages and employee turnover in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, I describe my theoretical framework and predictions in more detail. I then describe my data -the NLSY79 -and identification strategy in Section 3.4. I present results in Section 3.5 and conclude in Section 3.6."}, {"section_title": "Existing literature", "text": "A growing body of literature has explored the relationship between minimum wage levels and employment transition rates. Portugal and Cardoso (2006)  hiring at continuing firms, and the effect was more pronounced in larger firms and more profitable industries. Teenagers were also overrepresented at closing firms. However, teenagers' share of job separations at continuing firms decreased; on net, teenage employment rose over the period. Portugal and Cardoso (2006) interpret this as evidence of greater employer attachment among affected teenagers: \"[a]s their minimum wage was raised, compressing the bottom part of the wage distribution, the expected benefits from searching for a new job decline and so there is now less incentive to quit the job.\" (p. 1005). Indeed, teenagers who previously earned below the new minimum wage are more likely to remain with their employer than other teenagers or older workers. The authors connect this pattern to the Burdett and Mortensen (1998) search model, which predicts that higher wages will be associated with lower quit rates. However, in these data, quits are not empirically distinguishable from layoffs. Setting aside any potential direct disemployment effects of minimum wage increases, Brochu and Green (2013) estimate transition rates in high versus low minimum wage regimes. Using short panels from the Canadian Labour Force Survey, the authors construct monthly separation and hiring rates for low-skilled workers. Effects are identified off of province and time variation, and thanks to the long period of study  there are more than 140 different minimum wage regimes. The authors address the potential endogeneity of the minimum wage in two ways. First, they exclude recessionary periods so that effects are not identified off of cyclical variation. Second, they instrument for minimum wages using political variables for the province and its neighbors. Brochu and Green (2013) find that, for workers with less than one year of job tenure, a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 5 percent decrease in the probability of separation over the next year, mainly driven by a reduction in layoffs but also in quit rates. Combined with the observed reduction in hiring rates, these patterns are consistent with the standard finding of a minimal impact of minimum wage increases on employment rates. While separation effects were similar by age group, teen hiring rates are more negatively affected by minimum wage increases, suggesting that teenage employment levels will likely be reduced. The fact that the reduction in separations observed by Brochu and Green (2013) was driven by layoffs conflicts with Portugal and Cardoso (2006)'s interpretation of the Portuguese reduction in teen separations as stemming from reduced quit rates. Brochu and Green (2013) instead turn to a Mortensen-Pissarides type model in which workers and firms draw a match-specific productivity value at the end of a probationary period. The worker is paid the minimum wage during the probationary period; wages are bargained over once productivity is revealed, and the worker is laid off if productivity is below an endogenous threshold. A higher minimum wage may reduce the value of a vacancy since it makes the probationary period more expensive for the employer. This can lower the threshold for match quality at which an employer is willing to continue with the existing match, lowering layoffs. If firms can imperfectly screen workers before hiring, an increase in the minimum wage will additionally lead to a more stringent screening process, reducing the hiring rate as well as employment levels. While the predictions of this model are consistent with Brochu and Green (2013)'s empirical results on employment transitions, it contrasts with the usual empirical finding of no effect of the minimum wage on employment. When heterogeneous vacancy posting costs are introduced into the model, it is possible to rationalize a zero employment effect. Dube et al. (2016) undertake a similar analysis using United States data, estimating the response of employment flows among workers likely to be affected by minimum wage changes: teens and restaurant workers. Unlike Brochu and Green (2013), Dube et al. (2016) cannot observe whether a separation was due to a quit or layoff. The analysis is motivated with a job-ladder model, in which workers can search for a job while employed or unemployed, accepting a job if it pays above their reservation wage or above their current wage, as applicable. Jobs are destroyed exogenously. In bringing their questions to the data, Dube et al. (2016) take spatial heterogeneity more seriously than do Brochu and Green (2013), noting that state-level minimum wage increases were associated with other labor market phenomena and potentially with confounding policy changes. Consequently, they estimate effects of minimum wage changes using a border-discontinuity design, comparing counties on opposite sides of state lines. They support this design with evidence that \"cross-border contiguous counties are substantially more similar in levels and trends of covariates than counties further away.\" (p. 668) In order to measure outcomes at the local labor market level, they use the public-use Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) series, which provides aggregate statistics on employment, earnings, hiring, separations, and turnover rates at the county-industry and county-demographic group level. One limitation of this data is that it does not distinguish job-to-job transitions from job-to-unemployment transitions, nor quits from layoffs. Additionally, it is not possible to create a sample of minimum wage workers only, thus it is necessary to consider all teens or restaurant workers together. The results indicate that spatial heterogeneity can be an important source of bias in estimates of the employment elasticity of minimum wage changes. Dube et al. (2016) find significant negative elasticities for employment of teens and restaurant workers in a conventional specification, but no significant effects in the border-discontinuity specification. Meanwhile, minimum wage increases are associated with significant and economically meaningful decreases in hires, separations, and the turnover rate for teens and restaurant workers in both specifications. These results are consistent with the job-ladder model when calibrated using cross-sectional flows. Turnover is also found to drop more sharply for low-tenure workers upon a minimum wage increase, which is consistent with the match-quality model used by Brochu and Green (2013)."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical framework", "text": "In this chapter, I focus on the effect of minimum wages on employee-initiated separations, or quits. I hypothesize that quits have two causes: the arrival of a superior job offer, and a shock to the reservation wage that causes the current job to become unattractive to the worker. These causes will result in job-to-job and job-to-unemployment separations, respectively. In my empirical analysis, I will estimate the effect of the minimum wage on these two outcomes separately in order to provide evidence on the underlying mechanisms. First consider the relationship between the minimum wage level and the rate of worker quits due to the receipt of a higher-wage job offer, as in the classic job-ladder model (Burdett and Mortensen, 1998;Dube et al., 2016). This effect would be intensified if some sub-m 1 jobs were destroyed following the minimum wage increase, instead of being swept up to the new minimum wage. Thus, near-minimum-wage workers in the new regime are predicted to experience a lower job-to-job quit rate due to the slower arrival rate of higher-paying job offers. Next consider the factors driving job-to-unemployment quits. I hypothesize that a worker's time-varying reservation wage is drawn from some distribution that is not directly affected by the minimum wage. An employed worker draws a new reservation wage each period and will quit if her reservation wage exceeds her current wage. The reservation wage may rise because, for instance, the worker is contemplating attending school or caring for a new child. All else equal, a higher minimum wage means that minimum-wage workers are less likely to draw a reservation wage exceeding that value; in other words, it makes work more attractive relative to leisure, study, or home production. In addition, if a higher minimum wage results in reduced rates of hiring by employers, as found by Brochu and Green (2013), Dube et al. (2016), and Portugal and Cardoso (2006), a worker's reservation wage distribution may fall because of the anticipated lower arrival rate of offers. In other words, workers are more reluctant to enter non-employment because they expect it has become more difficult to find a job. Both these effects amount to lower job-to-unemployment quits for a higher value of the minimum wage. To study the effect of the minimum wage level on these two types of voluntary separations, I model employment duration in a competing risks framework, where the event of interest -either type of voluntary separation -may be obstructed by a different cause for employee separation. A competing risks model estimates the hazard rate of a particular failure event while accounting for the fact that other failure events may occur before the event of interest. Under a proportional hazards assumption, the hazard at time t for failure event k conditional on no failure of type k having yet occurred, known as the subdistribution hazard, can be written as where T represents the failure time, d indexes the failure event type and Z(t) is a vector of potentially time-varying covariates (Fine and Gray, 1999). The form of the baseline hazard l k0 (t) is left unspecified and is not estimated. Instead, the object of interest is the set of coefficients b which reflect the relative contribution of the covariates to the subhazard. While hazard models are regularly used to study employment spells (Farber, 1994;D'Addio and Rosholm, 2005), I am aware of only one study that has investigated the response of quit hazards to the minimum wage: Grossberg and Sicilian (2004). These authors hypothesize that a more strongly binding minimum wage has two opposing effects on turnover. As discussed above, the imposition of a minimum wage is likely to decrease the likelihood of obtaining a preferable job offer, hence increasing rents and reducing turnover. Grossberg and Sicilian (2004) also predict that if wage offers provide a signal of the effort required on the job, the compression of the wage distribution following a minimum wage increase will reduce the information content of wage offers and increase the number of bad matches, leading to greater turnover. While both of these effects are likely to be increasing in the level of the minimum wage relative to the wage distribution, Grossberg and Sicilian (2004) predict, without strong justification, that the rent effect will dominate in high-wage states while the net effect is ambiguous in low-wage states. In my identification strategy, described in the next section, I will focus on the effect of minimum wage increases for minimum wage workers specifically, rather than estimating effects separately for different groups of states."}, {"section_title": "Identification strategy and data", "text": "As of April 1, 1990, the federal minimum wage was raised from $3.35 to $3.80 after almost a decade of real erosion which had brought it to its lowest real level since 1950 (Card, 1992). The legislation signed in November 1989 also provided for a further increase to $4.25 as of April 1, 1991. Although there was a flurry of state minimum wage increases in the second half of the 1980s, these federal increases were binding for all but twelve states and the District of Columbia (Nelson, 1990). According to the Current Population Survey, across the United States 6.3 percent of workers were earning less than $3.80 in the twelve months leading up to the 1990 increase; 7.9 percent of workers were affected by the 1991 increase. I use a difference-in-difference strategy to study how these minimum wage increases changed quit hazards for affected workers relative to higher-wage earners. I define an affected worker, denoted \"Sub new MW\", as someone earning less than $4.25 in 1989, prior to the two minimum wage increases, the second of which raised the minimum wage to $4.25. Such a worker could be directly or indirectly affected by the first minimum wage increase, and would be directly affected by the second increase if they had not yet received a pay increase by April 1991. To study both increases together, I compare how quit hazards evolved for affected individuals in the first and second year after the April 1990 increase, relative to unaffected (above $4.25 per hour) workers. I also test for changes in quit hazards between the periods 2Q88-1Q89 and 2Q89-1Q90 -two years and one year prior to the first increase -to rule out differential pre-trends between the affected and unaffected workers. As controls, I include quarter-of-year (to address seasonality of separations) and Census region fixed effects, race, sex, and age. I use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) to study employee separations. The NLSY79 is a panel survey that began with a sample of 12,686 14-to 22-year-olds in 1979. changed jobs/moved, etc.) while in other years there are only a handful of reasons (quit for pregnancy or family reasons, quit for other reasons). In particular, only a subset of years specify the reason \"Quit because found a better job.\" To address this shortcoming, I first group responses as either layoffs (involuntary terminations) or quits based on the explanation provided by the respondent. I then subdivide quits as either job-to-job or job-to-unemployment quits based on the timing of other job spells: if the respondent began a new employment spell with another employer within the 7 days before or 14 days after a quit, that separation is marked as a job-to-job quit. I define respondents as affected by the 1990 and 1991 minimum wage increases if they earned below $4.25 per hour (the 1991 federal minimum wage) at any point in 1989. There are 1,775 such affected respondents in my data, and 7,400 counterparts who always earned greater than $4.25 in 1989. For all these respondents, I include in the analysis any spells that took place at least partially within the window 2Q88-1Q92. The parts of these spells that fell before or after this window are treated as left-truncated or censored, respectively. Table 3.1 presents summary statistics on these spells, divided between respondents earning below and above $4.25 in 1989. The lower-wage sample has a higher proportion of minorities and females. All respondents are between 24 and 32 in 1989 and there is not an age difference between the two groups. The mean and median spell duration are both roughly doubled for the higher wage group. Among spells that ended while the respondent was under observation, low-wage respondents are somewhat more likely to quit into unemployment, while higher-wage respondents are more likely to quit directly into another job. However, job-to-unemployment quits make up the majority of quits for both groups, underscoring the importance of studying this margin specifically. Finally, low-wage respondents are only slightly more likely to have their spells end in a layoff than their higher-wage counterparts. 1"}]
