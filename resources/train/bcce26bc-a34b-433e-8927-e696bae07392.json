[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Organic milk production has been one of the fastest growing segments of organic agriculture in the United States in recent years. Despite the growing number of organic dairy operations, the characteristics of organic dairy operations and the relative costs of organic and conventional milk production have been diffi cult to analyze. This study, using 2005 ARMS data for U.S. dairy operations, which include a targeted sample of organic milk producers, examines the structure, costs, and challenges of organic milk production. The analysis addresses economies of size, regional differences, and pasture use in organic milk production and compares organic and conventional milk production costs. The fi ndings suggest that economic forces have made organic operations more like conventional operations and that the future structure of the industry may depend on the interpretation and implementation of new organic pasture rules."}, {"section_title": "What Is the Issue?", "text": "Organic milk producers usually begin as conventional dairy operators who go through what can be a challenging and costly transition. To qualify for organic certifi cation under the NOP, producers must make changes in animal husbandry, land and crop management, input sourcing, and certifi cation paperwork, among others. In addition to these challenges, organic milk producers must now contend with the impact of a weaker U.S. economy on the demand for organic food products. By providing information about the characteristics, costs, and challenges faced by organic milk producers, this report provides a context for producers considering the organic approach, processors trying to supply an expanding organic milk market, and policymakers evaluating the economic implications of organic livestock production."}, {"section_title": "What Did the Study Find?", "text": "Economic forces may have pushed organic dairies to adapt their operations to be more like conventional dairies in terms of size, location, and the types of technologies used. The relative production costs for large and small organic dairies, organic dairies in the East and West, and organic dairies using pasture-based and conventional technologies are similar to those for conventional dairies.\nSize and Costs of Organic Dairies. Farms producing organic milk most often have small dairy operations; 45 percent of organic dairies milk fewer than 50 cows, and 87 percent milk fewer than 100 cows. Large organic dairies with 200 cows or more are a small portion of the organic dairy population, but account for more than a third of organic milk production. Average operating costs are highest on the largest organic dairies, but total economic costs are nearly $14 per hundredweight (cwt) less on the largest than on the smallest organic dairies because of lower capital and unpaid labor costs. The smallest operations use much more unpaid labor, accounting for most of this cost difference. Large organic dairies are much more likely to generate returns above capital and labor costs, suggesting that organic milk production will migrate toward larger operations, as has conventional production. Additional costs to comply with organic pasture requirements and for securing organic inputs in large volume may limit the cost advantages for larger organic dairies."}, {"section_title": "Region and Costs of Organic Dairies.", "text": "More than 80 percent of U.S. organic dairies are located in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, but these operations are small and less productive than those in the West. Organic dairies in the Northeast (averaging 53 cows) and Upper Midwest (64 cows) have far fewer cows on average than those in the West (381 cows), which produce more milk per cow on average (2,700 pounds more than in the Upper Midwest and 4,000 pounds more than in the Northeast). Average feed costs per cow are signifi cantly less on organic dairies in the Northeast and Upper Midwest due to greater use of homegrown feed and pasture. Despite higher feed costs per cow and greater labor and capital use, organic dairies in the West have lower total economic costs per cwt of milk produced. This cost advantage is the result of economies of size and much higher productivity per cow that may be attributed to the technologies used on these operations."}, {"section_title": "Pasture Use and Costs of Organic Dairies.", "text": "Almost two-thirds of organic dairies report that 50 percent of dairy forage comes from pasture, and a third indicate that 75 percent or more comes from pasture. Using pasture for dairy feed costs less than higher energy feed sources, and average feed costs per cow decline as more pasture is used for dairy forage. Organic dairies using the least pasture for dairy forage, however, have lower feed costs per cwt of milk than other organic dairies because average production per cow is more than 30 percent higher. Organic dairies that use conventional feeding methods, such as confi ning cows and feeding harvested forages, may generate higher returns to capital and labor than those using pasture-based feeding because of higher production and economies of size, and because pasturebased feeding requires more labor."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Organic and Conventional Dairies", "text": "\u2022 Organic dairies are smaller than conventional dairies (82 cows compared with 156 cows).\n\u2022 Organic dairies produce about 30 percent less milk per cow than conventional dairies (13,601 pounds per organic cow compared with 18,983 pounds per conventional cow).\n\u2022 Organic dairies are more often located in the Northeast and Upper Midwest than are conventional dairies (86 percent compared with 65 percent).\n\u2022 Organic dairies use more pasture-based feeding, where more than 50 percent of dairy forage fed is from pasture during grazing months, than conventional dairies (63 percent compared with 18 percent).\n\u2022 Organic dairies paid $6.37 per cwt more than conventional dairies in operating and capital costs, including transition costs, in 2005; the average price premium for organic milk was $6.69 per cwt.\n\u2022 Total economic costs of organic dairies in 2005 were $7.65 per cwt higher than for conventional dairies, nearly $1 per cwt higher than the average price premium for organic milk.\n\u2022 Pasture-based organic dairies' total economic costs were about $4 per cwt higher than conventional pasture-based dairies, much lower than the average price premium for organic milk in 2005.\nChallenges of Organic Milk Production. Certifi cation paperwork and compliance costs were reported by 40 percent of producers as the most challenging aspect of organic milk production, followed by fi nding new organic input sources (dairy replacement and feed), higher costs of production, and maintaining animal health. By contrast, the chief concern for large organic dairies seem to be fi nding organic input sources, and the chief concern for dairies in the Northeast seemed to be production costs; certifi cation paperwork was a lesser concern for pasture-based dairies and more educated operators.\nOrganic dairy operations usually begin as conventional dairies that undergo the transition to become certifi ed organic operations. Differences in farm and operator characteristics and production practices of organic and conventional dairies were identifi ed and used to measure differences in milk production costs. These cost differences, along with estimates of organic transition costs, indicate milk price premiums that organic dairies need to be competitive with conventional milk production (see box, \"What Other Studies Indicate\").\nResearch models were specifi ed to describe farms that use organic production and the difference in costs between organic and conventional farms. The models accounted for the myriad of factors that infl uence milk production costs, such as size of operation, region, and production practices, to isolate the cost difference attributed to an organic operation. The models also accounted for the fact that organic producers are not randomly assigned among the dairy population, but instead self-select. Self-selection could bias the cost comparison if unmeasured factors, such as the level or type of management, were correlated with both organic participation and milk production costs (see Appendix B: Modeling the Impact of Organic Participation on Milk Production Costs or McBride and Greene, 2009 ).\nThis research was also designed to examine whether organic systems are more or less competitive in different segments of the U.S. dairy sector. The models were used to evaluate the competitiveness of organic and conventional milk production for farms located in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, those using pasture-based feeding, and among small dairies, segments of the U.S. dairy sector where organic production is most common. The results provide an indication of when organic milk production was most economical compared with conventional production."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "This study used information from a 2005 survey of U.S. milk producers as part of USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) administered by its National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS).

A subsample of the survey targeted organic dairies identifi ed by major organic milk processors and certifi ers.

Regression analysis, with a treatment-effect model, was used to measure the difference in production costs between organic and conventional dairies. Differences in production costs, along with estimates of organic transition costs, indicated the milk price premiums that make organic competitive with conventional milk production."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Organic milk production has been one of the fastest growing segments of organic agriculture in the United States. Between 2000 and 2005, the number of certifi ed organic milk cows on U.S. farms increased by an annual average of about 25 percent, from 38,000 to more than 86,000 (USDA, Economic Research Service, 2007a; fi g. 1). Many of these cows were on small dairy operations that had switched to organic production to improve farm profi tability (Barham, Brock, and Foltz, 2006 Certifi ed organic milk production systems rely on ecologically based standards that prohibit the use of antibiotics and hormones in the cow herd and the use of synthetic chemicals in dairy feed production. Certifi ed organic milk production systems also attempt to accommodate the animals' natural nutritional and behavioral requirements, such as ensuring that cows have access to pasture (Greene and Kremen, 2003) . These requirements add to production costs and create challenges for widespread adoption, such as higher managerial costs and risks of shifting to a new way of farming, and signifi cant time and costs associated with the transition to organic production.\nThis report describes organic dairy farms in the United States, including information about farm size, location, production costs, and the types of technologies used, and discusses the challenges of organic milk production. Although the analysis focuses on organic dairy farms, a comparison with conventional dairy farms adds value to the discussion.\n1 The 2007 Census of Agriculture reports 1,617 farms with organic product sales among those classifi ed as dairy cattle and milk production according to the North American Industry Classifi cation System (NAICS). This is up from 516 farms in 2002.\n2 One percent of organic milk cows can account for 2-3 percent of U.S. fl uid milk consumption because most organic milk production is sold as fl uid milk. In contrast, only about 36 percent of conventional milk is sold as fl uid milk. The rest is sold for cheese and other manufactured products (Miller and Blayney, 2006) . "}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Organic milk producers usually begin as conventional dairy operators who then go through what can be a challenging and costly transition process. During the transition, organic dairies must change their animal husbandry, land, and crop management, source new and different inputs, and initiate the certifi cation process. To become a certifi ed organic dairy under current standards of USDA's National Organic Program (USDA, Agricultural Marketing Service, 2008a), the pasture and cropland providing feed for organic dairies must be managed organically for a minimum of 36 months. Current standards also require the dairy herd to be fed 100 percent organic feed and to receive organic health care for 12 months before being certifi ed. 3 Organic dairy animals may not be given hormones, such as rBST, 4 or antibiotics for any reason. Grazing is required for all animals over 6 months of age.\nThese requirements mean that products and feeds that meet organic standards must be found, and organic feeds can be priced signifi cantly higher than conventional feeds. Also, the approach to management must be adjusted on most farms as many conventional inputs, such as antibiotics, are no longer available (Arnold, 2007) . The certifi cation process can also be time consuming and tedious as farmers must develop an organic systems plan that describes practices and substances used in production. In addition, detailed production records must be kept for 5 years post-certifi cation for a farm to be in compliance with the regulations, and access to these records must be provided to USDA and its certifying agents (USDA, Agricultural Marketing Service, 2008b).\nUSDA's National Organic Program (NOP) rules state that access to pasture must be provided for ruminant animals, but do not indicate how much pasture should be allocated or how much dairy feed should be provided by pasture. 5 The most common technology used on conventional dairy operations confi nes milk cows in large barns and limits access to pasture. Therefore, interpretation of the pasture rule, largely left to individual certifi ers, has important implications for land requirements and costs of organic milk production for farmers considering the transition. Partly in response to comments, complaints, and noncompliance regarding pasture use on organic dairy operations, USDA proposed a rule in October 2008 to clarify and strengthen the NOP pasture requirement. This proposed rule would amend livestock and related provisions of the NOP, providing better consumer assurances that the USDA organic label on dairy products means that cattle graze on pasture during the pasturegrowing season 6 (U.S. Offi ce of the Federal Register, 2008).\nMilk prices paid to U.S. producers are determined by a complex system. A minimum, or base price, is determined by a combination of the dairy price support program and Federal milk marketing orders (Manchester and Blayney, 2001) . Quality adjustments are made to the minimum price based on the content of fats and other milk solids and the volume of milk sold, among other factors. Organic milk pricing is subject to the same minimum as all other milk, but processors pay a premium for the value added by the organic brand. Also, organic producers with cows using pasture as their primary forage may receive higher prices because the milk tends to have higher fat and other solids content (Butler, 2007) . Organic milk producers are paid a fi xed price per hundredweight (cwt) for organic milk, according 3 Dairy farms that transitioned prior to June 2006 were allowed to feed a diet consisting of as much as 20 percent conventional feed, but must have fed at least 80 percent organic feed for 9 months and then 100 percent organic feed for 3 additional months before they were able to sell certifi ed organic milk (Dimitri and Greene, 2002) . 4 Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring bovine growth hormone given to cows to increase milk production.\n5 Pasture is defi ned by the NOP as land used for livestock grazing that provides feed value and maintains or improves soil, water, and vegetative resources. 6 The pasture-growing season is defi ned as from last frost to fi rst frost, and can be from 120 to 365 days depending on climate and region of the United States.\nto annual contracts with organic creameries that purchase the milk. In contrast, conventional milk producers are paid a blend price determined by spot markets for butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk, and whey, which may vary dramatically each month. 7 The relative price stability of organic milk, compared with conventional milk, is a benefi t for producers who transition to organic."}, {"section_title": "Dairy Farm Data", "text": "Dairy farm data used in this study came from USDA's 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of U.S. milk producers. The ARMS, conducted annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS), provides detailed farm information on income, expenses, assets, and debt, as well as farm and operator characteristics. The 2005 ARMS included a version that highlights milk production practices and costs. This version targets dairy operations in 24 States that accounted for more than 90 percent of national milk production and covered all major production areas (fi g. 2).\nThe surveyed dairy farms were chosen from a list of farm operations maintained by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The target population of the dairy version included farms that were in the dairy business for all 12 months of 2005 and milked at least 10 cows at any time during the year. The dairy survey collected information to estimate average milk production costs. Screening out farms that milked fewer than 10 cows excluded farms with dairy cows for onfarm consumption and other noncommercial activities, such as youth projects. 7 The blend price is a minimum weighted average price in Federal milk marketing orders based on the proportion of Grade A Milk allocated to each use class. Producers receive the blend price with adjustments for butterfat content and plant location if so specifi ed (Manchester and Blayney, 2001) . A subsample that targeted organic operations was also part of the 2005 ARMS dairy version. Of the total 2,987 dairy farms sampled, 737 samples were targeted at organic operations in 19 States as identifi ed by the major organic milk processors and certifi ers. After accounting for nonresponse and missing data, information on 1,787 farms, including 352 certifi ed organic milk operations in 14 States, were available from the ARMS 8 (fi g. 2). Among the organic dairies, 325 sold more than 90 percent of milk production as certifi ed organic, 18 were transitioning to organic production, and 9 were mixed operations.\nEach surveyed farm represented a number of similar farms in the population as indicated by the surveyed farm's expansion factor. The expansion factor, or survey weight, was determined from the farm's selection probability, expanding the sample to represent the target population. Farm survey weights ensured that the sample expanded to represent dairy operations in the 24 States and that organic operations represented an appropriate share of the population despite a disproportionate representation in the sample. Organic farms accounted for 18 percent of the sample, but only 2 percent of the weighted number of farms. 8 The response rate of the organic dairy sample was 48 percent, compared with 64 percent for the conventional dairy sample. This response difference was due to the challenges of building the list of organic dairies; in addition, some dairies on the organic dairy list were not actually organic operations."}, {"section_title": "Economies of Size in Organic Milk Production", "text": "The emergence of large conventional dairy farms and the continued shift of production toward such farms suggest that economies of size play a major role in the structure of dairy farming. Economies of size and the role it takes in the structural changes observed in conventional milk production were documented by MacDonald et al. This section reports on the relationship between operation size and production costs in organic milk production, including what size and costs might mean for the structure of the industry.\nTo evaluate the relationship between organic milk production costs and operation size, surveyed producers were divided into groups by size, and differences in farm characteristics and practices, production costs and net returns, and labor use were compared among the groups. The size groups were defi ned by the largest number of cows milked on the operation during 2005: (1) fewer than 50 cows; (2) 50-99 cows; (3) 100-199 cows; and (4) 200 cows or more."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics and Practices by Size", "text": "Data for 2005 indicated that about 45 percent of organic dairies milked fewer than 50 cows, while 87 percent had fewer than 100 cows (table 1). These small operations accounted for a disproportionately small share of organic milk cows and production. In contrast, about 13 percent of organic dairies had 100 cows or more, but they accounted for 44 percent of milk cows and nearly half of production. The largest organic dairies-those with 200 cows or more-had an average herd size of almost 500 cows per farm and included nearly a third of organic milk cows. These large dairies had a higher average milk yield per cow than smaller dairies and produced 37 percent of organic milk.\nThe most striking difference among organic dairies in each size group was their location. Northeast and Upper Midwest farms accounted for 96 percent of dairies with fewer than 50 cows. Farms in the West accounted for 80 percent of dairies with 200 cows or more. Within each region, 97 percent of organic dairies in the Northeast, 88 percent of organic dairies in the Upper Midwest, and 85 percent of organic dairies in the Corn Belt had fewer than 100 cows. In contrast, 83 percent of organic dairies in the West had 100 cows or more and 63 percent had 200 cows or more (fi g. 3).\nThe use of several milk production technologies and practices tended to increase with size of organic operation, but most of the differences were between the smallest and other organic farms. For example, use of a milking parlor increased from 22 percent for the smallest dairies to nearly all dairies with 100 cows or more (table 1) . Thirty-eight percent of the smallest farms and over 50 percent of other farms participated in the Dairy Herd Improvement program. Use of regular veterinary and nutritionist services was also much lower on the smallest farms. Likewise, the use of business management tools, such as computer records, the Internet, and forward-purchasing inputs, was less. Pasture-based feeding was used by 70 percent of the smallest dairies and was also used by more than half of the largest dairies. 9 9 Producers surveyed in the ARMS were asked what percentage of the total forage ration milk cows obtained from pasture during the grazing months. With pasture-based feeding, pasture provides at least half of the forage fed to milk cows during the grazing months."}, {"section_title": "Production Costs and Net Returns by Size", "text": "Average feed costs differed little among the dairies in each size group, 10 but average operating costs for organic dairies increased from the smallest to largest size group due to the additional costs of hired labor on the largest farms. Total operating costs were about $2 per cwt higher on the largest organic dairies than on the smallest (table 2). Once capital costs were added, cost differences among the size groups were negligible, as lower capital costs on the larger operations offset the additional hired labor costs. The smallest farms, however, used signifi cantly more unpaid labor, mainly from farm operators and other family members, than did larger farms. After adding an opportunity cost for this unpaid labor, total economic costs for organic dairies declined with 10 Feed costs made up the largest share of milk production costs, accounting for 65-75 percent of operating costs and 33-50 percent of total economic costs. size and were nearly $14 per cwt less on the largest farms than on the smallest (see Appendix A: Measuring Milk Production Costs).\nThe relationship between average production costs and operation size for organic dairies was similar to that for conventional dairies among the size groups that characterize the organic industry (fi g. 4). Average production costs for conventional milk production declined from about $30 per cwt on operations with fewer than 50 cows to about $18 per cwt on operations with 200-499 cows (MacDonald et al., 2007) . Average costs dropped to less than $14 per cwt on conventional operations with more than 1,000 cows. Lower costs among the largest conventional producers suggest that similar economies of size may be available to organic producers if they increase the size of their operation above the industry norm. However, the additional costs of complying with pasture requirements and securing organic inputs in large volume may limit the cost advantages for larger organic operations.\nNet returns to the organic dairy enterprise were computed as the difference between the gross value of production and total economic costs. Average net returns in 2005 were negative for all organic dairy size groups (from -$12.93 per cwt among dairies with fewer than 50 cows to -$1.26 per cwt among dairies with 200 cows or more) (table 2) . 11 These averages, however, mask the variation in net returns among dairies. Some operations may be more productive because they are well managed, while others may pay less than average for inputs or receive above-average milk prices, and thus these farms may be profi table while their group, on average, is not. For example, 10 percent of organic dairies with fewer than 11 These estimates of net returns include charges for unpaid farm labor and homegrown feed. Charges for these items were determined by estimates of their opportunity costs, which may or may not refl ect the costs perceived by some farm operators (see Appendix A: Measuring Milk Production Costs). 50 cows and almost half of those with 200 cows or more generated positive returns above total economic costs (fi g. 5).\nFarmers are unlikely to start or expand a dairy operation if they are unable to recover their investment in capital and labor. Farmers who have already made substantial capital investments in dairy facilities and equipment, however, see these costs as sunk (unrecoverable), with little or no opportunity for use outside the dairy operation. These costs, therefore, have no bearing on the decision to operate in the short term, only becoming important when these capital assets must be replaced. 12 To better measure costs relevant to shortterm operating decisions, the share of farms with gross returns exceeding all costs except for capital costs was computed. About a fourth of organic dairies with fewer than 50 cows covered these costs, compared with almost threefourths of those with 200 cows or more (fi g. 5).\nSome small organic dairy farms appeared to be earning enough to keep operating, but on average, farms in the smaller size groups were not covering the opportunity costs of their investments in capital and the operator's time. In contrast, larger organic dairies were much more likely to generate returns above capital and labor costs. These conditions suggest that organic milk production may migrate toward larger operations, as has conventional production. This production change will likely occur over an extended period as existing smaller operations use up their production facilities and equipment, ultimately facing decisions about replacing capital assets or exiting the industry. Also, in the short term, some small operators may continue 12 If not replaced, the costs of maintaining dairy facilities and equipment are likely to increase over time, leading to higher repair and other operating costs. producing organic milk as a lifestyle choice despite returns that fail to cover the opportunity cost of their time."}, {"section_title": "Labor Use by Size", "text": "Small organic dairies are at a cost disadvantage relative to larger dairies due to the opportunity cost assigned to the unpaid labor provided by operators, partners, and family members. Unpaid labor costs for organic dairies with fewer than 50 cows were $13.42 per cwt, compared with only $1.15 per cwt on dairies with 200 cows or more. If this opportunity cost is ignored, the net returns to organic milk production were more similar among the size groups.\nLabor use by size group for organic dairies is shown in table 3. The largest dairies used substantially more hired labor than the smallest (11,530 hours versus 557 hours), but the hired labor hours per unit of production differed little among the size groups because of much higher production on the largest dairies. The difference in unpaid labor use among the farm size groups was much less. Organic dairy operations with 200 cows or more used about 700 more hours of unpaid labor, about 20 percent more than those with fewer than 50 cows. The largest dairies, however, produced about 1,700 percent more milk as a result of having more cows and an average productivity per cow that was 36 percent higher than the smallest dairies. Enhanced productivity for these larger dairies means that unpaid labor hours per unit of production fell dramatically across the size groups from 0.82 hour per cwt on the smallest organic dairies to only 0.05 hour on the largest.\nUnpaid labor is an opportunity cost defi ned as the time spent working on a dairy operation charged at a wage rate that represents what unpaid workers could earn in off-farm employment (see Appendix A: Measuring Milk Production Costs). 13 Opportunity costs of labor may vary signifi cantly among producers, and some producers may be willing to accept returns lower than they could earn in nonfarm employment because of lifestyle preferences and costs of switching occupations, among other reasons. The incentive to earn a competitive return for the time spent on the dairy operation, however, may be a motivating force for increasingly larger organic dairies. 13 Wage rates used to estimate unpaid labor costs averaged from $16.36 per hour among the smallest dairies to $23.00 per hour among the largest. Differences in the age, education, and location of farm operators in each group determined the wage rates. "}, {"section_title": "Regional Differences in Organic Milk Production", "text": "Conventional milk production has historically been concentrated in the Upper Midwest and Northeast, mostly in Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania. In the past three decades, however, milk production has expanded rapidly on large operations located in nontraditional areas of the South and West. Most prominently, California surpassed Wisconsin during the early 1990s as the number one milk-producing State. The continued growth of dairies in these nontraditional areas is the result of a favorable climate, an abundance of alternative crops that can be used for dairy feed (e.g., citrus pulp, cottonseed, or almond hulls), their relative geographic isolation, and population growth (Butler, 2002) .\nAlthough more recent in nature, regional development of organic milk production has followed a path similar to that of conventional milk production. Small organic dairy farmers and milk cooperatives in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, along with a major organic milk processor with its own large dairy farm in the West, pioneered organic milk production during the 1990s. Organic milk production was a good fi t for the small, pasture-oriented operations in the Northeast, in Wisconsin, and in other parts of the Midwest. Expansion in the West, where California and Oregon have become leading organic milkproducing States, was motivated by many of the same factors that spurred expansion of conventional milk production in this area.

Only 16 percent of operations in the West grew corn, and just over half produced hay. As a result, the large organic dairies in the West purchased more dairy feed items than those in other regions. The percentage of farms using pasture-based feeding for dairy cattle varied little among the regions.\nOperators of organic dairies in the West were, on average, more educated than those in other regions. Nearly half of farm operators in the West attended college, compared with 20 percent or less in the other regions. More education may explain why the use of some production practices was more common on dairies in the West. Operators of organic dairies in the West were more likely to participate in the Dairy Herd Improvement program, use artifi cial insemination, use regular veterinary and nutritionist services, use computerized milking and feeding systems, access dairy information from the Internet, and forward-purchase inputs. Higher education may contribute to a greater awareness of these practices and ease the adoption process.

Size economies were the predominant factor in the difference between total economic costs in each region, ranging from $37.59 per cwt on the small Northeast operations to $25.13 per cwt on the large operations in the West. Most of the difference in total economic costs in the West came from unpaid labor charges that were more than $9 per cwt less than in the Northeast and about $5 per cwt less than in the Upper Midwest.\nA breakdown of annual feed costs per cow in each region reveals costs that were signifi cantly less in the Northeast ($400 per cow less) and Upper Midwest ($500 per cow less) than in the West (fi g. 8). More than half of total feed costs on organic dairies in the Northeast stemmed from homegrown feed and grazed forages, while these sources accounted for more than 70 percent of feed costs in the Upper Midwest. Organic dairies in these regions may have incurred lower feed costs than those shown here if their production costs were lower than the market prices charged for these inputs. In contrast, more than three-fourths of the total feed cost on organic dairies in the West was from purchased feed items.\nDespite higher feed costs per cow on organic dairies in the West, feed costs per cwt were competitive with organic dairies in other regions. Total labor and capital usage were also much higher on dairies in the West, but total costs per cwt were signifi cantly less. The cost advantage of organic dairies in the West resulted from economies of size on larger dairies and higher productivity. Almost 50 percent of organic dairies in the West had an average milk production per cow of 15,000 pounds or more, and only 12 percent of organic dairies were producing less than 10,000 pounds (fi g. 9). In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, only a quarter of producers were producing 15,000 pounds or more, and 25 percent of Upper Midwest producers and more than a third of producers in the Northeast had average production less than 10,000 pounds.

Without these charges, the difference in total economic costs among the regions would be less than $3.50 per cwt.\nTotal labor use for organic milk production was signifi cantly higher in the West due to the larger operations, but labor use per cwt was much less (table  6) . Total labor use per cwt in the West (0.23 hour) was less than half that in the Upper Midwest (0.53 hour) and less than a third of that in the Northeast (0.84 hour). Part of this difference in labor use per cwt was due to higher productivity in the West, but labor use per cow was also signifi cantly less. Organic dairies in the West used 38 hours of labor per cow, compared with 100 hours in the Northeast and 70 hours in the Upper Midwest. Less labor use per cow was due, in part, to the labor-saving practices more often used on dairies in the West and to economies of size. Organic dairy feed costs per cow, by region Milk production, by region "}, {"section_title": "Pasture Use in Organic Milk Production", "text": "The most common technology used on conventional dairy operations confi nes milk cows in large barns and limits access to pasture. This means that forage from grazing comprises very little of the forage fed to dairy cows on most conventional dairies. Access to pasture is a requirement for the organic certifi cation of dairy operations. Forage from grazing is also an important element of the feeding program on many organic dairies. Milk producers may fi nd it easier and less expensive to maintain organic pastures for grazing dairy cows than to either purchase or produce and harvest organic crops and forage for dairy feed. Also, grazing systems may be less stressful for dairy cattle and contribute to lower veterinary expenses. Pasture-based production may also have environmental benefi ts, such as improved soil quality and reduced soil erosion (Boody et al., 2005; Weil and Gilker, 2003) .\nPasture use for dairy feed on organic dairies, relative to conventional dairies, is illustrated in fi gure 10. More than 60 percent of organic milk producers reported that at least half of their total forage ration came from pasture during the grazing months (an average of 6.5 months per year), compared with 18 percent of conventional dairies. Nearly 90 percent of organic dairies sourced at least 25 percent of their total forage ration from pasture. In contrast, 70 percent of conventional dairies reported that less than 25 percent of their total forage ration fed to dairy cows came from pasture, while 40 percent obtained none from pasture. To evaluate the role of pasture grazing in organic milk production, surveyed producers were divided into groups that indicate the level of pasture grazing as a source of dairy cow forage during the grazing months: (1) 0-24 percent; (2) 25-49 percent; (3) 50-74 percent; and (4) 75-100 percent."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics and Practices by Level of Pasture Use", "text": "Almost two-thirds of organic milk producers reported that at least 50 percent of the forage fed to dairy cattle during the grazing months came from pasture, and a third reported that 75 percent or more came from pasture (table 7) . Only 12 percent of organic milk producers reported that less than 25 percent of forage fed came from pasture. Differences between organic dairies where pasture use was highest (75-100 percent of forage fed) and lowest (0-24 percent of forage fed) were signifi cant and are emphasized in this section. Farm characteristics among organic dairies in the middle groups (25-49 percent and 50-74 percent of forage fed from pasture) showed little difference.\nOperations that relied on pasture use the most were the smallest in size and produced the least milk per cow. Organic dairies with 75-100 percent of forage fed from pasture had an average of 64 milk cows that averaged 11,289 pounds of milk per cow. In contrast, dairies with 0-24 percent of forage from pasture averaged more than twice the number of milk cows (135) and more than 5,000 pounds more milk production per cow (16,560 pounds). Thus, operations that relied less on pasture use (12 percent) had a disproportionately large share of milk cows (21 percent) and milk production (25 percent), while a third of operations that relied most on pasture use accounted for only 25 percent of milk cows and 21 percent of production.\nOrganic dairies with the highest pasture use for feed were located in the Northeast. More than half of these farms were in the Northeast and operated with 45 percent of the organic milk cows in this group. Operations in the Upper Midwest accounted for the majority of farms using the least pasture (0-24 percent) and 35 percent of farms using the most (75-100 percent). Organic dairies in the West accounted for only 8 percent of the farms using the least pasture, but these large operations held 51 percent of the milk cows in this group. Large operations relied less on pasture as a forage source because of the signifi cant land requirements necessary to supply pasture for large herds. However, some large operations in the West used pasture as an important dairy feed source. Among the farms with the highest pasture use, the West (at 2 percent) included 18 percent of the milk cows.\nOrganic dairies that relied the most on pasture use were in business relatively less time than other organic dairies. Twenty-seven percent of dairies that relied on pasture for 75-100 percent of their forage feed had been in business less than 10 years, compared with only 11 percent that relied on pasture for 0-24 percent of their forage feed (table 7) . Also, farm operators who relied the most on pasture forage were younger than other farm operators. Sixteen percent of these farm operators were younger than 35 and only 4 percent were older than 65, compared with 6 and 10 percent, respectively, of the operators who used the least pasture (fi g. 11). Younger farm operators on relatively new dairies were more likely to use pasture-based feeding for organic milk production.\nPasture as a source of forage on organic dairies was closely related to the intensity of pasture management. Rotating pastures is a management strategy that can increase the total volume and quality of dry matter produced on pastures by allowing cows to graze for specifi ed periods before moving them to new pastures. Seventy-two percent of organic dairies that reported the highest use of pasture forage rotated pastures at least once a day, compared with less than 40 percent of dairies that used pasture forage the least. Among dairies that used pasture the least, 24 percent reported that pastures were never rotated and 4 percent indicated that pasture was not a source of dairy feed."}, {"section_title": "Production Costs and Net Returns by Level of Pasture Use", "text": "Substituting pasture for more expensive feed sources may appear to be an effi cient way to lower dairy feed costs. Average feed costs per cwt of milk, however, were lowest on the organic operations using the least pasture for dairy forage (0-24 percent), between $1 and $2 per cwt less than on the operations using more pasture (table 8) . This relationship changes little even if charges for pasture resources are excluded from the feed costs.\nAverage feed costs per cow declined as pasture use for dairy forage increased (fi g. 12). Total feed costs were $1,902 per cow on organic dairies that relied on pasture for 0-24 percent of forage fed, compared with only $1,409 on organic dairies that relied on pasture for 75-100 percent of forage fed, a savings of about 25 percent. As shown previously, however, average production per cow was more than 30 percent lower on the organic dairies that used the most pasture, thus total costs per cwt were higher.\nBreaking down the distribution of milk production per cow for each group provides an indication of how milk yields declined as pasture was substituted for higher energy feed in the dairy ration. Nearly half of organic dairies feeding 0-24 percent of forage from pasture had annual milk yields at 15,000 pounds per cow or more, compared with just 10 percent of dairies feeding 75-100 percent (fi g. 13). In contrast, more than 40 percent of dairies using the most pasture had an annual milk yield of less than 10,000 pounds per cow, compared with 19 percent of those using the least pasture. This suggests that improving pasture quality to achieve higher milk production can contribute to the success of organic dairies using pasture-based feeding.\nThe relationship between pasture use and total production costs follows much the same pattern as seen for size and production costs on organic dairies. That is, the operations using less pasture were much larger and had lower average costs per cwt than the smaller operations using more pasture. Capital costs were more than $2 per cwt higher and the charge for unpaid labor was more than $5 per cwt higher on the operations where pasture forage accounted for 75-100 percent of forage fed than on those where pasture forage accounted for 0-24 percent of forage fed (table 8) . Larger operations were able to spread the fi xed costs for capital and labor over production from more cows, and each cow was more productive on the larger operations using the least pasture for dairy forage. Feed costs, by share of dairy forage fed from pasture Average returns net of total economic costs were negative for dairies in each of the pasture use groups, but were signifi cantly higher among the dairies using the least pasture. This disparity suggests that organic operations using conventional dairy feeding methods, such as confi ning cows and feeding higher energy feed, were more likely to generate higher returns to capital and labor resources than those relying more on pasture-based feeding. Thus, the technologies and production methods used on organic dairies could become more like those used on conventional dairies. Changing technologies and production methods may depend on the extent to which pasture requirements for organic dairies must include pasture as part of the dairy feeding program."}, {"section_title": "Labor Use by Level of Pasture Use", "text": "The biggest difference in organic dairy costs between those using the most and the least pasture for dairy forage was the unpaid labor charge. The labor charge on organic dairies feeding 75-100 percent of forage from pasture was more than $8 per cwt, compared with less than $3 per cwt on dairies feeding 0-24 percent of forage from pasture (table 8) . The labor charge contributed about half the difference in total costs that were more than $10 per cwt higher for dairies using the most pasture. Table 9 includes labor use per cow and per cwt for each level of pasture feeding. Unpaid labor use per cwt on organic dairies feeding 75-100 percent of forage from pasture was about three times that for those feeding 0-24 percent of forage from pasture. Part of this difference came from fi xed amounts of labor being spread over more output on the larger operations that used the least amount of pasture. Some of the labor difference, however, may be due to the pasture feeding system's being more labor intensive than handling dairy cows Figure 13 Milk production, by share of dairy forage fed from pasture in confi nement. Among farms with fewer than 100 cows, the unpaid labor use on dairies feeding the least forage from pasture was still about a third less than on those feeding the most forage from pasture (0.45 hour versus 0.65 hour). In addition, total labor use among these small dairies increased steadily as more pasture was used for dairy feed. This increase suggests that pasture-based feeding systems are inherently more labor intensive than the conventional practice of handling dairy cows in confi nement, possibly due to the labor required for moving cows to, from, and between pastures. "}, {"section_title": "Characteristics and Practices of Organic and Conventional Dairies", "text": "Organic dairies were smaller than conventional dairies, averaging 82 cows per organic farm compared with 156 cows per conventional farm (table 10) . The average milk production per cow was also lower on organic operations, nearly 30 percent less. Organic operations averaged about 13,600 pounds of milk per cow, compared with nearly 19,000 pounds per cow on conventional operations.\nMore than 80 percent of organic dairy operations were located in the Northeast or Upper Midwest, compared with 65 percent of conventional operations. These regions also included 62 percent of all organic milk cows, compared with 42 percent of conventional milk cows. In contrast, only 7 percent of organic dairies were located in the West, but these operations held about a third of total U.S. organic milk cows, the same as conventional operations. Organic dairies in the West (381 cows) were much larger than those in other regions and similar in average size to conventional operations (431 cows). The average size of organic dairies in the Northeast was half that of conventional dairies (52 cows versus 104 cows), and those in the Upper Midwest were about two-thirds the size of conven-What Other Studies Indicate Butler (2002) Measured the differences between organic and conventional dairy production costs in California based on 1999 data. The primary cost differences between organic and conventional operations included: reduced milk production, slightly higher feed and labor costs, and signifi cantly higher herd replacement and transition costs. Net returns from organic production in 1999 appeared to be more than twice those from conventional production on similar dairies, but less than for the State average of conventional production. Dalton et al. (2005) Reported average production costs and returns from a 2004 sample of 30 organic dairy farms in Vermont and Maine. Total costs for organic milk production came in at $22.58 per cwt, before a deduction for unpaid operator labor and management. Organic milk production did not generate any return to unpaid labor and management nor did it produce a positive return to farm assets or equity. To do so, an organic milk price of at least $25.00 per cwt would have been needed in 2004 to break even on returns to assets, and $28.05 per cwt would have been needed to earn a 5 percent return-9 and 24 percent, respectively above the average 2004 organic milk price. The cost structures of organic and conventional dairies were found to be similar, differing only in items that contributed 7 percent or less to the total cost of production. Barham, Brock, and Foltz (2006) Described organic dairy farming in Wisconsin using 2003 and 2004 survey data from organic, management intensive grazing, and conventional milk operations. Few differences existed between organic and other dairies in terms of farm operator characteristics, but organic operators expressed greater satisfaction and optimism about the dairy business. Organic operations were generally smaller than conventional operations, but larger than grazing operations, and were more similar to conventional operations in terms of their technology use. Organic operations seemed to be modernizing more rapidly than other dairies. Rotz et al. (2007) Examined the environmental and economic performance of organic grass and organic crop dairies in Pennsylvania. Results showed an economic advantage for organic over conventional milk production that depended on relative organic and conventional milk prices and levels of milk production. Based on the relative milk prices for 2006, organic production seemed to provide an option for improving the economic viability of dairy operations of a similar scale.\ntional dairies (64 cows versus 98 cows). The ARMS includes no data for organic dairy operations in the Southeast or Southwest.\nMost farm operator characteristics were similar among conventional and organic dairies. Nearly all farm operators in both groups reported farming as their primary occupation, common for dairy operations due to their substantial onfarm labor requirements. The distribution of operator education suggests that those in the organic group were neither more nor less educated than operators of conventional dairies. The average age of farm operators on conventional and organic dairies was similar. Most organic operations converted to organic production after years of conventional production. Of the 21 years that organic operators reported being in business, organic milk was produced for only 5 years. Organic producers were more optimistic about their future, as signifi cantly fewer planned to exit in the next 10 years and signifi cantly more planned to be in business for 20 or more years (fi g. 14).\nThe primary difference in the production practices used by organic and conventional dairies was found in their feeding systems. More then 60 percent of organic operations reported using pasture-based feeding that provided more than 50 percent of seasonal forage from pasture (during the grazing months), compared with just 18 percent of other operations (table 11) . Although not available to organic producers, rBST was used by 17 percent of conventional operations that were also more likely to utilize regular veterinary services and a nutritionist to formulate dairy rations (fi g. 15). Differences in production practices may have contributed to the higher production per cow on conventional versus organic operations.\nLabor use also distinguished conventional from organic dairies. Organic operations used nearly twice the hours of total labor per cwt, on average, than did conventional operations (0.50 hour versus 0.26 hour). Most of the labor difference came from signifi cantly more unpaid labor hours worked on organic dairies and was infl uenced by the smaller average size and lower productivity of organic dairies. Fixed labor inputs were spread over fewer units of production on the smaller organic dairies."}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting the Use of Organic Milk Production", "text": "Several operator and farm characteristics were statistically associated with the organic approach to milk production. Among operator characteristics, education and planning horizon were important. Dairy farmers graduating from college were more likely to be organic producers. Dairy operations planning to Figure 14 Plans to exit the dairy business, by type of producer exit the industry in the next 10 years were less likely to be organic, indicating that operations with a longer planning horizon were more likely to use the organic approach. 15 More educated dairy farmers with long-term plans to remain in business are probably more willing and able to make the necessary investments or take the additional risks associated with organic production.\nSize and location of dairy operations were also important factors infl uencing operators to go organic. The likelihood of being organic decreased as the number of milk cows on a farm increased. Larger operations had less incentive to go organic because of economies of size in milk production, pasture requirements for organic certifi cation, and possible diffi culties sourcing large quantities of organic inputs. The proximity and accessibility of grazing land to the operation may also have been important because barriers, such as highways and streams, may limit available pasture. Location in the Northeast or Upper Midwest was also associated with a higher probability of being organic. The organic dairy industry began in these areas and may offer a more developed infrastructure for handling organic milk.\n15 Some farm operators may have revised their planning horizon to be more optimistic after their experience as organic milk producers. Operations with a pasture-based feeding program were more likely to be organic, possibly because the land base enabled them to meet organic pasture requirements and pasture was more easily managed organically than fi eld crops. Results suggest that using pasture as a signifi cant source of dairy feed was one of the best predictors of being an organic dairy. Location in counties with a greater concentration of farms with milk cows included more organic production, potentially as a result of organic processors who chose to locate and recruit in areas with a large concentration of producers in order to reduce milk transportation and other transaction costs."}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Milk Production Costs", "text": "This section of the report examines the relationship between farm and operator characteristics and three levels of production costs-operating costs, operating and capital costs, and total economic costs (see Appendix A: Measuring Milk Production Costs). Older farm operators had higher costs than younger operators. Operating, operating and capital, and total economic costs all declined as farm size increased, consistent with economies of size. Costs declined as size increased, at a decreasing rate, as fi xed capital and labor costs were spread over more units of output. Signifi cant economies of size with respect to capital and labor were expected, but operating costs also declined with size, possibly due to greater feed effi ciency or lower prices paid for feed items on larger farms.\nFarm location infl uenced production costs as dairies in most other regions had lower costs than those in the Northeast. Technology use was also an important determinant of production costs. Farms using more technology had lower per unit capital and labor costs, possibly by increasing their Figure 15 Production practices, by type of producer productivity. Pasture-based feeding had a negative, but insignifi cant, effect on operating costs. Feed costs were lower for organic dairies that substituted pasture for other feed items, but lower production from pasture-fed cows offset the cost savings. Pasture-based feeding was associated with higher total economic costs due to higher labor requirements.\nAfter accounting for factors that infl uence production costs, operating costs for organic production were $4.78 per cwt higher, operating and capital costs were $5.65 per cwt higher, and total economic costs were $6.79 per cwt higher than for conventional production among all U.S. dairies (table  12) . Results were similar for dairies in the Northeast and Upper Midwest and among small farms (less than 150 cows). The estimated difference in production costs between pasture-based organic and pasture-based conventional farms, however, was much less than among all dairies ($2.87 per cwt for operating costs, $3.00 per cwt for operating and capital costs, and $3.57 per cwt for total economic costs). Therefore, it is not surprising that many pasture-based dairies use organic production."}, {"section_title": "Organic Transition Costs", "text": "The estimated cost differences indicate the additional costs incurred by operations producing organic milk relative to conventional operations but do not include the costs associated with the transition period. Data from the ARMS did not indicate the actual costs incurred during transition, so the estimated cost differences between organic and conventional milk production were approximated for the transition period. Before an operation is certifi ed to sell organic milk, pasture and cropland for dairy feed must be managed organically for a minimum of 36 months, and the dairy herd must be fed and managed organically during the last 12 months of that period. As a result, organic operations must undergo 3 years of higher costs before the higher organic milk prices are received. 16 Higher costs for 3 years are a necessary investment to return higher milk prices over the expected life of the operation. This initial investment is determined by the estimated additional costs incurred by organic operations over the 3-year transition period. During year 3, when both the land and dairy herd must be managed organically, the total additional costs were charged. During years 1 and 2, when only the land is managed organically, 50 percent of the additional costs were charged. This corresponds with about half of the feed cost on organic dairies from homegrown supplies, which would be managed organically during the full 3 years. The annualized cost of this investment was computed by spreading it over an expected operating life of 20 years.\nThe estimated transition costs and total additional costs on organic operations are shown in table 12. Transition costs were $0.72 per cwt for operating and capital costs and $0.86 per cwt for total economic costs. Thus, the total estimated additional costs among U.S. dairy farms for producing organic relative to conventional milk were estimated at $4.78 per cwt for operating costs, $6.37 per cwt for operating and capital costs, and $7.65 per cwt for total economic costs. Among pasture-based dairies, the cost differences were much lower at an estimated $2.87 per cwt for operating costs, $3.38 per cwt for operating and capital costs, and $4.02 per cwt for total economic costs (fi g. 16).\n16 Current NOP transition rules were used to estimate the transition costs even though many of the surveyed farms likely transitioned under the old rules. The current rules are used to refl ect the costs faced by conventional farms considering the transition to organic production.

Forty percent of producers reported that certifi cation paperwork and compliance cost were the most challenging (fi g. 17). Sourcing organic inputs, including grains and forages, feed supplements, and replacement heifers, was the most diffi cult aspect reported by 23 percent of organic producers. High costs of production and maintaining animal health were challenging aspects reported by 17 and 13 percent of producers, respectively.\nIn this section, the challenges of organic milk production are explored by examining how reported challenges to organic milk production varied across the sector. Producer reports were summarized by operation size, region, level of pasture use, and operator characteristics to see what factors may constrain the adoption and growth of organic milk production."}, {"section_title": "Farm Characteristics and Organic Production Challenges", "text": "The challenges reported for organic production varied little among dairy size groups, except for the largest dairies (table 13) . About a third of the largest organic dairies, those with 200 cows or more and an average size of nearly 500 cows (see table 1), reported sourcing inputs as the most diffi cult aspect, compared with 20-25 percent of smaller dairies. This indicates that sourcing organic inputs in volume may be diffi cult for some large organic producers and may be a factor constraining the size of organic operations. Smaller dairies reported certifi cation/compliance as the most diffi cult aspect, and the smallest dairies, those with fewer than 50 cows, were the least likely to report animal health and production costs as most challenging.\nOrganic milk production challenges were different in each region. The most diffi cult aspect for organic dairies in the Northeast was split between certifi cation/compliance and production costs at a third each. Dairies in the Northeast were the least likely to report sourcing inputs as most challenging, possibly because these small dairies often produce organic dairy feed or can buy it locally. Half of Upper Midwest dairies reported certifi cation/compliance, while half of organic dairies in the West indicated sourcing inputs as the most diffi cult aspect of organic milk production. The volume of organic inputs needed on large farms in the West may account for the level of concern with sourcing inputs. The most diffi cult aspect of organic milk production did not differ much among the pasture use groups, except for those using the most pasture. Dairies that relied on pasture for 75-100 percent of forage during the grazing months were less likely to report certifi cation/compliance as the most diffi cult aspect of organic production. Certifi cation/compliance may be less diffi cult for these dairies because the feeding program satisfi es the pasture requirement for organic certifi cation.

Forty percent of operators with a high school education, compared with only 22 percent of those with some college, reported certifi cation/compliance as the most diffi cult aspect.

Organic milk producers may have learned quickly to manage animal health as these concerns fell to 12 percent by year 2 and beyond.

The dataset is unique in that it includes a targeted sample of organic producers at a much higher rate than their occurrence in the population of all dairy farms. This targeted sample allows for an examination of the structure and costs associated with organic milk production and an analysis of differences between the conventional and organic sectors.\nOperation size was a primary determining factor for a dairy operation being organic. Small farms may view the organic approach as an alternative by which to reorganize current resources to improve farm returns and the odds of economic survival. Small-scale production may also be more conducive to sourcing organic inputs, which may be limited in some areas. Large dairies have more invested in production technologies that typically confi ne milk cows to large barns and limit access to pasture and are able to take advantage of economies of size. Thus, large farms may have less incentive to consider production alternatives. Further, large farms may have greater diffi cultly sourcing suffi cient quantities of organic inputs, and transitioning to organic production may require more adjustments due to pasture certifi cation requirements. Large organic dairies more often reported sourcing inputs and organic certifi cation/compliance requirements as the most challenging aspects of organic milk production.\nDairies were more likely to produce milk organically if they were located in the Northeast or Upper Midwest. These areas have a long history of small dairies and thus a successful infrastructure to provide inputs and manage output from several small operations. The largest U.S. organic milk cooperative pioneered organic milk production in the Northeast and Upper Midwest during the mid-1990s. Proximity to markets with highly affl uent consumers also made these regions attractive to organic milk operations. Access to pasture for dairy feed also had a strong infl uence on whether a dairy becomes organic. Operations using pasture-based feeding satisfy the pasture requirements for organic certifi cation, and organic pasture management is generally easier than organic crop management and less costly than purchasing organic dairy feed. Fewer small, pasture-based organic dairies were as concerned about certifi cation/compliance requirements as other organic dairies.\nResults from a statistical model comparing conventional and organic milk production costs indicated that average operating costs for organic dairies were $4.78 per cwt higher, and operating and capital costs were $5.65 per cwt higher after accounting for other factors that infl uence production costs.\nIncluding an estimate of the additional costs incurred during transition, average organic milk production costs were $4.78 and $6.37 per cwt higher, respectively. With an average price premium of $6.69 per cwt for organic milk, organic milk producers, on average, covered the additional operating and capital costs of organic production in 2005.\nMost organic dairies were small operations that used primarily unpaid operator and family labor. Returns above operating and capital costs on these small organic operations compared favorably with those of small conventional operations, suggesting that there may be economic incentives for some small existing dairies that have already committed much of the fi xed investment to consider the transition to organic milk production. Additional economic costs for organic production averaged nearly $1 per cwt more than the organic milk price premium in 2005. Thus, low returns to unpaid labor and management may limit startup organic dairies unless they can enter the industry at a much larger scale of production than the current norm.\nEven though most organic dairies were much smaller than conventional dairies, economic forces suggest that similar economies of size were available to organic producers. Some small organic dairies were earning enough to operate, but many were not able to cover the opportunity costs of investments in capital and the operator's time compared with larger operations. These economic conditions suggest that organic milk production may migrate toward larger operations, as has conventional production. This production shift will likely occur over an extended period as many existing small organic operations either choose to replace their capital assets with larger production units or exit the industry. In the short term, some small operators may continue producing organic milk as a lifestyle choice, despite generating returns that do not cover the opportunity cost of their time.\nOrganic milk farms able to use pasture resources for a signifi cant portion of dairy feed were very competitive with pasture-based conventional producers. Average operating costs for pasture-based organic milk production were estimated to be about $3 per cwt higher than those for pasture-based conventional production, and total economic costs for organic pasture-based milk production were about $4 per cwt higher than for pasture-based conventional production, signifi cantly less than the average organic milk price premium in 2005. Economic incentives appear to favor pasture-based dairies transitioning to organic production, and possibly startup organic dairies that can take advantage of pasture resources suitable for organic dairy feed.\nWhile the economics of pasture-based organic milk production compared favorably with that of pasture-based conventional production, pasture-based organic dairies had lower average milk production per cow and higher per unit costs than other organic dairies. This suggests that organic operations using conventional dairy feeding methods, such as confi ning cows and feeding harvested forages, are more likely to generate higher returns to capital and labor than those using pasture-based feeding. Thus, the technologies and production methods used on organic dairies may become more like those used on conventional dairies. Interpretation and implementation of revised organic pasture rules may shape the future structure of the organic industry. If pasture rules become more stringent, the challenges of certifi cation/compliance could have a major impact on the sizes and types of farms able to produce certifi ed organic milk.\nThis report attempts to shed light on the structure of organic milk production, factors affecting whether a dairy becomes organic, and the relative costs and returns of conventional and organic milk production. Based on these fi ndings, implications for the structure of organic milk production were developed. However, conclusions derived from the analysis were based on 2005 organic and conventional milk and feed price relationships and could change with adjustments in relative milk prices, markets for conventional and organic inputs, technological improvements in dairy farming, and new organic pasture regulations.\n1 These premiums refl ect the difference in the production costs of organic and conventional feed items, but may also refl ect additional transportation costs that could result from a scarcity of organic inputs in some areas. To the extent that these premiums refl ect the scarcity of organic inputs in some areas, the opportunity costs for using these homegrown inputs may be overstated.\n2 Using the opportunity cost approach to estimate homegrown dairy feed costs might bias the results against farms that produce feed because their feed production costs could be lower than assumed feed prices. This bias could be problematic because organic and pasture-based operations produce a relatively larger share of their feed than other operations. However, means estimated for whole-farm variable and fi xed costs per unit from the ARMS data are not signifi cantly different from per unit enterprise costs estimated with the opportunity cost approach. Enterprise costs for producing milk are useful in this report because they can be directly compared with milk prices."}]
