Depression in mothers is a common condition in the postnatal period 9, 10 and a documented correlate of a variety of poor developmental outcomes, including impairments in children's cognitive functioning. [11] [12] [13] [14] Preterm infants and their families may be more vulnerable to these associations. For example, evidence shows that mothers of preterm infants have a higher risk for psychological stress and depression than mothers of term born children, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and in turn, early exposure to maternal depressive symptoms appears to have a negative influence on preterm children's later cognitive function. 20 Less well studied are the bidirectional relationships among prematurity, fathers' postnatal depression, and children's early cognitive function. Like mothers, men undergo significant transitions during the periods of pregnancy and childbirth and there is indication that they too are at risk for depression during the postnatal 21, 22 and early childhood periods. 23 A small, but growing body of research also illustrates the connections between varied aspects of father involvement (e.g., active and regular engagement, warmth, participation in caregiving activities, and positive parental control) and enhanced cognitive development of their offspring, [24] [25] [26] with some evidence linking father involvement to better cognitive outcomes within the preterm population. 27 Preterm birth is an emotionally traumatizing event that could result in a stressful transition to parenthood and psychosocial stress related to loss of control 28 or fear about the infant's health, development or survival. 29, 30 These emotions likely affect fathers' mental health and well-being as well as mothers'; however both the extent to which fathers experience postnatal depressive symptoms after preterm birth and whether their depressive symptoms in turn impact children's early cognitive function are not well understood.\nOur aims were to assess depressive symptoms in mothers and fathers after preterm birth, and to identify the impacts of both prematurity and parental depressive symptoms on children's early cognitive function. We postulated that mothers and fathers of infants born preterm would have higher levels of depressive symptoms in the postnatal period than parents of term-born infants, and that these depressive symptoms would in turn be associated with lower cognitive functioning in children aged 24 months. In view of previous work, we further hypothesized that parental depressive symptoms would mediate the relation between children's preterm status and subsequent cognition, such that in the presence of parental postnatal depressive symptoms, children's preterm status would have a less adverse influence on their cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "Data were from the nationally-representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a longitudinal, population-based cohort of nearly 10,700 children born in 2001 and their parents. The ECLS-B selected a probability sample of the approximately four million children born in 2001, with oversampling of minority groups, twins and those born at low and very low birthweights, from births registered in the National Center for Health Statistics vital statistics system. 31 The sampling frame excluded births to mothers under 15 years of age and children who were adopted or deceased before the initial data collection wave. The ECLS-B initially sampled more than 14,000 births, and formed the final study cohort (consisting of completed 9 month interviews) of 10,700 when the children were aged approximately 9 months. The weighted response rate for the 24 month data collection wave was 93.1%. The ECLS-B data file provides analytic weights that adjust for disproportionate sampling, survey nonresponse and under-coverage; all analyses for this study were weighted and are representative of US children born in 2001. We obtained restricted data from the US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and report all unweighted sample sizes as rounded to the nearest 50 to comply with NCES guidelines. The Partners Human Research Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children considered this study exempt from review.\nData for this study are from the children's birth certificates and the first two waves of data collection, which occurred when children were approximately 9 and 24 months of age. During these waves, the ECLS-B collected data from the children through direct observation and from their biological mothers and resident and non-resident biological fathers through interviews and self-reported questionnaires. Non-resident biological fathers (e.g., those not currently residing the household with the child) were eligible to participate only if the mother consented to their involvement and reported that they had recent contact themselves or with the child.\nBecause of the nature of our research question, we limited our sample to only those children with complete data to assess mother and biological father depressive symptoms. Of the 10,700 completed maternal interviews, 9,450 had complete depressive symptom data available at 9 months. Of these, we included only those cases where biological mothers were living with the index child (n = 9,300). We further restricted the sample to include only those mothers with corresponding biological resident or biological non-resident father data, resulting in 6,300 cases. Finally, we excluded 200 cases with missing father depressive symptom data (for 150 resident and 50 non-resident fathers), 100 cases with missing birth certificate information, and 650 cases where the child did not complete the 24 month assessment, yielding a final sample size of 5,350. Mothers and fathers who did not provide biological father), age in years, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; non-Hispanic other race; or Hispanic). Household SES was defined by using a composite index generated by NCES that incorporated parental education, income, and occupation; 36 increasing scores reflect higher household SES (range \u22122.13, 2.18). BSF-R scores were not age normed, so we also measured the child's age at the 24-month assessment which for preterm children was recorded as their chronological age minus the number of weeks preterm."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Approach", "text": "All analyses were conducted using SAS v9.3 and applied appropriate weights to account for the complex sampling design. Study variables, overall and by preterm status, were summarized using descriptive statistics. We used t-tests and chi-squared tests to examine differences in mean continuous parental CESD scores and the dichotomized measure of parental depressive symptoms by child and family factors.\nA series of generalized estimating equation models with an independent correlation structure were then used to examine the extent to which preterm birth and mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms at 9 months were associated with children's cognitive function at 24 months, and whether the association between children's preterm status and 24-month cognitive function was mediated by parental depressive symptoms. CESD scores were treated as a continuous variable for these analyses. We also estimated the models using the dichotomized CESD measure, which yielded similar, but somewhat weaker results (data available upon request).\nThe first model tested the association between children's preterm status and their cognitive function at 24 months, controlling for child sex, plurality, postnatal hospitalization, the mother-father relationship, maternal age (continuous years), maternal race/ethnicity, household SES, and the child's age at the 24 month assessment. Preliminary analyses revealed that maternal race/ethnicity (r=0.67) and maternal age (r=0.74) were highly collinear with paternal race/ethnicity and paternal age, so we included only maternal factors in these analyses. The second model added both maternal and paternal 9 month CESD scores to test if the effect of preterm status on children's cognitive function was altered after accounting parental postnatal depressive symptoms (i.e., mediation). The relation between preterm status and cognitive function was determined to be mediated by parental depressive symptoms if the regression coefficient for preterm status was attenuated. We adjusted for parental CESD scores simultaneously, as including mothers' and fathers' CESD scores separately yielded similar results (data not shown).\nBeta estimates are reported as the mean difference (and 95% confidence interval) in children's cognitive function for each covariate. All models were weighted and accounted for any clustering of twins within families. resident biological fathers (8.3% of the sample). Slightly more than 1 in 10 children were born preterm; of which 1.5% were born very preterm and 8.9% were born moderate/late preterm.\nThe preterm sample was disproportionately comprised of multiples and infants whose parents were non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity and of lower SES. Post-neonatal hospitalizations were common among the preterm population, reported for 81.6% of children born very preterm and for 39.4% of children born moderate/late preterm, compared to 7.7% of term-born children (p<.0001).\nThe mean BSF-R score at 24 months among all children was 128.3 (SD=18.9). BSF-R scores were lower among children born very preterm (mean 119.9, SD=23.4) and moderate/ late preterm (mean 126.1, SD=18.3) than among term-born children (mean 128.6, SD=17.1; overall p-value <0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Parent Depressive Symptoms at 9 months", "text": "Among all parent respondents at child age 9 months, 14.3% of mothers and 11.9% of fathers reported HDS (Table 2 ). On the continuous CESD measure, mothers had a mean score of 4.5 (SD=7.2) and fathers had a mean score of 4.0 (SD=6.0). Mothers' and fathers' CESD scores showed a moderate positive correlation (Spearman r=0.24, p<.0001), with both parents reporting HDS in 2.7% of the households (data not shown). Fathers' rates of HDS were twice as high when mothers had HDS than when mothers did not have HDS (19.3% versus 9.4%, p<.0001); similarly, twice as many mothers reported HDS when fathers had HDS than when fathers did not have HDS (25.4% versus 12.9%, p<.0001).\nAmong both parents, the highest rates of HDS were observed among both mothers who identified a non-resident father (26.7%) and the non-resident fathers themselves (29.8%). In both mothers and fathers, higher mean CESD scores were reported when children were hospitalized after birth and among parents who were non-Hispanic black, younger, and of lower SES. Similar associations were noted for the dichotomized CESD measure ( Table 2 ), except that mothers, but not fathers, were more likely to report HDS if their child was a multiple (17.7%) versus singleton (14.2%, p=0.04), and fathers, but not mothers, were more likely to report HDS if their child was hospitalized after birth (15.0% versus 11.5%, p=0.04).\nFathers, but not mothers, also reported more depressive symptoms at 9 months if their child was born preterm (mean CESD score 5.1 [SD=11.3] among fathers of very preterm infants; mean CESD score 4.2 [SD=7.3] among fathers of moderate/late preterm infants; versus mean CESD score 3.9 [SD=6.8] among fathers of term infants, overall p-value=0.02); 21.1% of fathers of very preterm infants and 13.1% of fathers of moderate/late preterm infants reported HDS compared to 11.6% of fathers of term-born infants (overall pvalue=0.07). Sub-analyses revealed that within the preterm population (<37 weeks gestation) nearly 40% of non-resident biological fathers had HDS compared to roughly 8% of co-resident, married fathers (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Prematurity and Parent Depressive Symptoms on Cognitive Function", "text": "In Table 3 , Model 1 showed that being born very preterm was associated with lower cognitive function at 24 months (mean difference= \u22125.25; 95% CI: \u22128.05, \u22122.45), conditional on a host of child and family characteristics. Children who were male (mean difference=\u22123.84; 95% CI: \u22124.50, \u22123.18), multiple births (mean difference=\u22123.82; 95% CI: \u22125.10, \u22122.53), hospitalized after birth (mean difference=\u22121.53; 95% CI: \u22122.67, \u22120.39), lived with unmarried parents (mean difference=\u22121.14; 95% CI: \u22122.21, \u22120.07), and who were racial/ethnic minorities had lower cognitive function than their counterparts, while increasing levels of household SES predicted higher cognitive functioning (mean difference per unit increase of SES=3.17; 95% CI: 2.62, 3.73).\nModel 2 additionally included both mothers and fathers' depressive symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms at 9 months were not significantly associated with cognitive function at 24 months (mean difference=\u22120.06 per point increase in CESD score; 95% CI: \u22120.13, 0.02), but paternal CESD scores were inversely associated (mean difference per point increase in CESD score =\u22120.11; 95% CI: \u22120.18, \u22120.03; mean difference for HDS [data not shown] =\u22121.2; 95% CI: \u22122.23, \u22120.06). The addition of parental depressive scores did not attenuate the effect of prematurity, indicating no mediation. That is, both prematurity and fathers' depressive symptoms were independently associated with lower cognitive function in the fully adjusted model."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The findings from this national study confirm that depressive symptoms are present in new parents, 37, 38 with 14% of mothers and 12% of fathers endorsing clinically significant symptoms 9 months post-term. Although fathers reported lower levels of symptomology than mothers in the overall population, they had higher symptoms following preterm birth, with more than 1 in 5 reporting high depressive symptoms when their children were born before 32 weeks. In turn, children of fathers with higher depressive symptoms had lower cognitive function at age 24 months, even after adjustment for maternal depressive symptoms and children's biologic and social risk factors. These associations were not found for mothers.\nThe levels of depressive symptoms reported by fathers of preterm infants are consistent with studies indicating that the birth and care of a preterm infant is distressing for fathers. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] Qualitative evidence shows that fathers experience stress, fear, anger, insecurity, and anxiety following preterm birth 40, 42 and find it difficult to come to terms with the experience. 41 Fathers of preterm infants may experience more depressive symptoms related to the stressors and challenges associated with the transition to fatherhood (e.g., parental role attainment, competency, prioritizing the roles of partner, father and financial provider), which may be exacerbated in preterm birth. 44 The opportunity to extend these analyses to a cohort of non-resident fathers -a notable strength of this study -revealed a strikingly high rate (40%) of high depressive symptoms among non-resident fathers following preterm birth. Research shows that having a baby admitted to the NICU, a common occurrence with preterm birth, is a pivotal moment when fathers prioritize parenthood; 45 this experience may be doubly stressful for non-resident fathers who also face personal and societal expectations about fatherhood that emphasize direct child care and involvement with family life. 46 Non-resident fathers may also be less able to forge physical and emotional relationships with their infants. Regardless of the mechanism, these results indicate that both non-resident and resident fathers of preterm infants may be vulnerable to depressive symptoms and could thus be in need of intervention.\nIn contrast to fathers, mothers of preterm infants did not have elevated postnatal depressive symptoms as compared to mothers of term-born infants. It is possible that their depressive symptoms resolved prior to the 9 month data collection wave. While several studies document high rates of maternal depressive symptomology and psychological distress immediately following preterm birth, 17, 19, 43, 47 longitudinal analyses confirm that symptoms decrease over time 16, 17, 29, 48, 49 with few differences from mothers of term-born infants observed by 8 and 12 months. 19 The availability of postpartum depression screening and referral could play a role. Maternal depression screening is commonly conducted at postpartum visits by pediatricians and treatment may have been recommended long before the CESD was administered at 9 months. Fathers, on the other hand, are rarely the target of postpartum depression referral efforts, which may have contributed to the differences between maternal and paternal depressive symptomology we found here. Fathers also report putting their own needs aside to be supportive of their partners and to provide for their children, 50 as well as difficulties finding counseling support; 45 they might also lack social resources that are known to positively impact maternal depression trajectories. 16 The ECLS-B does not have data to explicitly examine these hypotheses.\nWe also sought to identify the impacts of both prematurity and postnatal parental depressive symptoms on children's early cognitive function. Not surprisingly, 24-month old children born preterm had worse cognitive function that their term born peers, even after accounting for a wide-range of child and family characteristics. Although we anticipated that mothers' and fathers' postnatal depressive symptoms would each mediate the association between children's preterm status and their later cognitive function, we found no evidence of this. Rather, our findings highlight the importance of understanding the contributions of both prematurity and postnatal paternal depressive symptoms to children's cognitive function.\nMany studies suggest that children of mothers who suffer from postpartum depression have worse cognitive function than children of non-depressed mothers, but we found a null effect. However previous associations have been mostly observed in high-risk samples where postnatal depression is accompanied by other family and social problems, suggesting that social risk factors are more influential to children's developmental outcomes than maternal depression per se. For example, Kurstjens and Wolke reported long-term effects of maternal postnatal depression on children's cognitive outcomes only among low SES boys whose mothers were chronically depressed. 51 McManus and Poehlmann found that maternal postnatal depression at 4 months predicted lower cognitive function at 16 months among a sample of preterm infants from Wisconsin, but only for infants whose mothers reported low levels of perceived social support. 20 Tse et al similarly found that the association between maternal depressive symptoms (measured prenatally) and children's cognitive function was largely explained by family sociodemographic characteristics, 52 providing further evidence for this interpretation. We accounted for several social risk factors in our multivariable model. Another possibility is that the effect of maternal depression on children's cognitive function is more strongly influenced by the chronicity, rather than the timing, of symptoms. 11, 51 The CESD was not administered prenatally or during the 24 month data collection wave so we could not account for any timing-or pattern-specific effects. Future longitudinal research should focus on the variable course of maternal depressive symptoms (e.g., timing, chronicity, and severity) to determine their differential consequences for children's cognitive function.\nPaternal postnatal depressive symptoms, on the other hand, were more strongly associated with children's subsequent cognitive function than maternal depressive symptoms, further suggesting that the pathways by which postnatal depression influences children's development may differ between mothers and fathers. 53 Although effects were small, the impact of paternal HDS to children's cognitive function was similar in magnitude to having unmarried parents, often viewed as a significant risk factor for children's development. The relation of postnatal depressive symptoms in fathers to children's cognitive function is not entirely understood, but several mechanisms are possible. First, depressive symptoms might have a direct impact on how fathers interact with their children. Depressive symptoms including low mood, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness likely interfere with the ability to provide responsive parenting, which may contribute to lower cognitive function. Studies report that depressed fathers of young children are less likely to engage with their children, 38 are more likely to use aggressive or harsh discipline, 54 and participate in less parent-to-child reading 37 than non-depressed fathers. In turn, markers of father involvement (e.g., reading and play) have been associated with young children's cognitive outcomes, both within the general population 37 and among those born preterm. 27 Indirect pathways are also plausible, for example if depression in fathers leads to marital conflict or compromises maternal affect or involvement. 53 Further, while this study focused on the effects of parental depression on child cognitive skills in children born preterm, future studies should examine the reciprocal or transactional relations between these dyads. 55 Studies into bidirectional relations have historically focused on maternal depression and child behavior, 56,57 but over time, paternal depression may also be influenced by their child's health and cognitive capabilities. It is also important to note that paternal depressive symptoms, while significant, were far less influential to children's cognitive function than their preterm status and certain aspects of their social environment. Efforts to improve children's cognitive function should thus continue to focus on these factors in addition to fathers' postnatal well-being.\nOur study has several strengths. We report data from a large, national sample using longitudinal data that are ideal for examining life course transitions for children and their families. In addition to providing a large cohort of children born preterm, the ECLS-B contains widely-used, well-validated measures of depressive symptoms and child development, and also has the advantage of being among the few national data sets available to address research questions regarding fathers. 58 We also acknowledge the following limitations. The CESD items do not parallel diagnostic criteria used to identify depression in a clinical setting, nor do they quantify the duration or frequency of depressive episodes or whether or not depressed parents received treatment. The initial data collection wave, at 9 months, likely missed cases of depression that resolved in the early postnatal period; we did not have data to ascertain whether depressive symptoms were present before or during pregnancy, which may have biased our findings, particularly if prenatal depressive symptoms have a causal relationship with postnatal depressive symptoms 10 or children's cognitive function. 59 Children's early health problems (e.g., those present before 9 months of age) could have increased the risk of depression in their parents and also played a role in their later cognitive function. However, we accounted for children's postnatal hospitalizations, a proxy for early health and developmental difficulties, which may have minimized this bias. As a sensitivity analyses, we also reran our analyses adjusting for congenital abnormalities, yielding nearly identical results. Birth certificate data are not as precise as medical record data. 60 Finally, the ECLS-B study design called for the child's biological mother to be the respondent for the parent instruments whenever possible; more research is needed to explicitly target fathers who are the primary caregivers of their children.\nClinically, our findings underscore the need to identify and manage postnatal depressive symptoms in both parents, and especially for non-resident fathers and fathers of infants born preterm who may be experiencing clinical levels of depressive symptoms beyond the initial phase following their child's birth. While there has been considerable attention paid to the identification and treatment of postnatal maternal depression, [61] [62] [63] little is known about the frequency of efforts to address depression or other health problems among new fathers. However early identification and referral seem justified, particularly in light of our findings that postnatal paternal depressive symptoms may be one factor that delays children's cognitive development.\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the relations among preterm birth, parental postnatal depressive symptoms, and cognitive function using a national cohort of US families that includes data for preterm infants and their resident and non-resident biological fathers. This study builds upon existing research demonstrating negative impacts of fathers' depressive symptoms on children's developmental outcomes [24] [25] [26] by offering new findings with respect to depression in fathers of preterm children, as well as among non-resident fathers. Our findings support early identification and treatment of fathers of preterm infants with depressive symptoms. Notes. Weighted estimates.
