Education for sustainable development ensures the knowledge, skills, and values required to surpass the various ecological and social issues. In addition, education and training have a fundamental function towards fulfilling many challenges Europe and its citizens are facing, such as socio-economic, demographic, environmental, and technological (Notices from European Union Institutions and Bodies, 2009). Therefore, enhancing and recognizing the people' qualifications is essential towards their individual and occupational development, as well as for competitiveness, employment, and social cohesion in Europe (Recommendations European Parliament and Council, 2009) . However, by taking into consideration the existing discrepancies as regards the structure and the content of the educational programs, there is emphasized an obvious difficulty as regards the comparison of education systems. Therefore, in order to employ a fair step towards understanding and interpretation of the inputs, processes, and the results of education systems from a global perspective, we underline the fact that their consistency is fundamental. In fact, by employing the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) there is ensured an international comparability in order to reflect the development of education systems worldwide. Therewith, the Bologna process named after the Bologna Declaration of 19 June 1999 shows as primary aim the establishment and promotion of the European system of higher education through the adoption of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees, which will promote the employability of the European citizens, alongside the international competitiveness of the European higher education system; the adoption of a system essentially based on two main cycles (undergraduate and graduate), the first cycle being oriented to the European labour market, lasting a minimum of three years, whereas the access to the second cycle shall require the successful completion of the first cycle studies, leading to the master and/or doctorate degree as in many European countries; the establishment of a system of credits, respectively the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) in order to promote the most widespread student mobility; the promotion of mobility for students, meaning the access to study and training opportunities, as well related services, also for teachers, researchers, and administrative staff, being acknowledged and valorized the periods spent within the European context of researching, teaching, and training, without prejudicing their statutory rights; the promotion of the European co-operation towards quality assurance for developing comparable criteria and methodologies; the promotion of the necessary European dimensions in higher education, especially as respects curricular development, interinstitutional co-operation, mobility schemes, and integrated programmes of study, training, and research. ISCED was initially developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the 1970s, subsequently being first revised in 1997. It belongs to the United Nations International Family of Economic and Social Classifications which are applied in statistics worldwide in order to gather, compile, and examine the cross-nationally comparable data. According to ISCED, the education programmes are classified based on their content being used two main crossclassification variables, respectively the levels of education and the fields of education. PISA was launched in 1997 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with the aim of developing relevant, regular, and reliable policies towards 15-year-old students' results. PISA represents an international standardized assessment programme, being the most extensive world survey that aims to evaluate the education systems worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students in several key subjects needed in adult life such as reading, mathematics, and science. Thus, a higher score highlights a significant literacy, consequently that particular education system being more efficient. PISA was first performed in 2000, being repeated every three years. So far, there are five employed appraisals in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012 . In PISA 2000 the main focus was on reading literacy, meaning general reading skills and literacy, essential within an information society. In PISA 2003, the emphasis was on mathematical literacy, being also introduced an additional domain on problem solving. In PISA 2006, the main subject was science. In PISA 2009, reading literacy was the major domain, whilst the main focus of PISA 2012 was mathematics and problem solving. For the first time, PISA 2012 also included an assessment of the financial literacy of young people. In PISA 2012 participated all 34 OECD member countries and 31 partner countries and economies, representing more than 80% of the world economy (European Commission, 2013a) . The PISA 2012 survey highlights the fact that the socio-economic status of students registered a significant influence on their performance in school. In fact, there was pointed out a higher likelihood of low students' performance at reading, mathematics, and science related to students coming from low-income households. Furthermore, there were emphasized the negative effects of immigrant background on performance, the significance of attending pre-primary education, likewise the difference existing between boys and girls towards reading. In PISA 2012, Shanghai-China and Singapore were the top performers at mathematics (OECD, 2013) . Consequently, Shanghai-China recorded an equivalent of nearly three years of schooling, above the OECD average. In addition, Hong Kong-China, Chinese Taipei, Korea, Macao-China, Japan, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and The Netherlands, in descending order of their scores, rounded out the top ten performers in mathematics. However, ten European Union (EU) Member States (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Croatia, Latvia, Austria, Poland, and Romania) have achieved since 2009 meaningful progress in diminishing their share of low achievers across all three basic skills. Unfortunately, five EU Member States (Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden) registered an increase in the number of low achievers. Overall, the performance registered in the EU was slightly better than the United States, but both lag behind Japan. Besides, we ascertain the benchmark 2020 according to which by 2020, the share of 15-year-olds with a low achievement in reading, mathematics, and science should be less than 15%. This paper aims at developing an aggregated indicator towards assesing the education systems from 26 European countries, respectively their classification based on ten specific selected indicators. The novelty of current research is underlined by the application of multidimensional data analysis techniques, as well as unsupervised classification techniques in order to appraise and rank the European education systems. The utility of this empirical study is depicted by the fact that it provides to the governmental authorities a comprehensive collection of information as regards the education systems within a single measure, based on which being established the ranking of a certain state from the education point of view. Adams (1993) stated that the terms efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and quality have often been used synonymously. According to the United Nations Children's Fund -UNICEF (2000), quality education includes the following constituents: learners who are healthy, well-nourished, and ready to participate and learn, being encouraged in learning by their families and communities; healthy, safe, protective, and gender-sensitive environments which provide adequate resources and facilities; the content that is considered based on relevant curricula and materials for gathering of basic skills, mainly in the areas of literacy, numeracy, and skills for life, and knowledge in such areas as gender, health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS prevention and peace; the processes through which trained teachers use child-centred teaching approaches in well-managed classrooms and schools, alongside ingenious valuation to ease learning and mitigate disparities; the outcomes that comprise knowledge, skills, and attitudes, being tied to national goals for education and positive participation in society. The quality education could be reflected through the performance related to students or graduates. Moreover, the value added by school could be measured through labour market performance such as extra income or by employing qualified employees. However, Psacharopoulos and Woodhall (1985) noticed that labour market performance depends on external circumstances rather than school exclusively. Part of the studies (Boissiere et al., 1985; Bishop, 1989 Bishop, , 1992 Moll, 1998) identified the fact that the cognitive ability tests are a good predictor of future students' income. Thereby, Hanushek and Kimko (2000) identified a positive relationship between the test scores and real gross domestic product per capita. Lee and Barro (2001) found that family inputs and school resources are related to school outcomes, proxied by internationally comparable test scores, repetition rates, and dropout rates. Family characteristics, such as income and education of parents, have strong relations with student performance. Therewith, supplementary school resources, particularly smaller class sizes, but probably also higher teacher salaries and greater school length, enhance educational outcomes. Eide et. al (2002) ascertained differential effects of school resources on earnings, but without controlling for individual and family background characteristics. Subsequently, after controlling for a set of demographic variables, much of the impact of school resources on earnings declined. There are studies (Card and Krueger, 1992; Betts, 1995; Grogger, 1996; Eide and Showalter, 2005) which researched if the improvement of the quality related to secondary education, measured through the growth of expenditures per pupil or through the reduction of the class size, cause the increase of subsequent earnings. Card and Krueger (1992) studied the effects of school quality, proxied by pupil-teacher ratio, average term length, and relative teacher pay, on the rate of return to education for men born between 1920 and 1949. There was found that men who were trained in states with higher-quality schools have a higher return to additional years of training. Likewise, the rates of return were also higher for the persons out of the states with better-educated teachers and with a higher fraction of female teachers. Contrariwise, by holding constant the measures of school quality, Card and Krueger (1992) ascertained no evidence that parental income or education affects average state-level rates of return. According to Betts (1995) , the earnings of white male workers depend significantly on which high school they have attended. Furthermore, there was not identified any relationship between adult wages and class size, teachers' salaries, and teachers' level of education. Grogger (1996) revealed that a 10% increase in school spending would increase students' adult wages by only 0.68%. Eide and Showalter (2005) concluded that larger secondary schools and schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios tend to reduce the likelihood of being unemployed for noncollege-bound men in the period shortly after secondary school graduation. Besides, the results provided support for a lack of any effect related to secondary school quality on unemployment probabilities approximately a decade after secondary school completion. Furthermore, we emphasize another research direction towards the efficiency of tertiary education within Europe: United Kingdom (Glass et al., 1995; Johnes and Johnes, 1995; Izadi, 2002; Flegg et al., 2004; Johnes, 2006 a, b) , Italy (Ferrari and Laureti, 2005; Agasisti and Dal Bianco, 2006; Bonaccorsi et al., 2006; Agasisti and Salerno, 2007; Abramo et al., 2008; Agasisti and Johnes, 2009 ), Austria (Leitner et al., 2007) , Germany (Warning, 2004; Fandel, 2007; Kempkes and Pohl, 2010) , Poland (Wolszczak-Derlacz and Parteka, 2011), Finland (R\u00e4ty, 2002) . However, only a part of studies investigated the efficiency of higher education institutions out of more European states: Bonaccorsi et al. (2007a) included the universities from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Switzerland, and United Kingdom; Bonaccorsi et al. (2007b) (2014) provided evidence that East Asian nations continue to outperform others, while Scandinavia showed mixed results; the outcome of PISA indicate the value of engaging all of society in education; better adult retention of skills depends on how often, and the environment within which, they are used; lifelong learning supports slow age-related skill decrease especially for those who are highly skilled already; before focusing on 21st century skills, developing countries must teach basic skills in a more effective way. The Global Index of Cognitive Skills and Educational Attainment compares the performance of 39 countries and one region (Hong Kong, being used as a proxy for China due to the lack of test results at a national level). In the latest edition (2014) of the Global Index of Cognitive Skills and Educational Attainment, South Korea tops the rankings, followed by Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Finland, United Kingdom, Canada, The Netherlands, Ireland, and Poland. The index comprises two categories, respectively cognitive skill (the latest test results from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, PIRLS; the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS; the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA; the initial output from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, PIAAC) and educational attainment (the latest literacy rate and graduation rates at the upper secondary and tertiary level)."}, {"section_title": "Review of Previous Research", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Structure of the European Education Systems", "text": "ISCED 2011 comprises the formal and non-formal education programmes provided at any stage of a person's life. Formal education represents the education that is institutionalised, intentional, and planned through public organisations and recognised private bodies. The qualifications of formal education are recognised, being within the scope of ISCED. In the case of non-formal education is emphasized the alternative and/or complement to formal education within the process of lifelong learning of people. Informal learning does not fall within the scope of ISCED for measuring participation in education, being defined as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but are not institutionalised. Likewise, ISCED excludes incidental or random learning, respectivley various forms of learning that are not organized or that entail communication not planned to cause learning. The ISCED level describes the degree of complexity and specialisation as regards the content of an education programme, from fundamental to complex. ISCED level 0 refers to early childhood programmes having an intentional education component, following to enhance socio-emotional skills required for participation in school and society. The programmes at ISCED level 1 or primary education aims at providing students fundamental skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, respectively the formation of a solid ground for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge, personal, and social development, also training for lower secondary education. The programmes at ISCED level 2 or lower secondary education are designed to build on the learning outcomes from ISCED level 1, their purpose consisting in setting the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon which education systems may then widen further educational opportunities. The programmes at ISCED level 3 or upper secondary education aims at completing secondary education in preparation for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment or both. The programmes at ISCED level 4 or post-secondary non-tertiary education are set to provide persons who finished ISCED level 3 with nontertiary qualifications required for admission to tertiary education or for employment when their ISCED level 3 qualification does not grant such access. The programmes at ISCED level 5 or short-cycle tertiary education are set to provide members with professional knowledge, skills, and competencies, being practically-based, occupationally-specific, and preparing students to enter the labour market. The programmes at ISCED level 6 or Bachelor's are designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills, and competencies, guiding to a first degree or equivalent qualification. The programmes at ISCED level 7 or Master's are set to provide members with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills, and competencies, conducting to a second degree or equivalent qualification. The programmes at ISCED level 8 or doctoral are set primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Figure 1 shows the main models of primary and lower secondary education (ISCED 1-2) in Europe, 2013/14. Therefore, we acknowledge a single structure education, the education being provided uninterrupted from the beginning to the end of compulsory schooling, with no transition between primary and lower secondary education, the general education being provided in common for all pupils. Furthermore, we identify the common core curriculum provision within which after successful completion of primary education (ISCED 1), all students advance to the lower secondary level (ISCED 2) where they follow the same general common core curriculum. Not ultimately, we ascertain the differentiated lower secondary education characterized by the fact that after the primary education was successful completed, either at the beginning or during lower secondary education, the students are required to follow distinct educational paths or specific types of schooling. . Table 1 provides the structure of pre-higher education systems in Europe. According to data out of Table 1 , we distinguish that Belgium -Flemish, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia register the most components (seven or eight components) as regards the European pre-higher education system, whereas Sweden, Spain, Finland, and Iceland underscore a reduced number of components (two or three components). Thereby, the data from Table 2 supports the fact that Latvia register the highest length of compulsory education (14 years), whereas Greece and Austria record the lowest length of compulsory education (9 years). By considering the age of entry within compulsory education, we ascertain the age of six years within the majority of European states."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Research Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample selection and variables' description", "text": "The empirical research will be employed for a sample which comprises 26 European states, the data corresponding for the last available year from Eurostat, namely 2012: Belgium (BE), Bulgaria (BG), Czech Republic (CZ), Germany (DE), Estonia (EE), Ireland (IE), Greece (GR), Spain (ES), France (FR), Croatia (HR), Italy (IT), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxemburg (LU), Hungary (HU), The Netherlands (NL), Austria (AT), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Romania (RO), Slovenia (SI), Slovak Republic (SK), Finland (FI), Sweden (SE), Iceland (IS), and Norway (NO). Table 3 shows the description of each variable employed within empirical research. The percentage of all 18-year-olds who are still in any kind of school, being covered all ISCED levels.

We decided to employ PCA as multidimensional data analysis technique since it ensures the decomposition expressed through a reduced number of components (Han and Kamber, 2006) and not redundant of the total variability out of the initial causal space (Jolliffe, 2002) . The purpose of PCA consist in fixing new variables entitled principal components expressed through linear combinations of the original variables so as the newly formed variables are characterized by maximum variability. The initial causal space subject to current empirical investigation comprises ten explanatory variables, v , v , \u2026, v , v , thereby signifying the fact that each of the 26 selected European country is characterized by ten indicators. The principal components which corresponds to the investigated causal space are described as a vector with ten dimmensions, labeled with w:\nThus, every coordinate w of the aforementioned vector represents a principal component described in relation with the original variables through the following linear combination:\nThe coefficients \u03b1 ( ) are the coordinates of the eigenvectors which correspond to the correlation matrix related to the original variables v , v , \u2026, v , v , whereas the variances of the principal components are the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix.\nThere is aimed to solve the following extreme problem, the optimum criterion being maximum or minimum, depending on the type of function \u03a6:\nPublished by ECSDEV, Via dei Fiori, 34, 00172, Rome, Italy http://ecsdev.org\nWe will consider the fact that the vectors \u03b1 ( ) are the colums of the matrix A of dimmension 10\u00d710, having the following form:\nWithal, we will suppose the fact that v is the vector whose coordinates are the original variables v , v , \u2026, v , v , whilst w is the vector whose coordinates are the principal components w , w , \u2026, w , w . Therefore, the linear combinations that define the principal components could be described as follows:\nFurthermore, in order to classify the European countries according to the developed indicator we will employ the cluster analysis. There will be employed the previously mentioned unsupervised classification technique since its purpose is to search and identify within the research data certain groups based on the similarities and dissimilarities between the objects which refer to the employed data. The cluster represents a distinct informational entity with clear significance, which comprises all the objects whose characteristics are identical or differs barely, but are significantly different towards the characteristics related to the objects from other classes or groups. Within current empirical research we will employ the Ward's method (Ward, 1963) as hierarchical aggregate classification method. According to Ward's method, in each stage of the classification there will be merged those two clusters for which the sum of the squared deviations for the cluster emerged upon aggregation is the lowest in comparison with other pairs of clusters. In fact, the Ward's method measures the distance between two clusters as the total sum of the squared deviations existing for the cluster configuration resulted upon merging those two clusters for which is assessed the distance (Zaki and Meira Jr., 2014) . The sum of squared deviations is defined as following, where y depicts the object j from cluster i, whereas n signifies the number of objects from cluster i:\nBesides, there will be covered the following stages in order to render the tree diagram. Initially, there is considered a number of clusters equal with the number of countries, respectively 26 clusters. However, every cluster comprises a single object:\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors. Journal Compilation \u00a9 2017 European Center of Sustainable Development.\nSubsequently, during several stages, the initial clusters are gradually aggregated in order to gather classes increasingly complex. Therefore, in each stage, labeled with t, there are aggregated only two clusters, respectively those clusters for which the aggregation distance is minimum in comparison with the distances between any two clusters existing in that stage. The aggregation distance could be defined as follows:\nTherefore, in the last stage of the aggregation, all the objects are covered within a single cluster: Table 4 shows the correlation matrix related to the original variables. At baseline, the data was standardized. Thus, we notice the fact that there is a high correlation coefficient (0.8806) between the total number of persons who are enrolled in the regular education system in each country (v 3 ) and the incoming students and outgoing students for each country (v 5 ). Notes: Description of the variables is provided in Table 3 . Table 5 provides the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, the principal components being descending sorted based on the information retained, as percentage out of the total variance. Likewise, there is disclosed the percentage from the initial information of each variable amongst the ten selected variables that is synthesized in the extracted principal components. Therefore, the first principal component explains 27.55% out of the total variance, the second principal component explains 20.60% out of the total variance, the third principal component explains 15.65% out of the total variance, whereas the fourth principal component explains 10.34% out of the total variance."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Research Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Correlation investigation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Principal component analysis (PCA) results", "text": "Published by ECSDEV, Via dei Fiori, 34, 00172, Rome, Italy http://ecsdev.org Figure 2 shows graphically the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix as proposed by Cattell (1966) . Thereby, there is shown that after the fourth point from the graph that signifies the fourth principal component, the slope is decreasing. According to Kaiser (1960) criterion, there are retained only those principal components that corresponds to the eigenvalues greater than unit. Based on the Cattell (1966) graph and Kaiser (1960) criterion, there will be withheld four principal components.
