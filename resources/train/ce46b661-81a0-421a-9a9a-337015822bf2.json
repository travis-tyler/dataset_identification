This is accomplished through two avenues as directed by the MagnusonStevens Act, the first being through direct regulation of fisheries to protect habitat from the direct or indirect impacts of fishing. With the implementation of the Coral Fishery Management Plan and subsequent amendments to that plan, the Council has protected coral, coral reefs, and live/hard bottom habitat in the south Atlantic region by establishing an optimum yield of zero and prohibiting all harvest or possession of these resources which serve as essential fish habitat to many managed species. Another measure adopted by the Council and implemented through the coral plan was the designation of the Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern, a unique and fragile deepwater coral habitat off southeast Florida that is protected from all bottom tending fishing gear damage. The Council has also prohibited the use of the following gears in the snapper grouper fishery management plan to protect habitat: bottom longlines in the EEZ inside of 50 fathoms or anywhere south of St. Lucie Inlet Florida, fish traps, bottom tending (roller-rig) trawls on live bottom habitat, and entanglement gear. Also established under the snapper grouper plan is an Experimental Closed Area (experimental marine reserve) where the harvest or possession of all species in the snapper grouper complex is prohibited. Other actions taken by the Council that directly or indirectly protect habitat or ecosystem integrity include: the prohibition of rock shrimp trawling in a designated area around the Oculina Bank, mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices in the penaeid shrimp fishery, a prohibition of the use of drift gill nets in the coastal migratory pelagic fishery; and a mechanism that provides for the concurrent closure of the EEZ to penaeid shrimping if environmental conditions in state waters are such that the overwintering spawning stock is severely depleted.\nIn addition to implementing regulations to protect habitat from fishing related degradation, the Council actively comments on non-fishing projects or policies that may impact fish habitat. In response to an earlier amendment to the Magnuson Act, the Council adopted a habitat policy and procedure document that established a four state Habitat Advisory Panel and adopted a comment and policy development process. Members of the Habitat Advisory Panel serve as the Councils' habitat contacts and professionals in the field. The Advisory Panel is structured and functions differently than other panels. The Panel is made up of four state sub-panels each having representatives from the state marine fisheries agency, the U S Fish and Wildlife Service, state coastal zone management agency, conservationist, commercial fishermen, and recreational fishermen. In addition to the state representatives, at large members on the overall panel include representatives from EPA Region IV, NMFS Southeast Fisheries Center, NMFS SERO, Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, and NMFS Habitat Conservation Division Headquarters. This body functions as a whole or as sub-panel depending on the scope of the issue. The Panel serves to provide the Council with both expert recommendations on activities being considered for permitting as well as guidance in development of Habitat policy statements. With guidance from the Panel, the Council, has developed and approved policies on; oil and gas exploration, development and transportation; dredging and dredge material disposal; submerged aquatic vegetation, and ocean dumping. These are included in Section 5 of this document under recommendations to protect EFH.\n1.2 Habitat Responsibilities as Defined in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996\nThe Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 USC 1801 et seq. Public Law 104-208 reflects the Secretary of Commerce and Fishery Management Council authority and responsibilities for the protection of essential fishery habitat. Section 305 (b) Fish Habitat,\n1\n\n\f1.0 Purpose and Need\nindicates the Secretary (through NMFS) shall, within 6 months of the date of enactment of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, establish by regulation guidelines to assist the Councils in the description and identification of essential fish habitat in fishery management plans (including adverse impacts on such habitat) and in the consideration of actions to ensure the conservation and enhancement of such habitat. In addition, the Secretary (through NMFS) shall: set forth a schedule for the amendment of fishery management plans to include the identification of essential fish habitat and for the review and updating of such identifications based on new scientific evidence or other relevant information; in consultation with participants in the fishery, shall provide each Council with recommendations and information regarding each fishery under that Council's authority to assist it in the identification of essential fish habitat, the adverse impacts on that habitat, and the actions that should be considered to ensure the conservation and enhancement of that habitat; review programs administered by the Department of Commerce and ensure that any relevant programs further the conservation and enhancement of essential fish habitat; and the Secretary shall coordinate with and provide information to other Federal agencies to further the conservation and enhancement of essential fish habitat.\nThe Act specifies that each Federal agency shall consult with the Secretary with respect to any action authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken, by such agency that may adversely affect any essential fish habitat identified under this Act. Additional provisions specify that each Council: may comment on and make recommendations to the Secretary and any Federal or State agency concerning any activity authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken, by any Federal or State agency that, in the view of the Council, may affect the habitat, including essential fish habitat, of a fishery resource under its authority; and shall comment on and make recommendations to the Secretary and any Federal or State agency concerning any such activity that, in the view of the Council, is likely to substantially affect the habitat, including essential fish habitat, of an anadromous fishery resource under its authority.\nAdditional terms in the Act specify provisions for commenting on activities impacting essential fish habitat. If the Secretary receives information from a Council or Federal or State agency or determines from other sources that an action authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken, by any State or Federal agency would adversely affect any essential fish habitat identified under this Act, the Secretary shall recommend to such agency measures that can be taken by such agency to conserve such habitat. Within 30 days after receiving a recommendation, a Federal agency shall provide a detailed response in writing to any Council commenting and the Secretary regarding the matter. The response shall include a description of measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, mitigating, or offsetting the impact of the activity on such habitat. In the case of a response that is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Secretary, the Federal agency shall explain its reasons for not following the recommendations.\nOn December 19, 1997, an interim final rule was published in the Federal Register to implement the essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). This rule establishes guidelines to assist the Regional Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in the description and identification of EFH in fishery management plans (FMPs), including identification of adverse impacts from both fishing and non-fishing activities on EFH, and identification of actions required to conserve and enhance EFH. The regulations also detail procedures the Secretary (acting through NMFS), other Federal agencies, state agencies, and the Councils will use to coordinate, consult, or provide recommendations on Federal and state\n2\n\n\f1.0 Purpose and Need\nactivities that may adversely affect EFH. The intended effect of the rule is to promote the protection, conservation, and enhancement of EFH.\nEssential fish habitat is defined in the Act as \"those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.\" The definition for EFH may include habitat for an individual species or an assemblage of species, whichever is appropriate within each FMP.\nFor the purpose of interpreting the definition of essential fish habitat: \"waters\" includes aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties that are utilized by fish. When appropriate this may include areas used historically. Water quality, including but not limited to nutrient levels, oxygen concentration and turbidity levels is also considered to be a component of this definition. Examples of \"waters\" that may be considered EFH, include open waters, wetlands, estuarine habitats, riverine habitats, and wetlands hydologically connected to productive water bodies.\n\"Necessary\" , relative to the definition of essential fish habitat, means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and a healthy ecosystem. While \"spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity\" covers a species full life cycle.\nIn the context of this definition the term \"substrate\" includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and associated biological communities. These communities could encompass mangroves, tidal marshes, mussel beds, cobble with attached fauna, mud and clay burrows, coral reefs and submerged aquatic vegetation. Migratory routes such as rivers and passes serving as passageways to and from anadromous fish spawning grounds should also be considered EFH. Included in the interpretation of \"substrate\" are artificial reefs and shipwrecks (if providing EFH), and partially or entirely submerged structures such as jetties.\nThis plan presents the habitat requirements (by life stage where information exists) for species managed by the Council. Available information on environmental and habitat variables that control or limit distribution, abundance, reproduction, growth, survival, and productivity of the managed species is included.\nThe Council, in working with our Habitat and Coral Advisory Panels and through a series of workshops identified available environmental and fisheries data sources relevant to the managed species that would be useful in describing and identifying EFH. In addition, the EFH workshop process tapped in on habitat experts, at the State, Federal, and regional level, to participate in the description, and identification of EFH in the South Atlantic region. This process allowed the experts in the field to identify major species-specific habitat data gaps, deficits in data availability (i.e., accessibility and application of the data) and in data quality (including considerations of scale and resolution; relevance; and potential biases in collection and interpretation).\nInformation was compiled where it existed on: current and historic stock size, the geographic range of the managed species, the habitat requirements by life history stage, and the distribution and characteristics of those habitats; the temporal and spatial distribution of each major life history stage: the distribution, density, growth, mortality, and production; collected from all sources of quality information.\nAccording to NMFS guidelines the councils should analyze information within the constraints of the of the available data when describing and identifying essential fish habitat. There are four levels of information. Level one is based on presence / absence distribution data, which is available for some or all portions of the geographic range of a species. At this level this is the only data available to describe the distribution of a species in relation to it's potential habitats. At level 2 data is available for habitat-related densities of species. Level 3 data provides\n3\n\n\f1.0 Purpose and Need\ngrowth, reproduction or survival rates within habitats, and level 4 information provides data on production rates by habitat.\nThe goal is to obtain the highest level of information. This information would relate the production rates or life history stages of a species to habitat requirements (including, type, quality, quantity and location). It would also track essential habitats necessary to maintain fish production which would be consistent with a sustainable fishery and in addition would demonstrate the managed species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem.\nIn assessing the relative value of habitats the Council is taking a risk-averse approach. This approach will ensure that adequate areas are protected as EFH of managed species. In the South Atlantic region mostly level 1 and some level 2 data is available. This information was used to identify the geographic range of a species and the presence/absence data was evaluated to identify those habitat areas that are most commonly used and essential for the species. This includes habitats that will better ensure the health of the fish population and the ecosystem. The Council used the best scientific information available to describe and identify EFH in the south Atlantic. Habitat loss and degradation may be contributing to species being identified as overfished, therefore all habitats used by these species are considered essential.\nBased on the ecological relationships of species and relationships between species and their habitat the council is taking an ecosystem approach in determining EFH of managed species and species assemblages. This approach is consistent with NMFS guidelines. Through the existing habitat policy, the Council directs the protection of essential fish habitat types and the enhancement and restoration of their quality and quantity.\nThe general distribution and geographic limits of EFH is described and where information exists presented by life history stage in maps that are part of a developing Council ArcView geographic information system (GIS). Maps developed to date by Council staff, Florida Marine Research Institute, NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NOAA SEA Division, North Carolina DNR encompass appropriate temporal and spatial variability in presenting the distribution of EFH. Where information exists, seasonal changes are represented in the maps. EFH is identified on maps along with areas used by different life history stages of the species. The maps present the various habitat types described as EFH.\nThe document also presents information on adverse effects from fishing and describes management measures the Council has implemented to minimize adverse effects on EFH from fishing. The conservation and enhancement measures implemented by the Council to date may include ones that eliminate or minimize physical, chemical, or biological alterations of the substrate, and loss of, or injury to, benthic organisms, prey species and their habitat, and other components of the ecosystem. The Council has implemented restrictions on fisheries to the extent that no significant activities were identified in the review of gear impact conducted for the NMFS by Auster and Langton (1998) that presented available information on adverse effects of all fishing equipment types used in waters described as EFH. The Council has already prevented, mitigated, or minimized most adverse effects from most fisheries prosecuted in the south Atlantic EEZ.\nThe Council is considering evidence that a some fishing practices are having an identifiable adverse effect on habitat, and are addressing these in the comprehensive habitat amendment. The Council, as indicated in the previous section, has already used many of the options recommended in the guidelines for managing adverse effects from fishing including: fishing equipment restrictions seasonal and aerial restrictions on the use of specified equipment; equipment modifications to allow the escape of particular species or particular life stages (e.g., juveniles); prohibitions on the use of explosives and chemicals; prohibitions on\n4\n\n\f1.0 Purpose and Need\nanchoring or setting equipment in sensitive areas; and prohibitions on fishing activities that cause significant physical damage in EFH; time/area closures including closing areas to all fishing or specific equipment types during spawning, migration, foraging, and nursery activities; and designating zones for use as marine protected areas to limit adverse effects of fishing practices on certain vulnerable or rare areas/species/life history stages, such as those areas designated as habitat areas of particular concern; and harvest limits.\nThis document identifies non-fishing related activities that have the potential to adversely affect EFH quantity or quality. Examples of theses activities are dredging, fill, excavation, mining, impoundment, discharge, water diversions, thermal additions, actions that contribute to non-point source pollution and sedimentation, introduction of potentially hazardous materials, introduction of exotic species, and the conversion of aquatic habitat that may eliminate, diminish, or disrupt the functions of EFH. Included in this document is an analysis of how fishing and non-fishing activities influence habitat function on an ecosystem or watershed scale. This analysis presents available information describing the ecosystem or watershed and the dependence of managed species on the ecosystem or watershed. An assessment of the cumulative and synergistic effects of multiple threats, including the effects of natural stresses (such as storm damage or climate-based environmental shifts), and an assessment of the ecological risks resulting from the impact of those threats on the managed species' habitat is included.\nGeneral conservation and enhancement recommendations are included in Section 5 of this document. These include but are not limited to recommending the enhancement of rivers, streams, and coastal areas, protection of water quality and quantity, recommendations to local and state organizations to minimize destruction/degradation of wetlands, restore and maintain the ecological health of watersheds, and replace lost or degraded EFH.\nThis document, pursuant to the guidelines, also presents areas which meet the criteria for designation of essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs) by individual habitat type or managed species or species complex. The following criteria are considered when determining whether a type, or area of EFH is an essential fish habitat-habitat area of particular concern: (1) the importance of the ecological function provided by the habitat; (2) the extent to which the habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradation; (3) whether, and to what extent, development activities are, or will be, stressing the habitat type; and the rarity of the habitat.. The identification of EFH-HAPCs will continue through the public hearing process and the Council will consider additional areas if identified through this process. A coral HAPC process under the coral plan already exists and differs somewhat from the process recommended in the EFH guidelines.\nThe Council will periodically review and update EFH information and revise this Habitat Plan document as new information becomes available. NMFS should provide some of this information as part of the annual Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report. A complete review of EFH information will also be conducted as recommended in the guidelines in no longer than 5 years.\n1.3 SAFMC Habitat Plan and Comprehensive Habitat Amendment Development Process A proposed rule was published by NMFS on April 23, 1997 specifying regional fishery\nmanagement council guidelines for the description and identification of essential fishery habitat (EFH) in fishery management plans, adverse impacts on EFH, and actions to conserve and enhance EFH. In order to address the new essential fish habitat mandates in the MagnusonStevens Act, the South Atlantic Council began development of: (1) a habitat plan which will\n5\n\n\f1.0 Purpose and Need\nserve as a source document describing EFH (SAFMC 1998a); (2) a comprehensive amendment which will amend each of the existing fishery management plans, identifying and describing EFH and addressing impacts of fishing gear and/or fishing practices on EFH (SAFMC 1998b); and (3) a monitoring program for each fishery management plan to determine new impacts from fishing gear and/or fishing practices in an effort to minimize, to the extent practicable, the adverse impacts on EFH.\nThe Council, recognizing the scope of the significant task necessary to meet the essential fish habitat mandates of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, called upon the Panel members to serve as or identify appropriate experts to function on a quasi-plan development team. Subsequently, the Council initiated a workshop process to identify habitat experts and information availability to facilitate identifying essential fish habitat in the south Atlantic region. Workshops were conducted on habitat types including, wetlands, oyster/shell habitat, seagrass, pelagic habitat (including Sargassum and water column), coral and live/hard bottom, and artificial reefs. In addition, workshops on the use of GIS to map habitat and species distributions and research and monitoring were also held. The workshop process not only provided the Council with an indication of the availability of information that could be used to identify essential fish habitat but also brought together habitat experts that have participated directly in the drafting of this Habitat Plan.\nThe Council and NMFS have coordinated their efforts to address their respective EFH mandates in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Representatives of the NMFS southeast regional habitat team from NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center Beaufort Laboratory, NMFS Southeast Regional Office, and NMFS Headquarters are directly involved in the development of this Habitat Plan. On December 19, 1997, an interim final rule was published in the Federal Register to implement the essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).\n6\n\n\f2.0 Summary\n2.0 SUMMARY 2.1 Geographic Coverage\nThe Council, in developing this Habitat Plan, has consolidated the best available information on habitat essential to species managed in the south Atlantic region. The description and distribution of essential fish habitat in this document includes estuarine inshore habitats, mainly focusing on North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and the Florida east coast as well as adjacent offshore marine habitats (e.g. coral, coral reefs, and live/hard bottom habitat, artificial reefs, Sargassum habitat and the water column). The structural component of these habitats constitute the basis for the habitat distribution information presented in this document. A primary goal of this document is to relay information on the distribution of managed species and essential fish habitats and provide information to address fishing and non-fishing threats to the watershed or estuarine drainage area.\nThis document was prepared through a cooperative effort of State, Federal and regional habitat partners on the Councils' Habitat and Coral Advisory Panels, additional technical experts identified during Council EFH workshops, and Council staff. This approach was deemed appropriate and has resulted in a scientifically defensible product that describes the structural characteristics and function by habitat type and presents available information on distribution and use by managed species and their significant prey. The intent of this document is to serve as a source document for all species managed by the Council. It also represents an ecological characterization of the south Atlantic region describing essential fish habitat. The Council is therefore taking a risk-averse approach in describing and protecting essential fish habitat in its area of jurisdiction and making recommendations to protect essential habitat in state waters. The emphasis of the determination is on the interrelationships between habitat and State and Federally managed species and their prey and endangered and threatened species. The vast array of species using these habitats implies that the structural habitats serve such a wide variety of species at different times in different locations that these structural habitats (estuarine, palustrine, coral and live/hard bottom, artificial reefs, and Sargassum) are all inclusive as essential to the functioning of a healthy ecosystem in the south Atlantic region. In addition, the water column plays an important role in defining the nature of essential habitat by being the common link.\nThis document is a living document that will be revised as new information becomes available. New techniques such as Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) modeling being developed may be useful in better identifying these habitats and their use by managed species. In addition, more refined and accurate mapping techniques through geographical information systems (GIS), such as the ones being used in the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), under development for south Atlantic states and continued refinement of the SEAMAP bottom mapping effort. These and other activities will provide even more refined information for future Habitat Plan versions.\n2.1.1 Estuarine/Inshore Essential Fish Habitat Estuarine inshore habitats include estuarine emergent vegetation (salt marsh and\nbrackish marsh), estuarine shrub/scrub (mangroves), seagrass, oyster reefs and shell banks, intertidal flats, palustrine emergent and forested (freshwater wetlands), and the estuarine water column. Section 3.1 presents individual detailed descriptions including species use of these habitats.\n7\n\n\f2.0 Summary\nEstuarine Emergent Estuarine marshes constitute a complex ecosystem that serves as essential fish habitat\nbut also is vital to wildlife including endangered and threatened species, furbearers and other mammals, waterfowl, wading birds, shore and other birds, reptiles and amphibians, shellfish, and invertebrates. In contrast to freshwater marshes, salt marshes have low species diversity of the higher vertebrates, but high species diversity of invertebrates, including shellfish, and fishes. Optimal estuarine habitat conditions for managed species' spawning, survival, and growth is dependent on protecting the structural integrity as well as the environmental quality of these habitats. In North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, the marsh systems are of principal importance as nursery areas.\nMore detailed estimates of wetland by county are presented in Appendix A . This compilation of existing wetland habitat may, as refined to hydrological units, begin to serve as a baseline upon which to implement the policy directive and the long-term objective of a net gain of wetland habitats in the South Atlantic region. The Coastal Change Assessment Program (CCAP) is presently being developed in response to the National Wetlands Policy Forum recommendation to improve inventory, mapping, and monitoring programs by USFWS and NOAA. The program was implemented to develop a nationally standardized geographic information system using ground-based and remote sensing data. It assesses changes in land cover and habitat in US coastal regions to improve understanding of coastal uplands, wetlands, and seagrass beds and their links to distribution, abundance, and health of living marine resources. At this time only South Carolina coastal counties are complete and will represent essential wetland habitat as mapped in that state. The state of Georgia information is under review and as North Carolina and Florida are completed the mapping coverage will be incorporated into the Habitat Plan as the most accurate presentation of inshore essential fish habitat in the South Atlantic region. The ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat is described in Section 3.1.1.1.\nEstuarine Shrub/Scrub Mangroves (from NOAA 1995) The red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avincennia germinans), and white\nmangroves (Laguncularia erectus) are the three \"true\" species found in South Florida (Tomlinson, 1986). Red mangroves have prop roots and viviparous cigar-shaped seedlings, while black mangroves have a pneumataphore root system and gray-green leaves, the undersides of which are encrusted with excreted salt. White mangroves have rounded leaves, with a pair of salt glands on each petiole. Buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus), an associated species occurring with mangroves, is found in transitional wetland areas between mangrove and upland areas.\nA mangrove classification system has been developed that identifies six major forest types based on geological and hydrological process: riverine, overwash, fringe, basin, dwarf, and hammock (Lugo and Snedaker). Riverine forests do not occur in southeast Florida due to the lack of freshwater rivers and the associated floodplains (Davis, 1943: Minerals Management Service 1990). Fringe forests occur along shorelines inundated by high tides, dominated by red mangroves, and exposed to open water. Tidal flow follows the same directional path along the fringe forest, resulting in sediment and litter accumulation.\nMangrove-related fish communities can be organized along various environmental gradients including salinity, mangrove detritus dependence, and substrate (Odum et al., 1982). The ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat is described in Section 3.1.1.2\n8\n\n\f2.0 Summary\nSeagrass Habitat Seagrass beds in North Carolina and Florida are preferred habitat areas of many managed\nspecies including white, brown, and pink shrimp, red drum, and estuarine dependent snapper and grouper species in the larval, juvenile and adult phases of their life cycle. Seagrass meadows provide substrates and environmental conditions which are essential to the feeding, spawning and growth of several managed species. Seagrass meadows are complex ecosystems that are essential habitat because they provide primary productivity, structural complexity, modification of energy regimes, sediment and shoreline stabilization, and nutrient cycling. Section 3.1.1.3 describes the ecological value and function and distribution of this essential fish habitat. The states of North Carolina through CGIA and Florida through FMRI provided geographical information system (GIS) coverage of seagrass habitat. Subsequent reconfiguration of the data was conducted by NMFS SEFSC to create a uniform ArcView format for inclusion into the Councils' essential fish habitat distribution data base and GIS system.\nOyster Reefs and Shell Banks Oyster and shell essential fish habitat in the South Atlantic can be defined as the natural\nstructures found between (intertidal) and beneath (subtidal) tide lines, that are composed of oyster shell, live oysters and other organisms that are discrete, contiguous and clearly distinguishable from scattered oysters in marshes and mudflats, and from wave-formed shell windrows (Bahr and Lanier 1981). Both intertidal and subtidal populations are found in the tidal creeks and estuaries of the South Atlantic. On the Atlantic coast, the range of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica, extends over a wide latitude (20\u00b0 N to 54\u00b0 N). The ecological conditions encountered are diverse and the oyster community is not uniform throughout this range. Where the tidal range is large the oyster builds massive, discrete reefs in the intertidal zone. North of Cape Lookout, in North Carolina, the oyster habitat is dominated by Pamlico Sound and its tributaries. In these wind-driven lagoonal systems, oyster assemblages consist mainly of subtidal beds. Throughout the South Atlantic, oysters are found at varying distances up major drainage basins depending upon typography, salinity, substrate, and other variables.\nSeveral terms used to describe the oyster/shell essential fish habitat are oyster reef, bar, bed, rock, ground and planting. The habitat ranges in size from small scattered clumps to large mounds of living oysters and dead shells. Predation and siltation limit oyster densities at the lower portion and outer regions of the reefs. The vertical elevation of intertidal oyster reefs above mean low water is maximal within the central Georgia coastal zone, where mean tidal amplitude exceeds 2 m (Bahr and Lanier 1981).\nLarge shell banks or deposits of oyster valves generated by boat wakes are found throughout the South Atlantic, usually along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and heavily traveled rivers. These shell accumulations are usually elongated and conform to the underlying bottom topography from mean low water into the supra littoral zone. Further build-up may result in ridge structures and washovers. In South Carolina, 998 \"washed shell\" deposits have been located predominantly in the central and southern portion of the State. Washed shell is less resilient, partially abraded oyster shell with a lower specific gravity than recently shucked shells (Anderson 1979).\nIntertidal Flats Variability in the tidal regime along the South Atlantic coast results in considerable\nregional variability in the distribution and character of the estimated 1 million acres of tidal flat habitat. The coasts of North Carolina and Florida are largely microtidal (0-2m tidal range) with\n9\n\n\f2.0 Summary\nextensive barrier islands and relatively few inlets to extensive sound systems. In these areas wind energy has a strong affect on intertidal flats. In contrast the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia are mesotidal (2-4m) with short barrier islands and numerous tidal inlets so that tidal currents are the primary force effecting the intertidal zone.\nTidal flats are critical structural components of coastal systems that serve as feeding grounds and refuges for a variety of animals. This constantly changing system provides essential fish habitat as; 1) nursery grounds for early stages of development of many benthically oriented estuarine dependent species. 2) refuges and feeding grounds for a variety of forage species of fishes 3) feeding grounds for a variety of specialized predators.\nPalustrine Emergent and Forested Palustrine emergent systems include tidal and non-tidal marshes. A large amount of the\nenergy present in the palustrine emergent vegetation may be exported out of the system. Tidal currents, river currents, and wind energy all act to transport organic carbon downstream to the estuary, which is the nursery area for many of the Council-managed species. Migrating consumers, such as larval and juvenile fish and crustaceans, may feed within the habitat and then move on to the estuary or ocean. These links with managed species demonstrate the essential nature of this habitat type. Section 3.1.2.2 describes the ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat.\nAquatic Beds Submersed rooted vascular vegetation in tidal fresh- or freshwater portions of estuaries and\ntheir tributaries performs the same functions as those described for seagrasses. Specifically, aquatic bed meadows possess the same four attributes: 1) primary productivity; 2) structural complexity; 3) modification of energy regimes and sediment stabilization; and 4) nutrient cycling. The ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat is described in Section 3.2.2.3.\nEstaurine Water Column This habitat traditionally comprises four salinity categories: oligohaline (< 8 ppt),\nmesohaline (8-18 ppt), and polyhaline waters (18-30 ppt) with some euhaline water (>30 ppt) around inlets. Alternatively, a three-tier salinity classification is presented by Schreiber and Gill (1995) in their prototype document developing approaches for identifying and assessing important fish habitats: tidal fresh (0-0.5 ppt), mixing (0.5-25 ppt), and sewater (>25 ppt). Saline environments have moving boundaries, but are generally maintained by sea water transported through inlets by tide and wind mixing with fresh water supplied by land runoff. Particulate materials settle from these mixing waters and accumulate as bottom sediments. Coarser-grained sediments, saline waters, and migrating organisms are introduced from the ocean, while finergrained sediments, nutrients, organic matter, and fresh water are input from rivers and tidal creeks. The sea water component stabilizes the system, with its abundant supply of inorganic chemicals and its relatively conservative temperatures. Closer to the sea, rapid changes in variables such as temperature are moderate compared to shallow upstream waters. Without periodic additions of sea water, seasonal thermal extremes would reduce the biological capacity of the water column as well as reduce the recruitment of fauna from the ocean. While nearby wetlands contain some assimilative capacity abating nutrient enrichment, fresh water inflow and tidal flushing are primarily important for circulation and removal of nutrients and wastes from the estuary.\n10\n\n\f2.0 Summary\nThe water column is composed of horizontal and vertical components. Horizontaly, salinity gradients (decreasing landward) strongly influence the distribution of biota, both directly (physiologically) and indirectly (e.g., emergent vegetation distribution). Horizontal gradients of nutrients, decreasing seaward, affect primarily the distribution of phytoplankton and, secondarily, organisms utilizing this primary productivity. Vertically, the water column may be stratified by salinity (fresh water runoff overlaying heavier salt water), oxygen content (lower values at the bottom associated with high biological oxygen demand due to inadequate vertical mixing), and nutrients, pesticides, industrial wastes, and pathogens (build up to abnormal levels near the bottom from lack of vertical mixing).\n2.1.2 Marine/Offshore Essential Fish Habitat Marine offshore habitats include live/hard bottom, coral and coral reefs, artificial/manmade\nreefs, pelagic Sargassum and water column habitat. Section 3.2 presents individual detailed descriptions including species use of these habitats.\nLive/Hard Bottom Habitat Major fisheries habitats on the Continental Shelf along the southeastern United States from\nCape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral (South Atlantic Bight) can be stratified into five general categories: coastal, open shelf, live/hard bottom, shelf edge, and lower shelf based on type of bottom and water temperature. Each of these habitats harbors a distinct association of demersal fishes (Struhsaker 1969) and invertebrates. The description of this essential fish habitat presented in Section 3.2.1.2, segregates the region into two sections: a) Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral; and b) Cape Canaveral to the Dry Tortugas. These regions represent temperate, wide-shelf systems and tropical, narrowshelf systems, respectively. The zoogeographic break between these regions typically occurs between Cape Canaveral and Jupiter Inlet.\nCovered by a vast plain of sand and mud underlain at depths of less than a meter by carbonate sandstone is relatively unattractive to fish. Live/hard bottom, usually found near outcropping shelves of sedimentary rock in the zone from 15 to 35 fathoms and at the shelf break, a zone from about 35 to 100 fathoms where the Continental Shelf adjoins the deep ocean basin and is often characterized by steep cliffs and ledges. The live bottom areas constitute essential habitat for warm-temperate and tropical species of snappers, groupers, and associated fishes including 113 species of reef fish representing 43 families of predominately tropical and subtropical fishes off the coasts of North Carolina and South Carolina.\nThe distribution of live/hard bottom habitat in the south Atlantic region is presented in the hardbottom maps in Section 3.2. These geographic coverage's are a compilation of the four state bottom mapping effort in the South East Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). The Florida Marine Research Institute developed uniform ArcView coverage's of hard bottom habitat (including coral, coral reefs, live/hard bottom, and artificial reefs) as a 1998 SEAMAP program and provided it to the Council for inclusion into the south Atlantic essential fish habitat distribution data base and GIS system.\nCoral and Coral Reefs Coral reef communities or solitary specimens exist throughout the south Atlantic region from\nnearshore environments to continental slopes and canyons, including the intermediate shelf zones. Habitats supporting corals and coral-associated species are discussed below in groupings based on their physical and ecological characteristics. Dependent upon many variables, corals may dominate a habitat, be a significant component, or be individuals within a community characterized by other\n11\n\n\f2.0 Summary\nfauna. Geologically and ecologically, the range of coral assemblages and habitat types is equally diverse. The coral reefs of shallow warm waters are typically, though not always, built upon coralline rock and support a wide array of hermatypic and ahermatypic corals, finfish, invertebrates, plants, and microorganisms. Hard bottoms and hard banks, found on a wider bathymetric and geographic scale, often possess high species diversity but may lack hermatypic corals, the supporting coralline structure, or some of the associated biota. In deeper waters, large elongate mounds called deepwater banks, hundreds of meters in length, often support a rich fauna compared to adjacent areas. Lastly are communities including solitary corals. This category often lacks a topographic relief as its substrate, but instead may use a sandy bottom, for example. Coral habitats (i.e., habitats to which coral is a significant contributor) are divided into five categories - solitary corals, hard bottoms, deepwater banks, patch reefs, and outer bank reefs. The order of presentation approximates the ranking of habitat complexity based upon species diversity (e.g., zonation, topographic relief, and other factors). Although attempts have been made to generalize the discussion into definable types, it must be noted that the continuum of habitats includes many more than these five distinct varieties.\nThe ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat is described in Section 3.2.1.2. The distribution of live/hard bottom habitat in the south Atlantic region is presented in the hardbottom maps in Section 3.2.\nArtificial/Manmade Reefs Manmade reefs are defined for this document as any area within marine waters in which\nsuitable structures or materials have intentionally been placed by man for the purpose of creating, restoring or improving long-term habitat for the eventual exploitation, conservation or preservation of the resulting marine ecosystems naturally established on these sites. Manmade hard bottom habitats are formed when a primary hard substrate is available for the attachment and development of epibenthic assemblages. This substrate is colonized when marine algae and larvae of epibenthic animals successfully settle and thrive. Concurrent with the development of the epibenthic assemblage, demersal reef-dwelling finfish recruit to the new hard bottom habitat. Juvenile life stages will use this habitat for protection from predators, orientation in the water column or on the reef itself and as a feeding area. Adult life stages of demersal reef-dwelling finfish including species managed in the snapper grouper plan, will use the habitat for protection from predation, feeding opportunities, orientation in the water column and on the reef and as spawning sites. Pelagic planktivores occur on hard bottom habitats in high densities and use these habitats for orientation in the water column and feeding opportunities. These species provide important food resources to snapper grouper species and coastal migratory pelagics including king and Spanish mackerel and cobia. The pelagic piscivores use the hard bottom habitats for feeding opportunistically. Most of these species do not take up residence on individual hard bottom outcrops, but will transit through hard bottom areas and feed for varying periods of time.\nManmade hard substrates are considered essential fish habitat in the south Atlantic region because of the use of these habitats by species in the snapper grouper complex, coastal migratory pelagics and prey important to those species. The ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat is described in Section 3.2.2\nThe State of Florida Marine Research Institute, as part of the 1998 deliverable, provided the Council with uniform Arc View coverage's for inclusion into the south Atlantic essential fish habitat distribution data base and GIS system.\n12\n\n\f2.0 Summary\nSargassum Pelagic brown algae Sargassum natans and S. fluitans form a dynamic structural habitat\nwithin warm waters of the western North Atlantic. Most pelagic Sargassum circulates between 20\u00b0N and 40\u00b0N latitudes and 30\u00b0W longitude and the western edge of the Florida Current/Gulf Stream. The greatest concentrations are found within the North Atlantic Central Gyre in the Sargasso Sea. Large quantities of Sargassum frequently occur on the continental shelf off the southeastern United States. Depending on prevailing surface currents, this material may remain on the shelf for extended periods, be entrained into the Gulf Stream, or be cast ashore. During calm conditions Sargassum may form large irregular mats or simply be scattered in small clumps. Langmuir circulation, internal waves, and convergence zones along fronts aggregate the algae along with other flotsam into long linear or meandering rows collectively termed \"windrows\".\nPelagic Sargassum supports a diverse assemblage of marine organisms including fungi, micro-and macro-epiphytes, at least 145 species of invertebrates, over 100 species of fishes, four species of sea turtles, and numerous marine birds. The fishes associated with pelagic Sargassum in the western North Atlantic include juveniles as well as adults of a wide variety of species. The carangids and balistids are the most conspicuous, being represented by 21 and 15 species respectively. Therefore, this habitat is considered essential fish habitat because it provides protection, feeding opportunity and use as a spawning substrate to species managed by the Council. The ecological value, function and distribution of this essential fish habitat is described in Section 3.2.3.\nAdditional information is contained in the fishery management plan for pelagic Sargassum (SAFMC 1998d).\nWater Column Specific habitats in the water column can best be defined in terms of gradients and\ndiscontinuities in temperature, salinity, density, nutrients, light, etc. These \"structural\" components of the water column environment are not static, but change both in time and space. Therefore, there are numerous potentially distinct water column habitats for a broad array of managed species and life-stages within species.\nThe discussion of the ecological function of water column habitat and importance to managed species is presented in Section 3.2.3.2.\n13\n\n\f2.0 Summary\n2.2 List of Fishery Management Plans and Species\n\nSouth Atlantic Snapper-Grouper Balistidae--Triggerfishes\nGray triggerfish, Balistes capriscus Queen triggerfish, Balistes vetula Ocean triggerfish, Canthidermis sufflamen Carangidae--Jacks Yellow jack, Caranx bartholomaei Blue runner, Caranx crysos Crevalle jack, Caranx hippos Bar jack, Caranx ruber Greater amberjack, Seriola dumerili Lesser amberjack, Seriola fasciata Almaco jack, Seriola rivoliana Banded rudderfish, Seriola zonata Ephippidae--Spadefishes Spadefish, Chaetodipterus faber Haemulidae--Grunts Black margate, Anisotremus surinamensis Porkfish, Anisotremus virginicus Margate, Haemulon album Tomtate, Haemulon aurolineatum Smallmouth grunt, Haemulon chrysargyreum French grunt, Haemulon flavolineatum Spanish grunt, Haemulon macrostomum Cottonwick, Haemulon melanurum Sailors choice, Haemulon parrai White grunt, Haemulon plumieri Blue stripe grunt, Haemulon sciurus Labridae--Wrasses Hogfish, Lachnolaimus maximus Puddingwife, Halichoeres radiatus Lutjanidae--Snappers Black snapper, Apsilus dentatus Queen snapper, Etelis oculatus Mutton snapper, Lutjanus analis Schoolmaster, Lutjanus apodus Blackfin snapper, Lutjanus buccanella Red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus Cubera snapper, Lutjanus cyanopterus Gray snapper, Lutjanus griseus Mahogany snapper, Lutjanus mahogoni Dog snapper, Lutjanus jocu Lane snapper, Lutjanus synagris Silk snapper, Lutjanus vivanus Yellowtail snapper, Ocyurus chrysurus Vermilion snapper, Rhomboplites aurorubens Malacanthidae--Tilefishes Blueline tilefish, Caulolatilus microps Golden tilefish, Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps Sand tilefish, Malacanthus plumieri Percichthyidae--Temperate basses Wreckfish, Polyprion americanus\n\nSerranidae--Sea Basses and Groupers Bank sea bass, Centropristis ocyurus Rock sea bass, Centropristis philadelphica Black sea bass, Centropristis striata Rock hind, Epinephelus adscensionis Graysby, Epinephelus cruentatus Speckled hind, Epinephelus drummondhayi Yellowedge grouper, Epinephelus flavolimbatus Coney, Epinephelus fulvus Red hind, Epinephelus guttatus Jewfish, Epinephelus itajara Red grouper, Epinephelus morio Misty grouper, Epinephelus mystacinus Warsaw grouper, Epinephelus nigritus Snowy grouper, Epinephelus niveatus Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus Black grouper, Mycteroperca bonaci Yellowmouth grouper, Mycteroperca interstitialis Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis Scamp, Mycteroperca phenax Tiger grouper, Mycteroperca tigris Yellowfin grouper, Mycteroperca venenosa\nSparidae--Porgies Sheepshead, Archosargus probatocephalus Grass porgy, Calamus arctifrons Jolthead porgy, Calamus bajonado Saucereye porgy, Calamus Whitebone porgy, Calamus leucosteus Knobbed porgy, Calamus nodosus Red porgy, Pagrus pagrus Longspine porgy, Stenotomus caprinus Scup, Stenotomus chrysops\nCoastal Migratory Pelagics Cero, Scomberomorus regalis Cobia, Rachycentron canadum Dolphin, Coryphaena hippurus King mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla Little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus Spanish mackerel, Scomberomorus maculatus\nShrimp Fishery of the South Atlantic Region Brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus Pink shrimp, Penaeus duorarum Rock shrimp, Sicyonia brevirostris Royal red shrimp, Pleoticus robustus Seabob shrimp, Xiphopenaeus kroyeri White shrimp, Penaeus setiferus\nSpiny Lobster Spiny Lobster, Panulirus argus\n\n14\n\n\fGolden Crab Golden Crab, Chaeceon fenneri\nCoral, Coral Reefs, and Live/Hard Bottom Habitat Coral belonging to the Class Hydrozoa (fire corals and hydrocorals).

Wetlands are classified on the basis of their hydrology, vegetation and substrate. One classification system proposed by Cowardin et al., (1979) and used by the USFWS classifies wetlands into five ecological systems. Estuarine emergents fall into two of these systems, the Estuarine and Marine. The Estuarine wetland is described as tidal wetlands in low-wave-energy environments, where the salinity is greater than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) and is variable owing to evaporation and the mixing of seawater and freshwater. Marine wetlands are described as tidal wetlands that are exposed to waves and currents of the open ocean and have a salinity of greater than 30 ppt. A saltmarsh, as defined by Beeflink (1977), is a \"natural or semi-natural salt tolerant grassland and dwarf brushwood on the alluvial sediments bordering saline water bodies whose water level fluctuates either tidal or nontidally\". The flora comprise of erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes dominated by salttolerant perennial plants (Cowardin et al. 1979). Structure and function of a saltmarsh are influenced by tide, salinity, nutrients and temperature. The saltmarsh can be a stressful environment to plants and animals, with rapid changes occurring in these abiotic variables (Gosselink 1980; Gosselink et al. 1974). Although species diversity may be lower than in other systems, the saltmarsh is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world (Teal 1962; Teal and Teal, 1969). The high primary productivity that occurs in the marsh, and the transfer of detritus into the estuary from the marsh, provides the base of the food chain supporting many marine organisms.\nMany saltmarshes are drained by an intricate network of tidal creeks. These creeks and the adjacent marsh function as nursery areas for larval and juvenile finfish, crustaceans, and mollusks, and as a critical fisheries habitat to adult species. Greater than 90% of the commercial and recreational landings in the South Atlantic are composed of estuarine dependent species. The marsh not only provides food, structure, and refuge from predators to fishery organisms, but also regulates the amount of freshwater, nutrient and sediment inputs into the estuary. In addition to its function as an essential fisheries habitat, the marsh plays a vital role in the health and water quality of the estuary. The position of saltmarshes along the margins of estuaries and their dense stands of persistent plants make them valuable for stabilizing shoreline and for storing floodwaters during coastal storms.\n3.1.1.1.2 Distribution of Marsh Habitat Salt and brackish marshes occur in each of the states in the South Atlantic Region. The\ntotal area of salt and brackish marshes in this region is approximately 894,200 acres (Field et al. 1991). It is estimated that South Atlantic salt marshes account for 16% of the nation's total coastal wetlands.\nSouth Carolina has the greatest salt marsh acreage (365,900 acres), followed by North Carolina (212,800 acres) and Georgia (213,200 acres). Florida (east coast) has the least salt marsh acreage (106,000 acres). The Albemarle-Pamlico Sound (NC) and the St. AndrewsSimons Sounds are the estuarine drainage areas (EDA) with the greatest marsh habitat.\nEnvironmental Sensitivity Index maps recently completed for the four South Atlantic States present the distribution of wetland habitats and examples are included in Appendix B. More extensive coverages will be available on the Council Habitat Homepage.\n16\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTable 1 presents baseline estimates of coastal wetland acreage by estuarine drainage area in the South Atlantic region compiled through a cooperative effort of NOAA and USFWS (NOAA 1991a). Figure 1. shows the estuarine drainage areas in the South Atlantic Region for which the estimates have been compiled. This coastal assessment framework, will ultimately be the spatial frame on which all inshore habitat distribution information will be presented.\n\nTable 1.

Values in parentheses represent the percent of total Estuarine Drainage Area wetlands grid sampled by NOAA.\n\nSalt and brackish marshes occur in the intertidal zone in coastal and estuarine waters. The coastal physiography of the northern and southern part of the South Atlantic Bight (e.g. North Carolina and Florida) is dominated by shallow water lagoons behind sand coastal barrier shoreline. In the central portion (e.g. South Carolina and Georgia) there are depositional marshfilled lagoons. In both these systems, marshes may occur in vast expanses, in narrow fringing bands, or as small \"pocket marshes\" interspersed among higher elevation areas. Although marshes may develop in sandy sediments, especially in high energy areas, marsh development typically leads to sediments with fine particle-size (mud) and high organic matter content. In most physical settings, marshes can accrete sediments, and thus maintain their elevation in relation to the rising sea level that is occurring over most of the South Atlantic Coast. Salt marshes persist longest in low-energy protected areas where the rate of sediment accretions is greater than or equal to the rate of subsidence (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986).\n\n17\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 1. Estuarine drainage areas in the South Atlantic Region (Source: NOAA 1991a). 3.1.1.1.3 Species Composition (Flora)\nThere are more than one hundred species of vascular flora and algae that compose the various intertidal macrophytic communities that are common to the estuaries of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) (Beccasio et al. 1980). Most of those communities are tidally influenced marshes and, to a lesser degree, tidally influenced shrub and forest communities. South of the St. John River estuary in northern Florida the wetland communities of the lagoonal estuaries of the lower Florida peninsula gradually change from a marsh dominated landscape to a shrub community dominated by mangroves.\nThe macrophytes identified in this section are all influenced in their growth characteristics by salinity in the water. Salinities in south Atlantic estuaries generally range from 30.0 parts per thousand (ppt) or above (essentially sea strength) at the mouths of coastal inlets to\n18\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nless than 0.5 ppt at the upper reaches of the estuaries under the influence of freshwater outflow from coastal plain streams and rivers (Odum et al. 1984). The tolerance of salinity in the water column and in the soils that serve as substrate directly influence the composition of the plant community. Salinity in combination with the periodicity of inundation due to tidal action and downstream discharge, soil chemistry, soil type, shading and erosion all result in a predictable model of the zonation of individual species and, at times, discrete plant communities.\nSpartina alterniflora or smooth cordgrass is the species that dominates the intertidal landscape in South Atlantic estuaries. S. alterniflora is able to tolerate salinities from sea strength to freshwater, as well as the saturated soils that are characteristic of twice-daily tidal inundation. S. alterniflora, a true grass, commonly occurs in vast stands growing on the fine grained soils that have been deposited in the low energy coastal lagoons and drowned river valleys behind the barrier islands that fringe the oceanic shoreline. Within the vertical zonation of the tidal amplitude S. alterniflora occurs from an elevation that generally equates to mean tide level up to mean high water.\nS. alterniflora exhibits three growth forms, tall, medium and short. The tall form dominates the immediate shorelines of the tidal stream banks at an elevation from mean tide level up to slightly below the mean high tide level and to a horizontal depth shoreward of about two meters. The stem height commonly attains one to one and a half meters. The medium form is found from the stream side levee horizontally into the interior of the marsh. Stem density is less dense that the tall form and stem height averages up to about one meter. The short form grows in the interior portion of the marsh where sediments are finer and less well-drained. Stem density can be higher than the medium growth form and stem height averages about 0.2 - 0.3 meters or shorter. This growth pattern is attributed to a combination of periodicity of tidal inundation, soil salinity, soil saturation, nutrient availability and other less predictable factors. The zonation and stem density, however, play a key role in the use of Spartina marshes by consumer organisms.\nThe second most common marsh plant that occurs in the region is Juncus roemerianus. J. roemerianus, like Spartina alterniflora, is found in all of the estuaries of the SAB. Less salt tolerant and not as well adapted to longer periods of inundation as S. alterniflora, J. roemerianus is found in the higher elevations of tidal coastal marshes. In salinity regimes higher that 15 ppt J. roemerianus is found in dense monospecific stands often in a zone between the Spartina and high ground. Stem height averages one meter but may approach two meters.\nDiversity of the vascular plant community increases at higher tide elevations and at lower salinities. In the outer portions of the estuary, Spartina patens or saltmeadow cordgrass, occurs between mean high water and spring high water. Other plants characteristic of the high marsh are Salicornia virginica and Distichlis spicata. In more brackish portions of the estuary, S. alterniflora is replaced by Spartina cynosuroides and Scrirpus olneyii.\nSeveral species of macroalgae may become abundant within salt marsh tidal creeks and on the marsh surface, particularly in early spring. These include Ulva, Codium, Gracilaria and Enteromorpha. These macroalgal communities, although ephemeral, can provide both refuge and food resources to marsh consumer organisms. Additionally, a diverse community of benthic and epiphytic microalgae inhabit the marsh surface and the stems of marsh plants. This community is composed of diatoms, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic bacteria, and may represent a significant portion of marsh primary production. The primary production of this algal community also plays an important role in supporting fisheries production in salt marsh habitats.\n19\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.1.1.1.4 Species Composition (Fauna) Estuarine intertidal marshes provide habitat for species of concern in two SAFMC\nmanagement plans: the red drum fishery and the shrimp fishery. These marshes also provide fish and wildlife habitat for other fish, shellfish, and other invertebrates, as well as endangered and threatened species, furbearers and other mammals, waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds and other birds, and reptiles and amphibians. Beyond the estuaries, exported marsh nutrients, detritus, and prey species contained in the food web ultimately add to the ecosystems supporting species of concern in two other management plans, the coastal migratory pelagics fishery and the snapper grouper fishery.\nIn contrast to freshwater marshes, salt marshes have low species diversity of the higher vertebrates, but high species diversity of invertebrates, including shellfish, and fishes. Table 2 reviews examples of fishes and crustaceans common to southeastern U.S. marshes. These organisms utilize the marsh structure (including the stems of emergent vascular plants, attached macroalgae, substrate materials such as shells and sediments, attached living oysters and mussels, residual tidal pools, and accumulated woody flotsam). Some feed directly on the vegetation, especially decapods and gastropods. Some species, are not found within the marsh, but derive substantial food resources from marsh plants as detritus. The protection afforded by the stem structure and intertidal water levels provides spawning habitat for some fish species, such as killifish, atherinids and gobiids, but most fishes associated with the marsh are recruited as larvae or early juveniles (Boesch and Turner 1984). Taxa spawning in or near the marsh are considered residents, but the most of the fish species (but not necessarily most of the biomass) are seasonally transient (Weinstein 1979). Transients spawn elsewhere, either upstream in freshwater (e.g., striped bass), or downstream in the coastal waters (e.g., flounders) (Schreiber and Gill 1995), and occupy the marsh habitat primarily as juveniles in the warmer months. Some of these species do not penetrate into the marsh, but are strongly linked to it in the adjacent fringing water. Of particular note are penaeid shrimp and red drum, both of which are managed species by the SAFMC. Red drum are critically tied to marshes as juveniles and early adults, feeding on the crustaceans and fishes produced there. Penaeid shrimp (brown, white, and pink) browse at the marsh edge and use the structure for protection (Turner 1977). Estuarine dependant species in the snapper grouper complex include gag, lane snapper, and gray snapper. Spanish mackerel, an important coastal migratory pelagic species, is also dependant on the estuaries during larval and juvenile life stages.\n3.1.1.1.5 Habitat Restoration Efforts to restore or create salt marsh habitat have been underway for over 20 years, as\nlosses of coastal wetlands through erosion, land subsidence, sea level rise and coastal development have increased (Nixon 1980; Matthews and Minello 1994). Restoration or creation of marsh habitat begins with designing a site with the appropriate hydrology, tidal exchange, and sediment properties to support the growth of salt marsh plants. Subsequent to physical modification of the site, plantings are often made of Spartina alterniflora or, less frequently, of other marsh plants. Given appropriate site selection and preparation, successful establishment of Spartina and/or other marsh species can occur within a few growing seasons.\n20\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 2.

Examples of marsh functions to be evaluated are food web support, provision of fishery nursery grounds, and the transformation of nutrients (Smith et al. 1995). Evidence to date suggests that the time it takes a transplanted salt marsh to attain the ecological function of a mature natural marsh may be 10 to 20 years. If the hydrology and tidal elevation of the site are not maintained, then the transplanted marsh may never supply equivalent habitat function as a natural marsh. This is particularly important to recognize in cases where marsh restoration or creation is undertaken to mitigate for the loss of natural marsh via development, dredging, or other permitted activities.\n3.1.1.2 Estuarine Shrub/Scrub (Mangroves) 3.1.1.2.1 Description, Distribution and Mangrove Habitat Types.\nMangroves represent a major coastal wetland habitat in the southeastern United States, occupying in excess of 200,000 hectares along the coastlines of all Gulf coast states, Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands; small areas of introduced species are also present in southern California and in Hawaii. Collectively four species comprise the \"mangrove\" forest: the red (Rhizophora mangle L), black (Avicennia germinans L. Stearn), the white (Laguncularia racemosa L. Gaertn.f.) mangroves and the buttonwood mangrove (Conocarpus erectus L.). Figure 2 provides an illustration of some of the characteristics of the first three species. The buttonwood, although frequently referred to as a mangrove, does not meet the strict mangrove definition proposed by Tomlinson (1986). The largest areas of mangrove forests are found along the coastal areas of Florida south of Latitude 28o 00 N. About 90% of this is located in the four southernmost counties of the Florida peninsula: Dade, Monroe, Collier, and Lee Counties (Gilmore and Snedaker 1993). Figure 3 shows the general distribution of mangrove species in Florida.\nThese species singularly or in combinations occupy wide ranges in the coastal zone from regularly flooded tidal regimes to higher elevations that may receive tidal waters only several times per year or during storm events. The growth of mangroves appears to be limited to estuarine systems and more inland areas that are subject to saline intrusions. A classification system for mangrove types based on gross differences in topography, surface hydrology and salinity exists and is presented in Table 3. A brief description of the mangrove types as summarized from Gilmore and Snedaker (1993), follows. This description is provided because the different forest types have somewhat different functional roles and fauna which utilize them (see next section).\nMangrove fringe forests occur along sheltered coastlines with exposure to open water of lagoons and bays. The tree canopy foliage forms a vertical wall and these forests are almost exclusively dominated by red mangroves. The characteristics of this mangrove habitat type are related to the patterns of tidal inundation through which detrital materials and propagules are exported from the system during ebb tides. These fringe forests commonly have a shoreline berm or an interior wrack line (i.e., build up of detritus). This is a very important habitat type for fishery organisms because of the presence of abundant food and refuge provided by the mangrove prop-roots, and has been more frequently studied relative to its links with adjacent systems than most other mangrove forest types (Thayer and Sheridan In press).\nOverwash mangrove islands are ecologically similar to fringe forests because of their high frequency of tidal inundation, but here the entire area is completely covered by tidal waters on almost every tidal cycle. Because of the overwash phenomenon there is an infrequent build\n22\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nup of a detrital berm or the development of a shoreline berm. Gilmore and Snedaker (1993) indicate that there is a high incidence of bird rookeries on overwash islands, presumably due to the limited habitat for predators and scavengers.\nRiverine mangrove forests occur in riverine areas that have estuarine water exchange, and is a forest type that is the most productive of the 5 described (Table 3). This high productivity is attributed to the reduced salinity and the fact that freshwater runoff from land provides mineral nutrients required for growth. This high production provides organic detrital material to the adjoining low-salinity system, and also is an important habitat for fishery organisms (Ley 1992).\n\nTable 3.\n\nCharacteristics of Mangrove Forest Type of Southern Florida a (Table from\n\nGilmore and Snedaker 1993.)\n\nCharacteristics\nForest height (m) Mean stand diameter (cm) Complexity Indexb\nTrees Saplings Litter production (mg/ha/yr.)\n\nMangrove Types\n\nFringe Overwash Riverine Basin\n\nForest Forest Forest Forest\n\n7.65 6.37 12.64\n\n12.14\n\n8.31 11.12 19.37\n\n10.53\n\n26.44 1.54 9.00\n\n13.17 38.77 2.17 22.76 9.00 12.98\n\n18.41 4.09 6.61\n\nDwarf Forest <1.0\n1.75\n1.5 -1.86\n\na Data are averages. b Complexity Index utilizes tree height, density, and number of species as independentvariables\nand the sum of present contribution of individual species (Pool et al. 1977).\n\nBasin mangrove forests exist in inland topographic depressions which are not flushed by all high tides. This habitat type may experience seasonal periods of hypersaline soil water which can limit mangrove growth and induce mortality. These habitat types are normally dominated by black mangroves but invasion by Australian pine and Brazilian pepper is very common. Odum et al. (1982) note that this habitat type provides an extreme habitat in which few aquatic species can live because of the commonly low oxygen levels and presence of generally high levels of hydrogen sulfide. However, Gilmore and Snedaker (1993) suggest that because of the large areal extent of the basin mangrove habitat type, they probably contribute the largest absolute quantity of organic detritus to Florida's nearshore waters, and that this export occurs on a highly seasonal basis.\nDwarf mangrove forests occur in areas where nutrients, freshwater inflow and tidal activity limit the growth of the plant. All of the species can exist in a dwarf form. These marginal habitats have received little attention relative to their role as fishery habitat.\n\n23\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nBlack Mangrove\nWhite Mangrove\nRed Mangrove\nFigure 2.

In press), this coastal habitat and resource is being progressively diminished by a variety of natural and anthropogenic actions such as removal for coastal development, deprivation of freshwater from upland watersheds, severe freezes, clearing for charcoal production, oil spills and water pollution, competitive exclusion by exotic tree species (e.g., Australian pine, Brazilian pepper), illegal cutting or removal, coastal erosion, and mosquito control activities. Most of these aspects have\n\n25\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nbeen discussed and/or documented by Odum et al. (1982) and Gilmore and Snedaker (1993), and are discussed under Section 4.0 of this document (Threats to Essential Fish Habitat), and need not be detailed here.\nMangroves are considered resilient and display characteristics of some \"pioneer species\" in that they have broad tolerances to environmental factors, rapid growth and maturity, continuous or almost continuous flowering and propagule production, high propagule outputs in a wide range of environmental conditions, and adaptations for short and long distance dispersal by tides (Cintron-Molero 1992). Even with these \"r-strategist\" characteristics mangroves are both sensitive and vulnerable to disturbance. Odum et al. (1982) point out, however, that one of the adaptations of mangroves--the aerial root system, is also one of the plant's most vulnerable components because of their susceptibility to clogging, prolonged flooding, and boring damage from invertebrates. They note that any process that coats the aerial roots with fine sediments or covers them with water for long periods has the potential of being a destructive agent. Diking, impounding and long term flooding, as has occurred in mosquito control situations has caused considerable damage, as have spraying of herbicides and inundation by oil spills. Good discussions of the impacts of urbanization, impoundment and flood control are provided by Gilmore and Snedaker (1993).\n3.1.1.2.3 Ecological Roles and Function Odum et al. (1982) has provided perhaps the most detailed account of the ecology of\nmangroves and this document and references cited should be referred for detailed descriptions of mangrove habitats. In the interim, however, several publications have appeared (Rooker and Dennis,1991, Cintron-Molero 1992, Gilmore and Snedaker 1993, Thayer and Sheridan In press, Thayer et al. In press) which update ecology, fishery value, and research information needs based on the available and often frequently limited literature base that exists on this habitat type. Cintron-Molero (1992) has provided a succinct summary of the functional values of mangrove ecosystems that is not dissimilar to that presented for seagrass ecosystems (Wood et al. 1969, Thayer et al. 1975). The relatively high primary productivity of mangrove ecosystems and the associated biological processes provide many goods and services which are of direct or indirect benefit to the public and to the urban and industrial environment. In Asia and South America, mangroves have been managed for lumber, firewood and charcoal. Mangrove habitats, particularly riverine, overwash and fringe forests, provide shelter for larval, juvenile and adult fish and invertebrates as will be discussed later and dissolved and particulate organic detritus to estuarine food webs. Because of this linkage, both as habitat and as food resources, mangroves are important exporters of material to coastal systems as well as to terrestrial systems (e.g., through bird use as a rookery and feeding on fish). They help shape local geomorphic processes and are important in the heterogeneity of landforms which provide shelter, foraging grounds and nursery areas for terrestrial organisms. The root system binds sediments thereby contributing to sedimentation and sediment stabilization.\n3.1.1.2.3.1 The linkage between mangroves and fishery organisms Thayer and Sheridan (In press) and Gilmore and Snedaker (1993) have provided\nsyntheses of most recent available information on fishery organism use, in terms of presence, in mangrove habitats; information prior to about 1981 on faunal use is provided by Odum et al. ( 1982). Based on these publications and references cited, there is little doubt that mangrove habitats provide nursery, feeding and growth, and refuge for both recreationally and commercially important fishery organisms and their food resources when flooded. As noted by\n26\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThayer and Sheridan (In press) and Thayer et al. (1987), while it has long been recognized that mangrove habitats in the southeastern U. S. are important to fishery resources (see Odum et al. 1982), there have been few quantitative studies dealing with the use of these habitat types and their functional value to fishery organisms largely from the lack of available techniques. The prop-root habitat of red and black mangroves has presented a formidable obstacle to evaluation of the temporal and spatial distribution and abundances of fishes and decapod crustaceans using the habitat. However, techniques have evolved to at least provide some information on the abundances and composition of organisms which actually move into and out of these systems when flooded.\nGilmore and Snedaker (1993) have divided mangrove faunal communities into seven spatial guilds that are defined by microhabitat associations, but recognized that these are dynamic groupings with species often moving from one guild to another during ontogeny or with changes in environmental conditions (Table 4). From the standpoint of fish and invertebrate use spatial guilds I, III, IV and V are most relevant, but Guild II, VI and VII cannot be discounted because this contains the arboreal and terrestrial components of the community, many of which are predators or scavengers on the fish and invertebrate fauna of the mangrove community.\nThe following discussion will deal with the mobile components of mangrove communities, most of which, from a fisheries standpoint interact with the community during flood tides, and the material comes primarily from Gilmore and Snedaker (1993) Thayer and Sheridan (In press) and references cited. Based on the spatial guild scheme seen in Table 4, transient representatives typically are represented by larval and juvenile stages of both invertebrates and fish commonly found using the fringe and overwash island mangrove forests (Guild I), and frequently the adult stage is found in adjacent seagrass meadows or in reef structures. Spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) and pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum) are the most important commercial and recreational invertebrates commonly found among the prop-roots of red mangroves, although Thayer et al. (1987) noted that pink shrimp were conspicuously absent from mangrove habitats sampled in Florida Bay. However, important links in the food linkages-the amphipods, isopods, polychaetes, etc.--are very important invertebrate components of the mangrove prop-root habitat. Snook (Centropomus undecimalis), jewfish (Epinephelus itajara), tripletail (Lobotes surinamensis), leatherjack (Oligoplites saurus), gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), dog snapper (L. jocu), sailor's choice (Haemulon parra), bluestriped grunt (H. sciurus), sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus), black drum (Pogonias cromis) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellata) also are common to this habitat, using it as refuge and as a ready source of food. Collections in both seagrass beds and mangroves suggest that there is an integral link between these habitats with tripletail, snook, gray snapper, red drum, and jewfish, for example, occurring over seagrass beds or other adjacent bottoms as adults or large juveniles but using the mangrove prop-root during juvenile stages. Spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), striped and white mullets (Mugil cephalus, M. curema) and great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) juveniles also are common inhabitants.\nMangrove tidal creeks and ditches (Guild IV) have received little attention (Ley 1992, Gilmore and Snedaker 1993) but based on the limited data are also utilized extensively by fishery organisms. Large aquatic predators appear to enter this mangrove community through the tidal tributary habitat. Because this habitat type (at least the creek edges) is flooded most of the time, this can serve as habitat for both resident and transient species (Table 4). Predaceous fishes common to this mangrove habitat are juvenile bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), ladyfish (Elops saurus), snook\n27\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n(Centropomus undecimalis), jewfish (Epinephalus itajara), gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Turtles, crocodiles and alligators also forage in these habitats.\nThe mangrove basin habitat (Spatial Guild V) is the harshest mangrove habitat type (see earlier), and is characterized by separation from tidal water by a berm and seasonal changes in water and thus availability for fishery resources . The more abundant fishes found in this habitat type are cyprinodontiform species such as killifish, mosquitofish and mollies. These species do provide food resources for surrounding habitats during periods of flooding when there is exchange with the adjoining estuary or riverine system.\n28\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 4.\n\nHabitat and Microhabitat Distribution of Organisms Showing an\n\nAssociation with Mangrove Forest Habitats of the Southeastern United States (Source:\n\nGilmore and Snedaker 1993).\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nHabitat\n\nSpecies\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nSublittoral/Littoral Mangrove Guild: Spatial (Red Mangrove Fringe, Riverine and Overwash\n\nRESIDENTS-SESSILE Tunicates\nCrustaceans\nMolloscs\n\nBlack tunicate,Ascidia niger\n\nMangrove tunicate,Ecteinascidia\n\nBarnacle, Balanus eburneus\n\nMangrove\n\nSphaeroma terebans\n\nEastern white slipper Crepidula plana\n\nEastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica\n\nTree oysters, Isognomon spp.\n\nBroad ribbed\n\nCarditamera\n\nMossy ark, Arca imbricata\n\nScorched mussel,Branchidontes\n\nWood boring\n\nMartesia\n\nRESIDENTS-MOBILE Molluscs\nCrustaceans Teleosts\n\nKeyhole limpet,Diodora cayensis\n\nCrown conch,Melogena corona\n\nLightning Busycon\n\nRock shells,Thais spp.\n\nOyster drills,Urosalpinx spp.\n\nPisa snails,Pisania pusio\n\nCeriths, Cerithidea spp.\n\nDove snails,Anachis\n\nTurret snails, Turritella spp.\n\nBubble snails,Bulla striata\n\nMud snails, Nassarius spp.\n\nHerbst's\n\nPanopeus herbsti\n\nHarris mud crab, Rithropanopeus\n\nBroadback mud crab,Eurytium limosum\n\nSnapping shrimp,Synalpheus\n\nSailfin molley,Poecilia\n\nMosquitofish, Gambusia\n\nMangrove gambusia,G.

Habitat\n3.1.1.2.4 Information/Research Needs. Thayer et al. (In press) presented a discussion on research needs for mangrove systems\nbased on a NOAA Coastal Ocean Program-sponsored workshop held in 1988. The following summarizes this paper and is separated into 6 priority areas of information need.\n3.1.1.2.4.1 Food web-related information needs. The prevailing paradigm regarding food webs of mangrove-dominated estuarine\necosystems is that they are based on particulate mangrove detritus, but recent research indicates that the dissolved organic form may be equally important. Research is needed to determine the contribution of mangroves to estuarine secondary productivity relative to contributions by phytoplankton, benthic micro- and macroalgae, and seagrasses. Food web research needs to evaluate the significance of dissolved organic matter relative to particulate organic matter in trophic linkages and the distribution of higher trophic level organisms in various mangrove habitats in relation to gut contents and food linkages (e.g., as through the use of multiple stable isotopes).\n3.1.1.2.4.2 Information needs on productivity and structure of mangroves. Little effort has been devoted to understanding the relationships between structural and\nfunctional attributes of mangrove communities or how these relations change with development of the mangrove stand over time. There is a need to characterize the dynamic nature of mangrove productivity and its influence on the productivity of adjacent coastal habitats. Protocols need to be developed that will enable characterization of forest structure, successional status and type, remotely. The proportional contribution of mangroves to the total primary production of a given watershed or estuary is not well known. This should include quantification of rates of primary production of respective components and development and testing of predictive models of the factors that control primary production in mangrove estuaries. Research is needed on the ecological processes associated with recovery and succession of mangrove ecosystems including research on the restoration and resiliency of restored mangrove systems. Coupled with the above is research on the significance of hydrology on successional patterns in mangrove habitats. The close coupling of mangroves to other hydrologic units in the landscape suggests that alterations in regional hydrology may induce changes in mangrove vegetation and functional patterns.\n3.1.1.2.4.3 Habitat use information needs. Past research on the importance of mangrove habitats for fishes and invertebrates has\nfocused primarily on fringing red mangroves, and that has been limited. The white and black mangrove habitats have been poorly studied. Each habitat type may export organic matter that generates chemical cues regulating the presence or absence and abundance of estuarine organisms and thus, the predictable spatial and temporal patterns of marine life. Determining the types and numbers of organisms that exploit these habitats, the functional aspects of habitat use, and how mangrove organic matter is transferred to higher trophic levels is critical, and are requisites for modeling linkages between variations in mangrove productivity and variations in faunal abundances. This requires work that compares spatial and temporal variation in use, feeding ecology and growth patterns.\n33\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.1.1.2.4.4 Nutrient cycling information needs. Mangroves may influence nutrient dynamics and associated coastal productivity by either\nremoving or contributing nutrients to these systems, and data on their function in maintaining water quality of estuarine ecosystems is limited. Processes associated with the immobilization of nutrients within mangrove ecosystems such as microbial decomposition and enrichment processes, and recycling, need to receive attention.\n3.1.1.2.4.5 Restoration and Succession of damaged mangrove ecosystems. The effectiveness of mangrove restoration and creation projects in terms of mangrove\ncommunity productivity, stability and faunal utilization patterns are poorly understood. The time frame for reaching natural growth and production rates has not been followed nor have the time courses for development of biogeochemical cycles and natural fish and invertebrate communities. Research also is needed to determine the effects of natural and human-induced perturbations on microbial decomposition and enrichment processes and on the significance of sea-level variations as factors contributing to successional patterns, habitat loss, and nutrient cycling processes.\n3.1.1.2.4.6 Synthesis and modeling needs. Ecological models can be used in conjunction with field and laboratory approaches to\nobtain a better understanding of the role of mangroves in coastal ecosystems and to develop predictions of success of restoration designs. Scientists and managers need to synthesize extant information of ecological processes that address key management issues of mangrove habitats. Mapping efforts need to be expanded to provide information on the distribution of this important habitat type.\n3.1.1.3 Ecological Value of Seagrasses and Their Function as Essential Fish Habitat This section is intended to briefly summarize the most important aspects of marine\nseagrasses which pertain directly to their distribution, abundance and function as essential fish habitat in the South Atlantic region of the United States. For an extensive and comprehensive ecological profile of seagrasses growing in the South Atlantic region we recommend two U.S. Department of Interior Community Profiles: Thayer et al. (1984) and Zieman (1982). A recent symposium on Biodiversity in the Indian River Lagoon published in Volume 57 of the Bulletin of Marine Science (Swain et al. 1995) is an excellent compendium of the biology, ecology and biodiversity of seagrass communities on the east coast of Florida. Another important source document is the Symposium on Subtropical-Tropical Seagrasses of the Southeastern United States (Durako et al. 1987). Additionally, three published books on the general biology and ecology of seagrasses have information pertaining directly to use of seagrass habitat by managed species and their food sources (McRoy and Helfferich 1977, Phillips and McRoy 1980, Larkum et al. 1989). Finally, \"The relationship of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) ecological value to species managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC): summary for the ASMFC SAV Subcommittee\" by R. Wilson Laney (1997) provides detailed descriptions and literature citations of seagrass use by species managed by ASMFC and the South Atlantic Council.\n34\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.1.1.3.1 Seagrass Species and Their Geographic Distribution in the South Atlantic Region\nOut of the estimated 250,000 flowering plants existing on earth today, only about 60 species have adapted to life in the marine environment (den Hartog 1970). Collectively, we refer to this group of submersed aquatic vascular plants (SAV) as seagrasses. Seaweeds (macroalgae) are often mistakenly referred to as \"grasses\". Despite the fact that they frequently co-occur and provide similar ecological services, these two plant taxa have distinctly different growth forms and contrasting life requirements. Taxonomically, seagrasses are divided into two families and 12 genera (den Hartog 1971, Phillips and Meinez 1988). At least 13 species of seagrass occur in United States waters, with the exception of Georgia and South Carolina where highly turbid freshwater discharges, suspended sediments and a large tidal amplitude combine to prevent their permanent establishment. In the remainder of the south Atlantic region there are 6 genera of seagrasses represented by 8 species, ranging in size from the three smallest, Halophila decipiens, Halophila engelmannii and Halophila johnsonii, to the relatively larger genera, Zostera marina, Ruppia maritima, Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme and Thalassia testudinum (Figures 4 and 5). Maps are included in Appendix C that present general seagrass distribution by estuarine drainage area in the south Atlantic region.\nThe three seagrass species growing in North Carolina, Z. marina, H. wrightii and R. maritima, are all found within coastal lagoons, protected inland waterways and river mouths protected by barrier islands. There are no known open ocean seagrass meadows in North Carolina. The remaining five species plus H. wrightii all occur in Florida and may be found in protected inland waters as well as oceanic environments. In north central, central, and southeast Florida all of the seagrasses occur within protected coastal lagoons and in the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). Beginning around the Palm Beach area and continuing south through the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), Halophila decipiens is found on offshore sandy sediments to a depth of approximately 30 m. Open ocean meadows of Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme and Thalassia testudinum begin just south of Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay and continue through the FKNMS in water depths up to approximately 30-40 m. The majority of seagrass biomass is distributed in the subtidal zone; however, all of the species, with the exception of H. decipiens, can be found growing in the intertidal zone where they may experience periods of exposure and desiccation.\n35\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nFigure 4. 1997).\n\nIllustration of seagrass species in the South Atlantic Region (Source: NMFS\n\n36\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.1.1.3.2 Seagrass Meadow Dynamics As in terrestrial grasslands, individual seagrasses and associated species form\nrecognizable biological and physical assemblages known as seagrass meadows. The meadows are usually defined by a visible boundary delineating unvegetated and vegetated substrate and vary in size from small, isolated patches of plants less than a meter in diameter to a continuous distribution of grass tens of square kilometers in area. Seagrass meadows are dynamic spatial and temporal features of the coastal landscape (den Hartog 1971, Patriquin 1975). In the south Atlantic region all seagrasses occur on unconsolidated sediments in a wide range of physical settings and different stages of meadow development leading to a variety of cover patterns, ranging from patchy to continuous. Seagrass beds developing from seed and mature beds in relatively high energy environments may have similar patchy signatures, but very different physical and chemical characteristics (Kenworthy et al. 1982). Depending on the species and the environmental conditions, a meadow may attain full development in a few months (e.g., Halophila spp.). Meadows that develop rapidly usually reproduce by seed, forming annual meadows that completely disappear during unfavorable growing conditions. For example, on the east and southeast coast of Florida between Sebastian Inlet in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) and North Biscayne Bay, H. decipiens forms annual meadows in water generally deeper than 1.5-2.0 m (Dawes et al. 1995). These depths are where the winter light levels cannot support the larger perennial species such as R. maritima, H. wrightii, S. filiforme and T. testudinum (Kenworthy and Fonseca 1996). In the relatively deeper water the smaller opportunistic H. decipiens is capable of germinating seeds in summer months when light levels are adequate. This life history strategy, combined with a thin leaf structure, minimal self shading, and relatively low nonphotosynthetic biomass make the genus Halophila ideally suited for growth in fluctuating and highly disturbed environments (Kenworthy et al. 1989).\nThese dynamic features of seagrass meadows are not just restricted to the genus Halophila. In North Carolina annual meadows of a large bodied species, Z. marina, are common in shallow, protected embayments where excessively high (> 300 C) summer water temperatures eliminate eelgrass beds that thrive in winter and spring when water temperatures are optimal (Thayer et al. 1984). These shallow embayments are replenished annually by seed stocks of eelgrass, whereas in North Carolina during the summer months when water temperatures exceed 25-30o C, eelgrass thrives only in relatively deeper water or on tidal flats where water movement is nearly continuous so that the plants are insulated from lethal temperatures and desiccation. In general, whether they are found in the warm temperate coastal waters of North Carolina or the subtropical environment in southeastern Florida, seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of seagrass biomass in the subtidal is normal (Dawes et al. 1995). The range of these seasonal fluctuations tends to increase from south Florida to North Carolina. North Carolina is a special case where seasonal fluctuations may be minimized in water bodies and meadows where Z. marina and H. wrightii co-occur. These two species are at their southern (eelgrass) and northern (shoalgrass) range limits, and when one species is limited by seasonal thermal extremes the other species may be abundant.\n37\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 5. Illustration and table of the distribution of seagrasses in the South Atlantic Region (Source: NMFS 1998).\nAlternatively, meadows formed by the larger bodied species which have either limited or irregular sexual reproduction, may require decades to reach full maturity. For example, the\n38\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nslowest growing species in the south Atlantic region, T. testudinum, produces relatively few fruits and seeds at irregular intervals (Tomlinson 1969, Moffler and Durako 1987). When turtlegrass is compared to its' congeners, H. wrightii and S. filiforme, it has the slowest rate of vegetative expansion (Fonseca et al. 1987). Depending on the environmental conditions, rates of vegetative expansion for H. wrightii and S. filiforme are normally 4 to 10 times faster than T. testudinum. Thus, T. testudinum meadows form more slowly than any of the other species, yet if the environmental conditions allow the full development of a turtlegrass meadow its biomass and productivity will usually exceed any other seagrass (Zieman 1982).\nRegardless of developmental stage or species composition, small seagrass patches and entire meadows can move, the rate of which may also vary on a scale of hours to decades. These dynamic spatial and temporal features of seagrass meadows are important aspects of fishery habitats. Seagrass habitats must be recognized as including not only continuously vegetated perennial beds but also patchy environments with the unvegetated areas between patches as part of the habitat. In fact, available data show that patchy habitats provide many ecological functions similar to continuous meadows (Murphey and Fonseca 1995, Fonseca et al. 1996). Also, it must be recognized that the absence of seagrasses in a particular location does not necessarily mean that the location is not viable seagrass habitat. It could mean that the present conditions are unfavorable for growth, and the duration of this condition could vary from months to years.\n3.1.1.3.3 Threats to Seagrass Systems Like all other organisms and habitats in estuarine-near shore environments, seagrasses\noccur at the end of all watershed inputs: the juncture between riverine inflow and oceanic inputs as well as the interface between land and sea. This situation makes them extremely susceptible to perturbations by natural processes as well as being susceptible to damage by human activities.\nIn the south Atlantic region seagrasses experience natural disturbances such as bioturbation (stingray foraging), storm or wave-related scour (tropical storms and surges), and disease or disease-associated perturbations (Labyrinthula), as well as man-related impacts (Short and Wyllie-Echeverria 1996). Especially problematic are excessive epiphytic loads and smothering by transient macroalgae, both of which are often associated with nutrient enrichment. Excessive nutrient discharges and suspended sediments can also disrupt seagrass systems by causing water column algal blooms that diminish the amount of light available for benthic dwelling seagrasses (Dennison et al. 1993). Often, nutrient enrichment will have detrimental effects that cascade up and down the food webs of seagrass meadows by diminishing the dissolved oxygen concentrations, forming toxic concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and diminishing the ability of a meadow to filter and stabilize sediments, thus altering the water column environment for filter feeders and primary producers.\nSubtidal seagrasses have suffered little damage from oil spills whereas impacts on intertidal beds have been significant ( Durako et al. 1993, Kenworthy et al. 1993). Oil spillrelated impacts on the seagrass-associated fauna can range from smothering to lowered stress tolerance, reduced market values and incorporation of carcinogenic and mutagenic substances into the food chain. Other well-known impacts such as dredge and fill operations are no longer a primary cause of major losses of seagrass habitat due to the recognition of their ecological role and vigilance of state and federal regulatory activities relative to permits. This human-related impact, although still present, is now being replaced by that associated with propeller scouring (Sargent et al. 1995) and some fishing gear-related impacts (Fonseca et al. 1984). This physical damage is long-lasting and often results in sediment destabilization and continued habitat loss.\n39\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe increasing number of small boats plying estuarine and coastal waters has made the propscarring impacts more widespread, and there has been a recognized need in some regions for both enhanced management of these systems and increased awareness by the boating public.\nWater quality and, in particular, water clarity is now considered among the most critical, if not the most critical, factor in the maintenance of healthy SAV habitats. In the past few years it has become increasingly evident that, with few exceptions, seagrasses generally require light intensities reaching the leaves of 15-25% of the surface incident light (Kenworthy and Fonseca 1996, Gallegos and Kenworthy 1996, Onuf 1996). However, water transparency standards historically have been based on light requirements of phytoplankton which typically require only 1% of surface light (Kenworthy and Haunert 1991). Many factors act to reduce water column transparency, with excess suspended solids and nutrients being considered to be among the most important and most controllable through watershed management practices.\nThe loss of seagrasses, regardless of the cause, leads to several undesirable, and often difficult to reverse, situations that reflect on aquatic vascular plant ecological values. Losses can and have led to reduced sediment binding and water motion baffling capability of the habitat allowing sediments to be more readily resuspended and moved (Fonseca 1996). The physical ramification includes increased shoreline erosion (e.g., as occurred in some areas after the seagrass die-off in the 1930's) and water column turbidity. The losses of seagrasses, of course, eliminates all important associated habitat functions pertinent to fisheries use.\n3.1.1.3.4 Seagrass As Essential Fish Habitat Because seagrasses are rooted, they can become nearly permanent, long-term features of\ncoastal marine and estuarine ecosystems coupling unconsolidated sediments to the water column. No other marine plant is capable of providing these properties of seagrasses. Seagrass meadows provide substrates and environmental conditions which are essential to the feeding, spawning and growth of several managed species (see Laney 1997, Zieman, 1982, Thayer et al. 1984). The specific basis of seagrass as fishery habitat is recognized in four interrelated features of the meadows: 1) primary productivity, 2) structural complexity, 3) modification of energy regimes and sediment and shoreline stabilization, and 4) nutrient cycling.\nOn a unit area basis seagrasses are among the most productive ecosystems in the world (McRoy and McMillan 1977) . High rates of primary production lead to the formation of complex, three dimensional physical structures consisting of a canopy of leaves and roots and rhizomes buried in the sediments. The presence of this physical structure provides substrate for attachment of organisms, shelter from predators, frictional surface area for modification of water flow and wave turbulence, sediment and organic matter deposition, and the physical binding of sediments underneath the canopy. Linked together by nutrient absorbing surfaces on the leaves and roots and a functional vascular system, seagrass organic matter cycles and stores nutrients, and provides both direct and indirect nutritional benefits to thousands of species of herbivores and detritivores.\nPrimary productivity. Seagrass meadows provide four important sources of primary organic matter, 1) their own tissues, 2) dissolved organic matter released from their tissues during metabolism, 3) the epiphytic microscopic and macroscopic plants that attach to the surfaces of the seagrass leaves, and 4) the plants that live on the sediments among the seagrass shoots. Some fishery organisms consume seagrasses directly, but the majority of the secondary fishery production in the meadows begins with the consumption of epiphyte communities, benthic algae and the utilization of organic detritus. Thus, the food webs supported by seagrass primary\n40\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nproduction are complex and include many intermediate steps involving microorganisms, meiofauna, small invertebrates such as isopods, amphipods as well as the thousands of species of macroinfauna and epifauna in the sediments on the sediment surface and in the water column.\nStructural complexity. Leaf canopies formed by seagrasses range in size from just a few cm (Halophila spp.) to more than a meter tall. Where several species co-occur, the three dimensional canopy may take on multiple layers and forms, with long (1.25 m) cylindrical stems and blade surfaces (S. filiforme) combined with relatively shorter strap-shaped leaves (T. testudinum or H. wrightii). No matter what species are present, the existence of leaf surfaces provides structures for attachment of smaller organisms and space between shoots for shelter from predators and adverse environmental conditions. The leaf area in a seagrass meadow may effectively increase the colonizeable substrate per square meter by an order of magnitude compared to an unvegetated substrate. While at the same time, the leaves and stems create a large volume of water column sheltered within the canopy and partially obscured by self shading of the leaves. Within the canopy there is an enormous physico-chemical microenvironment structured and maintained by the seagrasses. This structural influence extends into the sediments where the roots and rhizomes stabilize the substrate and form a large pool organic biomass and a matrix for meiofauna and macrofauna (Kenworthy and Thayer 1984).\nModification of energy regimes and sediment stabilization. The leaf surfaces and the collective structure of the canopy provide frictional drag forces which slows water motion and reduces wave turbulence. This process promotes the deposition of particles in the meadows, including but not restricted to inorganic sediments, dead organic matter and living organisms. The addition of all of these materials enhances the productivity, stability, and biodiversity of coastal systems with seagrasses. By promoting sediment deposition and stabilization, coastal habitats coupled to seagrasses meadows by water movement receive both direct and indirect benefits.\nNutrient cycling. The high rates of primary production and particle deposition make seagrass meadows important sources and sinks of nutrients. During active periods of growth the constant and high rate of leaf turnover and epiphyte growth provides nutrients for herbivores and a mechanism for nutrient export and retention. Temporary and permanent retention of nutrients within seagrass meadows is encouraged by particle deposition and burial as well as the formation of organic matter in the sediments by the roots and rhizomes. Seagrasses are sensitive to the availability and abundance of nutrients in their surrounding environment and often retain nutrient signatures representing environmental conditions they have experienced, both spatially and temporally (Fourqurean et al. 1992). The variation in tissue nutrient composition is an important factor in fishery utilization of seagrass derived organic matter.\n3.1.1.3.5 Specific Examples of Seagrass As Essential Fish Habitat From the standpoint of essential fish habitat, being submerged most if not all of the time,\nseagrasses are available to fishery organisms for extended periods. There has been a growth of research over the past 30 years trying to understand and quantify functional values of seagrass ecosystems. Experiments and observations have shown that juvenile and adult invertebrates and fishes as well as their food sources utilize seagrass beds extensively. In fact, the habitat heterogeneity of seagrass meadows, the plant biomass, and the surface area enhance faunal abundances. Predator-prey relationships in seagrass beds are influenced by canopy structure,\n41\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nshoot density, and surface area. Blade density interferes with the efficiency of foraging predators and the reduction of light within the leafy canopy further conceals small prey which includes young-of-the-year of many ecologically and economically important species. High density of seagrass shoots and plant surface area can inhibit movement of larger predators, thereby affording shelter to their prey. Additionally, some organisms can orient themselves with the seagrass blades and camouflage themselves by changing coloration. The food availability within grass beds for young stages of managed species may be virtually unlimited. These attributes are particularity beneficial to the nursery function of seagrass beds and while there is continuing debate and research on whether refugia or trophic functions are most important (when and to which organisms), there is little debate that these are important functions provided by this habitat type.\nPerhaps seagrass meadows are best known for their source of attachment and/or protection for bay scallops (Argopectin irradians) and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria). Scientific evidence also indicates that blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), pink and brown shrimp (Penaeus duorarum, P. aztecus), and lobster (Panulirus argus), just to name a few invertebrates, have a strong reliance on seagrass habitats including seagrass-supported trophic intermediaries.\nThere have been few studies dealing with larval fish settlement and use of seagrass habitats while there have been numerous publications listing juvenile and adult fishes collected in seagrass meadows. One might expect, however that some of the same functions described above hold true for larvae. Seagrass beds are important for the brooding of eggs (for example, silverstripe halfbeak, Hyporhamphus unifasciatus) and for fishes with demersal eggs (e.g., rough silverside, Membras martinica). Larvae of spring-summer spawners such as anchovies (Anchoa spp.), gobies, (Gobiosoma spp.), pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), rough silverside, feather blenny (Hypsoblennius hentz), and halfbeaks are present and use seagrass beds. In regions of North Carolina where there is often year-round cover of seagrass (eelgrass and shoalgrass), larval and early juvenile fishes are present in these beds during much of the year. Lists of these species are presented in referenced literature and policy statements, but it should be pointed out here that larvae and juveniles of important commercial and sportfish such as gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis), snapper (Lutjanus griseus), seatrout or weakfish, bluefish (Prionotus saltatrix), mullet (Mugil spp.), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonius undulatus), flounder (Paralichthys spp.), herrings (Clupeidae), and many other species appear in seagrass beds in spring and early summer. Many of these fish reside only temporarily in grass beds either to forage, spawn, or escape predation. Some species reside there until the fall when they return to the open coastal shelf waters to spawn. As is noted by the SAFMC's SAV protection policy, economically important species use these habitats for nursery and/or spawning grounds (Section 5.2.1.1): including spotted seatrout, grunts (Haemulids), snook (Centropomus spp.), bonefish (Albula vulpes), tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and several species of snapper and grouper.\nFor the most part, the organisms discussed above utilize the grass bed structure and trophic elements associated with the bed, but many species of herbivorous invertebrates (e.g., urchins Lytechinus variegatus, Tripneustes ventricosus), birds (e.g., black brant Branta bernicla), fishes (e.g., pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, parrotfish Sparisoma radians), the green turtle (Chelonia midas) and the manatee (Trichechus manatus) feed directly upon coastal and estuarine seagrasses. Work on green turtles in North Carolina has shown a higher incidence of capture in pound nets set in grass beds than by nets set in unvegetated areas. Grazing can have profound\n42\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\neffects on the system, but the consequences are neither uniform nor of similar importance in both tropical and temperate seagrasses (Thayer et al 1984).\nThe seasonal patterns of reproduction and development of many temperate fishery species coincide with seasonal abundances of seagrasses. It has been concluded in several studies that, although juvenile fish and shellfish can use other types of habitat, the bulk of the shelter in many estuarine systems is provided by seagrasses, and that the loss or reduction of this habitat will produce concomitant declines in juvenile fish settlement. Thus, this habitat type may be essential to many species of commercial, recreational and ecologically important shellfish and finfish.\n3.1.1.3.6 Aspects of Conservation and Restoration The recognition of the ecological role of seagrass habitats has prompted a need to\nconserve, and more recently protect these habitats by avoiding impacts (i.e., proactive management). This is a less costly and an environmentally sounder means of protecting this important resource than either mitigation or restoration. None-the-less, seagrass habitats have been and continue to be impacted or lost, and restoration efforts have broadened to include development and evaluation of new approaches to seagrass restoration and measurements of recovery of functional values. In addition, programs are being developed at the local level to plant seagrasses for purposes of sediment stabilization, nutrient uptake, and fishery habitat. These programs and projects, which are often volunteer, consult with experts, utilize scientifically based guidelines, and monitor their restoration success. Research continues to evaluate current techniques and develop new approaches (e.g., clonal development). However, we have not found a restoration or mitigation project that has returned seagrass habitat equal to that which has been lost. Much has been written on techniques and evaluation of restoration of seagrasses along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. (Fonseca 1992). Data is showing that if seagrass transplanting is successful we can expect a similar faunal community to return within a few years (2-4 possibly), depending on the geographic area and rate of development of the transplant (Fonseca et al. 1996). There are many uncertainties associated with seagrass mitigation and restoration such as impacts of herbivory, but experience is showing that efforts can be successful if the well-founded guidelines available are followed.\n3.1.1.4 Oyster Reefs and Shell Banks 3.1.1.4.1 Introduction\nOyster and shell essential fish habitat in the South Atlantic can be defined as the natural structures found between (intertidal) and beneath (subtidal) tide lines, that are composed of oyster shell, live oysters and other organisms that are discrete, contiguous and clearly distinguishable from scattered oysters in marshes and mudflats, and from wave-formed shell windrows (Bahr and Lanier 1981). Both intertidal and subtidal populations are found in the tidal creeks and estuaries of the South Atlantic. On the Atlantic coast, the range of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica, extends over a wide latitude (20\u00b0 N to 54\u00b0 N). The ecological conditions encountered are diverse and the oyster community is not uniform throughout this range. Where the tidal range is large the oyster builds massive, discrete reefs in the intertidal zone. North of Cape Lookout, in North Carolina, the oyster habitat is dominated by Pamlico Sound and its tributaries. In these wind-driven lagoonal systems, oyster assemblages consist mainly of subtidal beds. Throughout the South Atlantic, oysters are found at varying distances up major drainage basins depending upon typography, salinity, substrate, and other variables.\n43\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSeveral terms used to describe the oyster/shell essential fish habitat are oyster reef, bar, bed, rock, ground and planting. The habitat ranges in size from small scattered clumps to large mounds of living oysters and dead shells. Predation and siltation limit oyster densities at the lower portion and outer regions of the reefs. The vertical elevation of intertidal oyster reefs above mean low water is maximal within the central Georgia coastal zone, where mean tidal amplitude exceeds 2 m (Bahr and Lanier 1981).\nThe existence of shell middens and well defined constructions of shell rings throughout South Carolina, indicates the intertidal oyster has been cultivated and harvested for at least 4,000 years by pre-historic Indians of the coastal plain. In the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, a successful canning industry, taking advantage of the thin, highly irregular clusters of intertidal oysters thrived throughout South Carolina, with nearly 20 canneries in production (Keith and Gracy 1972). In conjunction with industry exploitation, the shellfish resource has, and continues to serve as a critical habitat for ecosystem stability and health. Usually found adjacent to emergent marsh vegetation, Crassostrea virginica provides the only threedimensional structural relief in an otherwise unvegetated, soft-bottom, benthic habitat (Wenner et al. 1996).\nLarge shell banks or deposits of oyster valves generated by boat wakes are found throughout the South Atlantic, usually along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and heavily traveled rivers. These shell accumulations are usually elongated and conform to the underlying bottom topography from mean low water into the supra littoral zone. Further build-up may result in ridge structures and washovers. In South Carolina, 998 \"washed shell\" deposits have been located predominantly in the central and southern portion of the State. Washed shell is less resilient, partially abraded oyster shell with a lower specific gravity than recently shucked shells (Anderson 1979).\n3.1.1.4.2 Habitat Description and Environmental Requirements Habitat and environmental conditions are the limiting factors controlling oyster\nabundance. Optimal salinity and temperature ranges for Crassostrea virginica are 12 ppt to 25 ppt and 10\u00b0 C to 26\u00b0 C, respectively. Oysters, the typical estuarine animal, tolerate extremes in salinity ( 5 ppt and 30 ppt), temperature (0\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C), turbidity and dissolved oxygen. Favorable salinity and temperature regimes are important criteria for successful reproduction and spawning. Spat settlement and survival are best on clean, firm surfaces, such as oyster shell exposed to good water circulation. The oyster reef depends on water currents to provide food and oxygen, remove wastes and sediments, and disperse larvae.\nIn South Carolina, oysters are predominantly 95% intertidal (Lunz 1952) and this preferred water and exposed habitat is from slightly below mean low water to approximately one meter above MLW (Sandifer et al. 1980). Oysters usually attach to shells on a mud flat, and as other oysters attach in succeeding generations, increased weight may cause them to recede into the mud, but provide a vertical substrate (or shell matrix) for subsequent spatfall (Burrell 1986). Generally, oyster setting in South Carolina occurs from early May through early October (McNulty 1953). Slightly more than 1% of spatfall occurs at other times during the year. Two setting pulses are usually noted each season. The highest settlement occurs from early June through July, and a second and lesser peak takes place during August or early September. Considerable setting intensity may also occur before, between and after the two pulses (McNulty 1953).\nIntertidal oyster growth varies significantly with temperature, quantity and quality of food. Oysters grow throughout the year unless exposed to extreme temperatures or other adverse\n44\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nenvironmental conditions. The eggs, early embryos, and larvae are eaten by protozoans, ctenophores, jellyfishes, hydroids, worms, bivalves, barnacles, larval and adult crustaceans, and fishes (Loosanoff 1965). In South Carolina, oyster predatory studies have been primarily concerned with pests found on natural beds. Lunz (1935, 1940, 1941, 1943) reported the following commonly occurring oyster pests and predators: the boring sponges Cliona spp; the oyster drills Urosalpinx cinerea and Eupleura caudata; the knobbed whelk Busycon carica; the annelid worm Polydora spp. and the starfish Asterias forbesii. Of these, boring sponges probably cause the greatest damage to South Carolina oysters (Lunz 1943).\n3.1.1.4.3 Habitat Distribution The most extensive contiguous intertidal oyster reefs in the South Atlantic region occur\nin the South Carolina coastal zone. These reefs diminish in size and significance south of Georgia and north of South Carolina (Bahr and Lanier 1981). SCDNR conducted an extensive survey of intertidal oyster resources beginning in 1980 and maintains the data in its Geographic Information System (Anderson, personal comm. 1998) (examples on SAFMC Web page).\nNorth Carolina initiated a GIS mapping program to document distribution of estuarine shell habitats including 7 subtidal and intertidal strata. These and an example of South Carolina detailed ArcView maps are are presented in Appendix D and have been added to the GIS data and map products used to determine EFH.\n3.1.1.4.4 Habitat Function Intertidal oysters have often been described as the \"keystone\" species in an estuary (Bahr\nand Lanier 1981) and provide significant surface area as habitat. Sometimes compared to submerged aquatic vegetation in the mid-Atlantic states, the intertidal oyster community has been identified as critical to a healthy ecosystem. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (filtering capacity, benthic-pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived from the oyster have been largely ignored or underestimated (Coen and Lukenbach 1998). Oyster reefs can remove, via filter feeding, large amounts of particulate material from the water column, and release large quantities of inorganic and organic nutrients into tidal creek waters (Haven and Morales-Alamo 1970; Dame and Dankers 1988; Dame et al. 1989).\nThe ecological role of the oyster reef as structure, providing food and protection, contribute to it's value as a critical fisheries habitat. The three-dimensional oyster reef provides more area for attachment of oysters and other sessile organisms and creates more habitat niches than occur on the surrounding flat or soft bottom habitat. Clams, mussels, anemones, polychaetes, amphipods, sponges, and many species of crabs are part of the oyster reef community. The invertebrates recycle nutrients and organic matter, and are prey for many finfish. Red and black drum, striped bass, sheepshead, weakfish, spotted seatrout, summer and southern flounder, oystertoads, and other fish frequent the oyster reef. Table 5 presents select macrofaunal species observed in collections from oyster habitat located in the southeastern United States. Starfish, sea urchins, and whelks, as well as racoons and wading birds, also come to the reef for food.\n45\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 5.\n\nList of select macrofaunal species observed in collections from oyster habitat\n\nlocated in the southeastern United States (Source NMFS 1997.)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSpecies\n\nCommon Name\n\nZone\n\nFisheries Value\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCRUSTACEANS\n\nBalanus spp.\n\nBalanoid barnacles\n\nI\n\nP\n\nAlpheus heterochaelis\n\nsnappimg shrimp\n\nI\n\nP\n\nCallinectes sapidus\n\nblue crab\n\nI/S\n\nR/C/P\n\nCrangon septemspinosa\n\nsand shrimp\n\nI\n\nP\n\nEurypanopeus depressus\n\nflat mud crab\n\nI\n\nP\n\nMennipe mercenaria\n\nstone crab\n\nI/S\n\nR/C/P\n\nPalaemonetes spp.\n\ngrass shrimp\n\nI/S\n\nP\n\nPanopeus herbstii\n\nmud crab\n\nI/S\n\nP\n\nPaguridea\n\nhermit crabs\n\nI\n\nP/C\n\nPenaeus duorarum\n\npink shrimp\n\nI\n\nR/C/P\n\nPinnotheres ostreum\n\noyster crab\n\nI\n\nP\n\nUpogebia affinis\n\nmud shrimp\n\nI\n\nP\n\nMOLLUSCS\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBusycon spp.\n\nwhelk\n\nI\n\nR/C/P\n\nCrassostrea virginica\n\neastern oyster\n\nI/S\n\nR/C/P\n\nAnadara ovalis\n\nblood ark\n\nI\n\nP\n\nChaetopleura apiculata\n\ncommon eastern chiton I\n\nP\n\nChione cancellata\n\ncross-barred venus\n\nI\n\nR/P\n\nDinocardium robustum\n\ngiant Atlantic cockle\n\nI\n\nR/C/P\n\nMercenaria mercenaria\n\nhard clam\n\nI\n\nR/C/P\n\nMytiladae\n\nmussels\n\nI\n\nP\n\nTagelus spp.\n\nrazor clam\n\nI\n\nP\n\nUrosalpix cinerea\n\noyster drill\n\nI\n\nP\n\nFISH\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArchosargus probatocehalus\n\nsheepshead\n\nI/S\n\nR/C/P\n\nBairdiella chrysoura\n\nsilver perch\n\nS\n\nR/P\n\nBlenniidae\n\nblennies\n\nS\n\nP\n\nCentropristis striata\n\nblack sea bass\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nChaetodipterus faber\n\nspadefish\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nCynoscion regalis\n\nweakfish\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nCynoscion nebulosus\n\nspotted trout\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nFundulus heteroclitus\n\nmummichog\n\nI\n\nP/C\n\nGobiidae\n\nGobies\n\nI/S\n\nP\n\nGobiesox strumosus\n\nskilletfish\n\nS\n\nP\n\nLeiostomus xanthurus\n\nspot\n\nI\n\nR/C/P\n\nLagodon rhomboides\n\npinfish\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nLutjanus griseus\n\ngray snapper\n\nI/S\n\nR/C/P\n\nMicropogonias undulatus\n\nAtlantic croaker\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nMyrophis punctatus\n\nspeckled worm eel\n\nI\n\nP\n\nOpsanus tau\n\noyster toadfish\n\nI/S\n\nP\n\nOrthopristis chrysoptera\n\npigfish\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nParalichthys lethostigma\n\nsouthern flounder\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nPogonias cromis\n\nblack drum\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nPomatomus saltatrix\n\nbluefish\n\nS\n\nR/C/P\n\nSymphurus plagiusa\n\nblack cheek tonguefish I\n\nP\n\nLetter codes for the Zone heading (in which zone species were collected) are I = intertidal, S = Subtidal; and for the\n\nFisheries Value heading are R = recreational, C = commercial, P = prey species.\n\n46\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.1.1.4.5 Species Composition The intertidal oyster habitat consists primarily of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica.\nAnother commercially important bivalve, the northern quahog or Mercenaria mercenaria often exists sympatrically with Crassostrea, which provides predator protection for juvenile clams. Epifauna associated with oyster beds was examined in South Carolina by Hopkins (1956). Beds in high salinity waters exhibited the greatest number (21) of associated species (Sandifer, 1980).\nFouling organisms such as barnacles (Balanus eburneus), bryozoans (Bugula neritina), sea squirts (Molgula manhattensis), and hooked mussels (Ischadium recurvum) are commonly observed growing on oysters (Linton 1970). Infestations by mud worms (Polydora spp.) are common (Lunz 1940, Grice 1951). In the North Santee River, South Carolina, the boring clam Martesia sp. was reported at several stations. A widespread pathogen (Perkinsus marinus) \"Dermo\" and most recently, (Haplosporidium nelsoni) \"MSX\" are both found in South Carolina (Bobo et al. 1997) and may present a problem when transplanting seed oysters. A common oyster commensal or parasite, the pea crab Pinnotheres ostreum, is found throughout the estuarine waters of the State. Oyster reefs in high salinity waters are also an important habit for juveniles of several important fish species such as sheepshead, Archosargus probatocephalus, gag grouper Mycteroperca microlepis, and snapper Lutjanus spp., as well as stone crab Menippe mercenaria and blue crab Calinectes sapidus and other transient and resident species (Wenner et al. 1996).\n3.1.1.4.6 Habitat Restoration Efforts Conservation efforts in South Carolina consist of restoring over fished reef areas and\nrequiring culture permit holders to plant 125 U.S. bushels of oysters or shell for each acre under cultivation. Passive management of 56 State shellfish grounds occurs as designated harvest areas are closed for periods to allow for natural setting and grow out. The State actively manages public shellfish grounds utilizing its R/V Oyster Catcher II, a 50' x 20' vessel to plant seed and shell in 17 areas, averaging 2.3 acres of shellfish habitat, and designated for recreational harvesting only. In addition, quarterly meetings are held with the State's Department of Health and Environmental Control to prioritize shellfish resource areas that would benefit from upgrading water quality.\n3.1.1.5 Geographic Distribution and Dynamics of Intertidal Flats in the South Atlantic Region\nThis section is intended to briefly summarize the most important aspects of tidal flats which pertain directly to their function as essential fish habitat. For a more extensive and comprehensive ecological profile of tidal flats in the South Atlantic region we recommend the U.S. Department of Interior Community Profile, Peterson and Peterson (1979).\n3.1.1.5.1 Introduction Tidal flats are dynamic features of coastal landscapes whose distribution and character\nmay change with shifting patterns of sediment erosion and deposition. Factors that effect the regional character of tidal flats include tidal range, prevailing weather patterns, coastal geography and geology, river influences and human activities. These factors may effect tidal flats as a result of seasonal shifts in tides, winds or river flow and through the influence of storms. Human activities that change flow patterns or sediment supply such as dam and jetty construction, dredging and filling are also important. In areas with a small tide, wind and waves\n47\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nare generally the most important factors in the formation of tidal flats with the exception of locations near tidal inlets (where tidal currents may be important) and river mouths (where river deltas may develop). In areas with moderate to large tidal ranges (>2m), tidal currents are generally the dominant factor in the formation and dynamics of tidal flats.\nVariability in the tidal regime along the South Atlantic coast results in considerable regional variability in the distribution and character of the estimated 1 million acres (Field et al. 1991) of tidal flat habitat. Geographic patterns in sediment size on tidal flats result primarily from the interaction of tidal currents and wind energy. The coasts of North Carolina and Florida are largely microtidal (0-2m tidal range) with extensive barrier islands and relatively few inlets to extensive sound systems. In these areas wind energy has a strong affect on intertidal flats. In contrast the coast of South Carolina and Georgia are mesotidal (2-3.3m) with short barrier islands and numerous tidal inlets so that tidal currents are the primary force effecting the intertidal. In both types of systems the substrate of the intertidal flats generally becomes finer with distance from inlets due to the progressive damping of tidal currents and wave energy in the upstream direction. Exposure of flats to wave energy, which resuspends fine particles, may cause the development of sand flats in areas where the wind fetch is sufficient for the development of significant wave energy. On the microtidal coast of North Carolina sandy flats tend to develop due to the large size of the sounds and their orientation relative to prevailing winds. In contrast in Georgia and South Carolina most flats are muddy, as the sounds and estuaries are small so that the importance of wave energy is reduced. These different depositional environments result in development of varied physio chemical environments in and on intertidal flats which in turn cause differences in animal populations that utilize them.\n3.1.1.5.2 Tidal Flats as Essential Fish Habitat Tidal flats are critical structural components of coastal systems that serve as benthic\nnursery areas, refuges and feeding grounds for a variety of animals (Table 6) and thus provide essential fish habitat. In addition tidal flats play an important role in the ecological function of South Atlantic estuarine ecosystems, particularly in regard to primary production and water quality. The benthic microalgal community of tidal flats consists of benthic diatoms, cyanobacteria, euglenophytes and unicellular algae. Primary production of this community can equal or exceed phytoplankton primary production in the water column, and can represent a significant portion of overall estuarine primary productivity. Benthic microalgae also stabilize sediments and control fluxes of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) between the sediment and the water column. Autochthonous benthic microalgal and bacterial production and imported primary production in the form of phytoplankton and detritus support diverse and highly productive populations of infaunal and epibenthic animals. Important benthic animals in and on the sediments include ciliates, rotifers, nematodes, copepods, annalids, amphipods, bivalves and gastropods. This resident benthos is preyed upon by mobile predators that move onto the flats with the flood tide. These predators do not always kill their benthic prey and many \"nip\" appendages of buried animals such as clam siphons and polychaete tentacles that can be regenerated. An important aspect of the function of these systems is the regular ebb and flood of the tide over the flats and a corresponding rhythm exists in the animals and microalgae adapted to life in the intertidal zone. The flooding tide brings food and predators onto the flat while the ebb provides residents a temporal refuge from the mobile predators. This constantly changing system provides essential fish habitat as; 1) nursery grounds for early stages of development of many benthically oriented estuarine dependent species 2) refuges and feeding grounds for a\n48\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nvariety of forage species and juvenile fishes 3) feeding grounds for a variety of specialized predators. Although it is recognized that tidal flats provide these important ecological functions the relative contribution of intertidal flats of different types and in different locations within coastal systems is not well known.\n3.1.1.5.3 Benthic Nursery Function Many species whose larval stages are planktonic but are benthically oriented as\njuveniles utilize intertidal flats as primary nursery ground. Intertidal flats are particularly suited for animals to make the shift from a pelagic to benthic existence. During this habitat shift these small animals are expected to be particularly vulnerable to adverse physical forces, predation and starvation, and flats may provide a relatively low energy environment where predation pressure is low and small benthic prey abundant. These animals may develop a tidal rhythm of behavior and move off and on the flat with the ebb and flood of the tide. This provides them an area of retention as currents over the flats are reduced, a refuge from a variety of predators due to the shallow water and excellent feeding conditions as the abundant meiofauna emerge to feed with the flooding tide. A wide variety of important fishes and invertebrates utilize intertidal flats as nurseries (Table 6) including the commercially important paralichthid flounders, many members of the drum family including red drum, and spotted seatrout, the mullets, gray snapper, the blue crab, and penaid shrimps.\n3.1.1.5.4 Refuge Function A variety of pelagic and benthic species utilize the intertidal flats as a refuge from\npredation and adverse physical conditions (Table 6). Predation pressure in the subtidal, particularly in the vicinity of inlets may increase during the rising tide due to the influx of coastal predators. Intertidal flats provide energetic advantages for animals seeking to maintain their position within the system as current velocities are generally low relative to deeper areas. Schools of planktivores including anchovies, silversides and menhaden and schools of benthic feeding juveniles such as the spot and croaker, pinfish and mojarras, move onto flats with the rising tide to take advantage of the favorable conditions flats provide. More solitary species such as black seabass and gag grouper also appear to utilize flats as a refuge during their emigration from structured estuarine nursery habitats to the sea in the fall. Flats also can provide a refuge from low oxygen levels that may develop in deeper areas of estuaries during summer months.\n3.1.1.5.5 Feeding Ground Function Several groups of specialized feeders utilize intertidal flats as feeding grounds (Table 6).\nThe depositional nature of intertidal flats provide a rich feeding ground for detritivors such as mullet and predators of small benthic invertebrates such as spot and moharra . A variety of invertebrate predators such as whelks and blue crabs feed on tidal flats as do their bivalve prey such as oysters and hard clams, important filter feeding residents of tidal flats. Another group that relies on flats as feeding grounds are predatory fishes such as rays, a wide variety of flatfishes and lizard fish whose form makes them well adapted to feed in shallow water. Other more conventionaly shaped fishes whose prey concentrate on flats use these areas as feeding grounds and red drum can be found hunting blue crabs on flats. Because flats are \"dry\" much of the time activity is concentrated during high water making tidal flats rich feeding grounds for species adapted to shallow waters.\n49\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 6.

Examples of direct impacts include dredging of flats themselves and contaminant spills. Indirect impacts include dredging that significantly alters current patterns, dam construction that traps sediment, beach re-nourishment projects and jetty construction.\n3.1.1.5.7 Conservation of Intertidal Flats Although intertidal flats are protected by the permitting process that regulate activities\nimpacting the intertidal, the perception that flats are of minor importance relative to vegitated habitats increases pressure on intertidal flats. Flats have the same legal protection afforded vegetated intertidal areas, however; the importance of intertidal flats is not generally recognized and the relative value of intertidal flats is not understood. As a consequence permits may be more easily granted for filling/dredging tidal flats than for salt marshes and salt marsh may be planted on a natural intertidal flat when mitigation for marsh destruction is required. Increased recognition of the ecological value of tidal flats by resource managers and permitting agencies is necessary to preserve these valuable habitats, and research on the different types of intertidal flats and their relative value in coastal systems should be encouraged.\n3.1.2 Palustrine Emergent and Forested (Freshwater Wetlands) 3.1.2.1 Introduction\nThis section briefly describes and summarizes the attributes of tidal fresh- and freshwater marshes (palustrine emergent or riverine emergent classification of Cowardin et al. 1979) and swamp forests (palustrine forested), some of which are also tidal, which pertain to their likely function as EFH. Both habitat types occur in South Atlantic estuarine drainage areas (EDAs) in the tidal fresh portions and freshwater portions of riverine tributaries. The function is deemed as likely, rather than definitive at this point for the South Atlantic region.\nThe review of the literature conducted for this amendment suggests that relatively few studies have been performed in the South Atlantic region to specifically investigate/document use of such habitats by Council-managed species, with the possible exception of white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus). Some studies have been performed which document the use of these habitats by important prey species, such as blue crabs, bay anchovies and alosids (alewife and blueback herring). Palustrine emergent, riverine emergent and palustrine forested wetlands in the South Atlantic drainages clearly play an important role in maintaining water quality in downstream areas which are used by Council-managed species as nursery areas. Tidal freshwater marshes are essential fish habitat beacuse they provide nursery habitat for managed species. In addition, palustrine emeregent and forested wetlands support essential fish habitat and the managed species dependant on that habitat through two primary avenues: 1) provision of functional attributes which maintain downstream EFH value by binding substrates, encouraging sediment deposition, nutrient uptake, and generation of detritus in a manner similar to that of intertidal salt marshes; and 2) provision of shelter, spawning habitats and prey for species which serve as important prey for Council-managed species. These prey species include Atlantic menhaden, mullet, alosids, grass shrimp, and others.\nMost of the information in this account is derived from Odum et al. (1984) for tidal freshwater marshes; and Wharton et al. 1982 and Hackney et al. 1992 for freshwater marshes and river swamps.\n51\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThis account employs the terms \"tidal fresh marshes\" and \"freshwater marshes\" to describe emergent wetland systems which occur in the tidal and nontidal portions of South Atlantic estuaries and their tributary rivers. For a thorough review of nomenclature used for these types of systems, see Odum et al. (1984, p. 1). In the Cowardin et al. (1979) wetland classification system, such systems could be classified estuarine emergent, riverine emergent or palustrine emergent depending on their position in the landscape with respect to the river channel. Marshes located off the main channel in oxbows or sheltered backwaters or back swamps are more properly termed palustrine; those which are fringing along river edges are classified as riverine (Odum et al. 1984; Cowardin et al. 1979).\nPalustrine forested systems are called bottomland hardwoods, in the case of riparian systems (those immediately adjacent to the main channel) which are seasonally flooded, or tidal river swamps, river swamps or back swamps, used for systems which occur in oxbows or more permanently flooded areas landward of the main channel.\n3.1.2.2 Description 3.1.2.2.1 Palustrine Emergent (Freshwater Marsh) Wetlands-Geographic Distribution in the South Atlantic Region\nTidal freshwater marshes occur in the uppermost portion of estuaries between the oligohaline (low salinity of 0.5 to 5 ppt) zone and nontidal freshwater wetlands. Combining the physical process of tidal flushing with the plants and animals of the freshwater marsh creates a dynamic, diverse and distinct estuarine community (Odum et al. 1984). Above the influence of the tides, additional freshwater marshes may occur in the backwater areas of river swamps, or in oxbow lakes created in former river channels. The tidal fresh marshes are characterized by: 1) near freshwater conditions (average annual salinity of 0.5 ppt or below except during periods of extended drought); 2) plant and animal communities dominated by freshwater species; and 3) a daily, lunar tidal fluctuation. In the vast lagoonal estuaries of North Carolina, freshwater marshes are probably functionally equivalent to tidal freshwater marshes, but may not experience regular lunar tidal influence, since these areas are dominated by wind-driven tides.\nThe most extensive development of tidal freshwater marshes in North America occurs on the United States east coast between Georgia and southern New England. The two regions with the greatest area of this wetland habitat type are in the mid-Atlantic states and South Carolina and Georgia. Acreages of freshwater marsh in the four South Atlantic Fishery Management Council states are presented in Table 7 (Odum et al. 1984).\nTidal freshwater marshes are best developed in locations which have: a major influx of freshwater, usually a river; a daily tidal amplitude of at least 0.5 m (1.6 ft); and a geomorphological structure which constricts and magnifies the tidal wave in the upstream portion of the estuary (Odum et al. 1984). As noted above, these conditions are not met in the sounds of NC, thus tidal freshwater marshes are less extensive and are replaced by tidal swamps.\nThe lower Cape Fear River, NC, and the lower portions of rivers in SC and GA contain numerous and extensive tidal freshwater marshes. Many of these were historically diked, impounded and converted to rice fields during the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries (Odum et al. 1984). Some of these impounded systems remain intact, others are managed to allow ingress and egress of estuarine organisms, including Council-managed penaeid shrimp and red drum, and others whose dikes have deteriorated have reverted to tidal marsh.\nThe most southern major river system on the coast is the St. Johns River system in Florida. The St. Johns has tidal influence for over 160 km (99 mi) inland; however, due to its\n52\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nunusual morphology (narrow mouth and broad upper reaches) amplitude in the tidal reach is minor, restricting typical plant communities to small areas (Odum et al. 1984).\n3.1.2.2.2 Palustrine Emergent Species and Community Structure Tidal freshwater and freshwater marshes have much greater plant diversity than that\nfound in salt marshes occurring in the more saline portions of estuaries (Odum et al. 1984). Zonation and community types are described in Odum et al. (1984).\nMost tidal fresh marsh flora consists of: 1) broad-leaved emergent perennial macrophytes such as spatterdock (Nuphar luteum), arrow-arum (Peltandra virginica), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata) and arrowheads (Sagittaria spp.); 2) herbaceous annuals such as smartweeds (Polygonum spp.), tear-thumbs (Polygonum sagittatum and P. arifolium), burmarigolds (Bidens spp.), jewelweed (Impatiens spp.), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), water-hemp (Anaranthus cannabinus), and water-dock (Rumex verticillatus); 3) annual and perennial sedges, rushes and grasses such as bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), spike-rushes (Eleocharis spp.), umbrella-sedges (Cyperus spp.), rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides), wild rice (Zizania aquatica), and giant cutgrass (Zizaniopsis miliacea); 4) grasslike plants or shrub-form herbs such as sweetflag (Acorus calamus), cattail (Typha spp.), rose-mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos) and water-parsnip (Sium suave); and 5) a handful of hydrophytic shrubs, including button bush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and swamp rose (Rosa palustris).\nMarshes of the Mid-Atlantic and Georgia Bight regions can contain as many as 50 to 60 species at a single location, and are comprised of a number of co-dominant taxa (Odum 1978, Sandifer et al. 1980). Among the more conspicuous species which occur in both regions are arrow-arum, pickerelweed, wild rice and cattails. In South Carolina and Georgia, marshes are often nearly a monospecific stand of giant cutgrass or a mixed community dominated by one or more of the species noted above, plus sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides), plumegrass, giant cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides) or soft-stem bulrush (Scirpus validus).\nOdum et al. (1984) describe eight community types of tidal freshwater marsh based on their synthesis of information from the literature on species dominance in these habitats. The types are:\n1) Spatterdock Community: Spatterdock can occur in pure stands, especially in late spring, in areas of marsh adjacent to open water. These areas may be below the level of mean low water, so that the stands are submerged during high tide. They may occur on submerged point bars on the meanders of tidal creeks. Later in the growing season, some of the spatterdock may be overtopped by other species which commonly inhabitat the low intertidal zone, including arrow-arum, pickerelweed and wild rice.\n2) Arrow-arum/Pickerelweed Community: Arrow-arum is an extremely cosmolitan species which grows throughout the intertidal zone of many marshes. This species forms its purest stands in the low intertidal portions of the marsh in spring or early summer (Odum et al. 1984). Pickerelweed is equally as likely to dominate or co-dominate this lower marsh zone, although its distribution is usually more clumped than arrow-arum. Both species tolerate long periods of inundation. Other species which may be associated with this community type include burmarigolds and wild rice, and less frequently, arrowhead, sweetflag and smartweeds.\n3) Wild Rice Community: Wild rice is conspicuous and distributed widely throughout the Atlantic Coastal Plain. It can completely dominate a marsh, producing plants which exceed 4 m\n53\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n(13 ft) in height in August and September. It may not be noticeable until mid-summer when it begins to overtop the canopy of the shorter plants, which usually consist of arrow-arum, pickerelweed, spatterdock, arrowhead, smartweed and burmarigolds.\n4) Cattail Community: Cattails are among the most ubiquitous of wetland plants and are principal components of many tidal freshwater marshes (Odum et al. 1984). Cattails are mostly confined to the upper intertidal zone of the marsh. They are usually found with one or more associates, including arrow-arum, rosemallow, smartweeds, jewelweed and arrowhead. They will also form dense, monospecific stands, especially in disturbed areas where they may co-occur with common reed (Phragmites communis).\n5) Giant Cutgrass Community: Giant cutgrass, also called southern wild rice, is an agressive perennial species confined predominantly to wetlands south of MD and VA. It dominates many of the tidal freshwater marshes, excluding other species. If it occurs in a mixed stand, other species present include sawgrass, cattails, wild rice, alligator weed, water parsnip and arrow-arum.\n6) Mixed Aquatic Community: The mixed aquatic community consists of an extremely variable association of freshwater marsh vegetation. It generally occurs in the upper intertidal zone of the marsh and is composed of a number of co-dominant species which form a mosaic over the marsh surface. Species present include arrow-arum, rose-mallow, smartweeds, waterhemp, burmarigolds, sweetflag, cattails, rice cutgrass, loosestrife (Lythrum spp.), arrowhead and jewelweed.\n7) Big Cordgrass Community: Big cordgrass is often seen growing in nearly pure stands in narrow bands along tidal creeks and sloughs, or on levee portions of low-salinity marshes. Arrow-arum and pickerelweed are associated with big cordgrass in these locales, but when stands extend further up onto the marsh, this species will intermix with cattails, common reed, rice cutgrass and wild rice.\n8) Bald Cypress/Black Gum Community: The bald cypress/black gum community generally is ecotonal between the marsh itself and wooded swamp or upland forest. Situated in the most landward protions of the tidal freshwater marsh at approximately the level of mean high water, this community consists of a mixture of herbs, shrubs and trees. Additional overstory species present include tupelo gum, red maple and ash, and shrubs such as wax myrtle and buttonbush. The understory may contain typical marsh plants, although they may be reduced in number and quantity due to shading by the canopy.\n3.1.2.2.3 Palustrine Emergent Dynamics and Function Tidal freshwater marsh provides nursery habitat for managed species and is therefore\nessential fish habitat. Tidal freshwater marsh and likely freshwater marshes as well, are somewhat unique in that the vegetation changes dramatically as the growing season progresses (Odum et al. 1984). First to emerge in the spring are the perennials, spatterdock followed by arrow-arum and pickerelweed as they regenerate from underwater rhizomes beneath the sediments. Interspersed among these species are the seedlings of annuals, consisting of wild rice, burmarigolds, tearthumbs and smartweeds. By early May, arrow-arum, spatterdock and pickerelweed usually dominate the intertidal zone, forming a dense low canopy over the\n54\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nseedlings of the other species. In some places, the canopy may be overtopped by cattail and sweetflag. As the summer progresses, seedlings which germinated earlier begin to overtop the fleshy-leaved perennials, and wild rice and giant cutgrass may reach heights of 3 m (10 ft) by mid-July. Other species follow, and 30 to 50 species may appear in a single marsh location. By late July, the leaves of the arrow-arum and sweetflag begin to yellow, due to dieback from intense summer heat, feeding of herbivores on their leaves, and the canopy of other vegetation shading them. August brings flowering from the giant cutgrass, wild rice and other grasses. Pickerelweed and burmarigolds produce purple and yellow flowers, respectively. Other species also bloom in the fall. As fall deepens, leaves change color, stems collapse and fall over, and by November most of the vegetation begins to decompose. By winter, most of the vegetation is gone, leaving only a barren mudflat until the entire process begins again in the spring.\nThe organic matter produced by the emergent vegetation, along with the phytoplankton (microscopic plants) and benthic algae in the tidal fresh and freshwater marshes serves as an energy source for various organisms. Much of the live material can be consumed by various insects or other herbivores. Microbial organisms decompose and use a large fraction of the dead plant material which collects on the marsh surface. Animals which feed on this detritus, called detritivores, further fragment plant remains. The ultimate result is that a large amount of the energy present may be exported out of the system. Tidal currents, river currents, and wind energy all act to transport organic carbon downstream to the estuary, which is the nursery area for many of the Council-managed species. Migrating consumers, such as larval and juvenile fish and crustaceans, may feed within the habitat and then move on to the estuary or ocean. While salt marshes export about half of their net primary production to adjacent tidal waters, comparable studies have not been performed for tidal freshwater marshes. However, studies of total net community production in such marshes indicate that values range from 1,000 to over 3,500 gm/m2/yr (Odum 1978), which is higher than values reported for higher salinity communities.\nDecomposition of freshwater marsh plant varies greatly in response to many factors (Brinson, Lugo and Brown 1981). However, there are several general trends with regard to the types of vegetation present and their decomposition rates. The leafy succulent low vegetation types (spatterdock, arrow-arum, burmarigold, pickerelweed, arrowhead, hibiscus leaves and wild rice) decompose extremely rapidly. They have relatively low amounts of resistant compounds (such as hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) and relatively high amounts of nitrogen. Such plants may completely decompose in 4 to 6 weeks (Van Dyke 1978, Turner 1978).\nThe plants found in the higher portions of the marsh generally have much slower rates of decomposition. They also in general contain high concentrations of resistant compounds and lower contrations of nitrogen than the rapid decomposers. Consumption of this type of plant material by detrivores is significantly lower than from the fleshy succulent species (Odum et al. 1984).\nThe differences in decomposition rates and composition of the low and high freshwater marsh plants produce differences in the thickness and duration of the litter layer, erosion rates, and nutrient retention capacity in different sections of the marsh. As a result, depending upon the relative proportions of high and low marsh vegetation at a given site, marshes may vary in their capacity to absorb excess loads of nutrients (i.e. sewage effluent, hog lagoon spills) and therefore provide some measure of water quality benefit for downstream areas.\nThe overall pattern of nutrient cycling in tidal freshwater marshes appears to be similar to the pattern hypothesized for estuarine marshes (Odum et al. 1984). Oxidized nitrogen and phosphorous compounds are processed within the marsh and reduced compounds are released\n55\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nback into the river. In tidal freshwater marshes, the spring influx of oxidized compounds and the autumn release of reduced compounds may be more prounounced than in estuarine marshes. In addition, most tidal freshwater marshes which have been studied appear to be net exporters of both nitrogen and phosphorous.\n3.1.2.2.4 Palustrine Forested Species and Community Types Tidal freshwater swamps are present along most of the river systems from the Cape Fear\nRiver in North Carolina south to Florida. They are often closely associated with tidal freshwater marsh. When they do co-occur, they are landward of the marsh and dominated by trees such as bald cypress (Taxodium distichus), red maple (Acer rubrum), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica) and tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatica). They frequently harbor an understory of emergent herbs and shrubs, many of which occur in the marsh. Some of these species are arrow-arum, jewelweed, royal fern (Osmundia regalis), lizard's tail (Saururus cernuus), Asiatic spiderwort (a.k.a. marsh dewflower, Murdannia keisak), wax myrtle and alder (Alnus spp.)(Odum et al. 1984).\n3.1.2.2.5 Palustrine Forested Dynamics A transformation similar to that described above for tidal fresh and freshwater marsh also\noccurs in the herbaceous layer of the swamp forest. Especially during dryer years, barren mud beneath the first and second canopies erupts with a green carpet of herbaceous vegetation in early June, grows to a height of several feet by July/August, and begins to decompose after the first killing frost in October/November. The author observed this transformation first hand in Company Swamp, along the Roanoke River in North Carolina, while completing vegetative sampling during the summer of 1986 (Laney et al. 1988). The lush, herbaceous growth undoubtedly contributes to the production of detrital material which is ultimately flushed from the back swamps and carried by currents to downstream estuaries.\n3.1.2.2.6 Distribution by Estuarine Drainage Area North Carolina\nPalustrine emergent freshwater systems occur throughout coastal North Carolina, although as noted above, they are most extensively developed in the Cape Fear River estuary in southeastern NC. Small patches of freshwater marsh occur adjacent to streams in much of northeastern North Carolina, but many of them are too small in extent to have been delineated for most mapping efforts. Such patches of habitat occur in the streams of mainland Dare and Hyde Counties, such as Milltail Creek, Swan Creek and Whipping Creek and their associated \"lake\" portions. Additional areas of such habitat are also likely present in the smaller tributaries to Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds.\nPalustrine forested wetlands are extensively developed in North Carolina. They occur adjacent to most of the northern sounds, and are extensively developed on all the major rivers, including the Chowan, Roanoke, Tar-Pamlico, Neuse, Cape Fear and Waccamaw.\nSouth Carolina Many of the South Carolina river/estuary systems have more than 200 ha (500 acres) of\ntidal freshwater marsh. Odum et al. (1984) indicates that the following meet that criterion: Winyah Bay system, including the Sampit, Black, Pee Dee and Waccamaw Rivers; Santee River, Charleston Harbor system, including the Cooper, Wando and Ashely Rivers; Saint Helena Sound system, including the South Edisto, Ashepoo, Morgan, Combahee and Coosaw Rivers; the New and Wright Rivers; and the Savannah River.\n56\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nGeorgia Systems listed by Odum et al. (1984) which meet the 500-acre palustrine emergent tidal\nfreshwater marsh criterion in Georgia include the Savannah River, Ogeechee River, Altamaha River and Satilla River.\n\nFlorida Palustrine emergent freshwater marsh of unknown extent occurs in the St. Johns River\nand is likely present in the St. Marys and perhaps the Indian River Lagoon system to some extent.\n\nTable 7.\n\nConservative estimates of acreages of tidal and some nontidal freshwater marshes\n\nin the four South Atlantic States (modified after Odum et al. 1984).\n\nState NC\nSC GA\n\nEstimated Acreage ha (acres) 19,800 (49,000)1\n26,115 (64,531)2 19,040 (47,047)3\n\nReferences\nWilson (1962), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1979)\nTiner (1977)\nWilkes (1976), Mathews et al.

The function is deemed as probable, rather than definitive at this point for the South Atlantic region. The review of the literature conducted for this amendment suggests that relatively few studies have been performed in the South Atlantic region to specifically investigate use of such habitats by Council-managed species or their prey (with the notable exception of the work done in the Northeast Cape Fear River, NC by Dr. Courtney Hackney and students at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, and in estuarine tributaries of the Pamlico River by faculty and students at East Carolina University).\nIn other regions, such as the Chesapeake Bay and northern Gulf of Mexico, use of tidal freshwater aquatic beds by Council-managed species and their prey is better-documented. It seems likely therefore that tidal fresh aquatic beds serve directly as EFH in the South Atlantic region because they are used as nursery habitat. Freshwater aquatic beds also provide funtions\n\n57\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nwhich support species and other EFH in the South Atlantic region through two primary avenues: 1) provision of functional attributes which maintain downstream EFH value in the estuarine portions of South Atlantic estuarine drainage areas (EDAs), such as binding substrates, facilitating sediment deposition, conducting nutrient uptake, and generating detritus in a manner similar to seagrasses; and 2) providing shelter and forage for species which serve as important prey for Council-managed species, such as Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), mullet (Mugil spp.), alosids (Alosa spp.), grass shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.) and others. Davis and Brinson (1980, 1983) reported that submerged rooted plants are often temporary features of the littoral zone, disappearing and perhaps reappearing with changing environments. They concluded that information on the seasonal and yearly variations in standing biomass of various aquatic macrophytes was needed to assess the potential contribution of these plants to ecosystem structure and function (Davis et al. 1985).\nThroughout this section, the term \"aquatic bed\" is used to describe areas of submersed rooted aquatic vascular vegetation which occur in oligohaline (0.5 to 5 ppt salinity), tidal fresh or freshwater portions of estuaries and their tributary rivers. This term is employed in the Cowardin et al. (1979) classification of wetland and deepwater habitats of the United States, accompanied by the modifier \"rooted vascular\", to define areas of such vegetation. Such aquatic beds may occur in the estuarine (for beds in oligohaline areas), riverine (tidal fresh or freshwater portions of rivers) or palustrine (oxbow lakes, backswamps) systems as defined in Cowardin et al. (1979). \"Aquatic bed\" is also the term employed in the land cover classification system developed for use in the national Coastal Change Analysis Program (Clamus et al. 1993) to describe such habitat.\n3.1.2.3.2 Freshwater Aquatic Bed Species and Their Geographic Distribution in the South Atlantic Region\nThe tidal fresh- and freshwater aquatic bed communities are diverse, with numerous plant species that vary in dominance depending upon the influence of salinity, turbidity and other environmental factors. It is likely that such communities occur to some extent in the tidal fresh and freshwater portions of most rivers in the South Atlantic, as far inland as the Piedmont reaches of mainstem rivers and larger tributaries. The aquatic bed communities of a portion (GA, NC, SC) of the states under jurisdiction of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) are described in Odum et al.(1984). The aquatic bed communities of southeastern United States Piedmont streams, blackwater streams, medium rivers and low-salinity backbays and lagoons are described to varying degrees in Hackney et al. (1992).\nIn tidal freshwater, aquatic beds generally grow in a zone extending approximately from mean low water to depths of several meters depending upon water clarity (Odum et al. 1984). This zone often lies adjacent to emergent low marsh and can encompass the entire channel of small, shallow tidal fresh creeks. Most aquatic bed species establish roots in soft benthic muds, and produce herbaceous outgrowths perennially. Stand density and extent are extremely variable, and many species are subject to drastic fluctuations in their populations from year to year, or in some cases within a given season (Southwick and Pine 1975, Bayley et al. 1978)\nThe presence of aquatic beds appears to diminish in southeastern rivers with distance traveled inland and upstream. They have been rarely reported in Piedmont streams (Mulholland and Lenat 1992); are considered locally abundant in some larger blackwater streams and rivers but rare in small blackwater streams (Smock and Gilinsky 1992); may be abundant in some medium-sized rivers (Garman and Nielson 1992); and can be extensive in some low-salinity (the term \"low-salinity as employed herein is synonomous with the term \"oligohaline\") backbays and\n58\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nlagoons (Moore 1992). Macrophytes may be more abundant in larger rivers of the Piedmont, especially along river margins where sediments are more stable (J.J. Haines, personal communication as cited in Mulholland and Lenat 1992). Larger Piedmont rivers may support a greater variety of plant forms than the smaller streams because of the presence of different substrate types, greater stability of fine-grain sediments and greater light availability.\nWater-weeds (Elodea spp.), pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.) and water-milfoils (Myriophyllum spp.) are some of the prevalent species in tidal freshwater wetlands of the Atlantic Coast (Odum et al. 1984 and literature therein). In Virginia, some fresh subtidal aquatic beds are composed of various naiads (Najas spp.), wild celery (Vallisneria americana) and dwarf arrowhead (Sagittaria subulata). Macroscopic algae found growing amid these vascular plants include species of the genera Nitella, Spirogyra and Chara.\nIn North Carolina, species present in the oligohaline and freshwater portions of Albemarle and Currituck Sounds were recorded by Ferguson and Wood (1994). Species present, in order of frequency of occurrence were: widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), wild celery, Eurasian water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), bushy pondweed (Najas quadalupensis), sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) and redhead grass (Potamogeton perfoloiatus). The presence of these species and others was also documented by Davis and Brinson (1976) for the Pamlico River estuary. Investigations in the upper portion of the Pamlico River estuary and a tributary, Durham Creek, documented the presence of wild celery, naiad (Najas spp.), pondweeds (Potamogeton foliosus and P. perfoliatus), widgeon grass, and also macroalgal muskgrasses (Chara spp. and Nitella spp.). Studies indicated that while aquatic beds occurred from 10 to 160 cm in depth, maximum density occurred at 60 cm. Wild celery and pond weed were the dominant species present.\nSpecies present in Florida (St. Johns River) include water milfoil and wild celery (Garman and Nielson 1992) and water weed (Elodea spp.) and Hydrilla (freshwater portions of Indian River Lagoon, Gilmore 1977).\nEstuarine tributaries of Pamlico Sound, specifically Jacks and Jacobs Creeks of the South Creek system, were surveyed over 17 months for distribution and biomass of submerged macrophytes by Davis, Bradshaw, and Harlan (1985). The rooted macrophytes present were Ruppia maritima and Zannichellia palustris. Ruppia was present primarily during the warm season, while Zannichellia was present primarily during the cool season; both species were present in June. Davis et al. (1985) concluded that the contributions of aquatic macrophytes to community structure in these creeks should be highly variable since their biomasses are highly variable.\n3.1.2.3.3 Aquatic Bed Meadow Dynamics Although macrophytes have rarely been reported in Piedmont stream tributaries of EDAs\n(Mulholland and Lenat 1992), because vascular plants usually do not occur in the shaded portions of Piedmont streams, species such as wild celery may grow in areas exposed to direct sunlight. Some researchers believe that the lack of vascular plants in Piedmont streams is the result of unstable sediments, moderate to high stream gradients, and the large variations in streamflow typical of most Piedmont streams (M.G. Kelly, personal communication as cited in Mulholland and Lenat 1992). An exception to this is the river weed (Podostemum ceratophyllum). This species grows attached to rock surfaces and is therefore not dependent on stable sediments. Productivity of river weed was greatest during moderate and stable streamflow, when the stream bed was completely flooded but the water velocities were not great.\n59\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nIn blackwater streams, light intensity is an important limiting factor to aquatic bed growth. Incident light is affected by both canopy development over small streams during the growing season, and by light attenuation in larger rivers (Smock and Gilinsky 1992). Discharge pattern is also probably important. Highly developed macrophyte beds in Upper Three Runs Creek, South Carolina, were attributed to that stream's more constant discharge versus others with more fluctuating discharges (W.R. English, personal communication as cited in Smock and Gilinsky 1992).\nMany aspects of the dynamics of aquatic beds in the upper Pamlico River estuary are reviewed in Davis and Brinson (1976). They and other authors (Harwood 1976, Reed 1976a-b, Zamuda 1976a-b, and Vicars 1976a-c) documented the density, depth and distance from shore; seasonal dynamics; growth dynamics; biomass; areal and temporal distribution; macrophyte decay dynamics; and total macrophyte production and nutrient accumulation.\n3.1.2.3.4 Aquatic Beds As Essential Fish Habitat Submersed rooted vascular vegetation in tidal fresh- or freshwater portions of estuaries\nand their tributaries performs the same functions as those described for seagrasses (see Section 3.1.1.3 of this amendment). Specifically, aquatic bed meadows possess the same four attributes: 1) primary productivity; 2) structural complexity; 3) modification of energy regimes and sediment stabilization; and 4) nutrient cycling. Primary production forms complex, three dimensional physical structures which consist of a canopy of leaves and stems and roots and rhizomes buried in the sediments or attached to rocky substrate (in Piedmont stream tributaries). The physical structure provides substrate for attachment of macroalgae and macroinvertebrates, shelter from predators, frictional surface area for modification of water flow and current turbulence, sediment and organic matter deposition, and the physical binding of sediments. Aquatic bed organic matter, like that of seagrasses, cycles and stores nutrients, providing direct and indirect nutritional benefits to macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores.\nTwo of the potential benefits derived from aquatic beds were tested in field experiments conducted by Rozas and Odum (1988). They conducted studies to determine whether relative predation pressure is less in aquatic beds than in unvegetated areas, and whether fish food availability is greater in aquatic bed than in nearby unvegetated areas. They found that aquatic beds in tidal freshwater marsh creeks not only afford protection from predators, but also provide a rich foraging habitat. By foraging in aquatic bed habitat, fish consume larger prey and may have higher growth rates, lower mortality, and higher fecundity (Rozas and Odum 1988).\nWhile the information on the use of aquatic beds in tidal fresh- and freshwaters appears scant, additional information should be generated in the future due to the development of new techniques (Rozas and Minello 1997). Enclosure devices, including throw traps and drop samplers, generally produce less variability in sampling and their catch efficiency does not appear to vary substantially with the type of habitat. These devices should be employed in aquatic beds to collect additional data to document the role which brackish, tidal fresh and freshwater submersed rooted macrophytes play in sustaining Council-managed species and to clarify their EFH role.\nTidal fresh- and freshwater aquatic beds serve as an important substratum and refuge for macroinvertebrates which serve as prey for fish. In the Middle Oconee River, GA, river weed hosted Simulium pupae and Calopsectra (Tarytarsus) larvae (Nelson and Scott 1962). Nelson and Scott concluded that much of the river weed was not used directly as a food source by invertebrates, but entered the detrital food chain after being dislodged from rock surfaces during\n60\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nhigh flow or drying out when exposed to air during low flow. Approximately one-half of the total plant detritus on the bottom of this reach of the Middle Oconee was river weed.\nThe macroinvertebrates upon which some fish species feed exhibit seasonality in Piedmont streams which corresponds to the presence of species of importance to Councilmanaged species. In Piedmont streams, studies of seasonal fluctuations in macroinverbebrate abundance show peaks in spring and autumn in both density (Stoneburner and Smock 1979, Reisen and Prins 1972) and taxa richness (Lenat 1988). These peaks correspond with the periods when spring-spawning alosids (shads and herrings) and their fall outmigrating juveniles are most likely present. Pre-spawning hickory shad, Alosa mediocris, gathering in Albemarle Sound in late winter, commonly eat fish prey, primarily of the Family Clupeidae; hickory shad migrating upstream in the Roanoke River to spawn consume fish and insects (Batsavage and Rulifson 1998).\nIn some cases, macroinvertebrates may serve not only as a direct source, but also an indirect source of sustenance as well. In blackwater rivers which contain beds of water lily (Nuphar luteum), much of the production enter the food chain through grazing by water lily beetles (Pyrrhalta nymphaea)(Wallace and O'Hop 1985). At least one investigator believes that the annual cycle of water lily abundance in many Coastal Plain rivers may be the major factor influencing seasonal variation in macroinvertebrate abundance (D.R. Lenat, personal communication as cited in Smock and Gilinsky 1992). Since alosids, herrings in particular, spawn in such beds, spawning adults and emerging larvae may benefit from the availability of prey in the form of macroinvertebrates themselves, or in the form of zooplankton or other species which make use of the detritus produced by invertebrate grazing.\nMacroinvertebrate abundance is higher in macrophyte beds and on their fronds or leaves than in sandy substrates (Smock et al. 1985; W.R. English, personal communication as cited in Smock and Gilinsky 1992). This abundance is attributed to the fact that aquatic beds stabilize sediment and are an important substrate, and upon their death, become food for invertebrates, a role similar to that played by seagrasses (see Section 3.1.1.3). Thorp et al. (1997) determined that macroinvertebrate density in Potomac River aquatic beds was two orders of magnitude higher and substantially more diverse than at open water sites. They interpreted their results to support the hypothesis that water-column macroinvertebrates are greatly enhanced in the presence of aquatic bed habitat. Rozas and Reed (1994) found that nekton habitat segregation with depth was largely influenced by submersed aquatic vegetation and salinity as well as water depth. Paller (1987) determined that larval fish assemblages in macrophyte beds were 160 times higher in standing stock than those in adjacent open channels, and that larvae concentrated in the interior of aquatic beds rather than at the ecotone between the aquatic beds and open channels.\nMacrophyte beds can also be a source of increased zooplankton prey. Cooper et al. (1994) documented the extent of water lily (Nuphar lutea) beds in the lower Roanoke River and their use by larval fishes. They found that the formation of water lily beds is dependent upon water temperature and level of the river but generally begins in early April, with die-back at the end of August or early September. Coverage in the estuary can be substantial; the Roanoke River delta contained about 314,000 m2 of surface area, representing anywhere from 3% to 40% of river surface area. Cooper et al. (1994) determined that these beds offered important refuge for young fish while allowing them to have access to adjacent open-water zooplankton. Daphnia, Bosmina, and copepods were found more frequently in adjacent open-water samples, while other cladocerans were more common in water lily beds. Cladocerans and rotifers were the primary prey taxa of larval fishes in water lily beds and cladocera and copepods were the primary taxa in open water. Fish taxa utilizing this habitat included, in order of abundance,\n61\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nsunfishes (centrarchids), shads and herrings (clupeids), minnows (cyprinids), white perch, darters, juvenile menhaden, carp (Cyprinus carpio), American eel juveniles (Anguilla rostrata), pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus), Atlantic needlefish (Strongylura marinus), brown bullhead (Ictalurus natalis) juveniles, striped bass (Morone saxatilis), suckers (Moxostoma spp.), inland silverside (Menidia beryllina), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens).\nOverall, macroinvertebrate abundance in blackwater streams is much higher than historically believed (Smock and Gilinsky 1992). Species richness is comparable to other types of southeastern streams previously viewed as more diverse.\nBlackwater streams and other Coastal Plain streams and their associated Aquatic beds are important spawning and nursery areas for many fish species, including anadromous species which serve as prey for at least one Council-managed species (bluefish) and likely for others. Use of blackwater streams by anadromous species as spawning sites and as nursery areas is widespread and documented by field observations (Davis and Cheek 1966, Baker 1968, Pate 1972, Gasaway 1973, Frankensteen 1976, Smock and Gilinsky 1992). Highest numbers of fish are present generally from April through June, although fish may arrive earlier in the south and later in the north. Arrival of adults corresponds with the highest flows, thus the greatest area of inundated floodplain (see Section on Palustrine Forested and Emergent Wetlands). Both anadromous and resident species move onto the floodplains to spawn, and those species which have adhesive eggs undoubtedly use aquatic bed vegetation as a substrate.\nThe life history aspects of anadromous alewife and blueback herring in freshwater along the Atlantic Coast was reviewed by Loesch (1987). The two species occur together (i.e., are sympatric) from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to upper South Carolina. Alewives alone occur north of Nova Scotia, and bluebacks alone south to Florida. Both species are important prey species for Council-managed species, and both use aquatic bed habitats for spawning in different parts of the range. Where the two species occur together, alewife preferentially uses habitats likely to contain aquatic beds, while blueback use swifter main channel areas. In the South Atlantic, bluebacks use aquatic bed habitats in oxbow lakes and other backwaters. Both species travel far upstream when access permits, increasing the likelihood that they would use riverine aquatic bed habitats. Loesch (1987) does not address microhabitat requirements for spawning, and does not provide any information about whether juveniles use aquatic beds during their nursery residence in freshwaters.\nStudies conducted by Rozas and Hackney (1983,1984), and Rozas and Odum (1987a-b), have documented the importance of oligohaline and freshwater creeks and associated aquatic beds as nurseries for species of significance as prey to Council-managed species. Oligohaline wetland habitats were found to be likely of equal importance as higher salinity marshes for two important estuarine species, spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). Additional species significant as prey were also dominant in oligohaline tidal creeks and associated aquatic beds, including grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchelli). Recruitment of small juvenile fishes was found to correspond with the period of greatest aquatic bed areal cover. Average densities of fauna were significantly greater in aquatic beds than over nearby unvegetated creek bottoms in the fall. The aquatic beds of tidal freshwater marsh creeks were considered most important as habitat for forage fishes. In experiments where the aquatic bed vegetation was removed from tidal fresh creeks, the number of grass shrimp on adjacent marshes decreased, but the average density of fishes was not reduced. The authors concluded that the proximity of aquatic beds and the depth of adjacent creeks are the most important factors that influence the abundance of nekton on tidal freshwater marshes (Rozas and Odum 1987a).\n62\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nAnadromous species are also important seasonal components of mainstem rivers which originate in the mountains or Piedmont. These include rivers such as the Roanoke, Tar-Pamlico, Neuse and Cape Fear in NC; Pee Dee, Santee, and Cooper in SC; Savannah, Ogeechee and Ocmulgee in GA, and St. Johns in FL. Other rivers not included in this list primarily drain the Coastal Plain and are blackwater rivers. Since their presence seasonally overlaps with the presence of aquatic beds in these systems, it is likely that adults may use these areas for spawning and perhaps feeding. The eggs, larvae and juveniles which are present in these systems from spring through the fall are much more likely to use aquatic bed habitat for cover and foraging.\nThe river with the highest potential for EFH designation due to both indirect and direct use by Council-managed species may be the St. Johns in FL (Tagatz 1967, Cox and Moody 1981, Hocutt et al. 1986, Swift et al. 1986, and Garman and Nielson 1992). Tagatz (1967) reported 115 euryhaline species (species which tolerate a wide range of salinity), including clupeids (shads and herrings) and scianids (drums, such as red drum, weakfish, spot, croaker and others). These species occurred at great distances upstream from the river mouth, presumably because of the extended tidal influence due to the St. Johns low gradient, and also to the presence of refugia in the form of salt springs which occur in the river.\nMany of the macroinvertebrates which occur in the oligohaline (low salinity) portions of the backbays and lagoons of the South Atlantic region may use the aquatic beds which occur there, especially the crustaceans. These species in some cases constitute important species managed by the Council (e.g. the penaeid shrimps) or are important prey for other Councilmanaged species (e.g., blue crabs which are prey for red drum, grass shrimp which are prey for many other species). Because many of the shrimps and crabs have well-developed osmoregulatory capabilities (the ability to adjust to changing salinity), the low and often variable salinities that occur in areas such as Currituck Sound, Albemarle Sound, Pamlico Sound, Core and Bogue Sounds, and SC and GA sounds and backbays, do not pose the stress which they do for other organisms (Moore 1992). On the South Atlantic coast, the penaeid shrimp species which appears most likely to use aquatic beds in tidal fresh and freshwater areas is the white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus), although it does not apparently penetrate fresh waters as far on the South Atlantic Coast as it does in the Gulf of Mexico (Odum et al. 1984). Although brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) do occasionally occur in the fresher areas of lagoons such as Albemarle Sound (R. Eager, R.W. Laney, J.W. Kornegay and S.W. Winslow, unpublished data) they are not abundant in such areas.\nPerhaps the most abundant macrocrustaceans which may use aquatic beds in tidal fresh and freshwater areas of southeastern EDAs are the grass shrimp, species of the genus Palaemonetes. There are four species which occur along the South Atlantic Coast: P. paludosus, restricted to freshwaters of rivers and which is abundant in tidal fresh areas; P. pugio which occurs in low-salinity areas; P. intermedius, also present in low-salinity areas; and P. vulgaris, which generally remains in areas of greater than 10 ppt salinity, but which presumably could move into areas occupied by aquatic beds during dry periods when salinities are higher and freshwater flows diminished. Williams (1984) notes that the three estuarine species all occur preferentially in beds of submersed aquatic vegetation, hence the name \"grass\" shrimp. Freshwater shrimp of the genus Macrobrachium, and freshwater crayfish (Procambarus spp.) also occur in tidal fresh- and freshwater portions of South Atlantic rivers (Rozas and Hackney 1984); however, their importance in the diet of Council-managed species or their prey is unknown.\n63\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nAnother significant crustacean which occurs in tidal fresh- and freshwater aquatic bed is the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Fully grown blue crabs, especially males, occur not uncommonly far upstream in coastal rivers and at least one large coastal lake, Lake Mattamuskeet in North Carolina (Moore 1992; Rulifson and Wall 1998). Whether the lake was historically isolated or was connected to the nearby estuary is somewhat in doubt, but it was unquestionably altered in the mid-1800s by the construction of a drainage canal dug by slaves (Lake Landing Canal), and then later in the early part of this century by additional canals which facilitated access by estuarine species (Forrest 1998). During one week (April 23-May 2, 1997), over 1,300 blue crabs with an average carapace width of 1.5 inches migrated into the lake, documenting its value as a nursery for this species (Rulifson and Wall 1998). Juvenile blue crabs characteristically occur at the lowest salinities in estuarine ecosystems (Tagatz 1968).\nOther euryhaline species which currently use Lake Mattamuskeet and its extensive aquatic bed habitats include Atlantic needlefish (Strongylura marina), striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) and tidewater silverside (Menidia menidia). The anadromous alewife and white perch (Morone americana) also use the lake for spawning (Rulifson and Wall 1998).\nA study of the functional relationship between economic damages and the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation in Chesapeake Bay demonstrated that loss of aquatic bed area can result in economic losses through diminishing recreational activities and commercial fishing, as a result of the impact of reductions in aquatic bed extent on fish and waterfowl populations (Kahn 1985).\n3.1.2.3.5 Distribution by Estuarine Drainage Area Limited information is available on the distribution and extent of aquatic beds in EDAs of\nthe South Atlantic. Much of the general distribution information in this section is derived from several of the chapters in Hackney et al. (1992), and from Odum et al.(1984). Distribution in EDAs of the South Atlantic region is discussed from the headwaters to the estuaries. Additional information is available from review of National Wetland Inventory (NWI) maps, although much of the aquatic bed habitat may have been overlooked as a consequence of the small size of individual meadows or beds, presence of tree canopy over the stream which precluded detection, or turbid waters present at the time aerial photographs were taken. On those maps which do include aquatic bed, it is mapped as one of the following: Estuarine, intertidal or subtidal aquatic bed in low-salinity backbays and lagoons; riverine, intertidal or subtidal aquatic bed in the tidal fresh portions of rivers; and lacustrine, limnetic aquatic bed in the case of Lake Mattamuskeet (Cowardin et al. 1979).\nNorth Carolina Ferguson (Ferguson and Wood 1994; and unpublished data) identified species (Table 8)\nand mapped the distribution and extent of aquatic beds in Currituck, Albemarle, Croatan, Roanoke and Pamlico Sounds in NC. With the exception of Currituck Sound and certain Albemarle Sound sub-estuaries, the shallow portions of the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers and Croatan and Roanoke Sounds are largely devoid of aquatic bed habitat due to physiological stress from variable salinity, chronic turbidity and highly colored water from coastal swamp drainage. Salinities greater than 5 ppt can be too high for low salinity species. Historical meadows of aquatic bed habitat in these low salinity waters are largely missing or reduced in aerial extent, based on anecdotal accounts, having been heavily impacted by development of coastal lands and eutrophication. Total acreage for the low salinity aquatic bed habitat mapped is approximately 11,000 acres, of which 55% is in Currituck Sound. Forty percent is in sub-\n64\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nestuaries associated with Albemarle Sound (R.

Species of SRV thrive in fresh and oceanic water which has been classified according to salinity by Cowardin et al. (1979). Two species, eel grass ( Zostera marina ) and shaol grass ( Halodule wrightii ) are true seagrasses, requiring salinities _>5.0  to survive. One species, widgeon grass ( Ruppia maritima ), is euryhaline. The remaining ten species are most frequent at salinities _< 5.0  ( ibid; Batuik et al., 1992)\n\nSouth Carolina Species of aquatic bed vegetation recorded in SC blackwater streams include Sparganium\namericanum, which is tolerant of low-light conditions. It is found in fully canopied, secondorder Cedar Creek in the Congaree Swamp National Monument, SC. Wild celery and pondweed (Potamogeton epihydrus) were common in Upper Three Runs Creek, a tributary of the Savannah River located at the Savannah River Plant site in SC (Morse et al. 1980).\nGeorgia Nelson and Scott (1962) reported that river weed (Podostemum ceratophyllum)\ndominated the benthic flora of a rock outcrop reach of the Middle Oconee River, GA. Free-flowing sections of the Savannah River, GA, hosted Potamogeton, Callitriche, and\nNajas, as well as Podostemum. Aquatic moss, Fontinalis, and large growths of the macroalga, Nitella, have also been observed in some areas of the Savannah River.\nLarge beds of macrophytes often occur in the backwaters of large, uncanopied rivers such as the Ogeechee River, GA, and Chowan River, NC (Dennis 1973, Twilley et al. 1985, Wallace and O'Hop 1985).\n\n65\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFlorida Aquatic macrophytes, both aquatic beds and emergent, are abundant and diverse\nthroughout the floodplain of the St. Johns River (Garman and Nielson 1992). Species which dominated the freshwater portions of the river included pondweeds (Pontederia spp.), water milfoil (Myriophyllum) and wild celery (Vallisneria)(Cox et al. 1976).\nFreshwater aquatic bed also occurs in the fresh portions of the Indian River Lagoon (Gilmore 1977). Species present included water weed, hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) or pickerel weed (Pontederia lanceolata).\n3.1.3 Estuarine Water Column This habitat traditionally comprises four salinity categories: oligohaline (< 8 ppt),\nmesohaline (8-18 ppt), and polyhaline waters (18-30 ppt) with some euhaline water (>30 ppt) around inlets. Alternatively, a three-tier salinity classification is presented by Schreiber and Gill (1995) in their prototype document developing approaches for identifying and assessing important fish habitats: tidal fresh (0-0.5 ppt), mixing (0.5-25 ppt), and sewater (>25 ppt). Saline environments have moving boundaries, but are generally maintained by sea water transported through inlets by tide and wind mixing with fresh water supplied by land runoff. Particulate materials settle from these mixing waters and accumulate as bottom sediments. Coarser-grained sediments, saline waters, and migrating organisms are introduced from the ocean, while finergrained sediments, nutrients, organic matter, and fresh water are input from rivers and tidal creeks. The sea water component stabilizes the system, with its abundant supply of inorganic chemicals and its relatively conservative temperatures. Closer to the sea, rapid changes in variables such as temperature are moderate compared to shallow upstream waters. Without periodic additions of sea water, seasonal thermal extremes would reduce the biological capacity of the water column as well as reduce the recruitment of fauna from the ocean. While nearby wetlands contain some assimilative capacity abating nutrient enrichment, fresh water inflow and tidal flushing are primarily important for circulation and removal of nutrients and wastes from the estuary.\nThe water column is composed of horizontal and vertical components. Horizontaly, salinity gradients (decreasing landward) strongly influence the distribution of biota, both directly (physiologically) and indirectly (e.g., emergent vegetation distribution). Horizontal gradients of nutrients, decreasing seaward, affect primarily the distribution of phytoplankton and, secondarily, organisms utilizing this primary productivity. Vertically, the water column may be stratified by salinity (fresh water runoff overlaying heavier salt water), oxygen content (lower values at the bottom associated with high biological oxygen demand due to inadequate vertical mixing), and nutrients, pesticides, industrial wastes, and pathogens (build up to abnormal levels near the bottom from lack of vertical mixing).\nTypically, parameters of the following variables can be used to chemically, physically, or biologically characterize the water column: total nitrogen, total organic nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, total organic carbon, NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, turbidity, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a , dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity (see Boyer et al., 1997). Composite signatures by these variables can be used to identify the source of the water column. Components commonly used to describe the water column are organic matter, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, and phytoplankton. Additional physical descriptors of the water column include depth, fetch, and adjacent structure (e.g., marshes, channels, shoals). Turbidity is\n66\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nquantified by secchi depth, light attenuation, and NTU. Increases in turbidity, resulting from large river flow runoff or strong wind events, affect the distribution and productivity of submerged aquatic vegetation and phytoplankton through reduction of light levels necessary for photosynthesis and changes in nutrient concentrations.\nThe dynamic, variable, productive, and stressful environment of the estuarine water column provides a rich opportunity for migrating and residental biota to live within the parameters for which they are adapted (Sea Grant, 1976). Many marine-spawning species utilize the estuarine water column as larvae if they are physiologically, thermally, and salinity adapted. For example, during mid-winter, larvae of several important commercial fishes (e.g., menhaden) are transported through inlets into the seemingly inhospitable thermal environment of the shallow estuaries, where they thrive on blooms of plankton and a relative lack of predators. Menhaden and other water column inhabitants utilize the exported production from other estuarine habitats such as marshes, seagrass beds, shell reefs, even though they don't physically occupy these structured environments. While the water column is a relatively difficult component of the estuary to define in terms of essential habitat compared with marshes, seagrass bed, and reefs, it is no less important since it is the medium of transport for nutrients and migrating organisms between river systems and the open ocean.\n3.2 Marine/Offshore Habitats 3.2.1 Coral, Coral Reefs, and Live/Hard Bottom Habitats 3.2.1.1 Coral and Coral Reefs 3.2.1.1.1 Geographical Range of Habitat Types\nCoral reef communities or solitary specimens exist throughout the geographical areas under Council authority. This wide distribution places corals in oceanic habitats of corresponding variability, from nearshore environments to continental slopes and canyons, including the intermediate shelf zones. Habitats supporting corals and coral-associated species are discussed below in groupings based on their physical and ecological characteristics.\nDepending upon many variables (see Section 3.3.7), corals may dominate a habitat (e.g., coral reefs), be a significant component (e.g., hard bottoms), or be individuals within a community characterized by other fauna (e.g., solitary corals). Geologically and ecologically, the range of coral assemblages and habitat types is equally diverse (see, e.g., James, 1977). The coral reefs of shallow warm waters are typically, though not always, built upon coralline rock and support a wide array of hermatypic and ahermatypic corals, finfish, invertebrates, plants, and microorganisms. Hard bottoms and hard banks, found on a wider bathymetric and geographic scale, often possess high species diversity but may lack hermatypic corals, the supporting coralline structure, or some of the associated biota. In deeper waters, large elongate mounds called deepwater banks, hundreds of meters in length, often support a rich fauna compared to adjacent areas. Lastly are communities including solitary corals. This category often lacks a topographic relief as its substrate, but instead may use a sandy bottom, for example.\nThis discussion divides coral habitats (i.e., habitats to which coral is a significant contributor) into five categories - solitary corals, hard bottoms, deepwater banks, patch reefs, and outer bank reefs (defined below). The order of presentation approximates the ranking of habitat complexity based upon species diversity (e.g., zonation, topographic relief, and other factors). Although attempts have been made to generalize the discussion into definable types, it must be noted that the continuum of habitats includes many more than the five distinct varieties discussed below. However, in compliance with existing knowledge, the following categories will suffice.\n67\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTo clarify the presentation in this Section and 3.3.7 of this document, corals have been divided into deep-water and shallow-water species, with the 200 m (660 ft) isobath or depth contour arbitrarily chosen as the dividing line since it approximates the edge of the continental shelf.\nThe following are definitions of selected terminology used throughout this Section and Section 3.3.7 which presents a detailed description of the species and their distribution:\nCoral: Species belonging to the Orders Stolonifera, Telestacea, Alcyonacea (soft corals), Gorgonacea (horny corals, sea fans, sea whips), and Pennatulacea (sea pens) in the Subclass Octocorallia; Orders Scleractinia (stony corals) and Antipatharia (black corals) in the Subclass Zoantharia; and the Orders Milleporina (fire corals, stinging corals) and Stylasterina in the Class Hydrozoa.\nPhylum Coelenterata Class Hydrozoa Order Milleporina (fire, stinging corals) Order Stylasterina (hydrocorals) Class Anthozoa Subclass Octocorallia Order Stolonifera Order Telestacea Order Alcyonacea (soft corals) Order Gorgonacea (horny corals, sea fans, whips, precious red coral) Order Pennatulacea (sea pens) Subclass Zoantharia Order Scleractinia (stony corals) Order Antipatharia (black corals)\nStony Corals: For the purpose of this plan, includes species belonging to the Class Hydrozoa (fire corals and hydrocorals) and Class Anthozoa, Subclass Zoantharia (stony corals and black corals).\nOctocorals: For the purpose of this plan, includes species belonging to the Class Anthozoa, Subclass Octocorallia (soft corals, horny corals, sea fans, sea whips, sea pens, and others).\nHermatypic (Corals): Corals that contain symbiotic, unicellular zoaxanthallae in their endodermal tissue. Always found in shallow (O to 100 m; O to 330 ft.), warm (15 to 35\u00b0C; 60 to 95\u00b0F), sun-lit waters. Usually colonial but may be solitary. Often referred to collectively as reef corals, however some species are small and are never found on reefs. Within the discussion on shallow-water corals, this definition has been qualified to exclude some corals with aberrant zooxanthellae relationships, e.g., facultatively symbiotic species (Boschma, 1925; McCloskey, 1970; Duclaux and Lafargue, 1973) and those which appear capable of \"bank-building\" without the benefit of symbionts (Avent, et al., 1977).\nAhermatypic (Corals): Corals that do not have zooxanthellae. Their distribution is not restricted by depth, temperature, or light penetration. Found from O to 5,880 m (O to 19,000 ft), and O to 35\u00b0C (32 to 95\u00b0F). Both colonial and noncolonial (i.e., single polyp) species in about equal\n68\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nnumber. Although often referred to as \"deep sea\" or \"solitary\" (see next definition) corals, they often occur in shallow water and many are colonial. Their distribution overlaps that of the hermatypes and is exclusive in waters deeper than about 100 m (330 ft).\nSolitary corals: A coral organism composed of a single polyp.\nColonial corals: A coral organism with more than one polyp and which may be part of a coral reef or some other coral assemblage. This may also be referred to as a colony, unit, or individual coral.\nCoral Reefs: For purposes of this FMP, coral reefs are defined as the hard bottoms, deepwater banks, patch reefs and outer bank reefs as described below:\n1.) Patch reef: Irregularly distributed clusters of corals and associated biota located in the management area only along the seaward (southeast) coast of the Florida Keys. Occur as dome-type patches on the leeward side of outer bank coral reefs (see definition below) or as linear-type patches that parallel bank reefs in arcuate patterns. The latter support flora and fauna, including elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), which more nearly resembles the bank reefs. Patch reefs include hermatypic reef-building corals plus ahermatypic species. Most patch reefs occur 3 to 7 km (1.6 to 3.8 nm) offshore between Miami and the Dry Tortugas on the inner shelf (less than about 15 m or 49 ft depth). Vertical relief ranges from less than 1 m to over 10 m (3 to over 33 ft).\n2.) Outer bank reefs: Includes ahermatypic and hermatypic species in a complex assemblage often with greater vertical relief than patch reefs. Located in the Florida reef tract primarily shoreward of the 18 m (60 ft) isobath. Biota always exhibits zonation, with the number and type of zones dependent upon the height of the coral substrate, the location of the reef, and the stresses present. Also referred to as the \"outer reef arc\" (Davis, 1928) and a \"fringing barrier\" (Milliman, 1973).\n3) Hard bottom: Coral communities lacking the coral diversity, density, and reef development of patch and outer bank reefs. Some hard bottom is more appropriately termed hard banks, organic banks or simply banks. Hard bottom may include some hermatypic corals. Widely distributed in the management area. Biota usually include a thin veneer of live corals, often covering a rock outcrop or a relic reef, and associated benthos (e.g., sponges, tunicates, holothurians) in an assemblage with low relief. Also called live bottom (Struhsaker, 1969), hardgrounds, or pinnacles (when found in a nonbank setting). Hard grounds is not used herein since the term connotes a particular geological sediment structure rather than a biotic community.\n4) Deepwater banks: A structure composed primarily of surface-hardened crusts of submarine muddy to sandy carbonate sediments supporting a comparatively diverse assemblage of benthic animals. The ahermatypic corals (Enallopsammia profunda and Lophella prolifera) may provide framework and promote entrapment and accumulation of sediments and skeletal debris. Similar structures may be called haystacks, deep sea mounds, or lithoherms.\n69\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.2.1.1.1.1 Solitary Corals Throughout much, if not all, of the management area, research has located bottom\ncommunities which include corals as a minor component of biotic diversity [for example Cairns (1979) in the Atlantic]. Although these solitary corals contribute benthic relief and habitat to communities throughout the fishery conservation zone, they apparently comprise a minor percentage of the total coral stocks in the management area.\n3.2.1.1.1.2 Hard bottom Hard bottom constitutes a group of communities characterized by a thin veneer of live\ncorals and other biota overlying assorted sediment types. Hard bottom are usually of low relief and on the continental shelf (Bright, et al., 1981); many are associated with relic reefs where the coral veneer is supported by dead corals.\nThis grouping of coral habitats is one of the most widely distributed of the five categories identified above, being common throughout the management area. Hard bottom or banks have been described by Goldberg (1973a), Bright, et al. (1981) and Blair and Flynn (1989), off southeastern Florida; off the coasts of southeastern states (Johnston, 1976); off Georgia and South Carolina (Stetson, et al., 1962; Porter, 1978, personal communication; Thomas, 1978, personal communication); and North Carolina (Huntsman, 1984; MacIntyre and Pilkey, 1969).\nEcologically and geologically, hard bottom and hard banks are diverse categories. Both habitats include corals but typically not the carbonate structure of a patch or outer bank coral reef nor the lithified rock of lithoherms, a type of deepwater bank (see discussions below). Diverse biotic zonation patterns have evolved in many of these communities because of their geologic structure and geographic location. Hard bottom is common on rocky ledges, overlying relic reefs, or on a variety of sediment types. In each case, species compositions may vary dependent upon water depth and associated parameters (light, temperature, etc.).\nShelf-edge banks occur off central eastern Florida at depths of 70 to 100 m, with relief up to 25 m and covered with massive, contiguous colonies of Oculina varicosa (1 to 2 m in height). Some of the pinnacles are covered entirely with dead Oculina debris. At 3 to 50 m depths solitary colonies (<30 cm diameter) of Oculina varicosa grow on limestone ledge systems (1 to 3 m relief) that parallel the coast of Florida (Reed, 1980b).\nHard bottom and banks in different geographical areas support different coral assemblages. Near the Florida Keys, hard bottom co-exist as underdeveloped reefs nearshore and seaward of the outer bank reef tract. North of Fowey Rocks off southeastern Florida, hard bottom include all types of corals, though hermatypic species are near their northern limit (see, for example, Goldberg (1973a) and Blair and Flynn (1989). Coral communities from Florida north to North Carolina, are dominated by ahermatypic species (gorgonians, Oculina), although some hermatypic species do occur off North Carolina (MacIntyre and Pilkey, 1969), and Georgia (Hunt, 1974). The corals on the hard banks off North Carolina near the 720 and 990 m (2,230 to 2,970 ft) isobaths consist primarily of Lophelia prolifera and Enallopsammia profunda, but also Bathypsammia spp., Caryophyllia clavus, and Balanophyllia spp. (Stetson, et al., 1962).\nOn Florida's east coast, hard bottom of nearshore areas has been characterized in the Florida Keys by Chiappone and Sullivan (1994) and off the mainland by Nelson (1989) and Nelson and Demetriades (1992). Nearshore hard bottom characteristics differ substantially between the mainland coast of east Florida and the Florida Keys. These differences include higher wave energies, fewer corals and grasses, and coarser sediments in nearshore hardbottom of mainland areas (Lindeman, 1997). Additional factors complicate Keys and mainland comparisons of hardbottom. Nearshore hardbottom in the Keys is distributed across more\n70\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nphysiographically variable cross-shelf gradients with a greater potential for structural heterogeneity than on the mainland. The presence of over 6000 patch reefs in Hawk Channel (Marszalek et al. 1977), many near shallow hardbottom habitats, introduces additional interhabitat relationships rarely found in nearshore hardbottom of mainland areas.\n3.2.1.1.1.3 Deepwater Banks The existence of deepwater banks called lithoherms in the Straits of Florida off Little\nBahama Bank has been reported in the literature by Moore and Bullis (1960), Neumann, Keller, and Kofoed (1972) and Neumann, Kofoed and Keller (1977). As defined by Neumann, et al. (1977), lithoherms are deepwater structures composed of surface hardened layers of lithified sandy carbonate sediments supporting a regionally diverse array of benthic fauna. Other types of deepwater banks may not be hardened but do support varying amounts of corals.\nTrue lithoherms are located predominantly beyond the outer edge of the continental shelf on the continental slope. Although their distribution is still being delineated, these structures have been identified only in the western south Atlantic region, especially within Bahamian national waters. Some lithoherms do, however, occur near the outer edge of the EEZ. Neumann, et al. (1972, 1977), encountered lithoherms at 600 to 700 m (1,988 to 2,310 ft.) in the northeastern Straits of Florida, along the base of the Little Bahama Banks; Wilber (1976), analyzed the petrology and environmental setting of some banks on the flank of the Little Bahama Bank.\nNeumann, et al. (1977), in describing a lithoherm in the Straits of Florida, listed the ahermatypic branching corals, Lophelia prolifera and Enallopsammia profunda, as the chief contributors to structure and habitats. As noted by James (1977) and others, sponges and other invertebrates also add to bottom relief, species diversity, and total available habitat. Wilber (1976), emphasized the roles of corals, alcyonarians, sponges, and crinoids in baffling, binding, and trapping sediments to the lithoherm.\nDeepwater banks may occur in a variety of shapes. Among the formations observed are rocky mounds 30 to 40 m (100 to 133 ft.) high and hundreds of meters long (Neumann et al., 1977); or individual mounds or \"haystacks\" (Hurley, Siegler and Fink, 1962). Because of accumulated sediments, seismic profiles are often necessary to unmask the true lithified interior of some lithoherms (Wilber, 1976).\nBanks have been found to vary greatly in vertical and horizontal dimension. Depending upon age, rates of sedimentation and lithification, currents, and species composition, banks may show a topographical expression ranging from a few meters to as much as 144 m (475 ft), as quoted by Stetson, et al. (1962). These differences alter water flow over the structure and hence biotic zonation (Lang, 1979, personal communication). Within this category of coral assemblages, the word lithoherm is often confused with other terminology. The precise definition of lithoherm identifies banks accumulated by sustained chemical precipitation, i.e., lithification, that is thought to be facilitated by upward-moving, deep, cold water, as on the eastern side of the Straits of Florida.\n3.2.1.1.1.4 Patch Reefs Patch reefs are diverse coral communities typified by the presence of hermatypic (reef-\nbuilding) and ahermatypic species. Patch reefs differ from consolidated outer bank reefs by their smaller size and lower scale of vertical relief.\n71\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nThese are usually distributed irregularly in clusters nearshore in warm waters like the Florida Keys, (Marszalek, et al., 1977). However, many coral assemblages occurring in the Keys, or north of Miami, are more appropriately called hard bottom communities.\nIn south Florida, patch reefs as defined herein, have been the subject of studies by Marszalek, et al. (1977) and Jones (1977), among others. More than 6,000 patch reefs occur in the Florida reef tract between Miami and the Marquesas Keys, (Marszalek, et al., 1977); most of those patches occur between Hawk Channel and the outer bank reefs, i.e., in a general strip 3 to 7 km (1.6 to 3.8 nm) offshore. Typically, patch reefs form on coralline rock or another suitable substrate such as coral rubble (Marszalek, et al., 1977).\nGeologically, patch reefs tend to form in two patterns - dome and linear - although transitional shapes occur, (Marszalek, et al., 1977). Dome-type reefs are roughly circular to elliptical as viewed from above. Most reefs of this type exhibit well-developed sandy bottom halos around their fringes. Randall (1965), Ogden, Brown and Salesky (1973), and Jones (1977), identified sea grass grazing around coral assemblages by sea urchins [for example, Diadema antillarum), parrot fish (family Scaridae) and other biota] plus current scouring as possible causes of halo formation. From above, a trend toward clustering with limited territoriality is easily perceived, i.e., although the domes are grouped, some distance is maintained between individual patch reefs. Most dome patch reefs have less than 5 m (17 ft.) of topographic relief, but some as high as 9 m (30 ft.) do occur. Linear-type reefs are usually situated seaward of dome-type patch reefs parallel to the outer bank reefs. In top view, linear patch reefs appear arcuate to linear, much like the true outer coral reefs of the Florida reef tract. Hence, instead of forming clusters, these patch reefs often occur end-to-end.\nThe distribution of patch reefs, dome- and linear-type, is uniform in southern Florida waters. Due to the clustering of dome-type reefs, the relationship of the linear-type reefs to coral reefs, and numerous stresses (water temperature and sewage effluents, for example) are most abundant in the upper Keys (Table 9).\n\nTable 9.\n\nPatch reef distribution in the Florida reef tract (Source: Marszalek, et al., 1977.)\n\nArea Fowey Rocks to Broad Creek (Key Largo) Broad Creek to Tavernier Creek Tavernier Creek to Big Pine Key Big Pine Key to Marquesas Keys\n\nApprox. no. patch reefs 3,975 1,590 50 420\nTotal 6,035\n\nPatch reefs also exhibit ecological variability. Dome-type assemblages support a diverse array of scleractinians and octocorals, plus numerous benthic invertebrates, algae, and fish (Marszalek, et al., 1977). Except for the noticeable absence of elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, the biota of dome patches resembles that of consolidated outer bank reefs, but usually lacks coral zonation. At Biscayne National Park, however, dome patch reefs display biotic zonation believed related to relief and sedimentation, (Jaap, 1979, personal communication). Octocorals dominate the top interior zones whereas M. annularis, Diploria spp., and Colpophyllia natans dominate western margins: The dominant coral in this type of patch reef is the small star coral, Montastraea annularis, which is often present in single enormous colonies, (see also Shinn, 1963). Linear-type patch reefs support corals and other marine life much like dome-types with the frequent addition of A. palmata. When found on a linear patch reef, A. palmata colonies are\n\n72\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nusually smaller, more widely spaced, and oriented differently than when found on an outer bank coral reef (Marszalek, et al., 1977). Of the two types of patch reefs, the linear-type is probably the ecologic transition form between dome patch reefs and outer bank reefs (Marszalek, et al., 1977). One hypothesis classified patch reefs of both types according to their presumed developmental stages of youth, maturity, and senescence (Jones, 1977):\nYouth (early development) -- Young patches consist primarily of pioneering scleractinian and alcyonarian species capable of attachment to the sediments. The young patches grow in size by outward expansion and by upward growth on living and dead pioneering corals. Corals in young assemblages on solid substrates are dominated by the star corals Montastraea annularis and M. cavernosa, and the starlet corals Siderastrea siderea and S. radians. On less stable bottoms, the brain coral Diploria (especially D. labyrinthiformis) and the moon coral Colpophyllia natans, are major patch forming species. Smaller colonies of Porites (P. astreoides and P. porites), Favia fragum, Agaricia agaricites, Dichocoenia stokesii, and Mussidae corals, may grow between coral heads. Millepora (M. alcicornis and M. complanata) aid in cementing the components into a patch reef.\nMaturity -- Mature patch reefs are characterized by vertical relief of several meters and a diameter of 10 to 20 m (33 to 66 ft.). Generally, these patches extend upward to the level of lowest low water. Mature patches usually have a horizontal zonation pattern. Montastraea annularis, whose large boulders (3 m or 10 ft and more) are the chief contributors to patch structure, usually occur on the eastern and southeastern (windward and seaward) margins (M. cavernosa may also occur there); Diploria (brain coral) and Colpophyllia (moon coral) heads more than one meter in diameter occur on the leeward sides or in eddies; and Siderastrea (starlet coral) colonies less than one meter in diameter occupy the center and remaining margins (Jones, 1977). At Biscayne National Park, however, the largest buttresses occur on westward fringes (Jaap, 1979, personal communication).\nSenescence -- When coral growth rates are exceeded by mortality in the massive reefbuilding species, senescence begins (Jones, 1977). This occasion is accentuated by simultaneous increases in growth of alcyonarians. During senescence, the scleractinians such as Montastraea and Siderastrea may survive due to size and silt resistance. Most of the patch, however, evolves into accretion piles of coral fragments overlain by a thin layer of loose sediment. At least during early senescence, other corals may survive by expanding mucous production (Porites, Dichocoenia, some Mussidae), vertical orientation or rapid growth (Agaricia and Millepora), or branching and vertical growth (Porites porites). Unless rejuvenated by new stocks, senescent reefs probably die.\n3.2.1.1.1.5 Outer Bank Reefs Outer bank reefs are restricted geographically to the Florida Keys. Geologically and\necologically, outer bank reefs represent perhaps the oldest, most structurally complex, and diverse type of coral assemblage. Although lithoherms, salt dome hard banks, and other environments that support coral may be older, these reefs are the height of ecological complexity for systems actually formed by corals and their associated organisms.\nOuter bank reef distribution is worthy of further discussion. Southeast of the Florida Keys, on the upper shelf, lie the majority of coral reefs in the management area, occurring as a discontinuous arc between Fowey Rocks and the Dry Tortugas.\nFlorida Reef Tract -- The Florida reef tract is within easy access of the coastal population centers of Miami-Homestead and the entire Keys (Marszalek, et al., 1977). The Florida reefs (outer bank reefs) are a discontinuous arc of skeletons and sediments accumulating in situ.\n73\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nAlthough reefs have their origin on sand or other suitable substrate (shells, rocks, fossil reefs, coral debris), their composition is predominantly coral, i.e., limestone or coral rock. Shinn, et al. (1977) and Shinn (1979), concluded that the linearity of these reefs approximately parallel to the Keys is due to underlying bedrock topography, rather than to biological or water quality causes.\nThe Florida reef tract includes approximately 96 km (52 nm) of outer bank reefs located between Fowey Rocks and the Dry Tortugas, a distance of about 270 km (146 nm) along the 20 m (66 ft.) isobath. A large portion of the reef tract is in the EEZ just beyond Florida's three-mile territorial sea.\nAs shown by Table 10, these coral reefs are distributed unevenly along that range; most of the reefs are found off the Key Largo area. Marszalek, et al. (1977), best described the reefs as \"... typically elongate features of variable vertical relief which occur at the shallow shelf edge between the 5 m and 10 m (16 to 33 ft) depth contours. Their long axes form a discontinuous line of reefs oriented parallel to the shelf edge. The northernmost reefs trend N-S and the reefs near Key West E-W reflecting the change in orientation of the arcuate shelf edge.\" Most of the outer bank reefs have well-developed spur and groove formations on their seaward faces. Spurs are extensions of coral reef growth seaward up to 30 m (100 ft) or more; grooves occur between adjacent spurs. Spurs and grooves are best developed in the upper and lower Keys. The middle Keys area exhibits some spur and groove formation but the orientation and development is variable (Marszalek, et al., 1977). Shinn (1963), found that spur and groove development in Key Largo Dry Rocks, Florida, is a constructional rather than erosional feature. Shinn, et al. (1981) found that spurs at Looe Key were constructed of Acropora palmata and had formed over five meters of carbonate sand. Spurs at Looe Key are no longer accreting due to the extensive die-off of A. palmata a few thousand years ago. Robbin (1981) also documented the Keys wide die-off of A. palmata at Alligator Reef.\nThe deep reef at Looe Key is being smothered by migrating carbonate sand. Examination of air photos revealed that carbonate sand that originated to the east and northeast of Looe Key is moving in a westerly direction (Shinn, et al., 1981).\n\nTable 10. 1977.)\n\nOuter bank reef distribution in the Florida reef tract (Source: Marszalek, et al.,\n\nArea Fowey Rocks to Broad Creek Broad Creek to Tavernier Creek Tavernier Creek to Big Pine Key Big Pine Key to Marquesas Key Total\n\nOuter Bank Reef (km) 22.2 34.3 16.6 22.6 95.8\n\nGenerally, Florida reefs are smaller in area, less biologically diverse, and lack the vertical relief of most coral reefs of the Bahamas or Caribbean Sea (Marszalek, et al., 1977). However, coral species diversity is still comparable to or greater than reefs bordering nearby countries. Like the patch reefs described above, outer bank reefs may be grouped according to their extent of development, i.e., underdeveloped and well developed (Marszalek, et al., 1977).\nUnderdeveloped -- Very common throughout the tract, occurring as coral reefs with sparse coral growth and no Acropora palmata zone. These reefs may represent relict limestone ridges in the spur and groove arrangement or relatively young reefs with immature biological zonation patterns. Long Reef in the upper Keys is an example of the relic reef case. (See, for\n\n74\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nexample, Shinn, et al., 1977). Small stands of immature coral reef biota often bridge the gaps between more well-developed reefs.\nWell-developed -- Marszalek, et al. (1977), characterized these coral reefs by their \"reefflat formed of in situ dead encrusted elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, skeletons and rubble.\" Colonies of Acropora, finger coral Porites, and starlet coral Siderastrea plus encrusting fire coral Millepora, and dozens of benthic species form most of the live reef structure. The typical zonation pattern shows A. palmata colonies on the seaward face of the reef to a depth of about 4 m (13 ft.), with M. complanata and the colonial zooanthid Palythoa in the turbulent shallow zone and a diverse coral assemblage dominated by small star coral, Montastraea annularis, heads in the deeper sections (Shinn, 1963). Within the Florida reef tract, Carysfort Reef and Key Largo Dry Rocks (Grecian Rocks) are examples of well developed coral reefs.\n3.2.1.1.2 Condition and Trends Several important impacts on coral health are categorized and discussed below. Present\nknowledge is not sufficient to establish a definite scale of impact severity. Many of the man-induced and natural stresses described below possess the capability of\ntemporarily or permanently depressing coral health and stability. Some of the more common responses to stress include polyp retraction, altered physiological or behavioral patterns, and modified energy cycles; the latter may be difficult to observe or quantify but it is a significant component of overall coral health. Another phenomenon, the \"shut-down reaction\" (SDR), has been studied in the laboratory and observed on rare occasions in the field in stony corals (Antonius, 1977). The SDR appears to be elicited by exposure of sick or diseased corals to a naturally sublethal stress, e.g., predation by the polychaete Hermodice carunculata, and proceeds as a rapid disintegration of body tissues resulting in death. Some doubt exists whether the SDR is a real physiological process or a continuation of tissue lysis in the sick coral. Lastly, damaged corals (abraded from anchor chains, storm damaged, etc.) may provide a starting point for infection with the blue-green algae, Oscillatoria submembranacea, which can potentially kill entire specimens (Antonius, 1975, 1976).\nGenerally, these data imply that certain specific areas may be in poorer health than others. Furthermore, the data provide insight for detecting areas with the potential for declining health assuming present stresses continue. Potential problem areas include the upper Florida reef tract where sewage pollution and recreational stresses are escalating.\n3.2.1.1.3 Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern The definition and criteria for Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (C-HAPC) are\ndetailed in the Fishery Management Plan for Coral, Coral Reefs, and Live/Hard Bottom Habitat. Pursuant to the MSFCMA the Council is also specifying Essential Fish Habitat - Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (EFH-HAPC). Readers of this plan should understand that although the two designations are closely related, there are conceptual distinctions between the two. EFHHAPCs are areas of special significance to the managed species (i.e., significant or critical areas, regions or habitats which serve as spawning, nursery, feeding, or refuge areas). C-HAPCs connotes a management concept designed to identify and focus regulatory and enforecment abilities on areas of special significance to the managed species. At the present only one Council designated C-HAPC exists in the South Atlantic region, the Oculina Bank HAPC, located off central eastern Florida. The remainder of this section focuses on the delineation and designation of C-HAPCs. Essential Fish Habitat -HAPCs are discussed and described in Section 3.3.7 of this plan.\n75\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nAs a vital first step in understanding and managing the coral resource, it is necessary to recognize that corals are not spread evenly over the management area. Rather, dense clusters of certain species concentrate at specific geographic locations to form reefs, hard bottoms, etc. Precise understanding of the geographic distribution of major coral habitats has been largely ignored, until recent mapping efforts. As these and other mapping projects are completed, expanded, and refined, they will become an important source of coral HAPC information.\nFor delimiting specific coral areas, HAPCs are taken only to include localities where large concentrations of adult (sedentary) corals are found. (The open water planktonic life style of larval forms precludes the isolation of specific geographic localities of larval concentration.) On a regional basis, these coral habitats comprise only a very small percentage of the geographical area of authority of South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. Since the focus here is only on coral habitats of particular concern, the area percentage is even smaller.\nIn order to focus only on coral habitats of particular concern, a set of criteria was developed in the Coral Fishery Management Plan (GMFMC and SAFMC 1982) (see Table 11). These criteria are general guideline statements intended to narrow the full complement of coral habitats down to those representing the most important coral concentrations in the management area.\nTable 11. Criteria for identifying Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern.\n1. Ecological a. An area that contains an outstanding example of a coral community type found over a\nbroad ocean area. (For example, a deepwater Lophelia-Enallopsammia bank, a shallow-water Acropora coral reef, patch reefs, etc.).\nb. Areas known to possess rare species of coral. c. Areas whose coral diversity contributes to a highly unusual or unique biologic relationship or ecologic condition.\n2. Research a. Areas with a substantial history of coral research and study. Such areas offer an\nopportunity to develop a long-term history of corals in their natural setting which should enhance the identification of trends in growth or response to stress - both vital information for coral managers.\nb. Areas which display in an especially clear cut fashion, coral habitat features of particular research interest such as spur and groove formations or particular biotic zonation patterns.\n3. Exploitation a. Areas where high concentrations of economically valuable corals subject to harvesting\ncan be found. This might include prime banks of black or pink precious corals, or areas where Plexaura homomalla can be abundantly found. These resource areas can then be managed as development areas under optimum yield objectives.\nb. Areas where specific man-made development plans, use, or pollution impacts have inflicted, or threaten to inflict, environmental damage including reduced coral species diversity, abundance or health.\n76\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n4. Recreation a. Areas that are documented as locations frequented on a regular basis by recreational\ndivers, sports fishermen, or glass bottom boat sightseers. b. Areas that offer a high but underutilized recreational resource because of their\noutstanding aesthetic qualities and proximity to population centers or boat access points.\n\nAt a minimum, any coral area chosen as an HAPC must meet one or more of the specific criteria presented in Table 11. In addition to these criteria, an effort should be made to ensure inclusion of areas that represent all coral community types found in the management area. Consideration of a geographic factor will provide for a regional system of HAPCs in which the full diversity of important coral habitat sites is included. Particular attention should be given to major coral habitat areas. Foremost of these broad areas is the extensive Florida reef tract which stretches along the Florida Keys. Other such habitat areas include hard bottom communities scattered off North Carolina and South Carolina.\nAll habitat areas should be mapped on a scale suitable to show the particular resources and associated habitats. A set of geographic coordinates and boundaries should accompany the map to clarify the precise area.\nThe coral habitat areas described below (Table 12) have been determined to satisfy the criteria and include the important element of geographic distribution. The Council will address, with review by their Scientific and Statistical Committees, nominations for HAPCs periodically and take action as they deem necessary, including public hearings and any other fishery management plan amendment processes.\n\nTable 12.

Gray's Reef encompasses nearly 32 km2 at a depth of about 22 meters (Parker et al. 1994). Gray's Reef, has been recognized by the Department of Commerce (OCZM) as an outstanding example of northern live bottom habitat by its designation as a National Marine Sanctuary. Although referred to as a \"reef,\" the 20 m (65 ft) deep area is actually a live bottom composed of a series of rocky ridges running in a southwest-northeast direction and covering an area of about 57 km2 (16.68 n m2). The Sanctuary contains extensive, but patchy hardbottoms of moderate relief (up to 2 meters). Rock outcrops, in the form of ledges, are often separated by wide expanses of sand, and are subject to weathering, shifting sediments, and slumping, which create a complex habitat including caves, burrows, troughs, and overhangs (Hunt 1974). Parker et al. (1994) described the habitat preference of 66 species of reef fish distributed over five different habitat types. Numbers\n\n77\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nof species and fish densities were highest on the ledge habitat, intermediate on live bottom, and lowest over sand.\nAmong the benthos at the site are scattered heads of stony corals and a variety of soft corals. The site is visited by scientists, SCUBA divers and commercial and sport fishermen, and is better known. The most authoritative description of the live bottom was prepared by Hunt (1974) on the geology and origin of the area. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, largely based on information presented by Hunt, nominated the area as a national marine sanctuary (Neuhauser, 1979), and it was designated as such in 1981.\nIn the 57 km2 (16.68 nm2) area bottom alteration activities, trawling and dredging, fish traps, and collection of marine plants, invertebrates, tropical fish, and historic or cultural resources are to be controlled by permits. The status quo activities of anchoring and spearfishing are to be monitored for future consideration. Other fishing activities are to be regulated under plans developed by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council.\n3.2.1.1.3.2 Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern The Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) (Figure 6) was established\nin 1984 by the SAFMC in order to protect a limited area containing Oculina varicosa (ivory tree coral, a branching scleractinian coral) reefs. These reefs occur off Ft. Pierce in eastern central Florida. The banks consist of delicately branched Oculina coral, growing in spherical, branching, thicket-like colonies stretching several hundred m in length and attaining heights of 0.3-5 meter, covering limestone pinnacles of up to 25 meter-high relief (Reed 1980). In deep water, Oculina coral grows slowly, at a rate of less than one-half inch per year. The HAPC is 92 square miles in area and is bounded by longitudes 79o53'W and 80o00'W on the east and west, respectively, and on the north and south by latitudes 27o53'N and 27o30'N. The depth range throughout the HAPC is 70-100 meters.\nIn shallow water, O. varicosa forms small discrete colonies (< 0.5 m) that possess the symbiotic zooxanthellae which aid in coral growth. Paradoxically, in deeper water (> 50 m), the coral forms its massive branching thickets with an extensive calcium carbonate framework while lacking the important symbiont. While O. varicosa has been found in water as deep as 128 m (off Cape Lookout, North Carolina) and as far north as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, the majority of the thickest growth occurs off the east coast of Florida, from Cape Canaveral to Ft. Pierce, in the area of the HAPC.\nThe diversity of the deepwater ecosystem associated with the Oculina Bank HAPC has been compared to tropical reefs. The strong currents found in this area are thought to contribute to the growth of the coral, trapping fine sand, mud and coral debris and forming the basis of the highly diverse resident invertebrate community, which includes mollusks, crustaceans, echinoderms and amphipods. This dense concentration of invertebrates serves as food for large populations of fishes, including spawning aggregations of gag and scamp (Gilmore and Jones 1992), snowy grouper (juvenile phase), speckled hind, red grouper, warsaw grouper, red porgy, red snapper, and greater amberjack.\nThe 1984 designation of the Oculina Bank as an HAPC closed the area to mobile fishing gears such as trawls and dredges. The slow growth rate of Oculina in deep water as wall as the extremely fragile nature of the coral ensures that contact with fishing gears is extremely destructive to the thickets. The strong currents that are so important in the reef-forming dynamics in the area also ensured that anglers fishing in the area used heavy weights to send their baits to the bottom, causing much damage to the delicate thickets of coral. In 1994, the HAPC was also declared to be the Experimental Oculina Research Reserve (EORR) and was\n78\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nclosed to all bottom fishing for a period of 10 years. In 1995 this closure was extended to include all anchoring within the boundaries of the Reserve.\nThe area encompassed by the EORR was fished extensively by commercial fishermen for calico scallops and rock shrimp as far back as the 1960s. Some fishermen continued to exploit the area with trawls until 1994 (Gregg Waugh, SAFMC, pers. comm.). Reed (1980) described Oculina rubble throughout the area. Manned submersible dives in March 1995 found extensive Oculina habitat damage throughout the EORR, and only one site, Jeff's Reef, was found where Oculina occurred in dense branching thickets. Jeff's Reef comprises a very small portion of the overall reserve area.\nThe fish community associated with the Oculina habitat appears to be greatly reduced after a 15 year period of intensive fishing in the area of the reserve (1980-1994) (Harbor Branch Oceanogr. Inst., unpubl. data). Gilmore and Jones (1992) found spawning aggregations of gag and scamp from 1977-1982. The scamp aggregations were extensive, numbering more than 100 individuals at times. The 1995 submersible dives found no gag aggregations, and those of scamp were reduced to less than 10 individuals (Koenig et al, unpubl.data). In addition, species such as snowy grouper, warsaw grouper, speckled hind, black seabass, red porgy, greater amberjack, little tunny, and blackfin snapper were absent or greatly reduced over levels of the early 1980s. It is thought that decreases in abundance of these important species as well as disappearance of spawning aggregations of gag and scamp are due to both overfishing and extensive habitat destruction.\n\nLive/Hard Bottom Type\nX Oculina Pinnacles ^ Oculina Coral T Coral B Hard Bottom/Soft Coral\n\n^\nX\nB\n100 m ^ ^\n\n80\u00b000'W 29\u00b000'N\n200 m\n\nMelbourne BREVARD\nINDIAN RIVER\n\n^ ^ Hetzal Shoal\nCape Canaveral\n\n^\n^^ ^ ^ ^^\n\n400 m\n\nBBB\n\n^^BTBB^T^BB^^T^^T2T8T\u00b0T30'N\n\n^\n\nSebastian Inlet\n\nBethal Shoals\n^^^ B\n\n^^ ^\n\n^^\n\nFt.

These coral communities are located closer to the Dade County urban areas than Key Largo Coral reefs. The Park is exposed to considerable recreational activity; divers tend to concentrate at four buoyed reefs. This HAPC would include only that portion of the Park located outside state waters.\nCoral reef assemblages in this HAPC closely resemble those described for Key Largo; typical zonation patterns exist. Species composition has been studied by Jaap (1979), and Jaap (in preparation). On-going research efforts are described in Biscayne National Park (1978a, b). Most importantly, the Park represents the only sector of the management area and perhaps the world, where all of the data necessary for calculating MSY has been collected.\nThere are currently no special regulations for the Park. General regulations in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations apply to all units of the national park system. Title 36 includes Part 2 on public use and recreation, Part 3 concerning boating and vessel permits, Part 5 on commercial and private operations, and Part 7 on special regulations.\n3.2.1.1.3.4 Florida Reef Tract The Florida reef tract contains the continental United States' most extensive coral habitat.\nComposed of a chain of individual reefs, the tract stretches in a curve of some 370 km (200 nm) from Miami to the Dry Tortugas (DiSalvo and Odum, 1974). The tract is bounded on the shoreward side by the Florida Keys and on the seaward side by the Florida Straits. Its width is about 6.5 km (4 nm) with the seaward edge following the 18 m (60 ft) bathymetric contour. Although Shinn (1963) reports that the tract's flourishing reefs are largely limited to the northern half of the tract particularly off Key Largo, other prospering reefs also exist further south.\nFor purposes of identifying coral habitats of particular concern along the Florida reef tract, a two areas have been selected: many separate reefs near Key Largo have been selected in the northern reef portion; Looe Key off Big Pine Key is identified from the middle portion. Other tract reefs which were considered, but were not included at this time, are Sand Key off Key West and the Sambo reefs off Boca Chica Key.\nThe Florida reef tract is exposed to a variety of both natural and man-made threats. Land based pollutants such as sediment, sewage, and various chemicals may be damaging certain reefs. However, the significance and even cause-effect relationships have yet to be clearly established. Perhaps the most significant threat is from recreational use, which exposes the reefs to direct damage by souvenir and specimen collectors and anchor damage.\n3.2.1.1.3.5 Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) Act (Public Law 101-605, 16\nNovember, 1990) designated 2,800 nm2 (9,500 km2) as a National Marine Sanctuary encompassing the waters of the State of Florida and the United States (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1996). The FKNMS includes the former Key Largo and Looe Key National Marine Sanctuaries. The FKNMS surrounds, but does not include Biscayne and Dry Tortugas National Parks and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. The boundaries of the park extend from seaward of BNP to the beyond the Tortugas Banks, a distance of approximately 220 miles. The offshore boundary corresponds with the 300 ft (91 m) isobath and the inshore boundary follows\n80\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nboundaries of Everglades National Park or the shoreline of the keys. The FKNMS was created to protect highly valued marine biological resources (boundary map shown below). The FKNMS management and coordination is cooperative effort of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Governor and Cabinet of the State of Florida and the Secretary of the Department of Commerce approved the FKNMS management plan in 1997. The management plan was developed through a complex process including considerable efforts to include public input. The plan covers boating, fishing, land use, recreation, water quality, zoning, research and monitoring, and education. Action plans are included for each element in the management plan and are phased in over a three-year period, dependent on funding. The most innovative management strategy is the zoning of a marine area for use and conservation. The zoning method was adopted from the Australian Great Barrier Reef Park Authority based on zoning for the Great Barrier Reef.\n(Source: http://wave.nos.noaa.gov/nmsp/fknms/)\nFor coral reefs, the zoning has designated 18 reef areas (30.8 km2) as Preservation Areas. This zoning is supposed to protect shallow reefs from user resource damages and replenish populations of invertebrates and fish. The zoning designates one area around Western Sambo (30.8 km2 ) as an Ecological Reserve (this zone is larger and has more restrictions than in the Preservation Zone). The goal of this zone is to replenish species populations by providing large protected nursery and resident refuge areas. One area has yet to be defined; the proposed replenishment area is a portion of Dry Tortugas. Four restricted Special Use Zones are designated for research only: Conch, Tenneessee, Looe Key, and Pelican Shoal (total area of 1.8 km2).\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was designated in the enactment legislation to conduct an evaluation of the water quality in the FKNMS (this program is designated as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Water Quality Protection Program). The EPA has reviewed literature, funded monitoring and research to determine the status and trends of water quality and important biotic communities in FKNMS. The monitoring includes water chemistry,\n81\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nsea grasses, and coral reefs and hardbottom communities. The EPA WQPP has also put an emphasis on corrective actions for ground water contamination by onsite sewage disposal systems, cesspits, package plants, surface discharging municipal wastewater treatment plants, and live-aboard vessels (U.S. EPA, 1996).\nThe goal of the coral reef and hardbottom monitoring project is to develop status and trends of stony coral percent cover and taxonomic diversity of stony coral fauna at 40 sites: 8 hardbottom- nearshore, 9 patch reef, 12 offshore shallow, and 11 offshore deep sites. Sites are distributed between upper Key Largo to west of Key West. Each site is sampled annually. There are four stations at each site. Sampling for coral cover is based on video transects and point counting selected images (N 60 images for each transect, there are 12 transects at a site). Taxonomic diversity (number of different species and/or species complexes found at a station) is determined by a qualitative-timed inventory of each station (44 m2). The information baseline began in 1996. The species inventory data documents that the hardbottom sites and the offshore shallow reef sites had the fewest number of coral species and the patch reef and offshore deep sites have the greatest number of species. Between 1996 and 1997 the number of species observed at an individual site remained relatively similar with the exception of a few sites. The species that occurred in 1996 but not 1997 were typically small and rare species. Video data is still being processed and evaluated.\nFor additional information on the Santuary refer to the FKNMS internet site (http://wave.nos.noaa.gov/nmsp/fknms/).\n3.2.1.1.3.6 Key Largo Coral Reefs (Formerly Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary) This HAPC has already been recognized by the Department of Commerce (OCZM) as an\noutstanding example of the patch and outer bank coral reefs found in the Florida reef tract. National recognition and incorporation into the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary has intensified public use of the area; resource collection pressures are low but user impacts, such as diver contact injury and recreational boat anchoring, continue. Many of the more prominent reefs are mapped. Sanctuary regulations allow hook and line fishing but prohibit spearfishing and the taking of tropical reef fishes.\nThe coral reefs within this area comprise the approximate northern limit of reef growth along the mainland coast of the Western Hemisphere. The zonation pattern of the reef structures for the northern Florida reef tract as described by Shinn (1963 and 1979) includes five zones; a back reef, a reef flat, an Acropora zone, a Millepora zone, and a rubble zone. The coral species composition of reefs off Key Largo are described by the Office of Coastal Zone Management (1979b). Several of the reefs within the area exhibit the spur and groove formation described by Shinn (1963) at the Dry Rocks Reef.\nThe northern tract reefs have a long history of scientific research. Much of the relevant research has been reviewed by the Office of Coastal Zone Management (1979b). A continuation of this research history is evident in the coral reef resource survey being coordinated by the Office of Coastal Zone Management (1979c) for the then proposed National Marine Sanctuary and an environmental assessment and biological inventory organized jointly by OCZM and the Florida Department of Natural Resources.\n3.2.1.1.3.7 Looe Key Reef (Formerly the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary) Looe Key HAPC has been recognized by the Department of Commerce (OCZM) as an\noutstanding example of a submerged coral reef in the lower Florida reef tract. The reef is located 12.4 km (6.7 nm) southwest of Big Pine Key, Florida. From an ecological and topographic point\n82\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nof view, five major zones were described by Antonius, et al. (1978): 1) a patch reef area; 2) a reef flat; 3) a forereef; 4) a deep reef seaward of the forereef; and 5) a deep ridge still further seaward. Each of these zones contains a representative coral species assemblage. Of particular significance, the forereef zone contains a spectacular spur and groove system that is among the best examples in the entire Florida reef tract (Antonius, et al., 1978). The following activities are prohibited: taking or damage to sanctuary resources, including tropical fish and corals; spearfishing; using wire fish traps, poisons, or electric charges; littering; and lobster trapping within the forereef area.\nThe reef is a diving attraction rapidly growing in popularity with both local residents and tourists (Barada, 1979). Concurrently, it is subject to growing pressure from souvenir hunters and anchor damage (Antonius, et al., 1978). The reef is also used regularly for teaching and recreational purposes by the Newfound Harbor Marine Institute facility on Big Pine Key. The reef was nominated for consideration as a marine sanctuary (see Section 6.4) in November 1975 by the Florida Keys Citizens Coalition and was subsequently designated as such in 1981, and recently incorporated into the FKNMS.\n3.2.1.2 Live/Hard Bottom Habitat Due to substantial biological, climatic, and geological differences between the temperate\nand tropical componenets of the managed area, the following summary is geographically segregated into two sections: a) Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral; and b) Cape Canaveral to the Dry Tortugas. Broadly, these regions represent temperate, wide-shelf systems and tropical, narrow-shelf systems, respectively. The zoogeographic break between these regions typically occurs between Cape Canaveral and Jupiter Inlet (approximately 230 km to the south). Distributions and areal amounts of hard bottom from the Florida/Georgia border to Jupiter Inlet (encompassing portions of both of the regions collated below) have been estimated from the comprehensive GIS assembly of almost all available data records (Perkins et al., 1997).\n3.2.1.2.1 Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral Major fisheries habitats on the Continental Shelf along the southeastern United States\nfrom Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral (South Atlantic Bight) can be stratified into five general categories: coastal, open shelf, live/hard bottom, shelf edge, and lower shelf (Figure 7) based on type of bottom and water temperature. Each of these habitats harbors a distinct association of demersal fishes (Struhsaker 1969) and invertebrates. Most of the bight substrate is covered by a vast plain of sand and mud (Newton et al. 1971) underlaid at depths of less than a meter by carbonate sandstone (Riggs et al. 1996, Riggs et al. 1998). The productivity of this sand- and mud-covered plain is low. Scattered irregularly over the shelf, however, are zones of highly concentrated invertebrate and algal growth, usually in association with marked deviations in relief that support substantial fish assemblages (Huntsman and Mcintyre 1971, Struhsaker 1969). Commonly called \"live bottom\" areas, they are usually found near outcropping shelves of sedimentary rock in the zone from 15 to 35 fathoms. Live bottom is especially evident at the shelf break, a zone from about 35 to 100 fathoms where the Continental Shelf adjoins the deep ocean basin and is often characterized by steep cliffs and ledges (Huntsman and Manooch 1978). The live bottom areas constitute essential habitat for warm-temperate and tropical species of snappers, groupers, and associated fishes. Exploratory fishing for reef fishes has yielded 113 species representing 43 families of predominately tropical and subtropical fishes off the coasts of North Carolina and South Carolina (Grimes et al. 1982; Table 13). Recently, Parker and Dixon (in press) identified 119 species of reef fish representing 46 families during underwater surveys\n83\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n44 km off Beaufort, North Carolina (Table 14). Twenty-nine tropical fishes and a basket sponge were new to the study area.Distinct faunal assemblages were associated with two habitats: live/hard bottom on the open shelf; and at the shelf edge. A study of South Atlantic Bight reef fish communities by Chester et al. (1984) confirmed that specific reef fish communities could be identified based on the type of habitat. Bottom topography and bottom water temperatures are the two most important factors which create habitats suitable for warm-temperate and tropical species.\n\nLive-Bottom Habitat\n\nSmall areas of broken relief within the openshelf habitat.

The Gulf Stream plays an important role in global-scale heat, momentum, and mass flux, as well as circulation patterns throughout its length. Physical, chemical, and biological processes are influenced by the presence of the Gulf Stream. It flows generally northeastward and, with its associated pressure gradient, is responsible for transporting water along the seaward flank of the Sea Slope gyre. The conditions and flow of the Gulf Stream are highly variable on time scales ranging from two days to entire seasons. At all times, the Gulf Stream flows toward the northeast with a mean speed of 1 m/s (2 kt). The location of the Gulf Stream's western boundary is variable because of meanders, attributable to atmospheric conditions, bottom topography, and eddies. These boundary features move to the southsouthwest, and transport momentum, mass, heat, and nutrients to the vicinity of the shelf break.\n\n87\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 14.

In general, the shelf demonstrates a ridge-and-swale (hill-and-valley) topography on the inner part and part of the outer shelf, with ridges having coarser surficial sediments than swales. At the shelf break, the topography is modified by a series of terraces before sloping or dropping off into vast submarine canyons.\nThe live-bottom habitats are often small, isolated areas of broken relief consisting of rock outcroppings that are heavily encrusted with sessile invertebrates such as bryozoans, sponges, octocorals, and sea fans. These outcrops are the ridges referred to above and are scattered over the continental shelf north of Cape Canaveral, although they are most numerous off northeastern Florida. A study of two live bottom areas off Georgia and South Carolina (Continental Shelf Associates 1979) revealed three hard bottom habitat types: 1) emergent hard bottom dominated by sponges and gorgonian corals; 2) sand bottom underlain by hard substrate dominated by anthozoans, sponges and polychaetes, with hydroids, bryozoans, and ascidians frequently observed; and 3) softer bottom areas not underlain with hard bottom. Along the southeastern United States, most hard/live bottom habitats occur at depths greater than 27 m (90 ft), but many also are found at depths of from 16 to 27 m (54 to 90 ft), especially off the coasts of North Carolina and South Carolina. Bottom water temperatures range from approximately 11o to 27o C (52o to 80oF). Temperatures less than 12oC may result in the death of some of the more tropical species of invertebrates and fishes. Generally, snappers (Lutjanidae), groupers (Serranidae), porgies (Sparidae), and grunts (Haemulidae) inhabit hard bottom habitats off northeastern Florida and the offshore areas of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The live bottom areas inshore (at depths of about 18 m; 60 ft) have cooler temperatures, less diverse populations of invertebrates, and are inhabited primarily by black sea bass and associated temperate species.\nThe shelf edge habitat extends more or less continuously along the edge of the continental shelf at depths of 55 to 110 m (180 to 360 ft). The sediment types in this essential fish habitat zone vary from smooth mud to areas that are characterized by great relief and heavy encrustations of coral, sponge, and other predominately tropical invertebrate fauna. Some of these broken bottom areas (e.g., in Onslow Bay, North Carolina) may represent the remnants of ancient reefs that existed when the sea level was lowered during the last glacial period.\nStruhsaker (1969) reported that, as a result of the proximity of the Gulf Stream, average temperatures on the bottom at the shelf edge are higher for a longer duration than those further inshore at other hard bottom areas. Bottom water temperatures at the shelf edge habitat range from approximately 12\u00b0 to 26\u00b0 C (55\u00b0 to 78\u00b0 F). However, Miller and Richards (1980) found that there is a stable temperature area between 26 and 51 m (85 to 167 ft) where the temperature does not drop below 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0 F). Cold water intrusions may cause the outer bottom temperatures to drop (Avent et al. 1977; Mathews and Pashuk 1977; Leming 1979). Fishes that generally inhabit the shelf edge zone are tropical, such as snappers, groupers, and porgies. Fish distribution is often diffuse in this zone, with fishes aggregating over broken bottom relief in associations similar to those formed at inshore live bottom sites.\nThe lower shelf habitat has a predominately smooth mud bottom, but is interspersed with rocky and very coarse gravel substrates where groupers (Epinephelus spp.) and tilefishes (Malacanthidae) are found. This habitat and its association of fishes roughly marks the transition between the fauna of the Continental Shelf and the fauna of the Continental Slope. Depths represented by this habitat zone range from 110 to 183 m (360 to 600 ft), where bottom water temperatures vary from approximately 11\u00b0 to 14\u00b0 C (51\u00b0 to 57\u00b0 F). Fishes inhabiting the deeper live or hard bottom areas are believed to be particularly susceptible to heavy fishing pressure and environmental stress.\n92\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe exact extent and distribution of productive live bottom habitat on the continental shelf north of Cape Canaveral is unknown. Although a number of attempts have been made, estimations of the total area of hard bottom are confounded due to the discontinuous or patchy nature of this habitat type. Henry and Giles (1979) estimated about 4.3 percent of the Georgia Bight to be hard bottom, but this is considered an underestimate. Miller and Richards (1980) reported that live bottom reef habitat comprises a larger area of the South Atlantic Bight. The method used to determine areas of live bottom involved the review of vessel station sheets from exploratory research cruises to locate sites where reef fishes were collected. Parker et al. (1983) suggested that rock-coral-sponge (live bottom) habitat accounts for about 14 percent, or 2,040 km2 , of the substratum between the 27 m and 101 m isobaths from Cape Hatteras to Cape Fear. Live bottom constitutes a much larger percentage of the substratum at the above depths from Cape Fear to Cape Canaveral. Parker et al. (1983) estimate that approximately 30 percent, or 7,403 km2, of the bottom in this area was composed of rock-coral-sponge substrate.\nIn 1992, the SEAMAP-South Atlantic Bottom Mapping Work Group of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission began an extensive effort to establish a regional database for hard bottom resources throughout the South Atlantic Bight. The primary objectives of the effort are to identify hard bottom habitats from the beach out to a depth of 200 meters, and to summarize the information into an easily-accessible database for researchers and managers. The Florida Marine Research Institute, as part of the 1998 SEAMAP program deliverables compiled the four state research effort and produced a complete set of ArcView maps presenting available information on hardbottom distribution from Florida to the North Carolina-Virginia border which are included in Appendix E. These coverages were provided to aid in the Council in the identification of essential fish habitat in the South Atlantic. Color versions of these maps are available over the internet at the Councils' Web site (www.safmc.noaa.gov) under essential fish habitat. Examples of the coverages are presented in Figures 8a and 8b.\nIn addition to the natural hard or live bottom reef habitats, wrecks and other man made structures, such as artificial reefs, also provide suitable substrate for the proliferation of live bottom. However, the combined area of artificial substrates will always be dwarfed compared with the total area of natural, exposed live/hard bottom. The faunal species composition on artificial reefs is similar to that identified on natural hard bottom habitat at the same depth and in the same general area (Stone et al. 1979).\n93\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 8a.

Hardbottom distribution Offshore Northern Palm Beach County, Florida (1998 SEAMAP Bottom-Mapping Project) (Source: FMRI 1998).\n95\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nMany fish species that inhabit live bottom reefs are nonmigratory, and are thus residents of specific reef areas for most of their adult lives. Therefore, any activities which result in significant destruction or degradation of reefs would adversely affect the productivity of the species that create important snapper-grouper fisheries. Of potential concern are natural gas/oil drilling activities, which could occur off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and northeast Florida. Increased sedimentation resulting from discharge of drilling muds and byproduct cuttings could bury hard bottom habitats unless currents effectively dispersed the sediments (SC and GA Departments of Natural Resources 1981). Other potential detrimental activities to offshore hard bottom reef habitats include ocean dumping, and bottom contact fisheries. Concern has been expressed that bottom trawling may cause long-term or irreversible damage to animal and plant communities (Tilmant 1979, Wenner 1983) and substrates. A study by Van Dolah et al. (1987) off Georgia evaluated the impacts of a roller trawl on coral and sponge dominated benthic communities. Although some damage was documented for all target species immediately after trawling, recovery of sponge occurred within a year. Even more passive fishing gear and operations, such as bottom longlines and vertical drop lines, and anchoring (Davis 1977) may be damaging to the more fragile reef fish-supporting communities.\n3.2.1.2.2 Cape Canaveral to Dry Tortugas The term hard bottom is applied in two relatively different areas of southeast Florida: the\nmainland and associated sedimentary barrier islands, and the coral islands and reef tract of the Florida Keys (Hoffmeister, 1974). Therefore, this summary is collated by two subregions: a) mainland southeast Florida; and b) the Florida Keys. The benthic habitat characteristics of the shelf bordering the mainland are not as complex as in the Florida Reef Tract. Within both subregions, non-coralline, hard bottom habitats are present in both nearshore (<4 m) and midand outer-shelf areas (>4 m).\n3.2.1.2.2.1 Mainland Southeast Florida Nearshore Hard Bottom - Nearshore hard bottom habitats are the primary natural reef\nstructures at depths of 0-4 m of this subregion. These habitats are derived from large accretionary ridges of coquina mollusks, sand, and shell marl which lithified parallel to ancient shorelines during Pleistocene interglacial periods (Duane and Meisburger, 1969). Currently, the majority of nearshore hardbottom reefs are within 200 m of the shore. However, they are often separated by kilometers of flat nearshore sand expanses. The habitat complexity of nearshore hard bottom is expanded by colonies of tube-building polychaete worms (Kirtley and Tanner, 1968) other invertebrates and macroalgae (Goldberg, 1973; Nelson and Demetriades, 1992). Nelson (1990) recorded 325 species of invertebrates and plants from nearshore hard bottom habitats at Sebastian Inlet. Hard corals are rare or absent due to high turbidities and wave energy. In some areas, the hard bottom reachs heights of 2 m above the bottom and is highly convoluted. The most widespread encrusting organism is the reef-building sabellariid worm, Phragmatopoma lapidosa (= P. caudata; Kirtley, 1994).\nFew quantitative characterizations of nearshore hardbottom fish assemblages are available. Based on visual censusing of three mainland southeast Florida sites over two years, 86 species from 36 families were recorded (Lindeman, 1997). Grunts (Haemulidae) were the most diverse family with 11 species recorded, more than double the species of any other family except the wrasses (Labridae) and parrotfishes (Scaridae) with seven and six species, respectively. The most abundant species were the sailors choice, silver porgy, and cocoa damselfish. Use of hardbottom habitats was recorded for newly settled stages of over 20 species (Lindeman and\n96\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSnyder, manuscript). Pooled early life stages (newly settled, early juvenile, and juvenile) represented over 80% of the individuals at all sites. Nearshore hardbottom fish assemblages of this subregion are characterized by diverse, tropical faunas which are dominated by early life stages.\nThree studies have included sections on nearshore hard bottom fishes as part of larger project goals. Gilmore (1977) listed 105 species in association with \"surf zone reefs\" at depths less than two m. Two additional species were added in later papers (Gilmore et al., 1983; Gilmore, 1992). Using visual surveys, Vare (1991) recorded 118 species from nearshore hard bottom sites in Palm Beach County. Futch and Dwinell (1977) included a list of 34 species obtained from several ichthyocide collections on \"nearshore reefs\". In addition to the species censused in Lindeman (1997), 19 species were qualitatively recorded at the Jupiter and Ocean Ridge sites. Including the prior studies, 192 species within 62 families have now been recorded in association with nearshore hard bottom habitats of mainland southeast Florida (Table 15). At least 90 species are utilized in recreational, commercial, bait, or aquaria fisheries.\nNearshore hard bottom habitats typically had over thirty times the individuals per transect as natural sand habitats (Lindeman, 1997) and newly settled individuals were not recorded during any surveys of natural sand habitats. During 34 visual transects over sand sites in southeast Florida, Vare (1991) recorded seven species (primarily clupeids and carangids). Approximately 15 months of sampling by seine hauls at a nearshore sand site in east-central Florida yielded a total of 22 species (Peters and Nelson, 1987). One species each of engraulid and carangid comprised 70% of the total catch.\nHard bottom habitats are often centrally placed between mid-shelf reefs to the east and estuarine habitats within inlets to the west. Therefore, they may serve as settlement habitats for immigrating larvae or as intermediate nursery habitats for juveniles emigrating out of inlets (Vare, 1991, Lindeman and Snyder, In press). This cross-shelf positioning, coupled with their role as the only natural structures in these areas, suggests nearshore hard bottom may represent important EFH resources.\nOffshore Hard Bottom - Several lines of offshore hardbottom reefs, derived from Pleistocene and Holocene reefs, begin in depths usually exceeding 8 m, and in bands that roughly parallel the shore (Goldberg, 1973; Lighty, 1977). The geologic origins and biotic characteristics of these deeper reef systems are different from the nearshore hardbottom reefs (Lighty, 1977), although reefs of both depth strata are lower in relief than reefs of the Florida Reef tract. The tropical invertebrate fauna of several of these mid-shelf reefs are described by Goldberg (1973) and Blair and Flynn (1989). No quantitative examinations of the fish assemblages of these habitats are published. Qualitative characterizations exist in Herrema (1974) and Courtenay et al. (1974; 1980). Using various collecting gears and literature reviews, Herrema (1974) recognized the occurrence of 206 \"primary reef\" fishes off the mainland southeast coast of Florida. Emphasis was placed on the similarities between this fauna and the reef fish fauna characterized at Alligator Reef in the Florida Keys (Starck, 1968). Lutjanids, haemulids and many other families were represented in both subregions on almost a species by species basis (Herrema, 1974). This information was not contradicted by the faunal characterizations in Courtenay et al. (1974; 1980). Based primarily on offshore records, Perkins et al. (1997) identified 264 fish taxa from the shelf of mainland Florida as hard-bottom obligate taxa.\n97\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 15.

Reported but identifiction\n\n99\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\n3.2.1.2.2.2 Florida Keys and Reef Tract Nearshore Hard Bottom - Nearshore hard bottom habitats of the Florida Keys can differ\nboth geologically and biologically from mainland areas (Table 16). Florida Keys nearshore hard bottom is semi-continuously distributed among areas with high organic sediments, increased seagrasses, more corals, and reduced wave conditions. Emergent upland components of the Florida Keys are derived from ancient reefs of the Florida Reef Tract and typically do not have sizeable beaches nor a nearshore current regime for delivery of beach-quality sediments. Nearshore hard bottom habitats on the mainland are patchily distributed among large expanses of barren, coarse sediments, commonly possess worm reefs, and show reduced coral diversities (Table 16). In contrast to the Keys, beach systems associated with sedimentary barrier islands are common in mainland areas.\nWithin the Keys, nearshore hard bottom is widely distributed and shows compositional differences based on proximity to tidal passes (Chiappone and Sullivan, 1994). Near tidal passes, these habitats are dominated by algae, gorgonians and sponges. In the absences of strong circulation, such habitats are characterized by fleshy algae, such as Laurencia (Chiappone and Sullivan, 1994). Hard corals are relatively uncommon in nearshore areas, presumably due to greater environmental variability in key parameters (temperature, turbidity, salinity).\n\nTable 16. Geological and biological comparisons between nearshore areas of the east coast mainland and the Florida Keys. Transition areas are given for each attribute.

This work was based on strip transect surveys at two sites in the middle Keys and recorded a total of 30 species within 18 families (Sullivan et al., in prep.). In Jaap (1984) review of Keys reefs, Tilmant compiled a list of 47 fish species occurring on nearshore hard bottom. In contrast, 192 species have been compiled for mainland areas (Lindeman, 1997). The paucity of fish studies on nearshore hard bottom habitats of both the mainland and the Florida Keys render definitive comparisons premature at this stage. Several additional factors further complicate Keys and mainland comparisons. First, nearshore hard bottom in the Keys is distributed across more physiographically variable cross-shelf strata with a greater potential for structural heterogeneity than on the mainland. Second, the presence of over 6000 patch reefs in Hawk Channel (Marszalek et al. 1977), many near shallow hard bottom habitats, introduces additional inter-habitat relationships rarely found in nearshore hard bottom of mainland areas. Characterizing the fish assemblages of the heterogenous nearshore areas of the Keys may be more problematic than for the relatively homogeneous nearshore hard bottom areas of mainland Florida. In both regions, some ecotones and attributes of vertical relief (e.g., sand-hard bottom interfaces and ledges) appear to aggregate some taxa. However, the microhabitat-scale distributions of fishes within nearshore hard bottom habitats remain unquantified.\nOffshore Hard Bottom - In a review by Chiappone and Sluka (1996, Table 5), no studies of fishes from hard bottom areas of the outer reef tract or the intermediate Hawk Channel area were identified. Most studies of offshore fish faunas in the Florida Keys have focused on reef formations derived primarily from hermatypic corals. Such areas may contain bedrock outcroppings properly termed hard bottom, however, this is typically not discriminated in the literature. Therefore, characterizations of offshore hardbottom ichthyofauna are not available and literature focused on coral reef fish assemblages of Hawk Channel and the Florida Reef Tract must be consulted (Section 3.2.1.2.2.2).\n3.2.1.2.3 Hard Bottom Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern : Section 600.815 (a) (9) of the interim final rule on essential fishery habitat determinations\nrecognizes that subunits of EFH may be of particular concern. Such areas, termed Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (EFH-HAPCs), can be identified using four criteria from the rule: a) importance of ecological functions; b) sensitivity to human degradation; c) probability and extent of effects from development activities; and d) rarity of the habitat. Hard bottom habitat types which ranked high in terms of these criteria are summarized below.\n3.2.1.2.3.1 Charleston Bump and Gyre The topographic irregularity southeast of Charleston, South Carolina known as the\nCharleston Bump is an area of productive seafloor, which rises abruptly from 700 to 300 meters within the short distance of about 20 km. The Charleston Bump is located approximately 32\u00b0 44' N. Latitude and 78\u00b0 06' W. Longitude and at an angle which is approximately transverse to both the general isobath pattern and the Gulf Stream currents (Figure 9). Those areas that contain the highest relief are the only known spawning locations for wreckfish. This species is fished intensively within the relatively small area of high relief, and is one of the few species within the snapper-grouper fisheries complex that has been successfully managed as a sustained fishery (C. Barans, SCDNR, pers. commun.)\nThe Charleston Gyre is considered an essential nursery habitat for some offshore fish species with pelagic stages, such as reef fishes. The cyclonic Charleston Gyre is a permanent\n101\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\noceanographic feature of the South Atlantic Bight induced by the reflection of rapidly moving Gulf Stream waters by the topographic irregularity (high relief) southeast of Charleston. The gyre produces a large area of upwelling of nutrients, which contributes significantly to primary and secondary production within the SAB region, and is thus important to some ichthyoplankton. The size of the deflection and physical response in terms of replacement of surface waters with nutrient rich bottom waters from depths of 450 meters to near surface (less than 50 meters) vary with seasonal position and velocity of the Gulf Stream currents. The nutritional contribution of the large upwelling area to productivity of the relatively nutrient poor SAB is significant (C. Barans, SCDNR, pers. commu.).\nFigure 9. Southeastern U.S. continental shelf and slope, showing major topographic featues (diagnol lines indicate the Charleston Bump) and boundaries of the primary commercial wreckfish grounds (heavy dots). (Source: Sedberry et. al., 1994).\n102\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe South Atlantic Bight, the Charleston Bump and Gyre are described in greater detail in \"General Oceanographic description of the South Atlantic Bight with emphasis on the Charleston Bump\" by Oleg Pashuk (George Sedberry SCDNR pers comm) which follows:\n\"The continental shelf off the southeastern United States, commonly called the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), extends from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida (or according to some researchers, to West Palm Beach, Florida). The northern part of the SAB is known as the Carolina Capes Region, while the middle and southern areas are called the Georgia Embayment, or Georgia Bight. The Carolina Capes Region is characterized by complex topography, and their prominent shoals extending to the shelf break are effective in trapping Gulf Stream eddies, whereas the shelf to the south is more smooth.\nShelf widths vary from just a few kilometers off West Palm Beach, Fla, to a maximum of 120 km off Brunswick and Savannah, Georgia. Gently sloping shelf (about 1m/km) can be divided into the following zones: 1)Inner shelf (0-20 m) which is dominated by tidal currents, river runoff, local wind forcing and seasonal atmospheric changes; 2)Midshelf zone (21-40 m) where waters are dominated by winds but influenced by the Gulf Stream. Stratification of water column changes seasonally: mixed conditions, in general, characterize fall and winter while vertical stratification prevail during spring and summer. Strong stratification allows the upwelled waters to advect farther onshore near the bottom and, at the same time, it facilitates offshore spreading of lower salinity water in surface layer. 3)Outer shelf (41-75 m) is dominated by the Gulf Stream. The shelf break, generally, occurs at about 75-m depth, but is shallower southward.\nOceanographic regime on the continental shelf in the South Atlantic Bight is mainly conditioned by 1)proximity of the Gulf Stream with its frequent meanders and eddies; 2)river runoff; 3)seasonal heating and cooling; and 4)bottom topography. Winds and tides can also modify circulation patterns, especially near shore, or where density gradients are weak. Temperature and salinity of shelf waters widely fluctuate seasonally (from 10\u00b0 C to 29\u00b0 C and from 33.0 ppt to 36.5 ppt), whereas warm and salty surface Gulf Stream waters have much less variable properties.\nThe warming influence of the Gulf Stream is especially notable in the winter near the shelf break where tropical species of fish, corals and other animals are found. A warm band of relatively constant temperature (18-22\u00b0 C) and salinity (36.0 ppt - 36.2 ppt) water is observed near bottom year-round just inshore of the shelf break, bounded by seasonally variable inshore waters on one side, and by fluctuating offshore waters on the other side, which are subject to cold eddy/upwelling events and warm Gulf Stream intrusions.\nFresh water nearshore is supplied mainly by the Cape Fear, Pee Dee, Santee, Savannah, and Altamaha rivers. River runoff is the highest during late winter-early spring, with maximum in March. The affect of runoff on coastal and shelf waters is most pronounced by April. Seasonal heating and cooling of coastal and shelf waters follow a trend in air temperature's increase and decrease, with a lag of approximately one month also.\nGeostrophic southward flow develops on the continental shelf and appears to be seasonal, reflecting river runoff and heating-cooling effects. This counter-current is maximum during summer. In late fall-winter, in general, it is no longer a broad continuous flow, and is restricted to narrow patches mainly in nearshore areas in the vicinity of river mouths.\n103\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe fluctuations in the Icelandic Low, the Bermuda-Azores High, and the Ohio Valley High largely govern the mean wind patterns in the SAB. Winds, in general, are from Northeast in fall-winter, and from Southwest in spring-summer, but they can be of different directions during a passage of atmospheric fronts.\nSemiduirnal (M2) tides dominate the SAB. Tidal range varies considerately in the SAB because of varying shelf widths. The maximum coastal tides of 2.2 m occur at Savannah, Georgia, where the shelf is widest, and decrease to 1.3 m at Cape Fear and 1.1 m at Cape Canaveral.\nSmall frontal eddies and meanders propagate northward along the western edge of the Gulf Stream every 1-2 weeks. They provide small-scale upwellings of nutrients along the shelf break in the SAB. In contrast to transit upwellings, there are two areas in the SAB where upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water is more permanent. One such upwelling is located just to the north of Cape Canaveral which is caused by diverging isobaths. The other, much larger and stronger upwelling occurs mainly between 32\u00b0 N. Latitude and 33\u00b0 N. Latitude, and it results from a deflection of the Gulf Stream offshore by the topographic irregularity known as the Charleston Bump.\nIn general, the Gulf Stream flows along the shelf break, with very little meandering, from Florida to about 32o N latitude where it encounters the Charleston Bump and is deflected seaward forming a large offshore meander. The cyclonic Charleston Gyre is formed, with a large upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water in its cold core. The Charleston Bump is the underwater ridge/trough feature located southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, where seafloor rises from 700 to 300 m within a relatively short distance and at a transverse angle to both the general isobaths pattern of the upper slope, and to Gulf Stream currents. Downstream of the Charleston Bump, enlarged wavelike meanders can displace the Gulf Stream front up to 150 km from the shelf break. These meanders can be easily seen in satellite images.\nAlthough 2-3 large meanders and eddies can form downstream of the Bump, the Charleston Gyre is the largest and the most prominent feature. The consistent upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters from the depths over 450 m to the near-surface layer (less than 50 m) is the main steady source of nutrients near the shelf break within the entire South Atlantic Bight, and it contributes significantly to primary and secondary production in the region. The Charleston Gyre is considered an essential nursery habitat for some offshore fish species with pelagic stages. It is also implicated in retention of fish eggs and larvae and their transport onshore.\nThe Charleston Bump and the Gyre can also create suitable habitats for adult fish. For example, the highest relief of the Bump is the only known spawning location of the wreckfish. The Charleston Gyre may be also beneficial to other demersal species of the Snapper-Grouper complex, as well as to pelagic migratory fishes, due to food availability and unique patterns of the currents in this area.\"\n3.2.1.2.3.2 Ten Fathom Ledge and Big Rock The Ten Fathom Ledge and Big Rock areas are located south of Cape Lookout, North\nCarolina. The Ten Fathom Ledge is located at 34\u00b0 11' N. Latitude 76\u00b0 07' W. Longitude in 95 to 120 meter depth on the Continental Shelf in Onslow Bay, North Carolina, beginning along the southern edge of Cape Lookout Shoals. This area encompasses numerous patch reefs of coralalgal-sponge growth on rock outcroppings distributed over 136 square miles of ocean floor. The substrate consists of oolithic calcarenites and coquina forming a thin veneer over the underlying Yorktown formation of silty sands, clays, and calcareous quartz sandstones.\n104\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe Big Rock area encompasses 36 square miles of deep drowned reef around the 50-100 meter isobath on the outer shelf and upper slope approximately 36 miles south of Cape Lookout. Hard substrates at the Big Rock area are predominately algal limestone and calcareous sandstone. Unique bottom topography at both sites produces oases of productive bottom relief with diverse and productive epifaunal and algal communities surrounded by a generally monotonous and relatively unproductive sand bottom. Approximately 150 species of reefassociated species have been documented from the two sites (R. Parker, pers. commu.).\n3.2.1.2.3.3 Shelf Break Area from Florida to North Carolina Although the area of bottom between 100 and 300 meters depths from Cape Hatteras to\nCape Canaveral is small relative to the more inshore live bottom shelf habitat as a whole, it constitutes essential deep reef fish habitat. Series of troughs and terraces are composed of bioeroded limestone and carconate sandstone (Newton et al. 1971), and exhibit vertical relief ranging from less than half a meter to more than 10 meters. Ledge systems formed by rock outcrops and piles of irregularly sized boulders are common.\nOverall, the deep reef fish community probably consists of fewer than 50 species. Parker and Ross (1986) observed 34 species of deepwater reef fishes representing 17 families from submersible operations off North Carolina in waters 98 to 152 meters deep. In another submersible operation in the Charleston Bump area off South Carolina, Gutherz et al. (1995) describe sightings of 27 species of deep water reef fish in waters 185 to 220 meters in depth.\n3.2.1.2.3.4 Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary Grays Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS) is located 17.5 nautical miles east of\nSapelo Island, Georgia, and 35 nautical miles northeast of Brunswick, Georgia. Gray's Reef encompasses nearly 32 km2 at a depth of about 22 meters (Parker et al. 1994). The Sanctuary contains extensive, but patchy hardbottoms of moderate relief (up to 2 meters). Rock outcrops, in the form of ledges, are often separated by wide expanses of sand, and are subject to weathering, shifting sediments, and slumping, which create a complex habitat including caves, burrows, troughs, and overhangs (Hunt 1974). Parker et al. (1994) described the habitat preference of 66 species of reef fish distributed over five different habitat types. Numbers of species and fish densities were highest on the ledge habitat, intermediate on live bottom, and lowest over sand.\n3.2.1.2.3.5 Nearshore Hard Bottom of Mainland Southeast Florida. Extending semi-continuously from Cape Canaveral (28o30' N) to at least Boca Raton (26o\n20' N), nearshore hard bottom was evaluated in terms of the four HAPC criteria in Section 600.815 of the final interim rule. In terms of ecological function, several lines of evidence suggest that nearshore hard bottom reefs may serve as nursery habitat. The following summary is based on the quantitative information available (Lindeman, 1997, Lindeman and Snyder, manuscript), which also included life stage-specific abundance data. First, pooled early life stages consistently represented over 80% of the total individuals at all sites censused. Second, eight of the top ten most abundant species were consistently represented by early stages. Third, use of hard bottom habitats was recorded for newly settled stages of more than 20 species.\nAlthough suggestive of nursery value, these lines of evidence need to be viewed in the appropriate context. The presence of more juvenile stages than adults does not guarantee a habitat is a valuable nursery. Rapid decays in the benthic or planktonic survival of early stages of marine fishes are common demographic patterns (Shulman and Ogden, 1987; Richards and Lindeman, 1987), insuring that if distributions are homogeneous, all habitats will have more\n105\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nearly stages than adults. Are early stages equally distributed among differing habitats or consistently skewed towards particular cross-shelf habitats? The high numbers of early stages on nearshore reefs appear to reflect more than just larger initial numbers of young individuals. Newly settled stages of most species of grunts and eight of nine species of snappers of the southeast mainland Florida shelf have been recorded primarily in depths less than five m, despite substantial sampling efforts in deeper waters. Adults are infrequent or absent from the same shallow habitats. There is habitat segregation among life stages, with the earliest stages using the most shallow habitats in many species of grunts and snappers (Starck, 1970; Lindeman, 1997; Dennis, 1992). Similar ontogenetic differences in both distribution and abundance exist for many other taxa which utilize nearshore hard bottom habitats. Based on this and other evidence, Lindeman and Snyder (manuscript) concluded that at least 35 species utilize nearshore hard bottom as a primary or secondary nursery area. At least ten of these species are managed under the Snapper/Grouper FMP.\nBecause nearshore areas are relatively featureless expanses of sand in the absence of hard bottom, such structures may also have substantial value as reference points for spawning activities of inshore fishes. Many fishes require three-dimensional structure as a reference point for coarse-scale aggregation and fine-scale behavior during spawning (Thresher, 1984). Using information from the literature, personal observations, and discussions with commercial fishermen, 15 species were estimated to spawn on nearshore reefs (Lindeman, 1997). An additional 20 species may also spawn on or near these reefs. Some are of substantial economic value; these include snook, pompano, and several herring species. At least 90 species known to associate with nearshore hard bottom structures are utilized in South Florida fisheries. The majority of these species are represented primarily by early life stages. Approximately fifty-one species are of recreational value and thirty species are of commercial value. Twenty-two species are utilized for bait and twenty-one species are marketed within the aquaria industry. Based on the demonstrated or potential value of these areas as nurseries and spawning sites for many economically valuable species, nearshore hard bottom habitats were estimated to support highly important ecological functions, the first criterion.\nThe second and third HAPC criteria, sensitivity and probability of anthropogenic stressors, are interrelated in terms of nearshore hard bottom. They are treated collectively here. Various stretches of nearshore hard bottom have been completely buried by dredging projects associated with beach management activities in this subregion (Section 4.1.2.3). They may also be subjected to indirect stressors over both short and long time scales from such projects. For example, between 1995 and 1998, up to 19 acres of nearshore hard bottom reefs were buried by beach dredging projects at two sites in Palm Beach County. A proposed project may bury an additional hard bottom in 1998 or 1999. Such activities occur within other counties of this subregion as well. The 50-year planning document for beach management in southeast mainland Florida (ACOE, 1996), includes beach dredge-fill projects for over fifteen areas, with renourishment intervals averaging 6-8 years. Given the past and projected future, it is concluded that both the sensitivity of these habitats and the probability of anthropogenic stressors is high.\nIn terms of the final EFH-HAPC criterion, rarity, nearshore hard bottom also ranks high. In southeast mainland Florida, most shorelines between Dade and Broward Counties (25\u00b030'26\u00b020' N) lack natural nearshore hard bottom with substantial three-dimensional structure (ACOE, 1996). Although substantial stretches of nearshore hard bottom exist in portions of Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, and Indian River Counties (Perkins et al., 1997) (26\u00b020'-27\u00b015' N) these reefs are often separated by kilometers of barren stretches of sand. Offshore, most midshelf areas (5-20 m) are also dominated by expanses of sand despite the variable occurrence of\n106\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nseveral mid-shelf reef lines. Therefore, there are no natural habitats in the same or adjacent nearshore areas that can support equivalent abundances of early life stages. Absences of nursery structure can logically result in increased predation and lowered growth. In newly settled and juvenile stages, such conditions could create demographic bottlenecks that ultimately result in lowered local population sizes.\nNursery usage of nearshore hard bottom reefs may be a bi-directional phenomenon. Many species utilize these habitats during both newly settled and older juvenile life stages. This suggests that nearshore hard bottom can facilitate both inshore and offshore migrations during differing ontogenetic stages of some species. Their limited availability doesn't necessarily decrease their value. When present, they may serve a primary nursery role as shelter for incoming early life stages which would undergo increased predation mortality without substantial habitat structure. In addition, some species use these structures as resident nurseries; settling, growing-out, and maturing sexually as permanent residents (e. g., pomacentrids, labrisomids). A secondary nursery role may result from increased growth because of higher food availabilities in structure-rich environments. Nearshore hard bottom may also serve as secondary nursery habitat for juveniles that emigrate out of inlets towards offshore reefs. This pattern is seen in gray snapper and bluestriped grunt which typically settle inside inlets and only use nearshore hard bottom as older juveniles (Lindeman, 1997).\nIn summary, nearshore hardbottom habitats of southeast Florida ranked high in terms of ecological function, sensitivity, probability of stressor introduction, and rarity. Based on the criteria in Section 600.815 (a) (9), it is concluded that they represent Essential Fish HabitatHabitat Areas of Particular Concern for species managed under the Snapper/Grouper Fishery Management Plan and dozens of other species which co-occur with many species in this management unit.\n3.2.2 Artificial/Manmade Reefs 3.2.2.1 Artificial/Manmade Reefs Defined\nThe National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 (Title II of P.L.98-623) defined artificial reefs as \"...a structure which is constructed or placed in waters....for the purpose of enhancing fishery resources and commercial and recreational fisheries opportunities.\" Since the term \"artificial reef\" tends to promote a misconception that the diverse biotic communities that develop on and around these structures are totally different from those found on natural reefs or live/hard bottom areas, the term \"manmade reef\" might serve as a better description of these habitats. Considering the long-term nature of the majority of the artificial reefs developed in the South Atlantic Bight since the mid-1960's, possibly the only \"artificial\" aspect to this type of hard bottom habitat is man's choice of substrate, timing and location selected for development. For this reason, the term \"manmade reef\" is likely a more accurate description of the resulting habitat and surrounding biological community that results from the establishment of these \"artificial\" reefs.\nFor all purposes within this document, manmade reefs are defined as any area within marine waters in which suitable structures or materials have intentionally been placed by man for the purpose of creating, restoring or improving long-term habitat for the eventual exploitation, conservation or preservation of the resulting marine ecosystems that are naturally established on these materials. In this light, manmade reefs should be viewed primarily as fishery management tools. There is no intention to imply that manmade reefs are identical in all respects to naturally occurring hard bottom areas or coral reefs; however, in consideration of the processes that lead\n107\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nto their development the management of the associated living marine resources common on all types of reef communities, they are very similar.\n3.2.2.1.1 Function and Ecology of New Hard Bottom Habitats Hard bottom habitats can be formed when overlying soft sediments are transported away\nfrom an area by storms, currents or other forces. The underlying rock or hard-packed sediment which is exposed provides new primary hard substrate for the attachment and development of epibenthic assemblages (Sheer, 1945; Goldberg, 1973a; Jackson, 1976; Osmand, 1977). This substrate is colonized when marine algae and larvae of epibenthic animals successfully settle and thrive. Species composition and abundance of individuals increase quickly until all suitable primary space is used by the epibenthos. At some point, a dynamic equilibrium may be reached with the number of species and number of new recruits leveling off. Competition for space and grazing pressure become significant ecological processes in determining which epibenthic species may persist (Kirby-Smith and Ustach, 1986; Paine, 1974; Sutherland and Karlson, 1977). The reef community itself should remain intact as long as the supporting hard substrate remains and is not buried under too great an overburden of sediment.\nConcurrent with the development of the epibenthic assemblage, demersal reef-dwelling finfish recruit to the new hard bottom habitat. Juvenile life stages will use this habitat for protection from predators, orientation in the water column or on the reef itself and as a feeding area. Adult life stages of demersal reef-dwelling finfish can use the habitat for protection from predation, feeding opportunities, orientation in the water column and on the reef and as spawning sites.\nPelagic planktivores occur on hard bottom habitats in high densities and use these habitats for orientation in the water column and feeding opportunities. These species provide important food resources to demersal reef-dwelling and pelagic piscivores. The pelagic piscivores use the hard bottom habitats for feeding opportunistically. Most of these species do not take up residence on individual hard bottom outcrops, but will transit through hard bottom areas and feed for varying periods of time (Sedberry and Van Dolha, 1984).\n3.2.2.1.2 Function and Ecology of Manmade Reefs Manmade reefs are deployed to change habitats from a soft substrate to a hard substrate\nsystem or to add vertical profile to low profile (< 1m.) hard substrate systems. These reefs are generally deployed to provide fisheries habitat in a specific desired location that provides some measurable benefit to humans. When manmade reefs are constructed, they provide new primary hard substrate similar in function to newly exposed hard bottom (3.2.2.1.1)(Goren, 1985). Aside from the often obvious differences in the physical characteristics and nature of the materials involved in creating a manmade reef, the ecological succession and processes involved in the establishment of the epibenthic assemblages occur in a similar fashion on natural hard substrates and man-placed hard substrates (Wendt et al., 1989). Demersal reef-dwelling finfish, pelagic planktivores and pelagic predators use natural and manmade hard substrates in very similar ways and often interchangeably (Sedberry, 1988). The changes in species composition and local abundance of important species in a specific area are often seen as the primary benefits of reef deployment activities.\nAs noted by researchers the physical characteristics of manmade reef habitat may result in differences in the observed behavior of fish species on or around such structures in contrast to behavior observed on equivalent areas of natural hard bottoms (Bohnsack, 1989). Some reef structures, particularly those of higher profile, seem to yield generally higher densities of\n108\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmanaged and non-managed pelagic and demersal species than a more widely spread, lower profile, natural hard bottom or reef (Rountree, 1989). The fishery management implications of these differences must be recognized and taken into consideration when planning, developing, and managing manmade reefs as essential fish habitat.\n3.2.2.1.3 Function and Ecology of Other Manmade Structures in the Marine Environment Other manmade hard substrates in marine and estuarine systems provide habitat of\nvarying value to fisheries resources. Coastal engineering structures such as bridges, jetties, breakwaters and shipwrecks provide significant hard substrate for epibenthic colonization and development of an associated finfish assemblage (Van Dolah, 1987). Some of these structures also provide habitat in the water column and intertidal zone which differs significantly from typical benthic reefs. The result of the different ecotones provided by these coastal structures is often higher species diversity than was present before the structure was placed on site. These structures also may provide refuge from predation as well as feeding opportunities and orientation points for juvenile and adult life stages of important finfish species in the South Atlantic region. They differ from manmade reefs as defined above, in that there is generally no direct intention in their design or placement to achieve specific fishery management objectives. However, their impacts should be considered just as any other activity which modifies habitats in the marine environment. It is important to consider that man-made structures often directly or indirectly (through mitigation) replace productive natural habitats.\nPilings vary substantially in their size, shape, and positioning. Those associated with leeward barrier island marinas are typically narrow and placed in shallow, calm water. Combinations of dock pilings and other structures can support sizeable fish assemblages (Iverson and Bannerot, 1984). Pilings associated with bridges are typically much larger, possess more cavities, and are placed in deeper, physically dynamic areas. Bridge pilings in deep channels can possess diverse and abundant ichthyofaunas. A large percentage of the fauna typical to offshore reefs can be found on these habitats, areas where such life stages would not occur under natural conditions. In South Florida, many species reach sizes on inshore bridges that are associated with maturation and have been collected in spawning condition (Lindeman, 1997). While the flat vertical surfaces of seawalls provide little structure for fish usage, many local agencies have added more complex structure in the form of bolders at the bases of seawalls to provide habitat and limit scouring of sediment. Approximately four times as many species have been recorded along seawalls sections with bolders compared to bare sections (Lindeman, 1997).\n3.2.2.2 Manmade Reef Development in the South Atlantic Bight While manmade reefs have been in use along the U.S. South Atlantic Coast since the\n1800's, their development in this region was somewhat limited through the mid-1960's. From the late 1960's to the present, reef development off the South Atlantic States (as measured by the number of permitted construction sites) has increased nearly five-fold, with approximately 250 sites now permitted in the coastal and offshore waters of these four states. Roughly half of these sites are in waters off the east coast of Florida alone. Artificial reef locations are considered live/hard bottom habitat and have been included in the SEAMAP Bottom Mapping Project data base and maps presented in Appendix E. In addition, artificial reef locations and structural detail where readily available for select states is presented in Appendix Q.\nThe total area of ocean and estuarine bottom along the South Atlantic States which has been permitted for the development of manmade reefs at present is approximately 129,000 acres (or 155 nm2). Due to practical limitations experienced by all artificial reef programs, it is very\n109\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nlikely that only a very small percentage of any of these permitted reef sites has actually been developed through the addition of suitable hard substrate. However, since in most cases construction activities may continue indefinitely on these sites, the percentage of hard bottom habitat developed will continue to rise as new materials are added.\nRecreational anglers remain the chief user group associated with manmade reefs in this region. Financial resources made available directly or indirectly through a large number saltwater sportfishing interests have been a prominent factor in most reef development projects. Due to favorable environmental conditions throughout most of the year along the South Atlantic States, recreational divers have also been a driving force in the establishment of many manmade reefs in recent years. This relatively new user group will continue to grow as does the popularity of this activity nationwide. While not as significant a user group across the region as the previous two, commercial fishing interests are present on some manmade reefs.\nState marine resources management agencies in all four South Atlantic states are actively involved in various aspects of manmade reef planning, development and management in their own waters as well as contiguous federal waters. All four states have, or are in the process of developing, their own state artificial reef management plans. North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia control all manmade reef development through programs within their respective natural resource management agencies, and hold all active permits for reef development. Florida's reef development efforts are carried out by individual county or municipal programs with a limited degree of oversight conducted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Reef construction permits in Florida are held by state, county and municipal government agencies or programs.\n3.2.2.2.1 North Carolina The North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) has been involved in artificial\nreef construction since the early 1970's. Responding to interest generated by local fishing club reef projects, the Division began a reef construction program using bundled automobile tires. Hundreds of thousands of tires were deployed on several reefs from Cape Lookout to Brunswick County.\nIn 1974, three 440-foot Liberty Class ships were cleaned and sunk on reef sites off Oregon Inlet, Beaufort Inlet and Masonboro Inlet. Another Liberty ship was added to the Oregon Inlet site in 1978. These surplus vessels were obtained from the federal government under Public Law 92-402, also known as the Liberty Ship Act. Artificial reef construction continued using tires and smaller surplus vessels until 1986 when the reef program was reorganized.\nDuring 1986 and 1987, twenty-one new reef sites were permitted by the DMF and 210 train cars were deployed on these sites. Use of tires was eliminated in the early 1980's due to stability problems. Reef construction permits which were held by various counties and clubs were transferred to the Division under a general permit issued to DMF by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE).\nAt present, the DMF maintains 46 artificial reef sites (see Appendix Q). These sites are located from one to 38 miles from shore and are strategically located near every maintained inlet along the coast. In recent years, most of the oceanic and some of the estuarine reefs have received new construction. Materials deployed since 1986 include 30 vessels, 10,000 pieces of large diameter concrete pipe, 210 train cars and over 40,000 tons of concrete pipe, bridge railings and rubble.\n110\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nIn addition to USACOE construction permits, aids to navigation permits are also maintained for the buoys which mark the center point of the artificial reef sites. The reef program uses a 115-foot landing craft for deploying and maintaining buoys, as well as for small construction projects.\nPrior to 1990, emphasis was placed on artificial reef construction. With funding provided by the Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration Program, the reef program has started a monitoring program to evaluate the effectiveness of reef materials, to test designed materials and to monitor fish assemblages on the reef. Aerial surveys are conducted to assess artificial reef usage along the coast and surveys of king mackerel tournament entrants are used to measure reef use, awareness and catch rates.\nThe DMF maintains one of the most active artificial reef programs in the nation. Adequate state funding and enthusiastic support from many civic and fishing clubs along the coast continues to ensure the success of North Carolina's artificial reef program.\n3.2.2.2.2 South Carolina The use of manmade structures to enhance fishing activities in South Carolina's coastal\nwaters was first documented during the mid-1800's. During the mid-1960's the construction of offshore and coastal artificial reefs for the benefit of saltwater recreational anglers was carried out by numerous private organizations. In 1967 the state provided funding for its first manmade reef construction project, and in 1973 an on-going state-sponsored marine artificial reef program was established. This program is currently maintained by the Marine Resources Division of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) within the Division's Office of Fisheries Management Funding for the program consists of state support through the SCDNR budget, federal support through grants from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service-managed Sport Fish Restoration Program, and additional support at the state level through the South Carolina Marine Recreational Fisheries Stamp.\nThe primary focus of the South Carolina Marine Artificial Reef Program (SCMARP) is the coordination and oversight of all activities within the state of South Carolina concerning the management of a viable system of marine artificial reefs in both state and contiguous federal waters. The primary goal of these manmade reefs is the enhancement of hard bottom marine habitats, associated fish stocks and resulting recreational fishing activities that take place on and around them. The SCMARP's responsibilities include reef planning, design, permitting, construction, monitoring, evaluation, research and marking. The program also plays a key role in interfacing with the public in areas related to general fisheries management issues as well as in providing specific reef-related information to user groups.\nAll manmade reef development and management in South Carolina is guided by the South Carolina Marine Artificial Reef Management Plan, adopted in 1991. As of January 1998, the state's system of marine artificial reefs consisted of 43 permitted sites (12 inside state waters) along approximately 160 miles of coastline. These sites range in location from estuarine creeks to as far as 32 miles offshore. Each manmade reef site consists of a permitted area ranging from several thousand square yards to as much as one square mile. Approximately seven square miles of coastal and open ocean bottom has been permitted, of which less than two percent has actually been developed through the addition of manmade reef substrate.\nSaltwater recreational anglers are the primary group associated with marine artificial reef utilization in South Carolina. Their annual fishing activities on manmade reef sites alone account for tens-of-thousands of angler-days, which result in an estimated total economic benefit to the state of over 20 million dollars each year. While some use of permitted artificial reefs by\n111\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\ncommercial fishing interests has been reported over the past three decades, this activity has been difficult to quantify since these practices do not have popular support with the majority of the fishing public, or may in some cases be illegal. Recreational divers comprise the second most common user group relying on the presence of marine artificial reefs. While sport divers have traditionally not been as large a user group as the saltwater recreational fishing community, significant expansion of the recreational diving industry in the state has resulted in a noticeable increase in this type of usage over the past two decades.\nIn an attempt to better manage the use of permitted manmade reefs in offshore waters and to ensure their long-term viability, the SCDNR has, through the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, obtained or applied for Special Management Zone (SMZ) status for 29 of the 31 permitted reef sites located in federal waters. Fishing on those reef sites granted SMZ status is restricted to hand-held hook and line gear and spearfishing (without powerheads). While none exist at the moment, the SCDNR is exploring the feasibility and possible benefits of establishing no-take manmade reefs in nearshore and offshore waters solely for the purpose of stock and habitat enhancement. For additional information refer to Appendix Q and http://water.dnr.state.sc.us/marine/pub/seascience/artreef.html.\n3.2.2.2.3 Georgia The continental shelf off Georgia slopes gradually eastward for 80 miles before reaching\nthe Gulf Stream and the continental slope. This broad, shallow shelf consists primarily of dynamic sand/shell expanses that do not provide the firm foundation or structure needed for the development of reef fish communities, which include popular gamefish such as grouper, snapper, amberjack, and sea bass. Less than 5% of Georgia's adjacent shelf consists of natural reefs (a.k.a., \"live bottoms,\" \"hard bottoms\"), with most of these located more than 40 miles offshore.\nEarly artificial reef development efforts off Georgia were initiated by private clubs, who realized that wrecks and similar structures would create enhanced fishing and diving opportunities closer to shore. These sporadic efforts were limited and largely ineffectual. In the late 1960's, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) began experimenting with artificial reef construction in its estuarine waters. These activities were soon expanded in the early 1970's to the state's adjacent federal waters in order to provide increased, more safely accessible opportunities to offshore anglers and recreational divers. Secondary use materials, otherwise known as \"materials of opportunity,\" were primarily used, consisting of tire units, scrap vessels, concrete/steel rubble, culvert, and surplused military vehicles. To date, the state program has constructed 15 artificial reefs from 5-23 miles offshore, as well as 11 estuarine reefs. Most of the offshore artificial reefs and all of the estuarine reefs are buoyed or marked.\nContinued expansion of the existing manmade reefs is planned, including the construction of additional offshore and inshore reef sites. Both secondary use and designed materials are currently being used by the program, with an increasing focus on fisheries habitat development. A state artificial reef management plan is expected to be finalized in 1998.\nGeorgia's artificial reef program is housed within the Marine Fisheries Section of GADNR's Coastal Resources Division. Ongoing artificial reef development and maintenance activities are primarily funded through the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program, better known as the Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux program. Other than in-kind match provided through salaries, direct state funding to date has been sporadic.\nOffshore development activities are authorized under a Regional Permit issued to GADNR by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, while estuarine development efforts are permitted individually by the Corps of Engineers and the state of Georgia. All buoys and\n112\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmarkers are permitted through the United States Coast Guard. Many of Georgia's offshore artificial reefs are also designated Special Management Zones (SMZs), where gear is limited to traditional recreational hook-and-line and spearfishing gear (including powerheads).\nAnglers constitute the largest user group on Georgia's offshore and estuarine artificial reefs. Recreational diving at the reefs is limited and primarily restricted to the artificial reefs found well offshore due to improved water visibilities and since these reefs feature the larger wrecks popular with divers. No firm determination has been made regarding the overall contribution of the state's artificial reefs to coastal economies, although rough estimations have suggested a $3-5 million impact annually.\n3.2.2.2.4 Florida (East Coast) Florida leads the nation in the number of public manmade fishing reefs developed. The\nfirst permitted artificial reef off Florida was constructed in 1918. Manmade reefs are found in waters ranging from eight feet to over 200 feet with an average depth of 70 feet. No fewer than 595 deployments of manmade reef materials off the Florida East Coast are on record with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). Over the last 40 years the state reef program has experienced a gradual transition in construction materials use, funding sources, and recognition of the importance of measuring effectiveness.\nThe State's involvement in funding manmade reef construction began in the mid-1960's when the Florida Board of Conservation awarded a limited number of grants to local governments to fund reef development projects. In 1971 a Florida Recreational Development Assistance Program grant was awarded to a local government by the DNR Division of Recreation and Parks for reef construction. Between 1976 and 1980 the DNR Division of Marine Resources received, and oversaw the preparation and placement of five Liberty ships, secured as a result of passage of the Liberty Ship Act, which facilitated the release of obsolete troop and cargo ships for use as artificial reefs.\n1978 marked the beginning of a systematic state artificial reef program. The Division of Marine Resources received a large grant from the Coastal Plains Regional Commission for artificial reef development. Rules for disbursing these funds were developed, defining a grantsin-aid program with projects selected through a competitive evaluation of local government proposals. In 1979 the State Legislature appropriated general revenue funds for reef construction which continued on an annual basis, with the exception of one year, through 1990. In 1982, in addition to receiving general revenue funds, the program was officially established as a grantsin-aid program by law (s. 370.25, Florida Statutes). One staff position was assigned responsibility for program administration.\nThe rapid proliferation of publicly funded artificial reefs in Florida beginning in the mid 1980's is the result of increased levels of federal, state and local government funding for artificial reef development. Prior to that, other state funding sources intermittently provided reef development assistance. In 1966 there were seven permitted artificial reef sites off Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. By 1987, this number had grown to 112. Consistent federal funding for Florida's reef program became available in 1986 as a result of the Wallop-Breaux amendment to the 1950 Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (Dingle-Johnson) . During the decade of reef-building activity from 1986-1996, Sport Fish Restoration Funds provided almost three million dollars to complete 164 Florida reef projects.\nIn January 1990, Florida instituted a saltwater fishing license program. About 5% of the revenue from the sale of over 850,000 fishing licenses annually became available for additional\n113\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nartificial reef projects. Two additional personnel were hired into the state artificial reef program to assist with coordination, information sharing, grant monitoring/compliance and diving assessment of artificial reefs. Saltwater license funds available for reef development have been approximately $300,000 for the past three years. Other revenue sources used for artificial reef projects are variable, however, currently these revenues cumulatively exceed the total annual state/federally funded artificial reef development grant program project budget of $600,000.\nFlorida is the only southeastern Atlantic coastal state active in artificial reef development which does not have a direct state-managed artificial reef program. For the last 20 years, Florida's artificial reef program has been a cooperative local and state government effort, with additional input provided by non-governmental fishing and diving interests. The state program's primary objective has been to provide grants-in-aid to local coastal governments for the purpose of developing artificial fishing reefs in state and adjacent federal waters off both coasts in order to locally increase sport fishing resources and enhance sport fishing opportunities. All but three active permitted reef sites are held by individual coastal counties or cities.\nReef management expertise at the local government level is variable. Reef programs are found in solid waste management, public works, natural resources, recreation and parks, administrative, and planning departments. Local government reef coordinators range from biologists and marine engineers to city clerks, grants coordinators, planners, and even unpaid volunteers. Reef management and coordination are generally collateral duties for most local government reef coordinators.\nLong range systematic planning and general reef management at the local government levels have lagged behind the rate of reef construction in Florida. Site specific projects are planned but the broader areas of program evaluation and actual management have not received much attention. A \"State Artificial Reef Development Plan\" was drafted in 1992 but there are currently few formal county level or regional artificial reef management plans which tie in with this plan or the National Artificial Reef Plan.\nDue to its abundance of coastline, ideal conditions, and large number of academic and research-oriented institutions, a significant quantity of the existing body of field research dealing with manmade reefs has been conducted in waters off Florida. Artificial reef research projects undertaken with over a million dollars in state funding since 1990 have included studies on reef spacing and design, material stability and storm impact studies, long term studies of reef community succession, residency of gag grouper on patch reefs through tagging and radio telemetry, juvenile recruitment to reefs, and impacts of directed fishing.\nAs with most other artificial reef programs in the U.S., there has been a shift in the types of materials used in the construction of manmade reefs in Florida waters over the past 35 years. Through experience, reef builders have learned which materials work best in providing effective long-lived manmade reefs. Modern construction practices have evolved to a point where reef programs are much more selective in the types of materials they use.\nConcrete materials, chiefly culverts and other prefabricated steel reinforced concrete, were the primary reef material in nearly 52% of the 480 public reef deployments in waters off Florida over the past 16 years. Engineered artificial reef units are a small but growing component of the state's manmade reef development efforts. During the last five years no fewer than five prefabricated concrete artificial reef designs have been utilized in 67 publicly funded reef deployments. Most, but not all, units designed specifically for use as artificial reefs have proven to be stable in major storm events. Future requirements for engineering evaluation of modules prior to deployment will be required. Prefabricated units designed specifically for use as\n114\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmanmade reefs have focused on improving upon habitat complexity, stability, and durability, as well as providing a standard design for research and monitoring projects.\nSecondary use materials such as obsolete oil platforms and steel vessels have also been used off Florida in the development of manmade reefs. Forty-six percent of the 595 Florida east coast artificial fishing reef structures are sunken vessels. These reefs have catered to fishermen fishing for pelagic species, and a rapidly expanding resident and tourist diving population. The majority of vessels sunk as manmade reefs are concentrated off Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward Counties.\nFlorida has had a long and diverse history of manmade reef development. Over the last 40 years there has been a shift in emphasis on use of any available material of opportunity which would serve as a three dimensional fish attractor without regard to the longevity or ultimate fate of the material, to emphasis on non- polluting, durable, and storm resistant structures with a life expectancy of at least twenty years. A shift has also taken place during the last two decades from non-governmental control of reef development to cooperative state/county/private partnerships where local governments assume responsibility and manage the permitted reef sites.\n3.2.2.3 Manmade Reef Construction Practices Manmade reefs have been built from a wide variety of materials over the years. As has\nbeen the case in almost all artificial reef development activity in the U.S. throughout the present century, most construction materials relied upon in the South Atlantic States have been forms of scrap or surplus; some more suitable for this purpose than others. While many of these materials have been the construction resource of necessity rather than solely of choice, it has become evident in recent years that a total reliance upon scrap or surplus materials for continued reef development activities in most coastal states may not be entirely practical if reef development goals are to be realized and a desirable degree of quality control achieved.\nIn an effort to decrease dependency of successful reef development on the availability of scrap or surplus materials, and to improve the overall effectiveness and safety of manmade reefs, most artificial reef programs have designed, manufactured and/or evaluated a number of specifically engineered reef habitat structures which may become a more viable option for future reef development projects. Due primarily to improved financial support for most artificial reef programs in the South Atlantic States and a willingness within private industry to develop new and affordable designed reef structures, the use of such reef construction material is now much more feasible.\nWhether specifically designed or secondary use materials are utilized to construct manmade reefs, individual state resource management agencies should be able to define particular materials that are deemed acceptable for use as reef structures in their coastal and adjacent offshore waters. The decision to allow or disallow the use of certain materials should be based on existing state and federal regulations and guidelines, as well as any soundly based policies established by a particular state. Materials should only be considered for use if they possess characteristics which allow them to safely meet the established objectives for the manmade reef project under consideration, and present no real risk to the environment in which they are being placed. The document entitled \"Guidelines for Marine Artificial Reef Materials,\" published by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, provides detailed information of the experiences, benefits, and drawbacks of past uses of a variety of materials by state resource management agencies. This, as well as other related documents, and the collective experiences of individual artificial reef programs, may be relied upon as the best available data in making decisions regarding the use of certain types of materials in manmade reef development.\n115\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.2.2.3.1 Secondary Use Materials Most manmade reefs in existence along the South Atlantic States have been constructed\nfrom a variety of forms of scrap or surplus materials. Due to their secondary use nature and unpredictable availability, most of these materials can be classified as \"secondary use materials\" (a.k.a.: \"materials of opportunity\"). Although past artificial reef development in most states has been directly tied to the availability of these materials due to budgetary constraints, this may not be the most desirable situation for continued planning and development of reef construction efforts in the future. While a total dependency on scrap and surplus materials is not the most effective means of managing reef development activities, some secondary use materials, when available in the proper condition, are very desirable in carrying out manmade reef construction projects and should continue to be utilized to enhance fisheries habitat.\nIn some cases naturally occurring materials such as quarry rock, limestone, or even shell have been utilized to construct manmade reefs. While these are not by definition scrap materials, their availability is sometimes dictated by a desire to move them from an existing site where for some reason they may no longer be desired. In these cases, they could be classified as a material of opportunity. In other cases, as in the intent to build a reef to provide a rocky bottom substrate, material such as quarry rock or limestone may be the most suitable material available to create the intended habitat, and may be specifically sought after.\nIn the South Atlantic States individual state artificial reef programs, resource management agencies, or other approved reef programs serve as the central contact and coordination point for evaluating, approving, distributing and deploying secondary use materials on a given state's system of artificial reefs. Before agreeing to approve any materials for use in reef construction, the managing or oversight agency must carefully inspect the items and ensure that they are environmentally safe, structurally and physically stable, needed, practical, and can be deployed in a cost-effective and safe manner. A detailed discussion of the benefits, limitations and problems encountered in using the almost limitless list of secondary use materials that have been employed over the years in the construction of manmade reefs is well beyond the scope of this document. However, both the Atlantic and Gulf State Marine Fisheries Commissions, as well as other individual artificial reef programs have produced publications which cover in great detail, many of the strengths and weaknesses of secondary use materials which have been employed in reef development.\n3.2.2.3.2 Designed Habitat Structures A total reliance on the availability of suitable secondary use materials in attempting to\ndevelop a productive system of artificial reefs presents several problems. If an artificial reef program is to function in a manner that is conducive to effective long-term planning and the pursuit of realistic (fishery management driven) reef development goals, it can not continue to base reef construction solely on the unpredictable availability and diminished quantity of acceptable scrap or surplus materials. The only practical solution is to consider the incorporation of manufactured reef structures into planned reef development activities.\nManufactured manmade reef structures can be developed which possess the characteristics desired of a reef substrate for a specific environment, application, or end result. Although the initial costs in procuring these reef materials may be higher than those involved in obtaining many secondary use materials, the transportation, handling and deployment costs are typically about the same, and the lack of expense in having to clean or otherwise prepare these structures can often balance out this difference completely. Being able to engineer into a reef\n116\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmaterial design specific qualities of stability, durability, structural integrity, transportability and biological effectiveness also gives manufactured reef structures a great advantage over most secondary use materials which are often severely limited in how they can be modified or deployed.\nManufactured reef units can be deployed in any quantity, profile and pattern required, allowing them to provide for maximum efficiency of the materials used in achieving the desired results. Secondary use materials such as ships must be deployed in a single unit, often with a great deal of the total material volume being taken up in vertical profile. The same volume of designed reef materials that would be found in a vessel can be spread over a much larger area of ocean bottom with much less relief, allowing for better access to a larger number of reef users and a \"more natural\" appearance in the layout of the reef.\nOne of the most significant advantages offered by the use of designed reef structures is the ability to procure them in any quantity any time they are needed. This allows reef managers to plan ahead and make the best possible use of available funding, as well as predict exact costs needed to accomplish specific reef construction objectives from month to month or year to year. When depending on secondary use materials for reef development, this type of short and longterm planning is rarely available.\n3.2.2.3.3 Standards for Manmade Reef Construction The National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 (Title II of P.L.98-623) provides broad\nstandards for the development of manmade reefs in the United States. The purpose of the Act was to \"promote and facilitate responsible and effective efforts to establish artificial reefs in the navigable waters of the US and waters superjacent to the outer continental shelf (as defined in 43 USC, Section 1331) to the extent such waters exist in or are adjacent to any State.\" In Section 203, the Act establishes the following standards for artificial reef development. \"Based on the best scientific information available, artificial reefs in waters covered under the Act...shall be sited and constructed, and subsequently monitored and managed in a manner which will:\n(1) enhance fishery resources to the maximum extent practicable; (2) facilitate access and utilization by US recreational and commercial fishermen; (3) minimize conflicts among competing uses of waters covered under this title and the resources in such waters; (4) minimize environmental risks and risks to personal health and property; and (5) be consistent with generally accepted principles of international law and shall not create any unreasonable obstruction to navigation.\"\nSection 204 of the Act also calls for the development of a National Artificial Reef Plan consistent with these standards. This plan was published by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1985 and includes discussions of criteria for siting and constructing manmade reefs, as well as mechanisms and methodologies for monitoring and managing such reefs. While the Plan itself lacked any degree of regulatory authority, adopted regulations subsequently developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for dealing with the issuance of artificial reef construction permits were based on the standards set forth in the Act as well as wording taken from the Plan. The Plan is in the process of being reviewed and revised by the NMFS with significant input being provided by existing state artificial reef programs.\nEach state artificial reef program has its own set of standards for the development and management of artificial reefs. In most cases these state standards were developed with the\n117\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nfederal standards from the National Fisheries Enhancement Act and the National Artificial Reef Plan in mind. While specific state programs may differ in matters involving technical operation or specific management issues, they are all very similar in their adoption of the national standards that exist.\n3.2.2.4 Manmade Reefs in Marine Resource Management Although manmade reefs may be classified as potentially powerful fishery management\ntools, it is safe to say at this point that their full potential in this capacity has yet to be realized. This is due in part to a past frequent disassociation between some reef developers and resource management agencies tasked with ensuring the long-term viability of the resources commonly affected by the establishment of additional hard bottom habitat. While this situation has been greatly improved in recent years through the establishment of state artificial reef programs, most of which are now operated by state resource management agencies, the primary limitation to maximizing benefits from manmade reefs has been their singular mode of use. Traditionally in most coastal states, manmade reefs have chiefly been relied upon for one primary purpose - the enhancement of marine recreational fishing activities.\nIn the past, little thought may have been given to the quantity, quality and degree of longterm success of hard bottom habitat and associated reef communities derived through the establishment of manmade reefs. The primary obtainable measure of success in most reef projects up to this point has been the direct benefit they provide to anglers, the fishing industry and the economy of a given locale. While these are certainly very valid and important benefits achievable through reef development, there are perhaps other benefits which could be realized through the establishment of manmade reefs given a change in focus on the desired end results of reef habitat development efforts.\nNot all manmade structures that have been placed in U.S. waters can necessarily be considered essential or even effective fish habitat. In the earlier years of artificial reef construction efforts in this country, poor planning, vague objectives, a lack of experience and basic information resulted in ineffective, and sometimes detrimental reef construction projects being carried out. As with marine resource management in general, technology, expertise and an associated understanding of what works well and what doesn't in developing useful reef habitat, have progressed significantly since that time. Based on the maturing process that the field of manmade habitat development has experienced over the past three decades, the potential uses of these resource management tools should be fully explored. The challenge facing manmade reef development programs today is how best to utilize this technology to most effectively assist in achieving state, regional and national marine resources management goals.\n3.2.2.4.1 Fisheries Enhancement The proper placement of manmade materials in the marine environment can provide for\nthe development of a healthy reef ecosystem, including intensive invertebrate communities and fish assemblages of interest to both recreational and commercial fishermen. The degree of effectiveness of a manmade reef in the enhancement of these harvesting activities varies, dictated by geographical location, species targeted, stock health, and design and construction of the reef. An examination of both the historical and present use of manmade reefs along each of the South Atlantic States reveals a common link to fisheries enhancement as the primary reason for, and benefit from, the establishment of these sites. Manmade reefs have developed an impressive track-record of providing positive results, as measured by harvesting success for a wide range of finfish species. To date, manmade reefs have been chiefly employed to create specific, reliable\n118\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nand more accessible opportunities for primarily recreational anglers. While they have been used to a lesser extent to enhance commercial fishing efforts, this may be due in part to the much smaller size of manmade reefs compared to larger, traditionally relied-upon, naturally occurring \"commercial fishing grounds\".\nIn their present scale and typical design, most manmade reefs, while well-suited for use by recreational anglers, would be unable to withstand intensive commercial fishing pressure, especially for many of the popularly sought-after demersal finfish species, for more than a short period of time. Difficulties experienced in using current commercial gear types and methodologies on and around manmade reef structures may also prove less cost effective than desired. Profit-driven operations would also be less likely to invest in creating a resource which would be open to public use. This, combined with the fact that most manmade reef programs at present receive the majority of their habitat development funding through sources tied directly to recreational fishing interests, make it doubtful that exclusively commercial, or even commercialscale manmade reefs are likely to be developed in the near future in this country.\n3.2.2.4.1.1 Special Management Zones Conceptualized by the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council, within the\nSnapper/Grouper Management Plan, several \"Special Management Zones\" or \"SMZs\" have been established in the South Atlantic off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida to provide gear and harvest regulations for defined locations. The basic premise of this concept is to reduce user conflicts through gear and harvest regulations at locations that feature limited resources that are managed for specific user groups. Generally, manmade reefs have been developed for recreational use utilizing recreational resources. The ability to regulate gear types utilized over the relatively limited area of a manmade reef enables fisheries managers to prevent rapid overfishing of these sites and promote a more even allocation of reef resources and opportunities.\nPresent SMZ regulations apply to about 30 manmade reef sites off South Atlantic States, with several more proposed. Since regulations concerning the management of SMZs are tied to specific gear restrictions, it is possible that the use of SMZs in the future could be expanded to a point where any possible type of fishing gear could be restricted for a set period of time or indefinitely. This could provide fishery managers with the ability to turn individual manmade reef sites \"on or off\" as the specific needs of the fishery in question dictate. The ability to have some degree of control over fishing activities on these sites would give manmade reefs more power as a true fishery management tool.\n3.2.2.4.1.2 Stock Enhancement Potential Manmade reefs are known to promote extensive invertebrate communities and enhance\nhabitat for reef fish and other fish species, including cryptic, tropical, and gamefish species, as well as many of commercial or recreational significance. The success of a reef and its contributions to stock enhancement varies geographically, and is determined by a wide range of complex parameters, including existing habitat, physical limitations, material design, reef configuration, reef management, and the health of the targeted species complex, which in turn is reliant on effective fisheries management locally, regionally, and nationally. As evidenced by multi-billion dollar reef development efforts in Japan, an even greater potential for stock enhancement in U.S. waters exists. This potential is further enhanced since domestic reef programs today possess better information and improved technology and are more focused in using this tool towards specific stock enhancement and fishery management needs.\n119\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFor species which may be to some degree habitat-limited, the establishment of additional suitable habitat targeted to specific life-history stages may improve survival. Additional manmade habitat designed specifically to promote survival of targeted species in \"protected\" areas could potentially enhance existing ecosystems or create new ones to fill in gaps where essential fish habitat had been damaged, lost, or severely over-fished. Man-made structures also may provide essential habitat while simultaneously acting as a deterrent to illegal fishing practices in specially managed areas (e.g. Florida Oculina Banks).\n3.2.2.4.2 Hard Bottom Habitat Enhancement Habitat enhancement through the construction of manmade reefs can be achieved by\nconverting some other type bottom habitat into a hard bottom community. Mud, sand, shell or other relatively soft bottom habitat can be altered by the addition of hard structure with low to high profile to add to the total amount of hard bottom reef environment in a given area. While it would be difficult and particularly costly to construct man made reefs with an equivalent area of most typical hard bottom found off the Southeastern U.S., substantial areas of ocean bottom can be effectively converted to hard bottom over time given sufficient planning, proper design and adequate resources.\nIn areas where existing hard bottom habitat is limited spatially, temporally, or structurally, manmade structures may be used to augment what is already in place. Hard bottom with or without a thin veneer of sediment constitutes a preferred substrate for this type of manmade reef development, as opposed to sand and mud bottoms; however, deployment of structures in already productive areas carries a certain degree of risk. Existing hard bottom may be directly damaged or impacted by modified current regimes, movement of materials and potentially increased user pressure. Although sparse, the hard bottom may constitute valuable juvenile habitat and refugia that may be severely compromised by creating additional habitat conducive to predators. On the other hand, a properly planned manmade reef could be constructed without impact to existing resources by utilizing stable materials that are designed to enhance juvenile habitat and survival.\nIn cases where critical hard bottom habitat is damaged or lost due to natural forces such as severe storms or burial, the addition of manmade reef material could be used to compensate for this loss on site or in adjacent areas. Manmade reef structures can also be used to repair damaged habitat or mitigate for its loss in cases where stable, hard substrate placed on the bottom would provide the closest in-kind replacement as possible, or at least provide the longterm base for the eventual re-establishment of the hard bottom reef community that was originally impacted.\n3.2.2.4.3 Manmade Marine Reserves / Sanctuaries Marine reserves and sanctuaries are a proven management technique that has been\nimplemented successfully worldwide to protect essential fisheries habitat and sustain fisheries stocks and genetic variability. Although the concept of marine reserves / sanctuaries has gained some support in the southeastern United States, the actual application of this management measure has generated resistance among user groups who feel that the establishment of such reserves will adversely impact fishing opportunities by limiting access to existing habitat. For areas with little fisheries habitat, these impacts are viewed as significant.\nThe potential role that manmade reefs could play in implementing marine reserves and similar management measures remains largely unexplored at present. It is conceivable that effective marine reserves / sanctuaries consisting of manmade structures could be developed in\n120\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nhabitat-limited areas to assist specifically in such roles as habitat and stock enhancement. Detailed research needed to measure their effectiveness in these roles is needed. Substantial resources and funds would also be required to develop the large reserve areas proposed, although smaller sanctuaries are entirely feasible. Manmade structures could be utilized to enhance existing marine reserve areas by improving existing habitat or providing additional hard bottom substrate. Manmade reef reserves / sanctuaries could also be used as test platforms to demonstrate to the public the potential effectiveness of such areas, without impacting existing fisheries practices on sites in a given area.\nAt this time, perhaps the most important contribution that manmade reef technology can provide for fisheries management efforts employing marine reserves / sanctuaries would be to create additional habitat and fisheries to \"compensate\" user groups for perceived \"losses\". Coupled with positive effects of adjacent marine reserves, properly sited, more accessible artificial reefs would increase benefits to user groups.\n3.2.2.4.4 Enhancement of Eco-Tourism Activities Along with other eco-tourism activities, recreational diving is one of the fastest growing\nsports in the United States. Properly planned, manmade reefs can be designed to encourage diving and to reduce spatial conflicts with other user groups, including fishermen. Specific SMZ or other regulations established for a manmade reef could conceivably allow non-consumptive uses only, including diving, underwater photography, snorkeling, and other eco-tourism activities. Recently, designed units were deployed off a Mexican resort to enhance existing reef areas that were viewed via submarine excursions. Materials selected could be designed and deployed to create specific fisheries habitat for tropical, cryptic, and other species targeted by non-consumptive users.\nThe establishment of additional hard bottom reef communities in areas with thriving dive-related industries could be used to reduce diving-related pressures on existing natural reefs, especially in the case of sensitive coral reefs in the Florida Keys. Finally, a non-consumptive reef would essentially constitute a sanctuary, providing fisheries and the associated habitat with de facto protection.\nAs with natural reefs, much remains unknown regarding the ecology and functions of manmade reef communities. On the other hand, the use of manmade reefs in management of user groups in fisheries is better known, although this potential has not been fully explored. To date, manmade reefs have been employed to create specific, more accessible opportunities for fishermen and divers, as well as to disperse and redirect pressure from overfished natural habitat.\n3.2.2.5 Current Manmade Reef Management Practices Manmade reefs can be an effective tool used in the management of marine fishery\nresources if properly developed, maintained and managed. With specific, realistic and measurable objectives in mind, the creation of essential hard bottom habitat can be achieved to benefit a variety of end uses for fisheries managers at federal, regional and state levels. Specific management strategies will depend on the objective(s) of the reef and compliance with existing management or regulating mechanisms, such as regulations mandated as part of the permitting process or the need to conform with existing State, Interstate Marine Fisheries Commission (IMFC), or Regional Fishery Management Council (FMC) fishery management plans (FMPs).\n121\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe roles of all parties involved in manmade reef management are found in the National Artificial Reef Management Plan. Since these roles have evolved somewhat since 1985, the current revision of this plan being considered by the NMFS contains the most detailed and up-todate description of the state of reef management in the U.S. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has formalized their specific involvement in manmade reef management through regulations promulgated pursuant to the National Fisheries Enhancement Act of 1984 (33CFR, Parts 320330). Involvement on a state level varies, with all coastal states in the South Atlantic Region having some degree of control or oversight of artificial reef development in their waters and adjacent Federal waters. All four of these states participate in regional communication and coordination concerning essential manmade reef management activities through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The general consensus of state reef program managers is that manmade reefs are fisheries management tools, and as such, their use constitutes a fisheries issue which must be addressed accordingly.\n3.2.2.5.1 Federal Role The primary Federal role in manmade reef management has been to provide technical\nassistance, guidance, and regulations for the proper use of artificial reefs by local governments and the private sector in a manner compatible with other long-term needs, and to improve coordination and communication on manmade reef issues between the Federal agencies, States, Regional Fishery Management Councils, Interstate Marine Fisheries Commissions, commercial and recreational fishing industries and interests, diving communities and other interested parties. Generally, the Federal role is carried out by the permit process, and by providing guidelines, services, information, financial aid, and in-kind support, as well as some regulatory functions regarding fishing practices on specially designated artificial reefs (e.g., \"Special Management Zone\" designation in the South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils' Snapper/Grouper Fishery Management Plan). See Appendix Q for the locations of designated SMZs.\nThe Federal Government has been involved in manmade reef activities for several decades, both in research and development sponsored by individual agencies as programs and budgets permitted, and in reviewing and commenting on reef permit applications. There is, however, no overall Federally coordinated program to guide artificial reef activities except through permit review, implementation of regulations, and recommendations in the Plan of 1985. The President's Proclamation of an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) on March 10, 1983 declared a National (Federal) interest in living and non-living resources found within 200 nautical miles from shore. In addition, the National Recreational Fisheries Conservation Plan of 1996 developed pursuant to Executive Order 12962 - Recreational Fisheries, directs specific Federal activities to utilize artificial reefs in implementation of a national recreational fisheries resources conservation plan. The Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Act) (P.L. 103-206) of 1993, finds that: \"...increasing pressure, environmental pollution, and the loss and alteration of habitat have reduced severely, certain Atlantic coastal fishery resources...and...it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to support...cooperative interstate management of coastal fisheries. Increased use of fisheries resources are expected in the EEZ, and there undoubtedly will be more interest in the use of manmade reefs to enhance these resources and the habitats essential to their proliferation.\nFive Federal entities -- the US Departments of the Interior (DOI), Commerce (DOC), Defense (DOD), and Transportation (DOT), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -have varying degrees of interest in, and responsibility for, manmade reefs. Detailed discussions\n122\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nof the roles they each play in manmade reef management are found in the National Artificial Reef Management Plan.\n3.2.2.5.2 State Role State resource managers in the South Atlantic Region recognize that manmade reef\ndevelopment involves long-term, if not permanent, alteration of bottom habitat. As such, possible effects on natural resources and the environment must be carefully considered in assessing whether or not to use this management tool in working to achieve specific fishery management-related objectives. Since implementation of the National Artificial Reef Plan of 1985, state resource management agencies in the Southeast Atlantic Region have been active in a variety of roles pertaining to the use of manmade reefs. These include acquiring permits, maintaining liability, financing, constructing, and monitoring marine manmade reefs through state supported programs. Other involvement has ranged from completion of reef construction projects as part of an agency's efforts to improve a specific fishery, to an agency's review and support for other organizations' reef building programs.\nState artificial reef programs have adopted state-specific plans based on guidance of the National Artificial Reef Plan of 1985, and tailored to their local regulations, requirements, policies, procedures, and objectives. In effect, the states have been responsible for implementing the National Plan and collecting information necessary for updating guidance in the plan, and for strengthening provisions of the National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984. There is general consensus among state fishery resource management agencies that manmade reef projects must be considered with fishery management issues in mind.\nSpecies and fisheries associated with manmade reefs typically have been predominant in federal waters. As more of these species become subject to Interstate Marine Fisheries Commission FMP regulations, it is important that state reef programs become more closely linked organizationally with state fishery management programs. In order to achieve the greatest benefits from manmade reefs, it is imperative that appropriate State agencies continue to play a major role in the development of national and site-specific guidelines for their use. The states have utilized the tools given them in a responsible and innovative manner to validate methodologies in reef research on such topics as construction and siting, fishery management, regulatory requirements, and reef biology (including production and aggregation issues). Such validation is essential for effective use of marine artificial reefs in fishery management planning, restoration or development of essential fish habitat, and to demonstrate innovative alternatives for which manmade reef structures can be useful.\n3.2.2.5.3 Regional Activities The Artificial Reef Technical Committee (ATC) of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries\nCommission (ASMFC), of which all four South Atlantic states are active members, meets periodically to exchange information and to coordinate activities relevant to common areas of interest. The role of the ATC is to provide an open forum for discussion and debate on issues facing state artificial reef program managers, respective federal agencies, and affected fisheries interests. The committee is composed of the coordinators of the state marine artificial reef programs within the state agencies responsible for marine and coastal resources management. Committee membership also includes representatives from the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Regional Fisheries Management Councils. The committee provides critical advice to the ASMFC\n123\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nrelative to development of marine manmade reefs, and has served to increase responsiveness and efficiency of coastal reef programs.\nJoint committee meetings with the sister-ATC from the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission have also served to consolidate individual state efforts along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, thus assisting in implementation of key elements of the National Fishing Enhancement Act. Both committees have worked cooperatively to identify and resolve national issues such as standardized criteria for materials used to build artificial reefs. The joint committee forum also has assisted member states in development and implementation of individual state plans and policies responsive to local, regional, and national needs. Coordination of state efforts through the interstate marine fisheries commissions has facilitated a dynamic and positive evolution of national artificial reef efforts. The cooperative efforts of state reef developers have progressed beyond a focus on solely creating access to fisheries utilizing materials of opportunity.\nGenerally, in marine waters beyond the territorial limit, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) determines management strategies for resources or users through specific fishery management plans. Coastal fishery resources which migrate between state, and often federal, jurisdictions may also be regulated through interstate FMPs developed and implemented by the respective Interstate Marine Fisheries Commissions (e.g. as under the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act). Therefore, FMCs and IMFCs should be have an active interest in the development of manmade reefs. These entities also have requirements in their FMPs to designate certain habitat as essential to the management of the species covered under a specific FMP. These entities are a major source of information about the fisheries resources and can help identify areas of potential conflicts or areas of concern in Federal waters, and can identify issues of compatibility of a proposed reef project with management objectives for the effected fisheries. Manmade reefs designated as SMZs offer reef mangers much more flexibility to effectively utilize reefs as fishery management tools by providing a degree of regulatory control which otherwise would not exist. Reefs can be planned, designed and developed with specific management objectives in mind (e.g. stock enhancement of a group of fish species in a particular environment) and be supported by the regulatory language for an SMZ. SMZs or similar regulatory measures allow manmade reefs to be used as nontraditional fishery management tools.\n3.2.2.6 Use of Manmade Reefs by Managed Species Earlier sections have discussed the ways in which manmade reefs are specifically used by\nboth invertebrate and finfish species (3.2.2.1.2, 3.2.2.4.1.2, 3.2.2.4.2). Since manmade reefs are established by marine resource managers throughout the entire South Atlantic Bight, the diversity of species present on and around such structures is extremely wide. Manmade reefs are used in almost every possible marine environment, from shallow-water estuarine creeks to offshore sites up to several hundred feet in depth. Due to the broad distribution of reef sites along the South Atlantic Coastal States, many different species may interact with manmade reefs at different live-stages and at different times.\nSince the majority of the manmade reefs constructed along the Southeastern U.S. are in coastal and offshore waters, the species most often present on these sites are predominantly the adult and/or sub-adult stages of virtually all species within the South Atlantic Snapper-Grouper Complex, as well as all species managed within the Coastal Migratory Pelagics. Depending on environmental conditions on a specific reef site, and the behavior patterns of certain fish, species within the Snapper-Grouper group tend to be long to short-term reef residents, while those among the Coastal Pelagics tend to be more transient visitors to the reefs as they migrate up and\n124\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\ndown the coast. Red drum and spiny lobster, as well as some of the managed shrimp species, may be found on and around specific reef sites at different times of the year, depending on the exact location and design of the reef. While some species of managed corals may occur on reef structures as far north as the Carolina's, the waters off South Florida are the predominant site where such species are found attached to manmade substrate.\n3.2.3 Pelagic Habitat 3.2.3.1 Sargassum Habitat 3.2.3.1.1 Description of Sargassum Habitat\nWithin warm waters of the western North Atlantic, pelagic brown algae Sargassum natans and S. fluitans (Phaeophyta: Phaeophyceae: Fucales: Sargassaceae) form a dynamic structural habitat. These holopelagic species are believed to have evolved from benthic ancestors at least 40 million years ago. Evidence supporting this contention include: 1) lack of sexual reproduction characteristic of benthic species, 2) absence of a basal holdfast, 3) endemic faunal elements (10 invertebrates and 2 vertebrates), 4) greater buoyancy than benthic forms, and 5) late Eocene to early Miocene fossil remains from the Carpathian basin of the Tethys Sea (Winge, 1923; Parr, 1939; Friedrich, 1969; Butler et al., 1983; Stoner and Greening, 1984, Luning, 1990). Sargassum natans is much more abundant than S. fluitans, comprising up to 90% of the total drift macroalgae in the Sargasso Sea. Limited quantities of several benthic species, including S. filipendula, S. hystrix, S. polycertium, S. platycarpum and S. pteropleuron, detached from coastal areas during storms, are also frequently encountered adrift. However, the drifting fragments of these benthic species soon perish (Hoyt, 1918; Winge, 1923; Parr, 1939; Butler et al., 1983).\nThe pelagic species are golden to brownish in color and typically 20 to 80 cm in diameter. Both species are sterile and propagation is by vegetative fragmentation. The plants\n125\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nexhibit complex branching of the thallus, a lush foliage of lancolate to linear serrate phylloids and numerous berry-like pneumatocysts. Perhaps the most conspicuous features are the pneumatocysts. These small vesicles function as floats and keep the plants positively buoyant. Gas within these bladders is predominately oxygen with limited amounts of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The volume of oxygen within the pneumatocysts fluctuates diurnally in response, not to diurnal cycles of photosynthesis, but to changes in the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding medium (Woodcock, 1950; Hurka, 1971). There are generally a large number of pneumatocysts on a healthy plant: up to 80 % of the bladders can be removed and the plants will remain positively buoyant (Zaitsev, 1971). Under calm sea states the algae are at the surface with less than 0.3% of their total mass exposed above the air - water interface. Experiments indicate that an exposure to dry air of 7-10 min. will kill phylloids, whereas, pneumatocysts and thallomes can tolerate exposures of 20-30 min. and 40 min., respectively. Wetting of exposed parts with seawater at 1 min. intervals, however, is enough to prevent tissue damage (Zaitsev, 1971). In nature, such stress is likely encountered only during the calmest seas or when the algae is cast ashore. Illustrations and descriptions of S. natans and S. fluitans are given in Hoyt (1918), Winge (1923), Parr (1939), Taylor (1960), Prescott (1968), Humm (1979), Littler et al. (1989) and Schneider and Searles (1991).\nMost pelagic Sargassum circulates between 20\u00b0N and 40\u00b0N latitudes and 30\u00b0W longitude and the western edge of the Florida Current/Gulf Stream (Figure 10a). The greatest concentrations are found within the North Atlantic Central Gyre in the Sargasso Sea (Winge, 1923; Parr, 1939; Ryther, 1956; Dooley, 1972; Butler et al., 1983; Butler and Stoner, 1984; Nierman et al., 1986). Total biomass is unknown, but, estimates obtained from net tows range from 800 - 2000 kg wet weight km-2. Within the Sargasso Sea, this translates into a standing crop of 4 to 11 million metric tons (Parr, 1939; Zaitzev, 1971; Peres, 1982; Butler et al., 1983; Butler and Stoner, 1984; Nierman et al., 1986; Luning, 1990). Stoner (1983) suggested that there had been a significant decline in biomass this century, but later recanted (Butler and Stoner, 1984). Nierman et al. (1986) also calculated that no apparent decline had occurred.\nPelagic Sargassum contributes a small fraction to total primary production in the North Atlantic, however, within the oligotrophic waters of the Sargasso Sea, it may constitute as much as 60 % of total production in the upper meter of the water column (Howard and Menzies, 1969; Carpenter and Cox, 1974; Hanson, 1977; Peres, 1982). Estimates of production are typically around 1 mgC m-2 d-1 with slightly higher values reported from more nutrient rich shelf waters. Production has been shown to double under conditions of nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment (Lapointe, 1986; 1995). Hanisak and Samuel (1984) found Sargassum to have low nitrogen and phosphorus requirements, and optimal growth at water temperatures of 24 - 30\u00b0 C and salinity of 36 ppt. Nitrogen fixation by epiphytic cyanobacteria of the genera Dichothrix, Trichodesmium, and Synechococcus may enhance production (Carpenter 1972; Carpenter and Cox, 1974; Phlips and Zeman, 1990; Spiller and Shanmugam, 1987). Photosynthesis in both Sargassum and the blue-green epiphytes is not inhibited at high light intensities (Hanisak ans Samuel, 1984; Phlips et al., 1986): not surprising in view of the neustonic niche they occupy.\nLarge quantities of Sargassum frequently occur on the continental shelf off the southeastern United States. Depending on prevailing surface currents, this material may remain on the shelf for extended periods, be entrained into the Gulf Stream, or be cast ashore (Hoyt, 1918; Humm, 1951; Howard and Menzies, 1969; Carr and Meylen, 1980; Winston, 1982; Haney, 1986; Baugh, 1991). During calm conditions Sargassum may form large irregular mats or simply be scattered in small clumps. Langmuir circulations, internal waves, and convergence zones along fronts aggregate the algae along with other flotsam into long linear or meandering\n126\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nrows collectively termed \"windrows\" (Winge, 1923; Langmuir, 1938; Ewing, 1950, Faller and Woodcock, 1964; Stommel, 1965; Barstow, 1983; Shanks, 1988; Kingsford, 1990). The algae sinks in these convergence zones when downwelling velocities exceed 4.5 cm sec-1. Buoyancy is not lost unless the algae sink below about 100 m or are held under at lesser depths for extended periods (Woodcock, 1950). A time-at-depth relationship exists which affects the critical depth at which bladder failure ensues (Johnson and Richardson, 1977). If buoyancy is lost, plants slowly sink to the sea floor. Schoener and Rowe (1970) indicate that sinking algae can reach 5000 m in about 2 days. Such sinking events contribute to the flux of carbon and other nutrients from the surface to the benthos (Schoener and Rowe, 1970; Pestana, 1985; Fabry and Deuser, 1991). However, the flux of Sargassum to the sea floor has not been quantified and there is no information on the fate of this surface export.\nSolid line refers to the outer boundary of regular occurrence; dashed line refers to the area in which there is a> 5% probability of encounter within 1\u00b0 square; hatched circle represents possible center of distribution\nFigure 10a. Distribution of pelagic Sargassum in the Northwest Atlantic. (Source: From Dooley 1972). 3.2.3.1.2 Utilization of Sargassum Habitat\nPelagic Sargassum supports a diverse assemblage of marine organisms including fungi (Winge, 1923; Kohlmeyer, 1971), micro-and macro-epiphytes (Carpenter, 1970; Carpenter and Cox, 1974; Mogelberg et al., 1983), at least 145 species of invertebrates (Winge, 1923; Parr, 1939; Adams, 1960; Yeatman, 1962; Weis, 1968; Friedrich, 1969; Fine, 1970; Dooley, 1972; Morris and Mogelberg, 1973; Ryland, 1974; Teal and Teal, 1975; Peres, 1982; Butler et al., 1983; Deason, 1983; Andres and John, 1984; Stoner and Greening, 1984; Morgan et al., 1985;\n127\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nNierman, 1986; see Table 1 in Coston-Clements et al., 1991), over 100 species of fishes (Table 1), four species of sea turtles (Smith, 1968; Fletemeyer, 1978; Carr and Meylan, 1980; Redfoot et al., 1985; Ross, 1985; Carr, 1986; 1987a; 1987b; Schwartz, 1988; 1989; Witham, 1988; Manzella and Williams, 1991; Richardson and McGillivary, 1991), and numerous marine birds (Haney, 1986). Many of the organisms most closely associated with Sargassum have evolved adaptive coloration or mimic the algae in appearance (Crawford and Powers, 1953; Adams, 1960; Teal and Teal, 1975; Gorelova and Fedoryako, 1986; Hacker and Madin, 1991).\nThe fishes associated with pelagic Sargassum in the western North Atlantic have been studied by a number of investigators (Adams, 1960; Parin, 1970; Zaitzev, 1971; Dooley, 1972; Bortone et al., 1977; Fedoryako, 1980, 1989; Gorelova and Fedoryako, 1986; Settle, 1993; Moser et al., in press). Similar research has also addressed the ichthyofauna of drift algae in the Pacific (Uchida and Shojima, 1958; Besednov, 1960; Hirosaki, 1960b; Shojima and Ueki, 1964; Anraku and Azeta, 1965; Kingsford and Choat, 1985; Kingsford and Milicich, 1987; Nakata et al., 1988). In all cases, juvenile fishes were numerically dominant. Sampling designs and gear avoidance have no doubt contributed to the poorly described adult fish fauna. However, studies by Gibbs and Collette (1959), Beardsley (1967), Parin (1970), Manooch and Hogarth (1983), Manooch and Mason (1983), Manooch et al. (1984; 1985), and Fedoryako (1989) clearly indicate that large pelagic adult fishes utilize Sargassum resources. This becomes even more evident when one observes the efforts of fishermen targeting \"weedlines\".\nMany of the fishes found in association with Sargassum are not restricted to that habitat and are known to frequent various types of drift material and fish aggregating devices (Besednov, 1960; Mansueti, 1963; Hunter and Mitchell, 1967; Kojima, 1966; Kulczycki et al., 1981; Lenanton et al., 1982; Robertson, 1982; Nakata et al., 1988; Fedoryako, 1989; Rountree, 1989; 1990). Protection, feeding opportunity, cleaning, shade, structural affinity, visual reference, tactile stimulation, historical accident, passive drift and use as a spawning substrate have all been postulated as reasons for such associations (Hirosaki, 1960a; Hunter and Mitchell, 1968; Senta, 1966a; 1966b; 1966c; Dooley, 1972; Helfman, 1981).\nThe surface residence time, season and geographic location of Sargassum affect the species composition and abundance of fishes associated with it. Most of the young fishes that associate with the algae are surface forms (Fahay, 1975; Powles and Stender, 1976) and it is not known if they remain near the alga when it is submerged. Recruitment of fishes to drift algae and flotsam is initially rapid and continues to increase over time (Senta, 1966a; Hunter and Mitchell; 1968; Kingsford and Choat, 1985; Kingsford, 1992). The abundance of larval and juvenile fishes varies seasonally and regionally, both in terms of numbers of fish and fish biomass (Dooley, 1972; Settle, 1993). The invertebrate fauna is similarly variable (Weis, 1968; Fine, 1970; Stoner and Greening, 1984). Regional trends in the mean abundance and biomass of young fish show decrease in abundance across the continental shelf and into the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea, and a decrease from spring through winter (Settle, 1993). Species richness is generally highest on the outer shelf during spring and summer and further offshore during the fall and winter. Overall, diversity is greatest in offshore waters (Bortone et al., 1977; Fedoryako, 1980; 1989; Settle, 1993).\nThe types of Sargassum habitats (e.g., individual clumps, small patches, large rafts, weedlines) and the \"age\" (i.e., growth stage and degree of epibiont colonization) also affects the distribution and abundance of associated fishes. Ida et al.(1967b), Fedoryako (1980), Gorelova and Fedoryako (1986) and Moser et al. (in press) described the spatial distribution of fishes in and around clumps and rafts of Sargassum. Juvenile Diodon, Coryphaena, Lobotes and the exocoetids occupy the outer periphery, whereas Canthidermis, Balistes, Kyphosus, Abudefduf,\n128\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nCaranx and Seriola are distributed below the algae. Other species such as Histrio and Syngnathus are typically hidden within the foliage. Larger juveniles and adults occupy nearby waters out to several 10's of meters from the patches. With regard to algal age, Conover and Sieburth (1964) and Sieburth and Conover (1965) suggest that the community could be significantly controlled by the effects of exogenous metabolites on algal epibionts. These substances, which are released during periods of new algal growth, inhibits epibiotic colonization, and could alter the trophic resources available to associated macrofauna, including fish (Gorelova and Fedoryako, 1986). Stoner and Greening (1984) concluded that algal age did affect the macrofaunal composition, but the abundance of carnivores remained stable. However, since their study dealt primarily with the invertebrate fauna, the effects of these substances on other trophic links remains unknown, although similar compounds are known to deter some herbivores (Paul, 1987; Hay and Fenical, 1988; Hay et al., 1988; Steinberg, 1988).\nFish abundance has been found to be positively correlated with Sargassum biomass. Correlations were significant over the middle shelf throughout the year. Fish biomass was also positively correlated over the outer shelf during the fall (Settle, 1993). No correlation was observed in the Gulf Stream or Sargasso Sea (Dooley, 1972; Fedoryako, 1980; Settle, 1993). The abundance of motile macrofauna (mostly invertebrates) has also been shown to be related to Sargassum biomass (Stoner and Greening, 1984).\nThere have been well over 100 species of fishes collected or observed associated with the Sargassum habitat (Table 17). The carangids and balistids are the most conspicuous, being represented by 21 and 15 species respectively. The planehead filefish, Monacanthus hispidus, is clearly the most abundant species in shelf waters off the southeastern U.S. and in the Gulf of Mexico (Dooley, 1972; Bortone et al., 1977; Settle, 1993; Moser et al., in press).\nA number of species have direct fisheries value although not all of them are common. However, the seasonal abundances of Caranx spp., Elagatis bipinnulata, Seriola spp., Coryphaena hippurus, Pagrus pagrus, Mugil spp., Peprilus triacanthus, and Balistes capriscus illustrates the importance of the habitat to the early-life-stages of these species.\nThe relationships between of a number of fishes and the Sargassum habitat remains problematic. The muraenids, gonostomatids, myctophids, apogonids, serranids, gerreids, scarids, lutjanids, chaetodontids, acanthurids, istiophorids, scorpaenids, bothids and several other taxa have been collected in limited numbers. It is likely that many of these fishes are found in convergence zones even in the absence of Sargassum.\n3.2.3.1.3 Measuring Sargassum Distribution and Abundance Our current understanding of the seasonal distribution and areal abundance (i.e. biomass\nper unit area) of pelagic Sargassum within the EEZ is poor. Gross estimates of the standing stock for the North Atlantic obtained from towed net samples are highly variable and range between 4 and 11 million metric tons. There is a clear need to improve our understanding of the distribution and abundance of this important habitat. Remote technology could aid to that end. Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers potential for assessing the distribution of large aggregations over broad swaths of the ocean surface. Coincident ship-based groundtruthing would permit an evaluation of the applicability of routine remote measurements of Sargassum distribution and abundance.\n129\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 17.

Therefore, there are numerous potentially distinct water column habitats for a broad array of species and life-stages within species.\nThe continental shelf off the southeastern U.S., extending from the Dry Tortugas to Cape Hatteras, encompasses an area in excess of 100,000 km2 (Menzel, 1993). Based on physical oceanography and geomorphology, this environment can divided into two regions: Dry Tortugas to Cape Canaveral and Cape Canaveral to Cape Hatteras. The break between these two regions is not precise and ranges from West Palm Beach to the Florida-Georgia border depending on the specific data considered. The shelf from the Dry Tortugas to Miami is ~25 km wide and narrows to approximately 5 km off Palm Beach. The shelf then broadens to approximately 120 km off of Georgia and South Carolina before narrowing to 30 km off Cape Hatteras. The Florida Current/Gulf Stream flows along the shelf edge throughout the region. In the southern region, this boundary current dominants the physics of the entire shelf (Lee et al., 1992; 1994). In the northern region, additional physical processes are important and the shelf environment can be subdivided into three oceanographic zones (Atkinson et al., 1985; Menzel, 1993). The outer shelf (40-75 m) is influenced primarily by the Gulf Stream and secondarily by winds and tides. On the mid-shelf (20-40 m), the water column is almost equally affected by the Gulf Stream, winds and tides. Inner shelf waters (0-20 m) are influenced by freshwater runoff, winds, tides and bottom friction.\nSeveral water masses are present in the region. From the Dry Tortugas to Cape Canaveral, the three water types are: Florida Current Water (FCW), waters originating in Florida Bay, and shelf water. Shelf waters off the Florida Keys are an admixture of FCW and waters from Florida Bay. From Cape Canaveral to Cape Hatteras, four water masses are found: Gulf Stream Water (GSW), Carolina Capes Water (CCW), Georgia Water (GW) and Virginia Coastal Water (VCW). Virginia Coastal Water enters the region from north of Cape Hatteras. Carolina Capes Water and GW are admixtures of freshwater runoff and GSW (Pietrafesa et al., 1985;1994).\nSpatial and temporal variation in the position of the western boundary current has dramatic affects on water column habitats. Variation in the path of the Florida Current near the Dry Tortugas, induces formation of the Tortugas Gyre (Lee et al., 1992; 1994). This cyclonic eddy has horizontal dimensions on the order of 100 km and may persist in the vicinity of the Florida Keys for several months. The Pourtales Gyre, which has been found to the east, is formed when the Tortugas Gyres moves eastward along the shelf. Upwelling occurs in the center of these gyres, thereby adding nutrients to the near surface (<100 m) water column. Wind and input of Florida Bay water also influence the water column structure on the shelf off the Florida Keys (Smith, 1994; Wang et al., 1994). Similarly, further downstream, the Gulf Stream encounters the Charleston Bump, a topographic rise on the upper Blake Ridge. Here the current is often deflected offshore, again resulting in the formation a cold, quasi-permanent cyclonic gyre and associated upwelling (Brooks and Bane, 1978). Along the entire length of the Florida Current and Gulf Stream, cold cyclonic eddies are imbedded in meanders along the western front. Three areas of eddy amplification are known: Downstream of Dry Tortugas, downstream of Jupiter Inlet (27\u00b0N to 30\u00b0N latitude), downstream of the Charleston Bump (32\u00b0N to 34\u00b0N latitude). Meanders propagate northward (i.e. downstream) as waves. The crests and troughs\n134\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nrepresent the onshore and offshore positions of the Gulf Stream front. Cross-shelf amplitudes of these waves are on the order 10 to 100 km. Upwelling within meander troughs is the dominant source of `new' nutrients to the southeastern U.S. shelf and supports primary, secondary and ultimately fisheries production (Yoder, 1985; Menzel 1993). Off Cape Hatteras the Gulf Stream turns offshore to the northeast. Here, the confluence of the Gulf Stream, the Western Boundary Under Current (WBUC), Mid-Atlantic Shelf Water (MASW), Slope Sea Water (SSW) , CCW and VCW create a dynamic and highly productive environment, known as the \"Hatteras Corner\" or \"The Point\".\nOn the continental shelf, offshore projecting shoals at Cape Fear, Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras affect longshore coastal currents and interact with Gulf Stream intrusions to produce local upwelling (Blanton et al., 1981; Janowitz and Pietrafesa, 1982). Shoreward of the Gulf Stream, seasonal horizontal temperature and salinity gradients define the mid-shelf and innershelf fronts. In coastal waters, river discharge and estuarine tidal plumes contribute to the water column structure. 3.2.3.2.2 Use of Water Column Habitats\nCoastal waters off the southeastern U.S. are split into two zoogeographic provinces based on shore fishes and continental shelf invertebrate species. The Caribbean Province includes the Florida Keys and extends northward to approximately the Florida-Georgia border, but its northern boundary is not sharp. The Carolinian Province extends from this border, northwards to Cape Hatteras (Briggs 1974). A similar faunal break is evident in mesopelagic fish fauna. The boundary between the North Sargasso Sea Province and the South Sargasso Sea Province occurs approximately parallel with Jupiter Inlet, Florida (Backus et al. 1977).\n135\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nThe water column from Dry Tortugas to Cape Hatteras serves as habitat for many marine fish and shellfish. Most marine fish and shellfish broadcast spawn pelagic eggs and thus, most species utilize the water column during some portion of their early life history (e.g. egg, larvae, juvenile stages). Larvae of shrimp, lobsters, crabs, and larvae of reef, demersal and pelagic fishes are found in the water column (e.g. Fahay, 1975; Powels and Stender, 1976; Leis, 1991; Yeung and McGowan 1991, Criales and McGowan 1994). Problems with species-level identifications prohibits an exact accounting of the number of fishes whose larvae inhabit the water column, but the number of families represented in ichthyoplankton collections ranges from 40 to 91 depending on location, season and sampling method (Table 18a).\n\nTable 18a. Summary of the number of larval fish families identified from studies conducted off the southeastern coast of the United States. .\n\nLocation\nFlorida Keys Cape Canaveral to Cape Lookout Cape Canaveral to Cape Lookout Cape Canaveral to Cape Lookout Cape Fear to Cape Lookout Cape Fear to Cape Lookout Palm Beach to Cape Lookout\n\nSeason\nSp W Sp F W W Sp-W\n\nNo. Families 91 48/601 49/561 40/551\n74\n66\n51\n\nStudy\nLimouzy-Paris et al.

Pelagic fishes in the region include numerous clupeoids, exocoetids, carangids, Rachycentron, Pomatomus, coryphaenids, sphyraenids and the scombroids (Schwartz, 1989). Some pelagic species are associated with particular benthic habitats (e.g. Seriola, Sphyraena), while other species are truly pelagic (e.g. Thunnus, Makaira). Adult meso- and bathypelagic species inhabit the water column in the Gulf Stream (Figure 10b) and adjacent Sargasso Sea (Backus et al. 1977).\n\n136\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 10b. Gulf Stream front location (Source: MMS 1990). 137\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSpecies- and life-stage-specific patterns of water column habitat utilization are not well known for most fishes. Some utilize near-shore fronts as feeding or nursery habitats (e.g. Anchoa, Scomberomorus); others utilize offshore fronts (e.g. Coryphaena, Xiphius). Important spawning locations include esturaine fronts (e.g. Cynoscion, Sciaenops), the mid-shelf front (Micropogonias, Leiostomus, Paralichthys), the Gulf Stream front (Coryphaena, Xiphius). Recent work has shown an accumulation of fish larvae in these shelf fronts (Govoni 1993). Movement of the Gulf Stream front also affects the distribution of adult fishes (Magnuson et al. 1981) and hook and line fisherman and longliners target much of their effort for pelagic species in these frontal zones. In addition, the quasi-permanent gyres which impinge upon the shelf near the Florida Keys and downstream from the Charleston Bump probably serve as important spawning/larval retention habitat for a variety of fishes (Collins and Stender, 1987; Lee et al., 1994). The region known as \"Point\" off Cape Hatteras supports an unusually high biomass of upper trophic level predators, including many important pelagic fishes. It has been suggested that the area is the most productive sport fishery on the east coast (Ross, 1989).\nDue to their important ecological function, at least two offshore pelagic environments discussed above represent essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC); the Charleston Bump and The Point. Both regions are productive and highly dynamic oceanic areas. A quasi-permanent, cyclonic eddy with attendant upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water sets-up in the wake of the Charleston Bump. Upwelling results in persistent primary and secondary production that may well result in an important, if not essential feeding environment for the larvae of fishes that congregate to spawn there. The hydrodynamics of the eddy may well serve in the retention of fish propagules that are lost from local populations elsewhere through entrainment into the Gulf Stream. The \"Point\" off Cape Hatteras is also highly productive due to the confluence of as many as four water masses. Adults of highly migratory species congregate in this area, while the diversity of larval fishes found there is truly astounding (Table 18b).\n138\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nTable 18b.

Tabular descriptions of habitat associations by life stage for each species. These tables summarize how each species uses the environment and provides information to assess the relative importance of different habitat types. The three tables developed are: 1) Habitat Associations (Tables 19a & 19b); 2) Biological Attributes (Tables 20a & 20b); and 3) Reproduction Tables (21a & 21b).\n\n145\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTable 19a.

Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTable 19b. Habitat Associations for Other Managed and Prey Species Using South Atlantic Estuaries (Source: NOAA 1998).\n148\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTerms Used in Habitat Association Life History Tables:\nLife stage definitions Life stages were defined in the three life history tables (Habitat Associations, Biological Attributes, and Reproduction) as follows: A - Adults; mature individuals, but not necessarily in spawning condition. S - Spawning; adults in spawning condition. J - Juveniles; not mature but otherwise morphologically similar to adults. L - Larvae; individuals which have hatched, but not yet attained the characteristic juvenile/adult morphology. E - Eggs; which have been spawned but not yet hatched.\nTerms used Domain - General habitat of life stages. \u00b7 Freshwater- Rivers and lakes above head-of-tide; freshwater lentic and lotic habitats. Lacustrine - Freshwater lentic areas (lakes) with riverine connections to the sea.. Riverine - coastal plain - River portions in the relatively flat land along a coast. Riverine - inland - River portions away from the coast. \u00b7 Estuarine - Embayment with tidal fresh, mixing, and seawater zones. Inlet mouth - The seaward end of an estuary. Channel - The drowned river channel or tributary channels of an estuary. Inter- and subtidal flats - Broad, shallow estuarine areas. Salinity range, NEI - Three salinity zones used by the ELMR program for compilation of distribution and abundance data. Tidal fresh zone - Salinities of 0.0-0.5 ppt. Mixing zone - Salinities of 0.5-25.0 ppt. Seawater zone - Salinities >25 ppt. Salinity range, Venice system - Five salinity zones according to the Venice system of estuarine classification. Limnetic - Salinities of 0.0-0.5 ppt. Oligohaline - Salinities of 0.5-5.0 ppt. Mesohaline - Salinities of 5-18 ppt. Polyhaline - Salinities of 18-30 ppt. Euhaline - Salinities >30 ppt. Temperature range - The temperatures at which a life stage is typically found, from 0_C to >30_C \u00b7 Marine - Coastal and offshore Beach/surf - Shore areas receiving ocean waves and wash. Neritic - Residing from the shore to the edge of the continental shelf. Oceanic - Residing beyond the edge of the continental shelf.\nSubstrate preference - Size of substrate that life stages reside on or in. \u00b7 Mud/clay/silt - Fine substrates <0.0625 mm in diameter. \u00b7 Sand - Substrates 0.0625-4.0 mm in diameter. \u00b7 Pebble/cobble/gravel - Substrates 4-256 mm in diameter. \u00b7 Boulder/rocky outcrop/reef- Large substrate >256 mm in diameter, exposed solid bedrock, or coral reef. \u00b7 Shell - Mollusc shell substrate, such as oyster. \u00b7 Submergent vegetation - Rooted aquatic vegetation that does not grow above the water's surface, e.g., turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum), shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). \u00b7 Emergent vegetation - Rooted aquatic vegetation that grows above the water's surface, e.g., cordgrass (Spartina) and mangrove. \u00b7 Floating vegetation - Non-rooted aquatic vegetation, e.g., Sargassum, and other vegetation that can form floating mats. \u00b7 None - No known substrate preferences.\nDepth preference \u00b7 Littoral Intertidal - From the high tide mark to depths of 1 m. Subtidal - At depths of 1-10 m. \u00b7 Sublittoral Inner shelf (10-50 m) - On or over the continental shelf at depths of 10-50 m. Middle shelf (50-100) - On or over the continental shelf at depths of 50-100 m. Outer shelf (100-200 m) - On or over the continental shelf at depths of 100-200 m.\n149\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTable 19b.(cont.)

The royal red shrimp, Pleoticus robustus occurs in deeper water, and sustains a limited harvest.\n3.3.1.1 Description of the Penaied Shrimp Species and Distribution With the exception of pink shrimp, which is also found off Bermuda, the three Penaeus\nspecies are restricted to the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico. Other common names for the white shrimp (Figure 11) include gray shrimp, lake shrimp, green shrimp, greentailed shrimp, blue tailed shrimp, rainbow shrimp, Daytona shrimp, common shrimp, and southern shrimp. The brown shrimp (Figure 11) is also known as brownie, green lake shrimp, red shrimp, redtail shrimp, golden shrimp, native shrimp, and also the summer shrimp in North Carolina. Other names for the pink shrimp (Figure 11) include spotted shrimp, hopper, pink spotted shrimp, brown spotted shrimp, grooved shrimp, green shrimp, pink night shrimp, red shrimp, skipper, and pushed shrimp.\n\nPink shrimp\n\nWhite shrimp\n\nBrown shrimp\n\nFigure 11. Illustrations of white, brown and pink shrimp.\n\nJuvenile and adult penaeids are omnivorous (eating both plants and animals) bottom feeders with most feeding activity occurring at night although daytime feeding may occur in turbid waters. Food items may consist of polychaetes, amphipods, nematodes, caridean shrimps, mysids, copepods, isopods, amphipods, ostracods, mollusks, foraminiferans, chironomid larvae, and various types of organic debris.\nWhite shrimp appear to prefer muddy or peaty bottoms rich in organic matter and decaying vegetation when in inshore waters. Offshore they are most abundant on soft muddy bottoms. Brown shrimp appear to prefer a similar bottom type and as adults may also be found in areas where the bottom consists of mud, sand, and shell. Pink shrimp are found most commonly on hard sand and calcareous shell bottom. Both brown and pink shrimp generally bury in the substrate during daylight, being active at night. White shrimp do not bury with the regularity of pink or brown shrimp.\nShrimp are preyed on by a wide variety of species at virtually all stages in their life history. Predation on postlarvae has been observed by sheepshead minnows, water boatmen, and insect larvae. Grass shrimp, killifishes, and blue crabs prey on young penaeid shrimp, and a wide variety of finfish are known to prey heavily on juvenile and adult penaeid shrimp.\nIn Georgia and northern Florida, some white shrimp spawning may occur inshore, although most spawning occurs more than 1.2 miles from the coastline. Off Florida, spawning occasionally takes place inshore, at or near inlets, but most occurs offshore in depths of 6.1-24.4 m (20-80 ft). In South Carolina most spawning occurs within about four miles of the coast. Some shrimp with spermatophores attached have been found inside Charleston harbor (Whitaker, SCWMRD, pers. comm. 1991).\n\n165\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSpawning is correlated with bottom water temperatures and has been reported to occur at bottom temperatures of between 17\u00b0 and 29\u00b0 C although spawning generally occurs between 22\u00b0 and 29\u00b0 C. White shrimp begin spawning in April in Florida and Georgia and late April or May in South Carolina. Spawning may continue into September or October.\nBrown shrimp spawn in relatively deep water. In the Gulf of Mexico, it was concluded that brown shrimp did not spawn in water less than 13.7 m (45 ft) and the greatest percentage of ripe females were at 45.7 m (150 ft). Spawning season for brown shrimp is uncertain, although there is an influx of postlarvae into the estuaries during February and March. Mature males and females have been found off South Carolina during October and November.\nPink shrimp apparently spawn between 3.7 and 15.8 m (12 and 52 ft). Off eastern Florida, peak spawning activity seems to occur during summer. In North Carolina, roe-bearing females are found as early as May, and by June, most pink shrimp are sexually mature.\nAll three species have eleven larval stages (5 nauplier, 3 protozoan, and 3 mysid) before developing into postlarvae. Duration of the larval period is dependent on temperature, food, and habitat. Records suggest larval periods of 10-12 days for white shrimp, 11-17 days for brown shrimp, and 15-25 days for pink shrimp. Brown shrimp postlarvae appear to overwinter in offshore bottom sediments (Whitaker, SCWMRD, pers. comm. 1991). Postlarval shrimp sizes range from approximately 2.9 to 12 mm (0.1-0.5 in) TL, with pink and white shrimp sizes overlapping and brown shrimp usually being larger.\nThe mechanism by which postlarvae are brought from distant spawning areas to inside estuaries is not well-known. Shoreward countercurrents north of Cape Canaveral have been suggested as the mechanism for transport of pink shrimp larvae from spawning areas to nursery areas along the northeast Florida coast. Movement of white shrimp postlarvae into the estuary is a result of nearshore tidal currents as white shrimp spawn relatively close to shore. There is some data on brown shrimp that suggest postlarvae may overwinter in offshore waters and migrate into estuaries the following spring. White and pink shrimp move into the estuary during late spring and early summer.\nAfter entering the estuaries, postlarval shrimp occupy nursery areas which offer abundant food, suitable substrate, and shelter from predators. In the South Atlantic these areas are generally dominated by the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora.\nWhite and pink shrimp enter the estuaries at about the same time, usually beginning in April and early May in the southern part of their range and in June and July in North Carolina sounds, where white shrimp are uncommon. Large white shrimp begin emigrating out of the estuary to the commercial fishing areas in August and continue through December. Smaller white and pink shrimp may remain in the estuary during winter and are termed overwintering stocks.\nIn the South Atlantic, juvenile and adult brown shrimp are rarely affected by severe winter weather because most have been captured by fishermen or predators, and others have moved offshore prior to the onset of cold weather.\nPink shrimp bury deeply in the substrate with the onset of cold weather and thus are protected to some extent from winter mortalities. However, pink shrimp can be adversely affected by low temperatures as evidenced by the mass mortalities in North Carolina during the winters of 1976-77 and 1977-78.\nPink and white shrimp that survive the winter grow rapidly in late winter and early spring before migrating to the ocean. The migrating white shrimp, called roe shrimp, make up the spring fishery and also produce the summer and fall crops of shrimp. When a majority of white shrimp do not survive the winter, the North Carolina and South Carolina fisheries are believed to\n166\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nbe dependent on a northward spring migration of white shrimp from more southerly areas to form the spawning stock. However, tagging data are inconclusive on the extent of this northward movement.\nSpatial and Temporal Distribution and Relative Abundance in Estuarine Habitat NOAA's Estuarine Living Marine Resource Program (ELMR), through a joint effort of\nNational Ocean Service and NMFS, conducts regional compilations of information on the use of estuarine habitat by select marine fish and invertebrates. A report prepared through the ELMR program (NOAA 1991b) and revised information (NOAA 1998), provided the Council during the Habitat Plan development process, present known spatial and temporal distribution and relative abundance of fish and invertebrates using southeast estuarine habitats. Twenty southeast estuaries selected from the National Estuarine Inventory (NOAA 1985) are included in the analysis which resulted from a review of published and unpublished literature and personal consultations. The resultant information emphasizes the importance and essential nature of estuarine habitat to all life stages of white, brown and pink shrimp. Regional salinity and relative abundance maps for use in determining EFH for white, brown and pink shrimp, were prepared for the Council by NOAA SEA Division. Figures 12-17 present a representative sample of the distribution maps. The entire set of maps in color can be found at the SAFMC web site (www.safmc.noaa.gov) and are included in Appendix F. These maps portray salinity and species relative abundances for estuaries and coastal embayments on state and/or regional maps. Depending on data availability, maps were produced at various scales: 1:24K, 1:80K, and 1:250K. For species relative abundances, these maps were developed only for juveniles of estuarine species (Nelson et al. 1991) showing the highest juvenile relative abundance in any salinity zone by season for each estuary. These maps will eventually be provided to the Council as ArcView shape files with associated data for inclusion into the Councils GIS system.\nRates of growth in penaeid shrimp are highly variable and depend on factors such as season, water temperature, shrimp density, salinity, size, and sex. Adolescent shrimp grow rapidly with estimates ranging from 1.0-2.3 mm per day for white shrimp, 0.5-2.5 mm per day for brown shrimp, and 0.25-1.7 mm per day for pink shrimp. Larger white shrimp may grow more than an inch per month.\nSalinity is also a factor determining growth rate in white shrimp. High salinities appear to inhibit growth. Density also affects growth of white shrimp. During years of low densities, the average size is generally larger.\nTemperature also affects brown shrimp growth rates, with rates as high as 3.3 mm per day recorded when the temperature exceeded 25\u00b0 C but less than 1.0 mm per day when water temperature was below 20\u00b0 C. Salinity also affects growth rates in brown shrimp. Salinities in excess of 10 ppt seems to enhance growth rate.\nPink shrimp in Florida Bay were found to grow 3.5 mm CL (carapace length) in winter and only 1.9 mm CL in spring. In North Carolina, maximum pink shrimp growth rates were recorded in summer.\nDistribution White shrimp range from Fire Island, New York to St. Lucie Inlet on the Atlantic Coast\nof Florida (Figure 18). Along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S., the white shrimp has centers of abundance in South Carolina, Georgia, and northeast Florida. White shrimp are generally concentrated in waters of 27 m (89 ft) or less, although occasionally found much deeper (up to 270 ft).\n167\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nOn the Atlantic Coast, brown shrimp occur from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts to the Florida Keys (Figure 19). While it may occur seasonally along the Mid-Atlantic states, breeding populations apparently do not range north of North Carolina. The species may occur in commercial quantities in waters as deep as 110 m (361 ft), but they are most abundant in water less than 55 m (180 ft).\nPink shrimp occur from southern Chesapeake Bay to the Florida Keys (Figure 20), and around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico to Yucatan south of Cabo Catoche. Maximum abundance is reached off southwestern Florida and the southeastern Golfo de Campeche. Along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S., pink shrimp occurs in sufficient abundance to be of major commercial significance only in North Carolina. Pink shrimp are most abundant in waters of 1137 m (36-121 ft) although in some areas they may be abundant as deep as 65 m (213 ft). Pink shrimp are common in the estuaries and shallow marine waters surrounding southern Florida and into deep waters (approximately 100 meters) southeast of the Keys, and are the dominant species within the Dry Tortugas shrimping grounds and Florida Bay (Solamon, 1968). Adult pink shrimp congregate in deep water (> 6 fathoms) off the Dry Tortugas to spawn. Larvae can take two routes to the estuarine nursery areas where they spend most of their life cycle. One route is directly to the shallow-water estuaries of the 10,000 Island, Whitewater Bay, and Florida Bay. On the other route, larvae are swept southwesterly into the Florida Current by way of the Loop Current, and are carried northeasterly along the outer edge of the Florida Reef Tract or of east coast of Florida (Ingle et al., 1959).\n168\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 12.

Rock shrimp can be easily separated from Penaeus species by their thick, rigid, stony exoskeleton. The affected environment, including a description of the shrimp fisheries in the south Atlantic region, is presented in detail in the original shrimp plan (SAFMC 1993) and the profile of the shrimp fishery in the south Atlantic (SAFMC 1981). A description of Council concerns and recommendations on protecting shrimp habitat is also included in the original FMP.\nFigure 21. Rock shrimp Sicyonia brevirostris.\nBiological Characteristics Rock shrimp are dioecious (separate sexes). Female rock shrimp attain sexual maturity at\nabout 17 mm carapace length (CL), and all males are mature by 24 mm CL. Seasonal temperature initiates maturation. Rock shrimp have ovaries that extend from the anterior end of the cephalothorax to the posterior end of the abdomen. Rock shrimp, as with most shrimp species, are highly fecund. Fecundity most probably, as with penaeids, increases with size. In rock shrimp, copulation is believed to take place between hard shelled individuals. During copulation the male anchors the spermatophore to the female's thelycum by the petasma and other structures and a glutinous material. Fertilization is believed to take place as ova and spermatozoa are simultaneously expulsed from the female. Spawning season for rock shrimp is variable with peak spawning beginning between November and January and lasting 3 months. Individual females may spawn three or more times in one season. Peak spawning activity seems to occur monthly and coincides with the full moon (Kennedy et al. 1977). Five ovarian stages, one more than found in penaeid shrimp, have been identified for rock shrimp (Kennedy et al. 1977): 1) Undeveloped; 2) Developing; 3) Nearly Ripe; 4) Ripe; and 5) Advanced Ripe.\nLarval and Postlarval Phases Kennedy et al. (1977) found rock shrimp larvae to be present year round with no trend\nrelative to depth, temperature, salinity, and length or moon phase. The development from egg to postlarvae takes approximately one month. Subsequently the development from postlarvae to the smallest mode of recruits takes two to three months. The major transport mechanism affecting planktonic larval rock shrimp is the shelf current systems near Cape Canaveral, Florida (Bumpus 1973). These currents keep larvae on the Florida Shelf and may transport them inshore in spring.\n178\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nGrowth Patterns, Mortality, and Recruitment Rates of growth in rock shrimp are variable and depend on factors such as season, water\ntemperature, shrimp density, size, and sex. Rock shrimp grow about a count a month. Growth is 2 - 3 mm CL per month in juveniles and 0.5 - 0.6 mm CL per month in adults (Kennedy et al. 1977).\nDensity is thought to also affect growth of rock shrimp. In 1993, the industry indicated that rock shrimp were abundant but never grew significantly over 36/40 count which was the predominant size class harvested during July and August of that year. During years of low densities, the average size appears to be generally larger.\nSince rock shrimp live between 20 and 22 months, natural mortality rates are very high, and with fishing, virtually the entire year class will be dead at the end of the season. The intense fishing effort which exists in today's fishery, harvests exclusively the incoming year class. Three year classes were present in sampling conducted between 1973 and 1974 by Kennedy et al. (1977). Fishing mortality in combination with high natural mortality and possibly poor environmental conditions, may be high enough to prevent any significant escapement of adults to constitute a harvestable segment of the population. The better than average rock shrimp production in the 1994 season possibly resulted from better environmental conditions more conducive to rock shrimp reproduction and spawning.\nEcological Relationships Food, Substrate, and Predation\nAlong the Florida Atlantic coast, the predominant substrate inside of 200 m depth is fine to medium sand with small patches of silt and clay (Milliman 1972). Juvenile and adult rock shrimp are bottom feeders. Stomach contents analyses indicated that rock shrimp primarily feed on small bivalve mollusks and decapod crustaceans (Cobb et al. 1973). Based on stomach contents of rock shrimp analyzed, Kennedy et al. (1977) found the relative abundance of particular crustaceans and mollusks corresponding to their availability in the surrounding benthic habitat.\nDistribution Recruitment to the area offshore of Cape Canaveral occurs between April and August\nwith two or more influxes of recruits entering within one season (Kennedy et al. 1977). Keiser (1976) described the distribution of rock shrimp in coastal waters of the\nsoutheastern United States. Whitaker (1982) presented a summary of information on rock shrimp off South Carolina. The only comprehensive research to date on rock shrimp off the east coast of Florida was by Kennedy et al. (1977). The following section incorporates some of the more significant findings presented by Kennedy et al. (1977) regarding the biology of rock shrimp on the east coast of Florida.\nRock shrimp (Sicyonia brevirostris) are found in the Gulf of Mexico, Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. up to Virginia (SAFMC 1993) (Figure 22). The center of abundance and the concentrated commercial fishery for rock shrimp in the south Atlantic region occurs off northeast Florida south to Jupiter Inlet (Figure 23). Although rock shrimp are also found off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia and are occasionally landed in these states, no sustainable commercially harvestable quantities of rock shrimp comparable to the fishery prosecuted in the EEZ off Florida are being exploited.\nRock shrimp live mainly on sand bottom from a few meters to 183 m (600 ft), occasionally deeper (SAFMC 1993). The largest concentrations are found between 25 and 65 m (82 and 213 ft).\n179\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 22.

Harvestable rock shrimp distribution in the south Atlantic region as indicated from historic research efforts (1956-1991) using finfish and shrimp trawls (Source: NMFS 1994).\n181\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nRoyal Red Shrimp Royal red shrimp are found throughout the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic area from\nCape Cod to French Guiana. In the South Atlantic they are found in large concentrations primarily off northeast Florida. They inhabit the upper regions of the continental slope from 180 m (590 ft) to about 730 m (2,395 ft), but concentrations are usually found at depths of between 250 m (820 ft) and 475 m (1,558 ft) over blue/black mud, sand, muddy sand, or white calcareous mud.\n3.3.1.3 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements for Penaeid Shrimp For peneaid shrimp, Essential Fish Habitat includes inshore estuarine nursery areas,\noffshore marine habitats used for spawning and growth to maturity, and all interconnecting water bodies as described in the Habitat Plan. Inshore nursery areas include tidal freshwater (palustrine), estuarine, and marine emergent wetlands (e.g., intertidal marshes); tidal palustrine forested areas; mangroves; tidal freshwater, estuarine, and marine submerged aquatic vegetation (e.g., seagrass); and subtidal and intertidal non-vegetated flats. This applies from North Carolina through the Florida Keys.\nThe three commercially important penaeid shrimp of the southeastern United States occupy similar habitats with the greatest differences being in optimal substrate and salinity. Apparently all three species can tolerate a wide range of habitat conditions; however, there appear to be optimal conditions which result in the highest growth rates and greatest survival.\nShrimp have a life cycle which requires a variety of habitats. The habitats can basically be divided into offshore and inshore. The high salinity, oceanic waters serve as habitat for large mature shrimp which will spawn offshore. Brown and pink shrimp apparently move to relatively deep continental shelf water and white shrimp appear to remain nearshore in shallower water (SAFMC 1981).\nThe relative abundance of the three shrimp species in the South Atlantic may be related to offshore bottom sediment composition. Kennedy and Barber suggest that spawning pink shrimp may be most abundant off Cape Canaveral and Cape Lookout because that species has an affinity for hard, coarse, and particularly calcareous bottom sediments which occur in those areas. They also note that the nearshore soft sediments correlate well with white and brown shrimp distribution from northern Florida to Pamlico Sound, North Carolina.\nOffshore water also serves as habitat for larval and postlarval shrimp. These shrimp are planktonic and feed on zooplankton in the water column. There is some evidence that postlarval brown shrimp may overwinter in nearshore bottom sediments (Temple and Fischer, 1967). Aldrich et al. (1968) demonstrated that brown shrimp postlarvae buried in laboratory experiments when water temperature was reduced to 12\u00b0-16.5\u00b0C (54\u00b0-62\u00b0F). For their experiments, they used substrate material taken from Galveston Bay which was 75 percent clay, 22 percent silt and 3 percent sand.\nThe inshore phase of the life cycle is perhaps the most critical because most of the rapid growth occurs here. This critical habitat is dominated on the Atlantic coast by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and Juncus (in North Carolina's Pamlico Sound) which produce most of the primary production. Schelske and Odum (1961) stated that up to 10 tons of Spartina plant tissues are produced per acre per year. Turner (1977) found a direct relationship between commercial landings to absolute area and type of estuarine-intertidal vegetation. He suggested that the \"...measurements of intertidal areas are relative indices of the amount of \"edge\" in an area and thus indirect measurement of the habitat.\"\n182\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nShrimp enter the inshore habitat as postlarvae and maintain a benthic existence. The areas where juveniles appear most abundant have a mud-silt substrate and intermediate salinities. Gunter et al. (1964) found that juvenile white shrimp were most abundant in waters of salinities less than 10 ppt in Alabama and Texas bays. Truesdale (1970) presented somewhat contradictory information. He concluded that salinity, per se, had no effect on postlarval distribution and abundance in Trinity Bay, Texas except during periods of high river discharge. Zein-Eldin and Aldrich (1965) and Zein-Eldin and Griffith (1970) found that salinity, per se, did not affect the growth of postlarval shrimp.\nApparently white shrimp have a greater tolerance to low salinity than brown shrimp. Gunter (1961) attributes the predominance of white shrimp in Louisiana to the lower estuarine salinities. Conversely, brown shrimp dominate in the waters around the much drier Texas. Gunter points out that the connection between rainfall and Texas white shrimp production was dramatically illustrated in 1957 when a long drought was broken and landings jumped from 2,229,000 pounds in 1957 to 7,370,000 pounds in 1958. Parker (1970) reported brown shrimp in areas where bottom salinity ranged from 0.9 to 36.5 ppt. Gaidry and White (1973) reported that commercial catches of brown shrimp were poor in those years when salinities where less than 15 ppt at the time postlarvae were present in the estuaries. They also stated that years of low commercial landings of brown shrimp were associated with prolonged estuarine temperatures of less than 20\u00b0 C (68\u00b0F) at the time of postlarval immigration into the estuary. Laboratory studies with juvenile and adult brown and white shrimp indicate that white shrimp are better adapted to tolerate low salinity, whereas, brown shrimp are better adapted to higher salinities (McFarland and Lee, 1963). Gunter et al. (1964), found that juvenile white shrimp were more abundant in areas with waters of salinities less than 10 ppt while brown shrimp juveniles were more abundant in salinities between 10.0 and 19.9 ppt.\nJuvenile shrimp appear to be most abundant at the Spartina grass-water interface. This \"estuarine edge\" is the most productive zone in many estuaries. Because there is a minimum of wind generated turbulence and stabilization of sediments, rich bands are found that along the edges of marshes (Odum, 1970). Furthermore, Odum (1970) found the percentages of organic detritus in sediments along the shore in the Everglades estuary are several times greater than a few meters offshore. Mock (1967) examined two estuarine habitats, one natural and one altered by bulk-heading. He found a 0.6 m (2 ft) band of rich organic material along the natural shore and very little organic material along the bulkheaded shore. White shrimp were 12.5 times and brown shrimp 2.5 times more numerous in the natural area as in the altered area. Loesch (1965) found that juvenile white shrimp in Mobile Bay were most abundant nearshore in water less than 0.6 m (2 ft) deep containing large amounts of organic detritus. Brown shrimp were congregated in water 0.6 to 0.9 m (2-3 ft) deep where there was attached vegetation.\nAs shrimp increase in size, they begin migrating toward high salinity, oceanic waters. Parker (1970) observed that size of brown shrimp at the time of emigration is apparently related to density of individuals but smaller individuals tended to concentrate in shallow peripheral zones. St. Amant et al. (1966) observed that as juveniles increased in size they move into deeper, larger bays, through the lower bays and to offshore waters. Lindner and Anderson (1956) stated that shrimp size increased from inside to outside waters. The largest shrimp were in the outside waters where salinity values were highest.\nWater temperature directly or indirectly influences white shrimp spawning, growth, habitat selection, osmoregulation, movement, migration, and mortality (Muncy 1984). Spring water temperature increases trigger spawning, and rapid water temperature declines in fall portend the end of spawning (Lindner and Anderson 1956). Growth is fastest in summer and\n183\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nslow or negligible in winter. Water temperatures below 20\u00b0C inhibit growth of juvenile shrimp (Etzold and Christmas 1977) and growth is virtually nil at 16\u00b0C (St. Amant and Lindner 1966). Growth rates increase rapidly as temperatures increase above 20\u00b0C. Increased water temperatures affects molting rate (Perez-Farfante 1969). Good correlation between heatingdegree-days and catch/effort ratio for penaeid shrimp was similar to correlations of yield-perhectare versus latitude (Turner 1977). Temperature and food supply limited the growth of white shrimp postlarvae more than did salinity differences between 2 and 35 ppt (Zein-Eldin 1964).\nSevere winters in 1939-40, 1966, 1976-77, and 1977-78 caused mass mortality and reduced catches in the South Atlantic white shrimp fishery (McKenzie 1981; Shipman 1983a; Whitaker 1983a). The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (1983) reported a 34% drop in white shrimp landings in 1981 and a 99% drop in 1981 spring catch of roe shrimp after the unusually cold 1980-81 winter. White shrimp are more tolerant of high temperatures and less tolerant of low temperatures than either brown or pink shrimp (Etzold and Christmas 1977). Among postlarvae, brown shrimp were more resistant than white shrimp to higher temperatures.\nWhite shrimp mortality was reported at water temperatures of 8\u00b0C and lower (Joyce 1965). Mortality of white shrimp is total at 3\u00b0C or lower, regardless of salinity. White shrimp survival at low temperatures depends on ambient temperature, the rate of temperature decline, the duration of low temperatures and salinity (Joyce 1965). The impact of low water temperature and low salinity on white shrimp was discussed by Music (1979) and Shipman (1983a). Adult white shrimp (>90mm long) may be more susceptible than juveniles to cold temperatures (Whitaker 1983a). Wiesepape (1975) found the 24-h LC50 (temperature causing 50% mortality in 24 h) to be 36\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C for white shrimp acclimated at 29\u00b0 and 34\u00b0C, respectively. Postlarvae and 30-mm long juveniles have similar but higher resistance times than 50-mm juveniles.\nAdult white shrimp spawn offshore where salinities are at least 27 ppt. The larvae move shoreward and become second-stage postlarvae as they enter estuaries on flood tides. Juvenile white shrimp moved 160 km upstream into water of less than 1.0-ppt salinity waters in the St. Johns River, Florida (Joyce 1965). Juvenile white shrimp have even been recovered from Lake Monroe Power Station filter screens located 270 km from the mouth of the St. Johns River -especially when low rainfall and low river stages caused reverse tidal flow (Edwin Joyce pers. comm., February 1984). The high calcium ion concentrations in the St. Johns River may explain the relative ease with which marine species enter and remain in low salinity waters (Joyce 1965). The lowest salinity in which white shrimp were recorded in the northern Gulf of Mexico was 0.42 ppt (Perez-Farfante 1969). Although field studies indicate that juvenile white shrimp prefer low salinities, laboratory studies have revealed that white shrimp appear to tolerate a wide range of salinities; they have been successfully reared at salinities of 18 to 34 ppt (Perez-Farfante 1969). McKenzie (1981) cited several studies in which fast growth was reported for white shrimp at salinities of 7 to 15 ppt.\nWhite shrimp in Georgia move toward higher salinity waters as sexual development progresses, and most spawn offshore in the sea (Harris 1974).\nTemperature-salinity tolerance ranges for white shrimp vary at different life stages, but the interactions are more pronounced at the extremes of tolerance. For example, Couch (1978) reported that broken-back syndrome (dorsal separation of the third and fourth pleural plates on abdominal) appears after sudden drops in salinity (from 15 ppt to 3 ppt) in cold water (8\u00b0C). The critical thermal maxima for white shrimp are influenced largely by acclimation temperatures, and to a lesser extent by salinity and size of test animal (Laney 1973). Freshwater inflow may affect coastal water temperatures, which in turn affect the growth rates (White and Boudreaux 1977)\n184\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nand migration of white shrimp (Shipman 1983b). Spring spawning of white shrimp coincides with a rapid rise in bottom water temperatures in high salinity offshore waters (McKenzie 1981).\nWhite shrimp prefer shallow, muddy-bottom substrate. Landings of shrimp along the Louisiana coast were highest in areas where substrates were highly organic (Barrett and Gillespie 1973; Gaidry 1974). A relative higher linear correlation (R2 = 0.69) between intertidal land area and average annual shrimp catch along Louisiana's inshore regions was reported by Turner (1977). The relation between inshore catches and hectares of vegetated estuarine habitat in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Tampa Bay, Florida, to Mobile Bay and Perdido Bay, Alabama) also showed a strong correlation (R2 = 0.64). A direct relationship between commercial shrimp landings and intertidal vegetated areas and degrees latitude was reported by Turner (1977). The annual landings (kg/ha) in 1955-64 were 19.7 in North Carolina, 7.9 in South Carolina, 13 in Georgia, and 22.4 in east Florida. White shrimp undoubtedly composed most of the landings except in North Carolina. Southward fall migration probably account for the high landings from Florida waters. The area of nearshore soft sediments correlate well with white and brown shrimp distribution from Pamlico Sound, North Carolina to northern Florida (McKenzie 1981).\nTemporal and spatial shifts by brown, white, and pink shrimp help reduce direct interspecific competition especially for certain substrates (Lassuy 1983). White shrimp burrow less deeply into muddy substrates and are more active in daylight than are brown or pink shrimp. Staggered seasonal recruitment of brown and white shrimp into the south Atlantic estuaries would reduce competition (Baisden 1983).\n3.3.1.4 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements for Rock Shrimp For rock shrimp, essential fish habitat consists of offshore terrigenous and biogenic sand\nbottom habitats from 18 to 182 meters in depth with highest concentrations occurring between 34 and 55 meters. This applies for all areas from North Carolina through the Florida Keys. Essential fish habitat includes the shelf current systems near Cape Canaveral, Florida which provide major transport mechanisms affecting planktonic larval rock shrimp. These currents keep larvae on the Florida Shelf and may transport them inshore in spring. In addition the Gulf Stream is an essential fish habitat because it provides a mechanism to disperse rock shrimp larvae.\nA description of shrimp habitat and recommendations to protect habitat were contained in the shrimp management plan (SAFMC 1993). The bottom habitat on which rock shrimp thrive is thought to be limited. Kennedy et al. (1977) determined that the deepwater limit of rock shrimp was most likely due to the decrease of suitable bottom habitat rather than to other physical parameters including salinity and temperature. Cobb et al. (1973) found the inshore distribution of rock shrimp to be associated with terrigenous and biogenic sand substrates and only sporadically on mud. Rock shrimp also utilize hard bottom and coral or more specifically Oculina coral habitat areas. This was confirmed with research trawls capturing large amounts of rock shrimp in and around the Oculina Bank HAPC prior to its designation.\nOther than Kennedy et al. (1977), no characterization of habitat essential to rock shrimp or bycatch in the rock shrimp fishery has been conducted. A list of species associated with the benthic habitat inhabited by rock shrimp was compiled from research trawling efforts (19551991) that captured harvestable levels of rock shrimp. In addition, Kennedy et al. (1977), during research efforts sampling the major distribution area of rock shrimp off the east coast of Florida, compiled a list of crustacean and molluscan taxa associated with rock shrimp benthic habitat.\n185\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.1.5 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements for Royal Red Shrimp Essential fish habitat for royal red shrimp include the upper regions of the continental\nslope from 180 meters (590 feet) to about 730 meters (2,395 feet), with concentrations found at depths of between 250 meters (820 feet) and 475 meters (1,558 feet) over blue/black mud, sand, muddy sand, or white calcareous mud. In addition the Gulf Stream is an essential fish habitat because it provides a mechanism to disperse royal red shrimp larvae.\n3.3.1.6 Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for Shrimp Penaeid Shrimp\nAreas which meet the criteria for essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs) for penaeid shrimp include all coastal inlets, all state-designated nursery habitats of particular importance to shrimp (for example, in North Carolina this would include all Primary Nursery Areas and all Secondary Nursery Areas), and state-identified overwintering areas.\nEstuarine tidal creeks and salt marshes that serve as nursery grounds are perhaps the most important habitats occupied by penaeid shrimp. The major factor controlling shrimp growth and production is the availability of nursery habitat. Remaining wetland habitat must be protected if present production levels are to be maintained. In addition, impacted habitats must be restored if future production is to be increased. Other areas of specific concern are the barrier islands since these land masses are vital to the maintenance of estuarine conditions needed by shrimp during their juvenile stage. Passes between barrier islands into estuaries also are important since the slow mixing of sea water and fresh water are also of prime importance to estuarine productivity.\nIn North Carolina, essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern include estuarine shoreline habitats since juveniles congregate here. Seagrass beds, prevalent in the sounds and bays of North Carolina and Florida, are particularly critical areas. Core Sound and eastern Pamlico Sound, based on a preliminary aerial survey funded through the AlbemarlePamlico Estuarine Study, have approximately 200,000 acres of seagrass beds making North Carolina second only to Florida in abundance of this type of habitat (Department of Commerce 1988b). In subtropical and tropical regions shrimp and spiny lobster postlarvae recruit into grass beds from distant offshore spawning grounds (Fonseca et al. 1992).\nSouth Carolina and Georgia lack seagrass beds. Here, the nursery habitat of shrimp is the high marsh areas with shell hash and mud bottoms. In addition, there is seasonal movement out of the marsh into deep holes and creek channels adjoining the marsh system during winter. Therefore, the area of particular concern for early growth and development encompasses the entire estuarine system from the lower salinity portions of the river systems through the inlet mouths.\nRock Shrimp No essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern have been identified for rock\nshrimp however, deep water habitat (e.g. the rock shrimp closed area/proposed expanded Oculina Bank HAPC) may serve as nursery habitat and protect the stock by providing a refuge for rock shrimp.\n186\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.2 Red Drum 3.3.2.1 Description of the Species and Distribution\nRed drum (Figure 24) occur in a variety of habitats distributed from Massachusetts to Key West, Florida on the Atlantic coast (Simmons and Breuer 1962). Red drum historically have been found as far north as Massachusetts with concentrations great enough to support a moderate commercial fishery in New Jersey in the early 1930s. Commercial red drum landings have generally declined along the mid-Atlantic coast with none being reported north of the Chesapeake Bay since 1950 (Yokel 1980). The distribution of red drum along the Atlantic coast in recent years, as indicated from recreational and commercial landings, extends from the Chesapeake Bay area through Florida.\nFigure 24. Red Drum, Sciaenops ocellatus.\nEggs, Larvae and Juveniles Red drum spawn in the ocean along beaches and in the vicinity of inlets and passes and\npossibly in high salinity estuaries. Red drum spawn at night and produce planktonic, spherical eggs between 0.86 mm and 0.98 mm in diameter (Johnson et al. 1977). Eggs are clear with a single, gold-colored oil droplet. Environmental requirements for optimum incubation were determined in the laboratory as a salinity of 25-35 ppt below which the eggs would sink and above which the eggs would clump together. In addition, optimum spawning occurred at temperatures of 22\u00b0-30\u00b0C (Holt et al. 1983). Red drum eggs and larvae are carried through tidal and current movement into estuarine systems. Increased spawning activity is associated with new and full moon periods during the spawning season.\nJuvenile red drum have a pronounced seasonal pattern of distribution in Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina moving into deeper areas of estuaries or the ocean in the fall and winter (Yokel 1980). Juveniles have been collected throughout Chesapeake Bay from September to November and through December in North Carolina (Hildebrand and Schroeder 1928; Mansueti 1960). In North Carolina, juvenile one and two year old red drum occur year round in estuaries, both in mainland bays and rivers, and along the grass flats behind barrier islands (Ross et al., 1987). A portion of these cohorts migrate into the ocean after their first year and occur along beaches during the late fall through early spring. Peak recruitment of young fish generally occurs September through November in North Carolina estuaries.\nAdults After maturation, adult red drum spend less time in the estuaries and more time in the\nocean (Yokel 1966). They migrate seasonally along the coast, inshore and/or north in spring and offshore and/or south in fall. Chesapeake Bay red drum are taken through October and are most abundant during spring and fall. Large schools of adult red drum were identified during aerial surveys conducted as part of the Atlantic Marine Gamefish Research Program. The annual survey encompassed 12 monthly flights over the continental shelf from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Miami, Florida to measure sea surface temperature and record sightings of all fish and other\n187\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nsurface life. Large schools of adult red drum were identified offshore south of Hatteras, North Carolina in April. Additional sightings of red drum offshore were noted to occur north of Hatteras in May and June. Large numbers of red drum are occasionally gigged in North Carolina sounds in the winter.\nAnnually, the best catches of large red drum occur around the eastern shore of Virginia and in the lower Chesapeake Bay in May-June and September-October. Largest catches of adult red drum along the Outer Banks are made from late March through May and from October through November (Ross and Stevens 1989). Large schools of red drum have been observed in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina during the summer (Mercer 1984). In winter, red drum have been caught in the trawl fishery and in trawl surveys at depths of 10 to 40 m. Red drum have been reported off South Carolina in 13-26 m of water in the winter and early spring.\nIn addition, large red drum were captured by shark gillnet fishermen in the EEZ offshore of Folly Beach, South Carolina in May 1989. Recreational fishermen in South Carolina have identified large schools of adult red drum nearshore feeding along bars during rising tides at night. In Georgia, red drum older than four years are generally found along beaches and in offshore waters. Recent sonic tagging studies conducted by Georgia Department of Natural Resources have resulted in field verification of red drum surface schools offshore in the EEZ (Music and Pafford 1984).\nMovement Patterns Adult red drum migrate seasonally along the Atlantic coast (Yokel 1966). Reports from\nfishermen and menhaden spotter pilots indicate that red drum typically arrive at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina between March and April, some entering Pamlico Sound and others proceeding up the coast. Red drum are expected about a week later at Oregon Inlet and three weeks to a month later in Virginia, some entering Chesapeake Bay. Apparently in times of high abundance and proper environmental conditions, red drum averaging 13-14 kg (33-36 lb) were present along the New Jersey coast from May to October (Welsh and Breder 1923). Red drum leave Virginia in most years by October and fall fishing along the North Carolina coast starts in September and usually ends in November (Yokel 1966).\nAfter their first or second year some red drum move along the barrier island beaches during fall and spend winter in deep holes or sloughs, while others winter in the estuary. As they get older, they spend spring, early summer and fall along the beaches and winter offshore. As spring approaches, these adult fish move from offshore wintering grounds towards the beaches with concentrations showing up around Ocracoke, Hatteras and Oregon Inlets, North Carolina. They occur along beaches near inlets for one to two months and move inside Pamlico Sound in summer. In August they school up around inlets to spawn and remain there and along the beaches through November, then move offshore again.\nRed drum also exhibit a north/south movement pattern as follows: A large body of fish moves inshore and north along the beaches in the spring up to the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia barrier islands. Also a large number of fish, generally 5-25 lb, spend their summer around shoals off Cape Hatteras, Cape Lookout and the four inlets north of Cape Lookout.\nOne consistent pattern that can be drawn from Atlantic coast red drum tagging studies is that red drum tend to stay in the same general estuarine system from post larval stages through their third or fourth year of life. They then move out of the estuarine system into the spawning stock associated with nearshore and offshore areas. Some large fish move into bays, sounds and harbor systems, even after maturity, and are susceptible to capture. The majority of tagging conducted along the Atlantic coast has been directed toward smaller red drum, less than four\n188\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nyears old. Large red drum are being tagged through efforts of recreational fishermen participating in sport fish tagging programs conducted by state fishery agencies. Returns of large fish (>32 in TL) have been very low and and many of these returns have occurred at the same general time. Thus movement of these fish can be cited as the minimum distance traveled, not accounting for possible migration and return to spawning grounds (such as specific inlet mouths or bar systems associated with these high energy areas).\nEcological Relationships - Food A dietary analysis of red drum (5-300 mm SL) stomach contents was conducted by\nDaniel (1988) Prey varied with fish size. Copepods were predominant prey by volume for fish 5-15 mm SL, representing 27% of the total volume. Mysids comprised 34% of the total volume of prey for fish 16-30 mm. The highest level of fish consumption occurred in juvenile red drum in the 76 and 100 mm size class (72% by volume) found in 70% of the individual samples. Fish were also a major component of juvenile red drum in both the 100-125 mm SL (51% by volume) and the 125-150 mm SL (60% by volume) size classes. A shift in composition of prey species was observed for red drum 200-300 mm SL. The predominant species observed in this size class included decapods (mainly mud crabs and fiddler crabs) accounting for 96% by volume and 95% of the (83) individuals analyzed. Music and Pafford (1984) analyzed the stomach contents of red drum which ranged from 101 mm to 1,100 mm collected in Glynn County Georgia from January 1979 through June 1982. Red drum 300-600 mm in length were found to have 17% fish, 72% arthropods and 11% plant material, with fiddler crabs (16%) and white shrimp (11%) being the predominant food item by occurrence. Red drum 601-1,100 mm in length were found to have 36% fish, 59% arthropods and 5% plant material, with fiddler crabs (14%) and mud crabs (11%) being the predominant food item by occurrence.\n3.3.2.2 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements For red drum, essential fish habitat includes all the following habitats to a depth of 50\nmeters offshore: tidal freshwater; estuarine emergent vegetated wetlands (flooded saltmarshes, brackish marsh, and tidal creeks); estuarine scrub/shrub (mangrove fringe); submerged rooted vascular plants (sea grasses); oyster reefs and shell banks; unconsolidated bottom (soft sediments); ocean high salinity surf zones; and artificial reefs. The area covered includes Virginia through the Florida Keys.\nRed drum are distributed along the Atlantic coast, in the ocean and estuarine areas in relation to their stage of maturity. Juvenile red drum utilize the shallow backwaters of estuaries as nursery areas and remain there until they move to deeper water portions of the estuary associated with river mouths, oyster bars and front beaches. Estuarine wetlands are especially important to larval red drum. The types of estuarine systems vary along the Atlantic and subsequently, the preferred juvenile habitat also varies with distribution. Young red drum are found in quiet, shallow, protected waters with grassy or slightly muddy bottoms. Shallow bay bottoms or oyster reef substrates are preferred by subadult and adult red drum. Red drum utilize the oceanic system which is the area of the Atlantic ocean from the beachfront seaward. Large red drum are thought to migrate along the Atlantic coast and are subjected to man's alterations of the natural system. Nearshore and offshore bar and bank areas such as Gaskins and Joiner Banks in South Carolina have been identified as areas where concentrations of red drum could be located. Nearshore artificial reefs along the Atlantic are also known to attract red drum as they make their spring and fall migrations. In the fall and spring red drum concentrate around inlets, shoals, capes, and from the surfzone to several miles offshore, moving among these areas.\n189\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe distribution of red drum between estuarine habitat and oceanic waters is dependant mainly on stage of development and temporal and environmental factors. Red drum are euryhaline. Adult and subadult red drum are most often found in diluted/concentrated seawater of 20 to 40 ppt and rarely above 50 ppt, while juveniles range into the freshest parts of estuaries. Eggs and newly hatched larvae require salinities above 25 ppt. Spawning occurs in or near passes of inlets (e.g. \"Grillage\" at the mouth of Charleston Harbor) with larvae being transported into the upper estuarine areas of low salinity. As larvae develop into juveniles and sub-adults, they utilize progressively higher salinity estuarine and beachfront surf zones. Red drum move out of estuarine areas as adults and occupy the high salinity surf zone nearshore and offshore coastal waters. In North Carolina and Virginia, large adults move into estuaries during summer months.\nRed drum are eurythermal, occuring over a temperature range of 2\u00b0-33\u00b0C, although they usually move into deeper water at extremes. Larger juveniles and adults are more susceptible to the effects of winter cold waves than small fish. High red drum mortality during freezes occurs and has the ability to decimate large portions of juvenile year classes. Thermal optimum is dependant on salinity, a characteristic of euryhaline fish.\nSpatial and Temporal Distribution and Relative Abundance in Estuarine Habitat NOAA's Estuarine Living Marine Resource Program (ELMR), through a joint effort of\nNational Ocean Service and NMFS, conducts regional compilations of information on the use of estuarine habitat by select marine fish and invertebrates. A report prepared through the ELMR program (NOAA 1991b) and revised information (NOAA 1998), provided the Council during the Habitat Plan development process, present known spatial and temporal distribution and relative abundance of fish and invertebrates using southeast estuarine habitats. Twenty southeast estuaries selected from the National Estuarine Inventory (NOAA 1985) are included in the analysis which resulted from a review of published and unpublished literature and personal consultations. The resultant information emphasizes the importance and essential nature of estuarine habitat to all life stages of red drum.\nRegional salinity and relative abundance maps for use in determining EFH for red drum were prepared for the Council by NOAA SEA Division (Appendix F). Figures 25-28 present a representative sample of the distibution maps for juvenile red drum. The remainder of the coverages and additional information on species and habitat distribution are available over the Internet on the Council web page under the habitat homepage (www.safmc.noaa.gov). These maps portray salinity and species relative abundances for estuaries and coastal embayments on state and/or regional maps. Depending on data availability, maps were produced at various scales: 1:24K, 1:80K, and 1:250K. For species relative abundances, these maps were be developed only for juveniles of estuarine species (Nelson et al. 1991) showing the highest juvenile relative abundance in any salinity zone by season for each estuary. These maps will eventually be provided to the Council as ArcView shape files with associated data for inclusion into the Councils GIS system.\n190\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 25.

Other areas of specific concern are barrier islands in each state, as these structures are vital to maintain estuarine conditions needed by larval and juvenile stages. Passes between barrier islands into estuaries also are very important, as the slow mixing of sea water and fresh water is generally regarded as being of prime importance in the productivity of any estuary. A rapid change may cause environmental stresses too great for many estuarine organisms to withstand.\nSeagrass beds or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) prevalent in the Chesapeake Bay and the sounds and bays of North Carolina and Florida are also critical areas for red drum, particularly for 1 and 2 year old fish (>750 mm or 29.5 in FL). Seagrass beds, shallow areas of estuarine rivers and mainland shorelines, are where many red drum reside during the summer. Based on a preliminary aerial survey in North Carolina there are approximately 200,000 acres of SAV distributed in Core Sound and eastern Pamlico Sound, making North Carolina second only to Florida in abundance of this type of fisheries habitat.\nThe states of South Carolina and Georgia lack seagrass beds; the preferred habitat of juveniles (<75mm) based on sampling efforts by Daniel (1988) in Charleston, South Carolina, may be high marsh areas with shell hash and mud bottoms. In South Carolina, smaller juveniles remain in the marsh system until they are around 150 mm, moving into the main creeks and river channels and lower harbor areas as they become larger. In addition, there is seasonal movement out of the marsh and into deep holes and creek channel adjoining the marsh system during the winter months. Therefore, the area of particular concern for early growth and development is seasonal and size dependant encompassing the entire estuarine system from the lower salinity portions of the river systems through the inlet mouth or lower harbor areas.\nThe various inlets, adjoining channels, sounds, and outer bars of ocean inlets are critical areas for spawning activity (see Figure 29 and Appendix S) as well as feeding and daily movements and may be affected by constant dredging, jettying or excessive boat traffic. Adult red drum spend a lot of time in these areas during spring and fall with large concentrations located near the least trafficked inlets.\n195\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 29. Sites of red drum and weakfish spawning aggregations identified in coastal North Carolina through acoutic sampling conducted by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (Louis Daniel, pers.comm. 1998).\n196\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.3 Snapper Grouper Complex 3.3.3.1 Description of the Species Complex.\nTen families of fishes containing 73 species are managed under the snapper grouper plan (Section 2.2). Their association with coral or hardbottom structure during at least part of their life cycle and their contribution to an interrelated reef fishery ecosystem are the primary criteria for inclusion within the snapper grouper plan (SAFMC, 1983). Phylogenetically, they are diverse and include representatives of two suborders of perciformes (Percoidei and Labroidei), as well as the order Tetraodontiformes. However, sixty-eight of these species are within eight percoid families. There is considerable variation in specific life history patterns and habitat use among the snapper grouper species complex. Seventeen of the 73 species in the FMP are overfished (SPR <30%) according to the most recent NMFS stock assessments and SAFMC SSC analyses. The overfished species include ten groupers, two snappers, two porgies, one grunt, one temperate bass, and one tilefish.\nSpace constraints in this document limit thorough characterizations of this diverse multispecies complex. To summarize some of the ecological variation among the more valuable species, short biological characterizations are provided below for 18 representative species from seven families. These include the serranid groupers (snowy grouper, yellowedge grouper, warsaw grouper, speckled hind, scamp, and jewfish), the percichthyid temperate basses (wreckfish), lutjanid snappers (gray snapper, mutton snapper, blackfin snapper, red snapper, silk snapper, and vermilion snapper), haemulid grunts (white grunt), sparid porgies (red porgy), carangid jacks (greater amberjack), and malacanthid tilefishes (golden tilefish and blueline tilefish). Seven of these species are overfished. Information on habitat use, biological attributes, and reproduction is provided for many of these and other species in Tables 19a, 20a, 21a, and 21b following the ELMR format used in Nelson et al., (1991).\nMore detailed information is available in the source document for the Snapper Grouper FMP (SAFMC, 1983b) and books summarizing the biology of many of these and co-occurring species, including Munro (1983), Ralston and Polovina (1987), Sale (1991), Claro (1994), and Arregu\u00edn-S\u00e1nchez (1996). In addition, many publications from areas under, or near, the Council's jurisdiction are available on individual species or species complexes (e.g., Matheson et al., 1986; Grimes et al., 1988; Cuellar et al., 1996; Ault et al., 1998) or specific habitat types (e.g., mangroves - Thayer et al. 1987; seagrasses - Sogard et al., 1987; Florida Keys coral reefs Bohnsack et al., 1987; Chiappone and Sluka, 1996; nearshore hard bottom - Lindeman and Snyder, in press; deep reefs - Parker and Mays, In press). Many additional summaries of the use of specific habitats by snapper grouper species are enclosed in the habitat characterizations in Section 3.0 of this document.\nGroupers (Serranidae): Snowy Grouper\nThe snowy grouper (Epinephelus niveatus ) is a demersal serranid distributed in the western Atlantic from NC and the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. It also occurs in the eastern Pacific including the Gulf of California, Mexico, and Panama (Fischer, 1978). Juveniles (about 400 mm (TL)) have been observed off NC in depths of 61 m ( Parker and Ross, 1986) where bottom water temperatures fluctuate from about 15.0o to 29.0oC. Adults occur to depths of about 180 m, and were common between 116 to 137 m off NC (Roe, 1976; Huntsman and Dixon, 1976; Parker and Ross, 1986), where the habitat contains irregularly sized boulders and ridges of bioeroded\n197\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nlimestone with vertical relief up to 10 m interspersed with sand, broken shell, and rock fragments.\nSnowy grouper live at least 27 years, reaching a weight of 29 kg (Moore and Labisky, 1984). Average lengths for fish aged 1 to 17 years are 210, 328, 404, 462, 513, 561, 604, 648, 686, 721, 762, 797, 833, 874, 899, 924, and 958 mm (Matheson and Huntsman, 1984). They feed mostly on crabs, fishes, and cephalopods (Bielsa and Labisky, 1987; Dodrill et al., 1993). Snowy grouper are protogynous hermaphrodites, changing from females to males as they grow older. Fish first reach sexual maturity when about 4 to 5 years old and 450 to 500 mm long (Moore and Labisky, 1984). Spawning occurs April through July, and eggs and larvae are pelagic. This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessment and SAFMC SSC analyses.\nYellowedge Grouper The yellowedge grouper (Epinephelus flavolimbatus) is a large (to 18 kg) grouper that\ninhabits hard bottom and rocky outcroppings in depths of 190 to 220m (Low and Ulrich, 1983). It ranges from offshore of NC along the continental shelf break to Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. It is much more abundant in the western Gulf of Mexico than in the Atlantic (Chester et al., 1984).\nYellowedge grouper live at least 15 years and grow to 1110 mm. Like their close relative, snowy grouper, yellowedge grouper are believed to be protogynous hermaphrodites. Sex reversal may take place over a wide range of sizes, but has usually occurred by the time a fish reaches 850 mm (Keener, 1984). Yellowedge grouper normally mature between ages five and six (450 to 469 mm). Spawning occurs from April to October with a September peak, and eggs and larvae are pelagic. Adults feed on bottom dwelling animals, including squid, octopus, crabs, eels, lizardfish, seahorses, scorpionfish, and searobins (Manooch and Raver, 1984).\nWarsaw Grouper The warsaw grouper (Epinephelus nigritus) is a large serranid distributed from NC to the\nFlorida Keys and Gulf of Mexico to the northern coast of South America. It inhabits irregular bottoms including steep cliffs, notches, and rocky ledges of the continental shelf break in depths of 76 to 219 m (Manooch and Mason, 1987).\nLittle is known about the reproduction of warsaw grouper but eggs and larvae are thought to be pelagic. Warsaw grouper live at least 41 years and reach lengths of over 2,300 mm and\n198\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nweights of at least 190 kg. Average lengths for fish aged 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 24 years are 330, 914, 1,194, 1,295, 1,397, and 1,473 mm (Manooch and Mason, 1987). Fishes and crustaceans are major foods (Manooch pers. obs.). This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessment and SAFMC SSC analyses.\nSpeckled Hind The speckled hind (Epinephelus drummondhayi) ranges from Bermuda and NC to FL,\nand throughout the Gulf of Mexico (Smith, 1971; Hoese and Moore, 1977). It inhabits high and low profile hard bottom in depths ranging from 27 to 122 m (Huntsman and Dixon, 1976; Parker, pers. obs.).\nPreliminary investigation indicates that speckled hind are protogynous hermaphrodites (Matheson, 1981). Most of the larger, older fish are males. Sexual maturity is reached in about 5 years (500 mm).\nSpeckled hind live more than 15 years and can weigh over 20 kg. Average total lengths for fish from NC and SC aged 1 to 15 years are 186, 317, 408, 475, 528, 572, 613,45, 678, 709, 739, 774, 804, 839, and 861 mm (Matheson and Huntsman, 1984). Speckled hind generally engulf their prey whole. The diet includes fishes, shrimp, crabs, squid, and octopus (Bullock and Smith, 1991). This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessment and SAFMC SSC analyses.\nScamp The scamp (Mycteroperca phenax) inhabits continental shelf waters from NC to FL and\nthroughout the Gulf of Mexico. The species has been observed over low to high profile rock outcroppings encrusted with soft corals, sponges, hydroids, and bryozoa in waters 20 to 100 m deep (Parker and Ross, 1986).\n199\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nScamp spawn from April through August with a peak in May and June (Matheson et al., 1986). They live at least 21 years and grow to 894 mm. Average total lengths (and weights) for fish aged 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 21 years are 216 mm (0.15 kg), 333 mm (0.54 kg), 414 mm (1.0 kg), 470 mm (1.4 kg), 516 mm (1.9 kg), 663 mm (3.9 kg), 770 mm (6.9 kg), 884 mm (8.9 kg), and, 894 mm (9.3 kg). Scamp feed mostly on fishes, such as round scad, Decapterus punctatus, tomtate, Haemulon aurolineatum, and vermilion snapper (Matheson et al., 1986).\nJewfish The jewfish (Epinephelus itajara) is found on both Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central\nAmerica (Smith, 1971). In the Atlantic, jewfish occur from Brazil throughout the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Bermuda, the Bahamas and Florida (Bohlke and Chaplin, 1968; Smith, 1971; Hoese and Moore, 1977; Robins and Ray, 1986).\nIn the South Atlantic, jewfish are more abundant off the Florida east coast and in the Florida Keys. Spawning aggregations have been observed in the past off Palm Beach, Florida but do not occur anymore. The occurrence of jewfish north of Florida is rare and the States of Georgia and South Carolina requested jewfish be protected within Special Management Zones around their artificial reefs. This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessments and SAFMC SSC analyses. The Council has since prohibited the harvest or possession of jewfish in the South Atlantic EEZ.\nJewfish are suspected to be protogynous hermaphrodites (born female and changing to male later in life), similar to other groupers. Smith (1971) found evidence of ova remnants in the gonad of a six foot male collected near Bimini, Bahamas. The size or age of sexual transition is unknown and it is possible that some males pass through an immature female stage and mature only as males (L. Bullock, FMRI, FDNR, personal communication). Also, many of the larger fish taken commercially have been females. The ongoing Florida Department of Natural Resources (FDNR) study of jewfish has found no transitional fish among those sampled from the commercial fishery. Thus, it is not conclusive whether jewfish are indeed protogynous hermaphrodites or gonochoristic (sexes separate).\nIn the eastern Gulf of Mexico, females with ripe ova have been found during July through October with August to mid-October apparently the period of peak reproductive activity (D. DeMaria, SAFMC Snapper Grouper Advisory Panel, personal communication). Spawning aggregations of jewfish have been observed in waters as shallow as 30-40 feet.\nIn the FDNR study, female jewfish sexually matured at about 50-inches total length (105 pounds in weight). The youngest sexually mature female sampled was ten years of age, assuming one annulus per year. No specific information on fecundity exists. The smallest\n200\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmature male was 43-inches total length, and the youngest sexually mature male was about five years old (L. Bullock, FMRI, FDNR, preliminary unpublished data).\nJewfish are long-lived and can attain a size of 700 pounds (Smith, 1971). Randall (1968) found fishes, hawksbill turtle, crabs, slipper lobster and most often spiny lobster in the stomachs of jewfish. Smith (1971) reported a large proportion of the jewfish's prey were crustaceans.\nAdult and juvenile jewfish inhabit shallow waters and reside around bottom features which provide cover and protection (e.g. shipwrecks, reefs, ledges, piers, bridges and mangrove lined shores) (Godcharles, personal communication; Hoese and Moore, 1977; Robins and Ray, 1986; Smith, 1971; Thompson and Munro, 1978). Juveniles have been found along bulkheads and bridges (Springer and Woodburn, 1960) and in upland canals in Tampa Bay (Lindall et al., 1975). The preferred habitat of adults is the high-relief ledges and wrecks further offshore (Smith, 1976). The habitat preferences of jewfish make them easily accessible to fishermen, and especially vulnerable to spearfishermen. Furthermore, their narrow habitat preference causes this species to be highly susceptible to hypothermia (Gilmore et al., 1978) and red tide (Smith, 1976) induced mortalities. Large numbers of these fish are reported to aggregate around isolated reefs, rock ledges and wrecks in 150 foot depths and less on the southwest and southeast Florida shelf during the spawning season (P. Colin and D. DeMaria, personal communication). Indeed, aggregations up to 24 fish in depths as shallow as 15 feet have been observed in Hobe Sound, Florida (W. Parks, personal communication).\n\"The jewfish's ecological role in Georgia's offshore live bottom communities is also unknown and subject to conjecture. Based on diver observations, however, it has been suggested that jewfish may slow sandwave inundation of low-relief or isolated outcrops that have been established as residences by this species. Besides maintaining an open substrate for invertebrates, these outcrops also support related live bottom fisheries, including scamp, black seabass, snapper and other reeffish. In light of the low occurrence of live bottoms off Georgia, this type of function could be important in maintaining some of the state's offshore live bottoms\" (D. Harris, personal communication).\nTemperate Basses (Percichthyidae): Wreckfish\nThe wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), has a wide geographic distribution but little is known of its biology and fisheries potential. Hardy (1978) reported the distribution of Polyprion americanus in the western Atlantic as extending from Grand Banks, Newfoundland to La Plata River, Argentina. The available literature consists primarily of occurrence records or behavioral observations (Roberts, 1977; Ryall and Hargrave, 1984; Schroeder, 1930), with limited life history data (Roberts, 1989). Wreckfish are pelagic for the first several years of their life (up to 30 cm length), often associated with floating debris (Roberts, 1989), the habit responsible for their common name. They grow to large size (100 kg weight, 2 m length), and are commercially fished in portions of their range (Roberts, 1989). The shallowest reported demersal populations of Polyprion in the western Atlantic were reported off Argentina in depths of 66-84 m (Menni and Lopez, 1979). The maximum reported depth for wreckfish is 1000 m (Lythgoe and Lythgoe, 1971). The presence of fishable concentrations of wreckfish in the northwestern Atlantic was unknown until 1987, when a fishery began to develop on the Blake Plateau, adjacent to South Carolina and Georgia.\nThe fishing grounds and known distribution of wreckfish comprise an area of the Blake Plateau of approximately 50-75 square nm, characterized by a rocky ridge system having a vertical relief of >50 m and a slope of >15 degrees. The depth range in this area is 450-600 m.\n201\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nThe substrates in areas of the Blake Plateau exhibiting significant relief are generally characterized as composed of manganese - phosphate pavements, phosphorite slabs and coral banks (Pratt and McFarlin, 1966: Stetson et al, 1979). Bottom samples obtained from commercial fishermen indicate that wreckfish concentrations occur primarily on the manganesephosphate bottoms. Prior observations from the research submersible, Johnson Sea-Link I, showed low densities of wreckfish associated with coral mounds or banks [C. A. Wenner (SCWMRD), personal communication]. There has been some exploratory efforts by commercial vessels but most of the fishing effort occurs on the initially discovered grounds of the Hoyt Hill area. This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessment and SAFMC SSC analyses.\nSnappers (Lutjanidae): Gray Snapper\nOne of the most commonly caught marine fishes in Florida, the gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) occurs in marine and estuarine waters from North Carolina and Bermuda through Brazil (Robins and Ray, 1986). Spawning activity occurs offshore and peaks during the summer and early fall (Grimes, 1987; Garc\u00eda-Cagide et al., 1994, Domeier et al., 1996). Eggs and larvae are planktonic and occur offshore (Bortone and Williams, 1986). Flexion of the caudal fin occurs at 4.2 mm (Richards and Saksena, 1980). Planktonic larval duration is estimated to range from at least 25 to 40 days, with a mean of 33 days postfertilization based on otolith microstructure (Lindeman et al., MSa). Settlement sizes range from approximately 10 to 20 mm (Starck, 1970). Larvae appear competent to settle at ages from approximately three to five weeks. The mean growth rate estimated for early juveniles is 0.92 mmd-1 (Lindeman et al., MSa). Maturity is reached at about 200 mm TL, probably during the third year (Starck, 1970). A variety of adult growth data are summarized in Claro and Garcia (1994). Based on literature reviews, Ault et al. (1998) estimated gray snapper reach a maximum size of .72 meters and a maximum age of 10 years.\nThe majority of western Atlantic snappers are easily distinguished as adults and larger juveniles. However, newly settled stages (<25 mm SL) of Lutjanus griseus, L. apodus, L. jocu, and L. cyanopterus can co-occur in shallow water, have essentially identical fin meristics, lack\n202\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\ndorsolateral spots, and can be difficult to distinguish. Diagnostic methods for these species and other snappers at settlement are summarized in Richards et al. (1994) and Lindeman (1997).\nJuvenile gray snapper are euryhaline and occur at salinities from 0-37 ppt (Tabb et al., 1961; Starck, 1970; Rutherford et al., 1983; Bortone and Williams, 1986). Exposure to freshwater pulses caused no mortality in laboratory experiments with juveniles (Serafy et al., 1997). Lower lethal temperature have been estimated at 11-14o C (Starck, 1970) and several authors report mortality at low water temperatures caused by freezes (Tabb and Manning, 1961; Starck, 1970; Gilmore et al., 1978). Gray snapper are carnivorous at all life stages. Juveniles primarily prey on crustaceans, but can also consume fish, mollusks and polychaetes (Starck, 1970; Hettler, 1989). Adults are typically nocturnal predators, consuming mostly fish, but also taking shrimp and crabs (Longley and Hildebrand, 1941; Starck and Davis, 1966; Randall, 1968; Starck, 1970; Moe, 1972). Adults may show seasonal spawning migrations (Starck, 1970; Domeier and Colin, 1997).\nIn contrast to most snapper species, there is a substantial literature on habitat use in juvenile stages of gray snapper. Most information is from south or central Florida. Starck (1970) summarized information available through the 1960s for the Florida Keys and concluded that settlement stages and early juveniles primarily used grassbeds before migrating to hard structure in deeper waters with growth. In the Florida Bay area, gray snappers have been examined indirectly or directly in various studies, including Odum and Heald (1972), Thayer et al. (1987), Sogard et al. (1987), Hettler (1989), Chester and Thayer (1989), and Rutherford et al. (1989). These studies found gray snapper to be the most abundant lutjanid in the northern and eastern areas of this complex estuary, with hundreds of turbid basins and limited flushing. In grassbeds of the Indian River Lagoon, gray snapper was the most frequently occurring and second most abundant snapper collected (Gilmore, 1988). Work in high-salinity, low-turbidity mangrove habitats in Cuba (Claro and Garc\u00eda-Arteaga, 1993) and Puerto Rico (Rooker and Dennis, 1991) also recorded gray snapper as the most abundant lutjanid.\nBased on reviews of 40 years of surveys, and new sampling, in the Biscayne Bay area, newly settled stages commonly occurred in grassbeds, were consistently absent from mangrove and hardbottom habitats, and were uncommon or rare from all habitats exceeding 5 m in depth (Lindeman et al., In press). Early juvenile stages (2.5-7 cm) were more widely distributed, particularly on the habitat scale, occurring among a variety of hard structures as well as mangroves and grassbeds. The absence of newly settled life stages from hardbottom and mangrove habitats may result from the older resident fauna and more concentrated predation pressures in these habitats (Lindeman, 1997).\nIn summary, early stages can occur in estuaries and shallow marine areas (Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928; Reid, 1954; Loftus and Kushlan, 1987; Bohlke and Chaplin, 1968; Randall, 1968; Starck, 1970; Chester and Thayer, 1989). Bottom types of high value include seagrass flats (Thalassia, Syringodium, and Halodule); soft marl bottoms, fine marl mud with shell and rock outcrops; mangrove roots; hardbottom structures; and shallow basins with seagrasses adjacent to mud banks (Bortone and Williams, 1986, Starck, 1968, Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928, Starck 1970, Gunter, 1957, Chester and Thayer 1989). Adults are primarily marine and utilize deeper waters than juveniles, but can occur in estuaries and rivers. Adults are euryhaline, ranging from 0-47 ppt waters (Croker, 1960, Hardy, 1978, Briggs, 1958) and have been reported from depths of 77 m (Rivas, 1970). Bottom types of high value for adults are diverse and include coral reefs and hardbottom offshore, ledges of channels, artificial structures, mangroves and grassbeds, alcyonarians, and sponges (Starck and Davis, 1966, Gunter, 1957, Hildebrand and\n203\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSchroeder, 1928, Kilby, 1955, Moe, 1972, Springer and Woodburn, 1960; Starck, 1970; Bohnsack et al., 1987).\nMutton Snapper A premier demersal fishery species, the mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), ranges from\nFlorida and Bermuda to Brazil (Robins and Ray, 1986). Unlike the gray snapper, mutton snapper are not appreciably present north of central Florida or in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Spawning activity occurs offshore and may peak during the summer and fall (Grimes, 1987; Garcia-Cagide et al., 1994). Sizeable aggregations can be formed during spawning (Domeier and Colin, 1997). Eggs and larvae are probably planktonic and occur offshore (Richards et al., 1994). Planktonic larval duration is estimated to range from at least 27 to 37 days, with a mean of 31 days postfertilization (Lindeman et al., MSa). Settlement sizes range from approximately 10 to 20 mm (Starck, 1970). The mean growth rate estimated for early juveniles is 0.68 mmd-1 for winter-spawned individuals (Lindeman et al., MSa). Adult growth data are summarized in Claro and Garcia (1994). Based on literature reviews, Ault et al. (1998) estimated that mutton snapper reach a maximum size of .94 meters and a maximum age of 14 years.\nMutton snapper are recorded from salinities of 4.5-37.3 ppt (Christensen 1965) and temperatures of 18.5-30o C (Roessler, 1970). Mortality from hypothermal stress has been documented at 6-13o C (Gilmore et al., 1978). Larvae and newly settled stages are presumed to be planktivorous and benthic invertebrate foragers, respectively. Large juveniles and adults feed predominately on a wide array of crustaceans and fishes, although gastropods and octopii may also be consumed (Randall 1967; Starck, 1970; Parrish 1987).\nIn contrast to the gray snapper, there is little literature on habitat use in early stages of nutton snapper. Eggs and larvae probably utilize water column habitats over the continental shelf, based on similar lutjanids (Grimes 1987; Leis 1987). Recruitment of early juveniles 10-25 mm SL to the Indian River Lagoon occurs principally from June to November; however, juveniles <20 mm SL have been captured in July, and October through January (Gilmore, unpubl data). From 1974 to 1977 the largest single collections of juveniles consistently occured in November, but the wide distribution of early juveniles through the summer, fall and winter indicates a prolonged spawning and recruitment period for southeast Florida mutton snapper populations (Gilmore, unpubl. data).\nNewly settled stages occur in seagrass meadows (10-15 mm SL at settlement, with size ranges of 10-200 mm SL, n = 250; Gilmore, unpubl. data) and generally use mangrove prop roots or adjacent shallow rock and coral reef formations as larger juveniles (>100 mm SL; Gilmore, unpubl. data). Christensen (1965) captured 297 juveniles, 15-176 mm SL in seagrass meadows at Jupiter Inlet in the southern terminous of the Indian River Lagoon, while Springer and McErlean (1962) captured 67 individuals 16-66 mm SL in nearshore seagrass meadows of the Florida Keys. Ocean inlet seagrass meadows are preferred habitat for mutton snapper juveniles in the Indian River Lagoon although they occurred at all seagrass stations from Sebastian Inlet to St. Lucie Inlet (Gilmore 1988; Gilmore unpublished data).\nAdults utilize a variety of deeper reef environments over reef, sand and mud substrates and can occur to depths of 100 m (Starck, 1970; Rivas, 1970; Gilmore 1977; Claro, 1981). Adult may make migrations to spawning sites (Domeier and Colin, 1997). Adults are generalized top predators on a variety of reef invertebrates and fishes, particularly slow-moving or sedentary benthic and epibenthic prey species. Feeding predominately takes place near the bottom during the day or night (Randall, 1968; Parrish, 1987).\n204\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nBlackfin Snapper The blackfin snapper (Lutjanus buccanella ) occupies shelf edge habitat from Cape\nHatteras, NC to the Caribbean Antilles, and in the Gulf of Mexico (B\u00f6hlke and Chaplin, 1993). While juveniles and subadults sometimes inhabit hard bottom at shallow depths (12 to 40 m), adult fish usually occur from 40 to 300 m (Rivas, 1970; Nagelkerken, 1981).\nMale fish grow larger (to 740 mm) than females but are less common (Boardman and Weiler, 1980). Adult fish more commonly reach 500 mm on a diet of fish and crustaceans (Nagelkerken, 1981).\nRed Snapper The red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) ranges from Cape Hatteras, NC to FL and\nthroughout the Gulf of Mexico. It is found over rocky bottom at depths from 10 to 190 m and feeds on fishes and invertebrates, i.e. shrimp, cephalopods, and worms (Fischer, 1978).\nRed snapper mature after 3 years (Bradley and Bryan, 1975) and spawn throughout the warmer months. Eggs and larvae are pelagic. Red snapper lives at least 16 years and grow to 1,025 mm. Average total lengths for fish aged 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 15 are 224, 379, 453, 536, 577, 845, and 1,025 mm (Nelson and Manooch, 1982).\nSilk Snapper The silk snapper (Lutjanus vivanus) ranges from Cape Hatteras, NC to Brazil and in the\nNorthern Gulf of Mexico along the continental shelf edge, 64 to 242 m in depth (B\u00f6hlke and Chaplin, 1993). This shelf edge habitat consists of algal limestone cliffs and ledges interspersed with shell hash and sandstone (Grimes, 1976).\nYoung adult and juvenile fish occupy shallower depths than adult fish, to as shallow as 12 m where preferred bottom type occurs (Nagelkerken, 1981). Fish and crustaceans make up the majority of the diet. Silk snapper reach sexual maturity by 500 to 555 mm and grow to 750\n205\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmm. Thought to travel in loose schools, silk snapper aggregate year round for spawning with apparent peaks in July through September and October through December. Female fish outnumber males (Boardman and Weiler, 1980). Vermilion Snapper\nThe vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) occurs over rough bottom from Bermuda and NC to Brazil, including the West Indies (Bohlke and Chaplin, 1993). Their diet consists mostly of small pelagic crustacea (ostracods, copepods, stomatopods, amphipods, shrimp, and crabs), cephalopods, pelagic gastropods, and small fish (Dixon, 1975; Grimes, 1979).\nVermilion snapper mature in 3 to 4 years, and spawn April through September off NC (Grimes, 1976) and year around off Puerto Rico (Boardman and Weiler, 1980). Ovaries contain 100 thousand to 1.8 million eggs (Grimes, 1976). Eggs and larvae are pelagic. Vermilion snapper live at least 10 years and grow to 618 mm (Grimes, 1978). This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessments and SAFMC SSC analyses.\nPorgies (Sparidae): Red Porgy\nIn the western Atlantic the red porgy (Pagrus pagrus) occurs from NC to Argentina over rough bottom at depths from 18 to 280 m (Murray and Hjort, 1912), but has not been reported from the Caribbean (Manooch and Huntsman, 1977). Red porgy are protogynous hermaphrodites; most fish longer than 457 mm are males. Females mature in 2 to 4 years and may spawn 47,000 to 500,000 eggs.\nSpawning occurs from January through April and eggs and larvae are pelagic (Manooch, 1975). Red porgy live up to 15 years. Average lengths for ages 1 to 12 years are 238, 290, 341, 382, 419, 451, 483, 505, 527, 543, 558 and 604 mm. The red porgy feeds on crabs, snails, worms, sea urchins, and occasionally small fishes such as round scad and tomtate (Manooch, 1977). This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessments and SAFMC SSC analyses.\n206\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nGrunts (Haemulidae): White Grunt\nThe white grunt (Haemulon plumieri) ranges from North Carolina to Brazil. Eggs and early larvae are pelagic (Johnson, 1978). Juveniles and adults are found from the shore to at least 35 m (Fischer, 1978), occupying a variety of habitats including reefs and hardbottom, grass flats, and mangrove habitats (Gilmore, 1977; Darcy, 1983). They are often found individually or in small groups, but can also form large schools over reefs and gorgonians, particularly during the day (Longley and Hildebrand, 1941; Gilmore, 1977; Darcy, 1983; Christensen, 1965). Spawning occurs over much of the year with one or more peaks in warmer months (GarciaCagide, 1994).\nLarvae reared in the laboratory grew at a rate of 0.32 mm/d (Saksena and Richards, 1975). Otolith increment deposition has been validated as daily and the mean growth rate of field-collected early juveniles has been estimated at 0.38 mm/d (Lindeman et al., MSa). Adults tagged on the Florida west coast showed a growth rate ranging from 1.4 to 3.6 mm/month (Moe 1966). Maximum length is estimated at 450 to 460 mm (Hoese and Moore, 1977; Robins et al., 1986; Evermann and Marsh 1902; Breder, 1948).\nWhite grunt are fished commercially and recreationally throughout their range (Manooch, 1976; Fernando, 1966). They are important in energy exchange between reef and seagrass communities because of nocturnal foraging migrations (Darcy, 1983). Newly settled stages feed on plankton directly from the water column during the day (Ogden and Ehrlich, 1977). Adults are generalized carnivores which feed mainly on benthic invertebrates (Manooch, 1976). These include echinoderms, polychaetes, majid crabs, alpheid shrimp, isopods, other shrimp, crabs, and small fish (Bebe and Tee-Van, 1928; Davis, 1967; Fischer, 1978; Darcy, 1983). Because of their abundance, they are probably important prey for many larger species of groupers and snappers (Darcy, 1983).\nJacks (Carangidae): Greater Amberjack\nThe greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) occurs in the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia and Bermuda to Brazil, including the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico (Fischer, 1978). Greater amberjack probably spawn year around but are reproductively most active from March through June (Burch, 1979). Spawning concentrations occur in southeast FL and the Keys.\nThe relatively new (since 1985) commercial fishery, especially that conducted by divers with spearguns, focuses on these aggregations. Greater amberjack have been aged to 17 years; they reach a weight of at least 30.5 kg and a length (FL) of 1,552 mm (Manooch and Potts, in press). Average lengths for fish aged 1 to 10 years are 407, 643, 908, 1000, 1094, 1169, 1218, 1333, 1397, and 1435 mm (Burch, 1979). Amberjacks are voracious feeders; major foods are fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Manooch and Haimovici, 1983).\n207\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTilefishes (Malacanthidae): Golden Tilefish\nThe golden tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps ) is a demersal malacanthid species that inhabits the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope along the entire east coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico south to Venezuela. It is a bottom dweller, living in burrows in clay substrate at depths from 76 to 457 m (Freeman and Turner, 1977) in water temperatures from 9 to 14%C (Grimes et al., 1986).\nFifty percent of males mature by age 5 (450 mm) while 50% of females mature by age 6 (500 mm) (Erickson and Grossman, 1986). Females spawn 1 to 10 million eggs, and spawn fractionally from March to November (Grimes et al., 1988). Golden tilefish live at least 33 years and mean sizes for fish aged 5, l0, l5, 20, 25 and 30 years are 471, 554, 689, 790, 883 and 852 mm (Harris and Grossman, 1985). Adult tilefish feed on fish, crabs, shrimp, squid, worms, sea cucumbers, anemones, tunicates, and sea urchins (Freeman and Turner, 1977). This species is considered overfished in the most recent NMFS stock assessment and SAFMC SSC analyses.\nBlueline Tilefish The blueline tilefish (Caulolatilus microps) occurs from Cape Charles, VA to the\nCampeche Banks, Mexico in water depths between 68 and 236m, but is found principally south of Cape Hatteras (Dooley, 1978). The species frequents irregular bottom comprised of troughs and terraces inter-mingled with sand, mud, or shell hash bottom along the continental shelf break. This habitat is commonly shared with some of the deep water snappers and groupers, especially snowy grouper. Blueline tilefish have been observed hovering near and entering burrows under rocks (Parker and Ross, 1986). Water temperatures typically range from 15 to 23 oC (Ross, 1978). These tilefish are epibenthic browsers, often feeding upon crabs, shrimps, snails, worms, sea urchins, and fish (Ross, 1982; Bielsa and Labisky, 1987).\nLong lived and slow growing, blueline tilefish may attain 820 mm in 17 years (Ross, 1978; Ross and Huntsman, 1982; Labisky et al., 1983). They commonly reach 150 mm by the end of year one. Labisky et al. (1983) reported average lengths for age 1-15 fish of 165, 279, 358, 414, 464, 505, 544, 576, 607, 632, 655, 676, 693, 709, and 726 mm respectively.\n208\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSome females mature at age 1, all are mature by age 6. Large females spawn up to 4 million pelagic eggs between April and September, with peak spawning in May and September (Ross and Merriner, 1982). Early researchers believed that blueline tilefish might be protogynous hermaphrodites; however, a recent study indicates normal sexual dimorphism (Labisky et al., 1983).\n3.3.3.2 Distribution and Use of Inshore/Estuarine Habitat. Snapper grouper species utilize both pelagic and benthic habitats during their life cycle.\nPlanktonic larval stages live in the water column and feed on zooplankton. Juveniles and adults are typically demersal and usually associate with hard structures on the continental shelf that have moderate to high relief; i.e., coral reefs, artificial reefs, rocky hard-bottom substrates, ledges and caves, sloping soft-bottom areas, and limestone outcroppings. More detail on these habitat types is found in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. However, juveniles of some species, such as Lutjanus analis, L. griseus, L. jocu, L. synagris, Ocyurus chrysurus, Epinephelus itajara, E. morio, Mycteroperca microlepis , M. venenosa, C. faber, and L.maximus may occur in inshore seagrass beds, mangrove estuaries, lagoons, and bay systems. In many species, various combinations of these habitats may be utilized during diurnal feeding migrations or seasonal shifts in cross-shelf distributions.\nNOAA's Estuarine Living Marine Resource Program (ELMR) has compiled regional information on the use of estuarine habitats by select marine fish and invertebrates. A report prepared through the ELMR program (NOAA 1991b) and revised information (NOAA 1998), provided to the Council during the Habitat Plan development process, summarizes known spatial and temporal distributions and relative abundances of fish and invertebrates using southeast estuarine habitats. Twenty southeast estuaries selected from the National Estuarine Inventory (NOAA 1985) are included in an analysis based on a review of published and unpublished literature and expert consultations.\nDetailed information on the distribution and seasonal use of estuarine habitat by gray snapper exists in the NOAA ELMR program. This information emphasizes the importance and essential nature of estuarine habitats to gray snapper. Since it is the only estuarine dependant species under the Snapper Grouper FMP in the ELMR data set, it is used here as a proxy for other estuarine dependent snapper grouper species. As information is compiled on other estuarine dependent species, such as gag, spatial coverages of juvenile distribution and use of inshore habitat essential to the species will be spatially portrayed on maps. Figures 30-32 present a representative sample of the distibution maps for juvenile gray snapper. The remainder of the coverages and additional information on species and habitat distribution are available over the Internet on the Council web page under the habitat homepage (www.safmc.noaa.gov). These maps portray salinity and relative abundances for estuaries and coastal embayments on state and/or regional maps. Depending on data availability, maps were produced at various scales: 1:24K, 1:80K, and 1:250K. These maps will eventually be provided to the Council as ArcView shape files with associated data for inclusion into the Council's GIS system.\n209\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.3.3 Offshore Habitat 3.3.3.3.1 Distribution and Use of Offshore Habitat\nThe principal snapper grouper fishing areas are located in live bottom and shelf-edge habitats. Temperatures range from 11\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 C over the continental shelf and shelf-edge due to the proximity of the Gulf Stream, with lower shelf habitat temperatures varying from 11\u00b0 to 14\u00b0 C. Depths range from 54 to 90 feet or greater for live-bottom habitats, 180 to 360 feet for the shelf-edge habitat, and from 360 to 600 feet for the lower-shelf habitat.\nThe exact extent and distribution of productive snapper grouper habitat on the continental shelf north of Cape Canaveral is unknown. Current data suggest that from 3 to 30 percent of the shelf is suitable bottom. These hard, live-bottom habitats may be low relief areas supporting sparse to moderate growth of sessile invertebrates, moderate relief reefs from 1.6 to 6.6 feet, or high relief ridges at or near the shelf break consisting of outcrops of rock that are heavily encrusted with sessile invertebrates such as sponges and sea fans. Live-bottom habitat is scattered irregularly over most of the shelf north of Cape Canaveral, but is most abundant off northeastern Florida. South of Cape Canaveral the continental shelf narrows from 35 to 10 mi and less off the southeast coast of Florida and the Florida Keys. The lack of a large shelf area, presence of extensive, rugged living fossil coral reefs, and dominance of a tropical Caribbean fauna are distinctive characteristics.\nRock outcroppings occur throughout the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras, NC to Key West, FL (MacIntyre and Milliman, 1970; Miller and Richards, 1979; Parker et al., 1983). Generally, the outcroppings are composed of bioeroded limestone and carbonate sandstone (Newton et al., 1971) and exhibit vertical relief ranging from <0.5 to over 10 m. Ledge systems formed by rock outcrops and piles of irregularly sized boulders are common. Parker et al. (1983) estimated that 24% (9,443 km2) of the area between the 27 and 101 m isobaths from Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral is reef habitat. Although the area of bottom between 100 and 300 m depths from Cape Hatteras to Key West is small relative to the shelf as a whole, it constitutes prime reef fish habitat according to fishermen and probably contributes significantly to the total amount of reef habitat.\nMan-made artificial reefs are also utilized to attract fish and increase fish harvests. Research on man-made reefs is limited and opinions differ as to whether or not artificial structures actually promote an increase of biomass or merely concentrate fishes by attracting them from nearby natural areas.\nThe distribution of coral and live hard bottom habitat as presented in the SEAMAP Bottom Mapping Project is a proxy for the distribution of the species within the snapper grouper complex. The methodology used to determine hard bottom habitat relied on the identification of reef obligate species including members of the snapper grouper complex. ArcView maps were prepared for the four-state project by FMRI (FDEP) showing the best available information on the distribution of hard bottom habitat in the south Atlantic region. The maps which consolidate known distribution of coral, hard/live bottom and artificial reefs as hard bottom are included in Appendix E. These maps are also available over the Internet on the Council web page under the habitat homepage (www.safmc.noaa.gov). General snapper grouper species distribution maps are available for black sea bass and red porgy (Figures 34a and 34b).\n210\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 30.

Black sea bass distribution in the South Atlantic region (Adapted from NOAA 1980 and NOAA 1998).\n216\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nAdditional information on managed species use of offshore fish habitat was generated cooperatively by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, NOAA/Biogeographic Characterization Branch, and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. Plots of the spatial distribution of offshore species were generated from the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction Program (MARMAP) data (Figures 35-41) .\nThis fishery-independent survey program has been collecting data in the South Atlantic Bight region since 1973. The program began 25 years ago as an ichthyoplankton and groundfish survey of shelf and upper slope waters from Cape Fear to Cape Canaveral, however, since 1978, efforts of the South Carolina MARMAP program have concentrated on fishery-independent assessments of reef fish abundance and life history. The spatial distribution of sampling effort has varied considerably by gear type. Traps, which have constituted the bulk of the sampling effort (n=7458), were deployed randomly on confirmed hard bottom habitat during 1979-1997. Longline sampling (n=445) has usually been restricted to the deepest regions in the sampling area. Sampling strategy for trawls (n=2249) varied during 1973-1987. From 1973-winter 1977, a stratified random sampling strategy was employed. During summer 1977 to 1980, trawling was conducted over sand bottom habitat along offshore transects. From 1978 to 1987, a trawl survey targetted only live bottom areas at known hard bottom locations. MARMAP also conducted a trawl survey in 1982 to 1983 and 1985-1987 at depths < 18 m. Sampling effort with the different gear types varied seasonally, increasing during spring Months (n=205) to a peak in June (n=2301) and then declining by October (n=454) through the winter months.\nMaps portraying the distribution of offshore species were created with this temporal and spatial variability in fishing effort in mind (Figures 36-42). The marine species EFH products requested by the SAFMC were catch-density plots. No attempt was made to interpret seasonal or habitat-specific catch distributions for individual species due to the low number of observations for many species and the sampling bias towards summer months and hard bottom habitat. Therefore, catch data for each species were pooled across all years, months, and gear types for each species and then plotted against regional bathymetry. Catch distributions for each species are a function of spatio-temporal distribution of sampling effort for each gear and susceptibility of individual species to each gear. Therefore, each plot should not be interpreted as a comprehensive portrayal of an individual species' distribution. Certainly, many of the species presented here exhibit seasonal trends in abundance while others are more residential (Grimes et al. 1982; Chester et al., 1984; Sedberry and Van Dolah, 1984; Wenner and Sedberry, 1989). Instead, the plots should be considered as point confirmation of the presence of each species within the scope of the sampling program. As importantly, the plots identify the occurrence of the snapper grouper complex over hard bottom habitats. These plots, in combination with the hard bottom habitat distributions presented in Appendix E, can be employed as proxies for offshore snapper grouper complex distributions in the south Atlantic region.\n217\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 35.

The five species that make up over 97% of the catch by weight are tilefish, Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps, snowy grouper, Epinephelus niveatus, blueline tilefish, Caulolatilus microps, warsaw grouper, Epinephelus nigritus, and yellowedge grouper, E. flavolimbatus. Less is known of the life histories of deep reef fishes than for any other group supporting a major fishery. The depth and strong currents, often to 3 knots, preclude observations by SCUBA divers and make submersible observations difficult. Distance from shore of these open ocean habitats and usually inclement weather make incidental and anecdotal observations and reports about the fish and their habitat extremely rare. Although hook and line and longline gear have been used successfully to capture some deepwater reef fishes, little is known about rare or hard to catch species.\nOverall, the deep reef fish community probably contains less than 100 species. From submersible operations off NC, Parker and Ross (1986) observed 34 species of deepwater (98 to 152 m) reef fishes representing 17 families and described the behavior of species from eight families. Gutherz et al. (1995) observed 27 species of deepwater (185 to 220 m) reef fishes from submersibles off South Carolina in 1982. There were obvious differences (probably depth related) in abundance of the most common species of fish observed from the submersible from North Carolina to South Carolina. Parker and Mays (In press) present life history summaries including species composition, distribution, preferred habitat, spawning periodicity, and associated fishes and benthos for 14 species.\nObservations during three submersible dives in May 1992 on the abundance and distribution of deepwater reef fishes important to fisheries were compared to the above surveys. At the Big Rock or Charleston Lumps there were apparent increases in abundance (fish/ha) over time of scamp, Mycteroperca phenax (5 to 45), blueline tilefish (<1 to 14), and southern hake, Urophycis floridana (<1 to >23). Also in the Charleston Bump area, there was an apparent decrease in snowy grouper (9 to 2). Although the recent data are sparse, they show that at least seven of nine economically important species, previously observed from submersibles, have survived intense fishing pressure at these locations.\nTwenty active or retired fishermen (headboat operators and commercial fishermen who employed vertical hook and line or longline gear) from Cape Hatteras, NC to Key West, FL described the deep reef fishery in their areas. According to fishermen, coast wide stocks (usually at depths between 100 and 175 m) of yellowedge grouper, Epinephelus flavolimbatus, warsaw grouper, bigeye, and barrelfish were depleted before snowy grouper. Snowy grouper were most often caught between 110 and 155 m, but were sometimes taken from shallow water (<30 m) as they spawned off the Florida Keys. Tilefish usually produced monospecific catches from deeper waters, 175 to 300 m. Three areas have been unproductive for tilefish: the areas from 1) just below Cape Hatteras, NC to Cape Romain, SC, 2) Bellville, GA to St. Augustine, FL, and 3) Marathon, FL to Key West, FL. Some fishermen believe this is because they have not yet determined when tilefish migrate through these areas, although tagging studies and submersible observations of tilefish and their burrows do not give evidence of migration (Grimes et al., 1983). There is little commercial fishing by United States fishermen for deepwater species between Ft. Pierce and Homestead, FL because the area is congested with domestic recreational and Bahamian (commercial and recreational) fishermen. Florida fishermen feared revealing \"secrets\" and were particularly vague about descriptions of the fishery in their area.\n225\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 42. Deep Reef Fish Habitat (Source: Parker and Mays, In press). 226\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.3.3.3 Spawning Habitats of Snapper Grouper Species Along with recruitment, spawning is a key demographic attribute of reef fish species.\nThe protection of spawning habitats is an unquestionably logical component of managing essential fish habitat. Specific information on the spawning sites and component habitats for snapper grouper species is limited. Most studies of reef fish reproduction have focused on the seasonality of spawning using fishery-dependent data. In-situ information on the habitat characteristics of key spawning areas is uncommon. However, limited information can be obtained for individual species from reviews of spawning information by Thresher (1984), Grimes (1987), Colin and Clavijo (1988), Garcia-Cagide et al. (1994) and Domeier and Colin (1997).\nTemporal patterns of spawning are more documented for snapper grouper species than spatial patterns. Several temporal patterns are present: a) spawning is concentrated over one or two winter months (as in many groupers); b) spawning occurs at low levels year-round with one or two peaks in warmer months; c) spawning occurs year-round with more than two significant peaks. In addition, spawning can occur in pairs or in various types of aggregations. Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that many species of grouper and snapper can form sizeable spawning aggregations (Domeier and Colin, 1997). However, this pattern may not be universal among all of the species within the snapper grouper management unit. In fact, some species that spawn in aggregations may also pair-spawn under certain conditions.\nThe site specificity of spawning aggregations may be high, on the scale of decades (Colin and Clavijo, 1988; Garcia-Cagide et al., 1994). Many explanations of the choice of spawning sites have focused on the avoidance of egg predation. This assumes that the upward rush culminating the spawning act is executed at structural features positioned in a manner favorable for immediate offshore advection of eggs away from predators on the reef (Johannes, 1978). However, this hypothesis suffers from limited (Shapiro et al., 1988) and sometimes contradictory (e.g., Appeldoorn et al., 1994) experimental evaluation.\nDue to the intense constraints on studying spawning and associated habitats (e.g., gathering in situ behavioral data in deep waters during dusk or night), determining the combinations of key habitat attributes that favor spawning will be a protracted process for many species. However, this need not impede proactive management. Spawning sites within SAFMC jurisdiction have been identified for certain grouper and snapper species (Gilmore and Jones, 1992; Domeier and Colin, 1997). Available information for other species suggests that shelf edge environments of moderate to high structural relief are sites of spawning for many species, perhaps through the entire southeastern U. S. region. In addition, shallow areas may also be spawning sites for some snapper grouper species (see jewfish summary in Section 3.3.3.1). As new information becomes available, maps of all documented spawning areas will be created for the key species of the snapper grouper complex. In addition to pinpointing existing spawning information, this approach will allow the assessment of the spawning value of similar habitat types within SAFMC jurisdiction.\n3.3.3.4 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements Essential fish habitat for snapper-grouper species includes coral reefs, live/hard bottom,\nsubmerged aquatic vegetation, artificial reefs and medium to high profile outcroppings on and around the shelf break zone from shore to at least 600 feet (but to at least 2000 feet for wreckfish) where the annual water temperature range is sufficiently warm to maintain adult populations of members of this largely tropical complex. EFH includes the spawning area in the\n227\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nwater column above the adult habitat and the additional pelagic environment, including Sargassum, required for larval survival and growth up to and including settlement. In addition the Gulf Stream is an essential fish habitat because it provides a mechanism to disperse snapper grouper larvae.\nFor specific life stages of estuarine dependent and nearshore snapper-grouper species, essential fish habitat includes areas inshore of the 100-foot contour, such as attached macroalgae; submerged rooted vascular plants (seagrasses); estuarine emergent vegetated wetlands (saltmarshes, brackish marsh); tidal creeks; estuarine scrub/shrub (mangrove fringe); oyster reefs and shell banks; unconsolidated bottom (soft sediments); artificial reefs; and coral reefs and live/hard bottom.\n3.3.3.5 Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for the Snapper Grouper Species Complex\nAreas which meet the criteria for essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs) for species in the snapper-grouper management unit include medium to high profile offshore hard bottoms where spawning normally occurs; localities of known or likely periodic spawning aggregations; nearshore hard bottom areas; The Point, The Ten Fathom Ledge, and Big Rock (North Carolina); The Charleston Bump (South Carolina); mangrove habitat; seagrass habitat; oyster/shell habitat; all coastal inlets; all state-designated nursery habitats of particular importance to snapper grouper (e.g., Primary and Secondary Nursery Areas designated in North Carolina); pelagic and benthic Sargassum; Hoyt Hills for wreckfish; the Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern; all hermatypic coral habitats and reefs; manganese outcroppings on the Blake Plateau; and Council-designated Artificial Reef Special Management Zones (SMZs).\nTherefore, areas which meet the criteria for designating essential fish habitat - habitat areas of particular concern include habitats required during each life stage (egg, larval, postlarval, juvenile, and adult stages.)\n3.3.4 Coastal Migratory Pelagics 3.3.4.1 Description of the Species and Distribution\nThe habitat of adults in the coastal pelagic management unit, except dolphin, is the coastal waters out to the edge of the continental shelf in the Atlantic Ocean. Dolphin is an oceanic species that may be found on the shelf. Within the area, the occurrence of these species is governed by temperature and salinity. All species are seldom found in water temperatures less than 20\u00b0 C. Salinity preference varies, but these species generally prefer high salinity. Dolphin are seldom found in waters with salinity less than 36 ppt. The scombrids prefer high salinities, but less than 36 ppt. Salinity prefence of little tunny and cobia is not well defined. The larval habitat of all species in the coastal pelagic management unit is the water column. Within the spawning area, eggs and larvae are concentrated in the surface waters.\nKing Mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla\n228\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nEstuaries are important habitats for most prey species of coastal pelagics. For this reason, estuarine habitats and factors which affect them should be considered as part of the coastal pelagic management unit. All the coastal pelagic species, except dolphin, move from one area to another and seek prey whatever local resources happen to be abundant. Many of the prey species of the coastal pelagics are estuarine-dependant in that they spend all or a portion of their lives in estuaries. Accordingly, the coastal pelagic species, by virtue of their food source, are to some degree also dependant upon estuaries and, therefore, can be expected to be detrimentally affected if the productive capabilities of estuaries are greatly degraded.\n3.3.4.2 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements Essential fish habitat for coastal migratory pelagic species includes sandy shoals of capes\nand offshore bars, high profile rocky bottom and barrier island ocean-side waters, from the surf to the shelf break zone, but from the Gulf stream shoreward, including Sargassum. In addition, all coastal inlets, all state-designated nursery habitats of particular importance to coastal migratory pelagics (for example, in North Carolina this would include all Primary Nursery Areas and all Secondary Nursery Areas).\nFor Cobia essential fish habitat also includes high salinity bays, estuaries, and seagrass habitat. In addition, the Gulf Stream is an essential fish habitat because it provides a mechanism to disperse coastal migratory pelagic larvae.\nFor king and Spanish mackerel and cobia, essential fish habitat occurs in the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic Bights.\nSpatial and Temporal Distribution and Relative Abundance of Spanish Mackerel in Estuarine Habitat\nNOAA's Estuarine Living Marine Resource Program (ELMR), through a joint effort of National Ocean Service and NMFS, conducts regional compilations of information on the use of estuarine habitat by select marine fish and invertebrates. A report prepared through the ELMR program (NOAA 1991b) and revised information (NOAA 1998), provided the Council during the Habitat Plan development process, present known spatial and temporal distribution and relative abundance of fish and invertebrates using southeast estuarine habitats. Twenty southeast estuaries selected from the National Estuarine Inventory (NOAA 1985) are included in the analysis which resulted from a review of published and unpublished literature and personal consultations. The resultant information emphasizes the importance and essential nature of estuarine habitat to all life stages of spanish mackerel.\nRegional salinity and relative abundance maps for use in determining EFH for two estuarine dependant coastal migratory pelagic species included in the data, Spanish mackerel and Cobia. These map coverages were prepared for the Council by NOAA SEA Division (Appendix F). Figures 43-46 present a representative sample of the distibution maps for juvenile Spanish mackerel. The remainder of the coverages and additional information on species and habitat distribution are available over the Internet on the Council web page under the habitat homepage (www.safmc.noaa.gov). These maps portray salinity and species relative abundances for estuaries and coastal embayments on state and/or regional maps. Depending on data availability, maps were produced at various scales: 1:24K, 1:80K, and 1:250K. For species relative abundances, these maps were developed only for juveniles of estuarine species (Nelson et al. 1991) showing the highest juvenile relative abundance in any salinity zone by season for each estuary. These maps will eventually be provided to the Council as ArcView shape files with associated data for inclusion into the Council's GIS system.\n229\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSpatial and Temporal Distribution and Relative Abundance of Cobia in Estuarine Habitat Regional salinity and relative abundance maps were developed to aid the Council in\ndetermining EFH for Cobia. These map coverages were prepared for the Council by NOAA SEA Division (Appendix F). Figures 47- 50 present a representative sample of the distibution maps for juvenile Cobia. The remainder of the coverages and additional information on species and habitat distribution are available over the Internet on the Council web page under the habitat homepage (www.safmc.noaa.gov).

These maps will eventually be provided to the Council as ArcView shape files with associated data for inclusion into the Councils GIS system.\nDolphin, Coryphaena hippurus\nSee Section 3.2.3.1.1 for a detailed description of Sargassum as essential fish habitat for dolphin. Dolphin are fast aggressive predators that feed on actively swimming fish (MMS 1990).\nFish are the most important items in the diet, becoming increasingly important as dolphin grow from 300 mm (12 in) to 1,500 mm (59 in). Flyingfish are important in the diet of adult common dolphin. Flyingfishes appear to be especially important in the diet of large dolphin; fish and invertebrates on Sargassum appers to be most important to small female dolphin. In general, many dolphin prey are associated with Sargassum, and most of the fishes that were found associated with Sargassum in the Florida Current are eaten by dolphin (MMS 1990). Dolphin probably spend a relatively large amount of time feeding on small animals associated with Sargassum because, although adapted for fast short-range pursuit, dolphin lack the adaptation of fishes such as tunas for long-range pursuit of prey. Dolphin in the Gulf Stream ate 32 species of fishes. Additional food included the crab Portunis sayi (common in Sargassum), shrimp, and cephalopods. Although Sargassum appears frequently in dolphin stomachs, it is probably ingested incidentally with assiciated small fishes and crustaceans. Off Cape Hatteras, most fish in the diet were those typically associated with Sargassum. The most frequently found genera wre Hippocampus (seahorse), Monacanthus (filefish), and Aluterus (filefish). Other prey of dolphin include balistids and fast moving fishes such as Spanish mackerel and carangids, and at night perhaps mesopelagic fishes. The presence of other smaller dolphins in the diet indicates cannibalism, and smaller dolphin may find shelter in Sargassum from predators, including their own species (MMS 1990).\n3.3.4.3 Essential Fish Habitat - Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for Coastal Migratory Pelagics\nAreas which meet the criteria for essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs) include sandy shoals of Cape Lookout, Cape Fear, and Cape Hatteras from shore\n230\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFigure 43.

Estuaries meeting this criteria for Spanish mackerel include Bogue Sound and New River, North Carolina; Bogue Sound, North Carolina (Adults May-September salinity >30 ppt); and New River, North Carolina (Adults May-October salinity >30 ppt). For Cobia they include Broad River, South Carolina; and Broad River, South Carolina (Adults & juveniles May-July salinity >25ppt).\nThese areas include spawning grounds and habitats where eggs and larvae develop. In addition, the estuarine habitats also provide prey species along migration pathways.\n3.3.5 Golden Crab 3.3.5.1 Description of the Species and Distribution\nThe golden crab, Chaceon fenneri, is a large gold or buff colored species inhabiting the continental slope of Bermuda (Luckhurst, 1986; Manning and Holthuis, 1986) and the southeastern United States from off Chesapeake Bay (Schroeder, 1959), south through the Straits of Florida and into the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Manning and Holthuis, 1984, 1986; Otwell et al., 1984; Wenner et al., 1987, Erdman 1990).\nReported depth distributions of C. fenneri range from 205 m off the Dry Tortugas (Manning and Holthuis, 1984) to 1007 m off Bermuda (Manning and Holthuis, 1986). Size of males examined range from 34 to 139 mm carapace length (CL) and females range from 39 to 118 mm CL. Ovigerous females have been reported during September, October and November, and range in size from 91 to 118 mm CL (Manning and Holthuis, 1984, 1986).\"\nLarval Distribution & Recruitment The following text is from Lockhart et al. (1990): \"The distribution patterns of Chaceon fenneri and possibly C. quinquedens in the eastern\nGulf of Mexico suggest a causal role for the Loop Current System (Maul 1977) in basic life history adaptations. Female distribution within these species' geographic ranges and the timing of larval release supports this hypothesis. Ours was the first study to discover female golden crabs in any significant numbers and was also the first to find a major population of female red crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. Both of these concentrations of females were seemingly shifted counter-current to the Loop Current circulation. We hypothesize that this counter-current shift is linked to larval release and transport, and serves to maximize recruitment into the parent population by minimizing risk of larval flushing.\n239\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSimilar counter-current shifts of other female decapods have been reported or hypothesized. In the Gulf of Mexico, spawning female blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) have been hypothesized to undergo a late summer spawning migration in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico that is counter to the Loop Current system (Oesterling and Adams 1979). Female western rock lobsters (Panulirus cygnus) are hypothesized to undergo migration to favor recruitment back into the parent population (Phillips et al. 1979). Kelly et al. (1982) proposed that only those red crab larvae (Chaceon quinquedens) released up-current in the species' range will recruit back into the parent population. Melville-Smith (1987a, 1987b, 1987c) in a tagging study of red crabs (C. maritae) off the coast of southwest Africa, showed that the only segment of the population exhibiting significant directional movement were adult females: 32% of recaptures had moved greater than 100 km and the greatest distance traveled was 380 km over 5 yr. This directional movement was later shown to be counter to the prevailing surface currents (Melville-Smith 1990). Thus, within decapods in general, and the genus in particular, adult females are capable of, and appear to undergo, long-distance directional movement in their lifetimes.\nA similar migration of adult female golden crabs, counter-current to Loop Current circulation in the Gulf of Mexico, would produce the geographic population structure observed off the southeastern United States. Females would be most common farthest up-current whereas males would be most common intermediate in the species geographic range. Wenner et al. (1987) reported a 15:1 (M:F) sex ratio in the South Atlantic Bight and in this study, we had an overall sex ratio of 1:4 -- both consistent with hypothesized net female movements to accommodate larval retention and offset the risk of larval flushing.\nIn fact, given this, two female strategies could maximize recruitment in a prevailing current. The first is for females to position themselves far enough up current so that entrainment would return larvae to the parent population (Sastry 1983). The second is to avoid larval entrainment altogether and thus avoid flushing of the larvae out of the system. Female Chaceon fenneri, and perhaps C. quinquedens, appear to use both strategies but rely mainly on the latter.\nFemale golden crabs release larvae offshore in depths usually shallower than 500 m. If larvae were released directly into the Loop Current-Gulf Stream System, they would be entrained for their entire developmental period. Given a developmental time of 33-40 d at 18\u00b0C (K. Stuck, Gulf Coast Research Laboratories, Ocean Springs, Mississippi, pers. comm.) and current speeds of 10-20 cm/sec (Sturges and Evans 1983), transport of the larvae would be 285 km to 690 km downstream. Thus, larvae released on the Atlantic side of Florida are in danger of being flushed out of the species' range before recruiting to the benthic stock. Likewise, larvae released directly into the current in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico would be flushed from the Gulf.\nFemale golden crabs release larvae from February to March (Erdman and Blake 1988; Erdman et al. 1989) and the greatest concentration of female golden crabs to date found in this study was in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico off central Florida. Only during this period and in this region (Maul 1977), can female golden crabs avoid complete entrainment and possible flushing of larvae out of the system. Partial entrainment of larvae might still occur, but its duration should be much reduced, and the risk of larval flushing minimal. This hypothesis predicts that most larvae should be found near the concentrations of females we found in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico with decreasing settlement further downstream. The abundance of juveniles should show a similar pattern.\nOne need not invoke similar counter-current movements for male geryonid crabs. In particular, males moving perpendicular to adult females (i.e. males moving up and down the continental slope) would have a greater encounter rate with females than males moving along the\n240\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nslope with females. Given low female reproductive frequency (Erdman et al. 1989), intense male-female competition (Lindberg and Lockhart 1988), and probability of multiple broods (Hinsch 1988) from a single protracted copulation (H. M. Perry, pers. obs.), the male strategy should be to intercept relatively rare receptive females all along the species' range, not to aggregate with presumably inseminated females. This hypothesis would predict a relatively uniform abundance of males along their geographic range. In addition, the incidence of inseminated females should be high farthest upstream with an ever decreasing percentage downstream. Our study supports the former hypothesis but we cannot address the latter.\nThe distributional patterns of geryonid crabs we observed are consistent with those reported from elsewhere. Furthermore, these patterns lead us to suggest that the Loop Current System has had a causal role in life history adaptations of Chaceon fenneri and perhaps C. quinquedens. In general, females are expected to release larvae during a time and in a region where risk of larval flushing is minimal (Sinclair 1988), whereas males are expected to compete intensely for rare, receptive mates.\"\nThe coastal physical oceanography in the Florida Keys was described by Yeung (1991) in a study of lobster recruitment:\n\"The strong, northward-flowing Florida Current is the part of the Gulf Stream system confined within the Straits of Florida. It continues from the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico, and proceeds beyond Cape Hatteras as the North Atlantic Gulf Stream.\nThe mean axis of the Florida Current is approximately 80 km offshore of Key West and 25 km off Miami (Lee et al. 1991). Mean annual cross-stream surface current speed in the Straits of Florida is approximately 100 cm/s (U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office 1965).\nBrooks and Niller (1975) observed a persistent countercurrent near Key West extending from surface to the bottom, and from nearshore to approximately 20 km seaward. They believed that it was part of the cyclonic recalculation of the Florida Current between the Lower and Middle Keys.\nThe presence of a cold, cyclonic gyre was confirmed by physical oceanographic data collected in the SEFCAR cruises. It was named the Pourtales Gyre since it occurs over the Pourtales Terrace -- that area of the continental shelf off the Lower and Middle Keys (Lee et al. 1991). When the Florida Current moves offshore, the Pourtales Gyre forms over the Pourtales Terrace, and can last for a period of 1-4 weeks.\nThe Pourtales Gyre could entrain and retain locally spawned planktonic larvae for a short period. The combination of the cyclonic circulation and enhanced surface Ekman transport could also advect foreign arrivals into, and concentrate them at, the coastal boundary (Lee et al. 1991).\nVertical distribution of the larvae within the 3-dimensional circulation will subject them to complicated hydrographic gradients, which might influence their development time, and hence their dispersal potential (Kelly, Sulkin, and van Heukelem 1982; Sulkin and McKeen 1989). Thus, variability in the circulation features and water mass properties can lead to variability in larval transport and recruitment.\"\nThe Pourtales Gyre may provide a mechanism for entrainment of golden crab larvae spawned on the Florida east coast, and also as a mechanism to entrain and advect larvae from the Gulf and Caribbean (e.g., Cuba). This possibility is supported by the conclusion of Yeung (1991) suggesting that larvae of a foreign origin supply recruits to the Florida spiny lobster population:\n\"The foreign supply of pre-recruits arriving with the Florida Current might easily meet the same fate as the locally spawned larvae, that is, passing on with the Florida Current. The\n241\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nPourtales Gyre may play a significant role in recruitment by providing a physical mechanism to entrain and advect larvae into the coastal boundary.\nThe Pourtales Gyre, even if linked with the Dry Tortugas gyre or the Florida Bay circulation, may not be able to provide a pathway much more than 2 months in period. For locally spawned Panulirus larvae to be retained for their entire development would require several circuits -- not impossible, but unlikely\"\nThe timing of the Pourtales Gyre provides a mechanism for local recruitment of Scyllarus larvae (Yeung, 1991) and may also provide a similar mechanism for golden crab larvae. Golden crab larvae from the Gulf of Mexico, Cuba, and possibly other areas of the Caribbean, probably provide larvae to the South Atlantic population. The proportion of local recruitment is unknown but could be significant.\nFeeding Feeding habits are very poorly known. Golden crabs are often categorized as scavengers\nthat feed opportunistically on dead carcasses deposited on the bottom from overlying waters (Hines, 1990).\nMovement Wenner et al. (1987) found in the South Atlantic Bight that: \" Size-related distribution of\nG. fenneri with depth, similar to that reported for red crab, may occur in the South Atlantic Bight. We found the largest crabs in the shallowest (274-366 m) and deepest (733-823 m) strata. A clear trend of size-related up-slope migrations such as Wigley et al. (1975) reported for G. quinquedens is not apparent, however, because of trap bias for capture of larger crabs of both sexes. Otwell et al. (1984) also noted no pattern in size of golden crab by depth for either sex. Tagging studies of red crab off southern New England provided no evidence for migration patterns and indicated instead that tagged crabs seldom moved more than 20 km from their site of release (Lux et al., 1982).\"\nLindberg and Lockhart (1993) found in the Gulf of Mexico: \" The golden crab Chaceon fenneri in the eastern Gulf of Mexico exhibits a typical bathymetric pattern of partial sex zonation and an inverse size-depth relationship, as first reported for red crabs (C. quinquedens: Wigley et al., 1975; C. maritae: Beyers and Wilke, 1980). Sex segregation, with females shallower than most males, was more evident in our results than in those of Wenner et al. (1987) from the South Atlantic Bight, primarily because our trap catch had a higher proportion of females (25.9% compared to 5.2%).\"\nAbundance Golden crab abundance studies are limited. Data from the South Atlantic Bight (Wenner\net al., 1987) estimated abundance from visual assessment was 1.9 crabs per hectare while traps caught between 2 and 10 kg per trap. Wenner and Barans (1990) estimated the golden crab population in small areas of 26-29 square km between 300-500 m off Charleston to be 5,0006,000 adult crabs. In the eastern Gulf of Mexico adult standing stock was estimated to be 7.8 million golden crabs and the biomass was estimated to be 6.16 million kg (13.6 million pounds) (Lindberg et al., 1989). Experimental trapping off Georgia yielded an average catch of 7 kg per trap (Kendall, 1990).\n242\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.5.2 Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements Essential fish habitat for golden crab includes the U.S. Continental Shelf from\nChesapeake Bay south through the Florida Straits (and into the Gulf of Mexico). In addition, the Gulf Stream is an essential fish habitat because it provides a mechanism to disperse golden crab larvae. The detailed description of seven essential fish habitat types (a flat foraminferan ooze habitat; distinct mounds, primarily of dead coral; ripple habitat; dunes; black pebble habitat; low outcrop; and soft-bioturbated habitat) for golden crab is provided in Wenner et al. (1987).\nBased on exploratory trapping, golden crab maximum abundance occurs between 367 and 549 meters in the South Atlantic Bight. Information on sediment composition suggest that golden crab abundance is influenced by sediment type with highest catches on substrates containing a mixture of silt-clay and foraminiferan shell. Wenner et al. (1987) further notes: \"Other studies have described an association of G. quinquedens with soft substrates. Wigley et al. (1975) noted that bottom sediments throughout the area surveyed for red crab from offshore Maryland to Corsair Canyon (Georges Bank) consisted of a soft, olive-green, silt-clay mixture. If golden crabs preferentially inhabit soft substrates, then their zone of maximum abundance may be limited within the South Atlantic Bight. Surveys by Bullis and Rathjen (1959) indicated that green mud occurred consistently at 270-450 m between St. Augustine and Cape Canaveral, FL (30\u00b0N and 28\u00b0N). This same depth range from Savannah, GA to St. Augustine was generally characterized by Bullis and Rathjen (1959) as extremely irregular bottom with some smooth limestone or \"slab\" rock present. Our study indicates, however, that the bottom due east between Savannah and St. Catherines Island, GA at 270-540 m consists of mud and biogenic ooze. Further north from Cape Fear, NC to Savannah, bottom topography between 270 and 450 m is highly variable with rocky outcrops, sand and mud ooze present (Low and Ulrich, 1983).\"\nIn a subsequent study using a submersible, Wenner and Barans (1990) found the greatest abundance in rock outcrops:\nObservations on density and a characterization of essential habitat for golden crab, Chaceon fenneri, were made from a submersible along 85 transects in depths of 389-567 m approximately 122 km southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. Additional observations on habitat were made on 16 transects that crossed isobaths between 293-517 m.\n\nSeven essential habitat types can be identified for golden crab from observations:\n\n\u00b7\n\nA flat foraminiferon ooze habitat (405-567 m) was the most frequently encountered\n\nhabitat. This habitat type is characterized by pteropod-foraminiferan debris mixed with larger\n\nshell fragments, a sediment surface mostly covered with a black phosphorite precipitate;\n\n\u00b7\n\nDistinct mounds, primarily of dead coral at depths of 503 to 555 meters and constituted\n\n20% of the bottom surveyed on dives to count crabs. Coral mounds rose approximately 15 to 23\n\nmeters in height above the surrounding sea floor and included several that were thinly veneered\n\nwith a fine sediment and dead coral fragments, as well as a number that were thickly encrusted\n\nwith live branching ahermatypic corals (Lophelia prolifera and Enallopsammia profunda). Fan-\n\nshaped sponges, pennatulids and crinoids were oriented into the northerly 1.4-1.9 km- h-1 current.\n\nThe decapod crustaceans Bathynectes longispina, Heterocarpus ensifer and Eumunida pita, the\n\nblack-bellied rosefish, Helicolenus dactylopterus, and the wreckfish, Polyprion americanus,\n\nwere frequently sighted along transects in the coral mound habitat.\n\n\u00b7\n\nRipple habitat (320-539 m); dunes (389-472 m); black pebble habitat (446-564 m); low\n\noutcrop (466-512 m); and soft-bioturbated habitat (293-475 m). A total of 109 C. fenneri were\n\n243\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nsighted within the 583,480 m2 of bottom surveyed. Density (mean no. per 1,000 m2) was significantly different among habitats, with highest values (0.7 per 1,000 m2) noted among low rock outcrops. Lowest densities were observed in the dune habitat (<0.1 per 1,000 m2), while densities for other habitats were similar (0.15-0.22 per 1,000 m2).\"\nA similar submersible study in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Lindberg and Lockhart, 1993) found similar results with higher abundance on hard bottom: \"Within the bathymetric range of golden crabs, crab abundance may be related more to habitat type than to depth. The greatest density (36.5 crabs/ha) occurred on or near hard-bottom canyon features.\"\nGolden crab occupy offshore oceanic waters along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts as adults. Offshore areas used by adults are probably the least affected by habitat alterations and water quality degradation. Currently, the primary threat comes from oil and gas development and production, offshore dumping of dredged material, disposal of chemical and other wastes, and the discharge of contaminants by river systems.\n3.3.5.3 Essential Fish Habitat - Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for Golden Crab There is insufficient knowledge of the biology of golden crabs to identify spawning and\nnursery areas and to identify HAPCs at this time. As information becomes available, the Council will evaluate such data and identify HAPCs as appropriate through the framework.\n3.3.6 Spiny Lobster 3.3.6.1 Species Distribution and Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Requirements\nEssential fish habitat for spiny lobster includes nearshore shelf/oceanic waters; shallow subtidal bottom; seagrass habitat; unconsolidated bottom (soft sediments); coral and live/hard bottom habitat; sponges; algal communities (Laurencia); and mangrove habitat (prop roots). In addition the Gulf Stream is an essential fish habitat because it provides a mechanism to disperse spiny lobster larvae.\nSpiny lobster begin their existence in the Keys as larvae that arrive oceanic currents. As planktonic larvae they pass through 11 life stages in more than six months (FKNMS 1995). They then metamorphose into a transitional swimming stage (puerulus) (Little and the Milano, 1980; Lyons, 1980) that is found along Florida's southeast coast all year-long (Hunt et al., 1991). Pueruli travel through channels between the Keys and enter nursery areas in Florida Bay and the Gulf, where they preferentially settle into clumps of red alga Laurencia (Herrnkind and Butler, 1986). In seven to nine days a metamorphose into juveniles and take a solitary residence in the algal clumps for two to three months (Marx and Herrkind, 1985b; Hunt et al., 1991).\nWhen juvenile spiny lobster reach a carapace length of 15 to 16 mm they leave the algal clumps and reside individually within rocky holes, crevices, coral, and sponges. They remain solitary until carapace length reaches approximately 25 to 35 mm, when they begin congregating in rocky dens. They remain in these nurseries for 15 months to two years (Hunt et al., 1991).\nAdult lobsters move to deeper waters in the coral reef environment, where they occupy dens or holes during daylight hours. They are nocturnal feeders and predominantly prey upon molluscs and crustacea, including hermit crabs and conch.\n244\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nSpiny lobster, Panulirus argus\nAdults move to the offshore reef to spawn, and larvae are swept up to the East Coast by the Florida Current, where many are lost due to the length of pelagic pueruli stage (9 months) (Marx and Herrnkind, 1985a; Hunt et al., 1985 a; Hunt et al., 1991). The following abstract of Yeung, (1996) summarizes recent research efforts on transport and retention of spiny lobster larvae: Transport and Retention of Lobster Phyllosoma in the Florida Keys. Abstract of a doctoral dissertation at University of Miami. December 1996.\n\"Physical transport can significantly affect recruitment variability of marine species with planktonic larvae. This especially pertinent to the phyllosoma larvae of spiny lobsters (Palinuridae), which have an estimated planktonic duration of 6-12 months. A large population of spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, inhabits the reef offshore of the Florida Keys in the Straits of Florida, constituting one of Florida's most valuable fisheries. The hydrography of this region is dominated by the strong Florida Current, which links the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico with the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic. This dynamic oceanography favors the entrainment and dispersal of locally-hatched phyllosoma larvae, leading to contention about the origin of recruits for Florida's population. In this study, the problem of lobster recruitment is approached from the perspective of transport. The main objective is to find the linkage between spatial variables of larval distribution and transport processes. The main physical processes likely to influence larval advection are the meanders and frontal modulations of the Loop Current - Florida Current, coastal gyres and countercurrents, and wind-driven onshore surface transport. The hypothesis is that, due to those processes, intra-regional spatial variability in the distribution and abundance of phyllosomata exists along the Florida Keys. Spatial variability of transport is established with empirical observations of associated physical parameters, e.g. wind vectors, wind-driven surface onshore transport, frequency of coastal countercurrent reversals, the mode of the Loop Current, and the configuration of the Florida Current. The physical data are related to the pattern of larval distribution derived from five years of sampling. Interspecific comparison of larval recruitment strategies between palinurid and scyllarid (Scyllaridae) lobsters, who also inhabit the region and possess the phyllosoma larva, lends insight to the mechanisms of larval transport. Simulation modeling of larval trajectories in an advective model of current-modified ageostrophic transport in the Straits of Florida further aids the conceptualizing of processes, and testing and formulation of hypotheses regarding the interaction between larval behavior and oceanography. Clarification of this biological-physical coupling will advance our understanding of spiny lobster population dynamics and promote effective management of the fishery stocks.\"\n3.3.6.2 Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for Spiny Lobster Areas which meet the criteria for essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern\n(EFH-HAPCs) for spiny lobster include Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, Card Sound, and coral/hard bottom habitat from Jupiter Inlet, Florida through the Dry Tortugas, Florida.\n245\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\n3.3.7 Coral, Coral Reefs, and Live/Hard Bottom Habitat 3.3.7.1 Species or Groups of Species and Their Distributions 3.3.7.1.1 Shallow-water Species 3.3.7.1.1.1 Octocorallia (sea fans, sea whips, etc.)\nThe shelf waters of the southern and southeastern United States contain a considerable diversity of octocorals. Among those listed for the shelf regions of the western Atlantic by Bayer (1961), only 19 have not been reported from the management area (four species are reported which require confirmation). However, 36 species of primarily deeper-dwelling species have been added to Bayer's list since 1961, bringing the total shelf octocoral fauna of the present study area to 113 species. Of that total, 18 species appear to be endemic, and an additional three species find their principal distribution here (Table 22).\nThe temperate region from North Carolina to the southeast Florida coast contains no distinctive octocoral elements. Typical species are Leptogorgia virgulata, L. setacea, Lophogorgia hebes, Muricea pendula, and Titanideum frauenfeldii.\nThe area from Palm Beach south to the Dry Tortugas contains a tropical Atlantic fauna, which appears to be fairly homogeneous. Some faunal differences occur along the Florida reef tract in response to water temperature ranges, substrate availability, and other variables.\nCairns (1977a) published a field guide to the more common gorgonians of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Florida. Wheaton described the octocoral fauna off southeast Florida in 20-50 meter zones (1987), off Key Largo, in 27-57 m depths (1981), at Looe Key (1988), and at Dry Tortugas (1975,1989.)\n\nTable 22.

This is a remarkably high number, considering that the most diverse locale in the Caribbean (Jamaica) lists only 66 species (Goreau and Wells, 1967; Wells and Lang, 1973). Twelve Jamaican species are absent from Florida waters and an additional seven species are known from the Florida reef tract but not Jamaica: Madracis asperula, Oculina tenella, O. robusta, Cladocora debilis, Caryophyllia horologium, Flabellum fragile, and Favia gravida. The latter species had been considered as endemic to Brazil until their identification from Florida by Jaap (1979, personal communication) and Avent, et al. (1977), respectively. Two scleractinians are endemic to the South Atlantic and are members of the Oculinidae included in Table 23.\n\nTable 23. Endemic elements of the scleractinian fauna from the shallow-water continental shelf regions (less than 200 m or 660 ft) of the southeastern United States (References as listed) .\n\nOculina varicosa Lesueur.\n\nRare off Florida Keys at 72 to 90 m (236 to 295 ft) (Pourtales, 1871; Verrill, 1901). Common on the continental shelf and shelf edge north of Palm Beach (Avent, et al., 1977; Reed, 1978, personal communication). Known as far north as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina from subtidal to 152 m in depth (Reed, 1980b). Also known from Bermuda in 5 to 22 m (l6 to 72 ft.) (Verrill, 1901). Ludwick and Walton (l957).\n\nOculina arbuscula Verrill.\n\nCape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Charleston, South Carolina (McCloskey, 1970). Reportedly common off Savannah, Georgia, 3 to 25 m (10 to 82 ft). Porter (1978, personal communication) reports this species from Bermuda.\n\nThe basic pattern of stony coral distribution follows:\n\nCorals in the 0-200 m depth that are azooxanthellate (lacking algal symbionts) are distributed throughout the tropical wetern Atlantic. Most are solitary ahermatypic corals and small colonials: Madracis brueggemanni, Oculina tenella, Cladocora debilis.\n\nCorals found in deeper waters that are azooxanthellate have a temperate distribution (not found south of 30\u00b0 N. Latitude). This includes solitary and some colonial species such as Madrepora carolina and Madrepora oculata.\n\nCorals that are limited in depth to less than 70 m, are zooxanthellate, and almost exclusively colonial have a strong tropical affinity (Caribbean-Bahamas, southeast Florida, Bermuda, with extreme records in Brazil and North Carolina). This group is often referred to the shallow water reefs corals. In Florida, coral distribution is from Fowey Rocks south. Examples of this group include Acropora palmata, Porites porites, Diplora labyrintiformis, Mussa angulosa, and Eusmilia fastigiata.\n\n247\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\n3.3.7.1.1.3 Antipatharia (black corals) Black corals are not well represented in the management area with the exception of\nCirripathes sp. (probably C. lutkeni) which occurs rarely in the Florida Keys (Goldberg, 1979, personal communication). The species appears to be quite common below 20 m (66 ft.) on the southeast Florida coast (Goldberg, 1973a) (Table 24).\n\n3.3.7.1.1.4 Stylasterina Some Stylasterina have been reported in waters less than 200 m (660 ft) deep (Boschma,\n1957): Distichopora foliacea P. from Key West at 183 m (595 ft.) and off Vaca Key (Marathon) at 152 to 244 m (500 to 720 ft.); and Plibothrus symmetricus P. from American Shoal at 179 m (585 ft). Each of these records probably represents unusually shallow occurrences of deeper water species.\n\nTable 24.

Fourteen species have\nbeen identified as worthy of special protection (Table 25). Antonius, et al. (l978) noted that pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindrus) was recommended for listing as an endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. A conference sponsored by the Atlantic Reef Committee, determined the species to be threatened in the management area but not endangered throughout its range (defined by the Endangered Species Act as worldwide for invertebrates). Jaap (unpublished) produced a summary document on systematics, distribution, stratigraphy, and ecology of the pillar coral for the meeting. The Florida Committee on Rare and Endangered\n\n248\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nPlants and Animals (a private group that supplies information to state agencies) has listed as endangered throughout the Florida reef tract (in all unprotected areas, i.e., outside Biscayne National Park and other areas) an additional 13 species.\nAll of the corals listed as continental shelf fishery resources in the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 that may occur in the management area are found deeper than the 200 m (660 ft) contour.\n3.3.7.1.2 Deepwater Corals As a group, deepwater corals (found deeper than 200 m or 660 ft) are among the most\npoorly understood corals considered in this plan. Field and laboratory observations of deepwater species are sparse. Collecting expeditions have been fair to adequate; the best available sources of data are the coral specimens scattered at research institutions such as the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Marine Research Institute (formerly the Florida Department of Natural Resources Marine Lab), the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, and Texas A&M University. Cairns (l979) has comprehensively reviewed the deepwater Scleractinia but the deepwater gorgonians remain relatively unstudied. The work of Cairns (1979) on deepwater scleractinian coral zoogeography revealed seven species to be endemic (i.e., limited) to the temperate region off the eastern United States. Five of those species have a primarily warm temperate distribution (Concentrotheca laevigata, Cyathoceras squiresi, Thecopsammia socialis, Bathypsammia tintinnabulum, and B. fallosocialis), two are found in cold temperate waters (Enallopsammia profunda and Dasmosmilia lymani).\nGenerally, Caribbean waters have more deepwater species than adjacent waters. In the warm temperate western Atlantic, 28 species occur. Of those species, 14 are tropical and do not occur north of Cape Hatteras, seven are endemic to the temperate region north of Florida and Cuba, and seven species are more cosmopolitan. North of Cape Hatteras, 12 species have been reported, six of which also occur in warm temperate waters. Distribution maps and tables of these corals are included in Cairns (1979).\nIn light of the inadequate data base, separate sections discussing the other major taxonomic groupings of deepwater corals are not attempted.\n3.3.7.1.2.1 Distributions Within the management area there are at least 183 species of corals collected from deeper\nthan 200 m (660 ft.). Although information from deepwater collections is far from complete, the areas of highest coral concentration along the Atlantic coast appear to be between the 600 and 800 m (1,960 to 2,600 ft) contours of the continental slope where deepwater banks are found. Although a complete listing of coral species associated with such structures is impossible at present, at least 23 species of coral have been collected from them.\n3.3.7.1.2.2 Protected Deepwater Corals No deepwater species have been listed as endangered or threatened by the Endangered\nSpecies Act nor are any under consideration for listing (Roe 1979, personal communication). Corallium (precious red coral) and Keratoisis (bamboo coral) were listed as fishery\nresources in the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976.\n249\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\n3.3.7.2 Abundance and Status 3.3.7.2.1 Shallow-water Species\nPrior to about 1985, information concerning relative abundance of shallow-water corals must be gleaned from a large number of papers, reports, and personal unpublished observations of specific coral habitats and communities. Since these studies/observations were almost always conducted at different times by different investigators using different methods, the composite data base was incomplete and inconsistent and did not provide a thorough assessment of the present condition of the coral stock. However, available data do allow an overview of the resource primarily from the original 1982 coral plan (GMFMC and SAFMC 1982). For purposes of discussing relative abundance of shallow-water corals, the management unit may be subdivided into seven regions based on general species compositions. Each of these regions is discussed individually below. As an overview of major shallow-water coral communities surveyed in the following. Section 3.2.1 and Appendix E presents the major hard bottom and coral reef areas of the south Atlantic. Since the late 1980's numerous surveys of shallow water corals have been undertaken.\n\nTable 25.

However, since the GFWFC addresses only vertebrate animals, the FCREPA list constitutes the only state listing of marine invertebrates, including corals. These species are not necessarily rare or endangered at this time.\n\nThe most recent edition of rare and endangered biota of Florida is M. Deyrup and R. Franz (eds.), 1994. Rare and endangered biota of Florida, Vol. IV Invertebrates. University Press of Florida, Gainsville, 798pp.\n\n3.3.7.2.1.1 North Carolina to Cape Canaveral NOAA's Office of Coastal Zone Management (l979d) cited reports that three to 30\npercent of the shelf region is covered by live bottom habitats. The coral fauna along the edge of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida, remains incomplete. Studies by Menzies, et al. (l966) and Macintyre and Milliman (l970) indicate that Pleistocene algal accumulations account for the ledges, small terraces, and slight rises of the continental margin off North and South Carolina, while oolitic deposits predominate in the more southerly sector. O. varicosa is present on the inner and mid-shelf (3 to 40 m) as small discrete\n\n250\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\ncolonies (<30 cm diameter, usually <15 cm), and on the outer shelf and upper slope to depths of 152 m either as individual colonies (l to 2 m diameter), thickets, or banks. While O. varicosa has been found in water as deep as 128 m (off Cape Lookout, North Carolina) and as far north as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, the majority of the thickest growth occurs off the east coast of Florida, from Cape Canaveral to Ft. Pierce, in the area of the Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern discussed in Section 3.2.1.1.3.2.\nCorals on the outer continental shelf proper are characterized by patches of low relief hard bottom also referred to as live bottom (Struhsaker, 1969). Hard bottom communities throughout this shelf area have been reviewed by Continental Shelf Associates (1979).\nThese areas are inhabited by tropical and subtropical fishes, coralline algae, sponges, hydroids, and various species of other invertebrates and coral. They have been described at depths of 20 to 40 m (66 to 132 ft) from Onslow Bay, North Carolina, by MacIntyre and Pilkey (l969) and Huntsman and MacIntyre (1971). Four other species of scleractinians were noted: Balanophyllia floridana Pourtales; Phyllangia americana Milne-Edwards & Haime; Astrangia danae Agassiz (= A. astreiformis M.-E. & H.); and the eye coral, Oculina arbuscula Verrill. Additional scleractinian records for the North Carolina continental shelf include a number of small, mostly solitary species: Rhizosmilia maculata (reported as Bathycyathus maculatus), Dasmosmilia lymani; Rhizatrochus fragilis (reported as Monomyces fragilis); Paracyathus defilipii; and Cladocora sp. (Cerame-Vivas and Gray, 1966).\nReports from South Carolina and Georgia waters (Powles and Barans, 1979; Reed, 1978, personal communication, respectively) indicate that the coral fauna is largely the same as off North Carolina, except that coral patches are even more sparsely distributed (Barans, 1978, personal communication). Gray's Reef occurs in this region, approximately 33 km (18 nm) east of Sapelo Island, Georgia. This complex rises from a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to a crest at 18 m (59 ft). It is approximately 6 km (3.2 nm) long and 2 km (1 nm) wide. The geology of Gray's Reef has been studied by Hunt (1974). Although the area is not a true coral reef a number of corals and their associates are found there. Porter (1978, personal communication) noted that the biomass is dominated primarily by a large pink ascidian (probably Eudistoma sp.), secondly by the gorgonian Leptogorqla sp. (probably L. virgulata), and thirdly by scleractinians, Oculina varicosa identified by J. K. Reed and eye coral, Oculina arbuscula. If confirmed, this identification extends the range of O. arbuscula from Charleston to Savannah (McCloskey, 1970). Other species noted by Porter include stump coral (Solenastrea hyades), star coral (Montastraea annularis, uncommon), Cladocora arbuscula, Astrangia poculata, and Phyllangia americana.\nBayer (1961) stated that the shelf octocoral fauna from the East Coast of Florida north of Cape Canaveral is indistinguishable from the fauna from Georgia and the Carolinas. Reports from North Carolina (Menzies, et al., 1966; Cerame-Vlvas and Gray, 1966), South Carolina (Powles and Barans, 1979), and Georgia (Reed, 1978, personal communication) appear to confirm this conclusion for both octocorals and scleractinians.\n3.3.7.2.1.2 Central Florida to South Florida (Cape Canaveral to Palm Beach) This shelf region represents a transitional zone for coral fauna and deserves special\nconsideration. The shelf edge contains a conspicuous band of pinnacles, benches, mounds, and troughs (here collectively referred to as hard bottoms) which are often capped by the Ivory Tree Coral, Oculina varicosa Lesueur. Although the species occurs at least as far north as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (Reed, 1980b), its structural development is greatest in this region; thickets 1-2 m (3-6 ft) high are found on pinnacles with up to 25 m relief (Avent, et al., 1977;\n251\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nReed, 1980). A major portion of the shelf edge is littered with Oculina debris (MacIntyre and Milliman, 1970).\nThe Oculina community harbors a rich vertebrate and invertebrate fauna which includes other scleractinians (Astrangia poculata (Peters et al., 1988), Balanophyllia floridana, Cladocora debilis, Paracyanthus pulchellus, and Coenocyathus species) and octocorals (Telesto nelleae, and Tltanideum frauenfeldii) (Avent, et al., 1977). Two hundred species of mollusks, 47 species of amphipod crustaceans, 21 species of echinoderms, and 50 species of decapod crustaceans have been found directly associated with Oculina varicosa (Reed, et al., 1982).\nAlthough shelf-edge Oculina communities seem not to persist south of Jupiter, Florida, the species is found on coquinoid rock ledges scattered over the shallow shelf south to St. Lucie Inlet and Stuart, Florida (27\u00b0 10'N latitude) where Oculina is associated with decidedly Carolinian octocorals such as Lophogorgia and Leptogorgia spp. In spite of the Antillean ecological character of other groups which persist north to Cape Canaveral (Avent, et al., 1977; Briggs, 1974), the scleractinian and octocorallian fauna became Antillean only south of St. Lucie Inlet (in a similar fashion to the Mollusca studied by Work, 1969). The coquinoid ledges here possess the same species noted above, but mixed with tropical genera such as the Diploria (brain coral), Isophyllia (cactus coral), Montastraea (star coral), and the octocorals Eunicea, Pseudopterogorgia, and Gorgonia (Reed, 1979, personal communication).\n3.3.7.2.1.3 Southeast Florida Coast (Palm Beach to Fowey Rocks) South of 27\u00b0 North latitude to near Miami, the continental shelf narrows to 3 to 5 km (1.6\nto 2.7 nm) and the warm waters of the Florida current become the most dominant hydrographic feature (Lee and McGuire, 1972). Thus, in the vicinity of Palm Beach, Florida, Carolinian corals are replaced by a diverse hard-bottom community, tropical in character, zoogeographically similar to that of the Florida Keys, but less well developed than the majority of the Florida reef tract.\nThe hard-bottom community found in this region is dominated by gorgonian corals. The antipatharian black coral Cirripathes lutkeni is prominent below a depth of 22 m (72 ft.) but the scleractinians are less abundant at the northern end (Wheaton and Jaap, 1976) and in the vicinity of Miami (Courtenay, et al., 1975) than in the central Florida coastal region (Goldberg, 1973a,b). The underlying substrate is a Holocene elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, and staghorn coral, A. cervicornis, relic reef which lies 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft.) below present sea level. The reef apparently has not been active for the last 7,000 years (Lighty, et al., 1977). Presently, the dominant hermatypes are the large star coral Montastraea cavernosa, the small star coral M. annularis, the lettuce coral Agaricia lamarcki, and the brain coral Diploria clivosa.\nNearshore habitats of this area (less than 4 km) are primarily sand plains. However, nearshore hardbottom reefs are also interspersed. These structures consist primarily of exposed Anastasia-formation limestone and Holocene caps of sabellariid worm reefs (Phragmatopoma caudata) with some small, domal corals represented. Nelson (1990) recorded 325 species of invertebrates and plants in association with similar nearshore hardbottom habitats at Sebastian Inlet, approximately 150 km north. Over 190 species of fishes are documented from such habitats in the Palm Beach area (Lindeman, 1997). At least 515 species total are now known from nearshore hardbottom habitats of the east coast of mainland Florida, a number expected to grow with more studies (Nelson, 1990). These habitats are discussed further in Section 3.2.1 Live/Hard Bottom Habitat.\nThe deeper zones of this community (20 to 30 m; 66 to 100 ft) are characterized by the presence of the scleraxonian gorgonian Iciligorgia schrammi as described by Goldberg (1973a).\n252\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nWheaton and Jaap (1976) and Courtenay, et al. (1975) have confirmed the existence of the same zonation oft Palm Beach and Miami Beach, respectively. Wheaton described the octocoral fauna of the outer slope and fore reef zone from Palm County, to Looe Key (Wheaton, 1987). Blair and Flynn (1989) observed hard bottom community structure off Miami.\n3.3.7.2.1.4 Florida Keys (Fowey Rocks to the Dry Tortugas) Coral reefs and hardbottom communities are common within the south Florida coastal\necosystem. With the exception of Bermuda and the northern Bahamas, the Florida Keys represent the northernmost limit of coral reefs in the western Atlantic. Coral reefs are constructed by complexes of corals and other plants and animals that build limestone skeletons or leave calcium carbonate debris as a result of their growth. The cumulative result is a threedimensional irregular structure that is unique compared to the surrounding seascape. Well developed coral reefs similar to those found in the Bahamas and Caribbean occur from the Ragged Keys to Tortugas Banks: 25\u00b0 40' \u00ad 24\u00b0 30'N latitude, 80\u00b0 30' \u00ad 82\u00b0 40'W longitude (Jaap, 1984, Jaap and Hallock, 1990). High profile bank reefs parallel the island arc in a band four to six miles from shore. Bank reefs are characterized by spur and groove formations (Shinn, 1963), elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), and Millepora complanata (encrusting fire coral) at the reef crest. Patch reefs are found between the coast and the offshore bank reefs and typically are characterized by an irregular ring of large corals (Montastraea annularis, M. cavernosa (star corals), Colpophyllia natans, Diploria labyrinthiformis, and D. strigosa (brain corals). The diversity of corals is quite variable, upwards of 60 stony coral species have been documented on an individual bank reef (Jaap et al., 1989). The diversity and abundance of octocorals tends to be greatest in patch reefs and offshore deep reefs. Coral cover is also variable and often quite low (Aronson and Murdoch, 1997). Functionally, coral reefs enhance the abundance and variety of life, provide a living breakwater that protects the coast from storm waves, provide economic benefit from fisheries and tourism, and are important education and research resources.\nMany well developed patch and outer bank reefs, such as Carysfort Reef and Key Largo Dry Rocks, occur shoreward of the 18-m (60 ft) isobath and are dominated by Acropora palmata (elkhorn) and Millepora complanata (encrusting fire coral) at the crest, followed by A. cervicornis (staghorn), Montastraea annularis (small star coral), and M. cavernosa (large star coral), in successively deeper zones (Shinn, 1963). Prior to the 1990's, specific information on the distribution and abundance of corals on these reefs was available in individual works at localized sites (in spite of their position as the northernmost Acropora reefs in the western Atlantic). The outer bank reefs of Biscayne National Park to the north have been described by Voss, et al. (l969) but quantitative data on distribution and abundance of corals on a single reef were not included. Wheaton (unpublished) surveyed reefs in Biscayne National Park from 1978 to 1981.\nLooe Key Reef (12.9 km, 200\u00b0 off the SW tip of Big Pine Key, 24\u00b0 37'N, 81\u00b0 24'W) is a representative outer bank reef. The reef was subdivided into reef flat, spur and groove, forereef, and deep reef habitats to characterize these habitats (Wheaton and Jaap, 1988). Inshore of the reef there is a fan-like mosaic of seagrass and sediments. Progressing from the seagrasssediments, there is a zone of consolidated rubble that is in less than one-meter deep. It is constructed by coral skeletons that have been carried into the shoal water by storm waves. This area is called reef flat or reef crest. This is a very physically controlled zone; strong waves, winds, intense solar radiation, and extreme temperatures limit the species that can survive in this habitat. Morphologically, the corals found in this area are low relief-encrusting forms and or\n253\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nspecies that can thrive in the strong wave turbulence (Geister, 1977). The reef crest at Looe Key is dominated by Millepora complanata (encrusting fire coral), Porites astreoides (mustard hill coral), and Palythoa caribaeorum (golden sea mat). Seaward of the reef crest, spurs and grooves (S & G.) extend from the shoal-water approximately 150 to 200 m. The S & G system at Looe Key is 5 to 9 m (16 to 30 ft) deep at the seaward spur terminus. Acropora palmata (elkhorn coral) skeletal material is the principal construction component of the spur formations. The spurs can be subdivided into shallow (<1 to 5 m), intermediate (2 to 7 m), and deep (7 to 9 m) habitats (Wheaton and Jaap, 1988). The numerically abundant corals in these habitats are:\n\nShallow: Porites astreoides, Millepora complanata, Agaricia agaricites Intermediate: Agaricia agaricites, M. complanata, P. astreoides Deep: Montastraea cavernosa, Plexaura flexuosa, Acropora cervicornis\n\nTaxonomic richness in these S & G habitats based on Wheaton and Jaap (1988) is:\n\nHABITAT\nShallow S&G\nIntermediate S&G Deep S&G\n\nNo. of Octocorallia Species 4 Colony density (m2): 1.18 to 1.33 7 to 11 Colony density (m2): 2.16 to 6.05 14 to 15 Colony density (m2): 6.15 to 8.94\n\nNo. of Milliporina and Scleractinia spp. 4 Colony density(m2): 7.60 to 9.59 16 to 18 Colony density (m2):10.11 to 10.18 20 to 22 Colony density (m2): 7.65 to 9.75\n\nColonies of very large, living Montastraea annularis (small star coral), Diploria strigosa (brain coral), and Colpophyllia natans (boulder brain coral). Montastraea cavernosa (large star coral) become dominant at the seaward ends of the spurs. They also can be found sitting independently off of the spur formations.\nThe end of the spur and groove zone at Looe Key Reef is marked by a sandy plain at 10 to 12 m (33 to 40 ft), which grades into a deeper reef zone, particularly on the west side of the reef. A series of deep spurs and grooves continues to a depth of 30 to 35 m (100 to 115 ft.). Octocorals such as the rough sea plume (Muriceopsis flavida; eleven percent of deep reef gorgonians) are common but are replaced by Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata (the bipinnate sea feather) and Iciligorgia schrammi with increasing depth. The scleractinians of the deep reef are similar in composition to the shallower zones but contain a relatively greater abundance of branching and star forms such as Eusmilia fastigiata (star or flower coral), Porites porites, and Madracis spp. (ten-rayed star coral). The larger scleractinians of the deep reef are Agaricia spp (lettuce coral) and Mycetophyllia spp. (cactus coral). To seaward the reef terminates and grades into a plain of sediments.\nPatch reefs are generally located between Hawk Channel and the outer reefs. Their distribution is bimodal with major concentrations between Elliott Key and lower Key Largo and between Boca Chica Key and Key West. Fewer patch reefs are distributed between Lower Key Largo and Boca Chica Key. The distribution pattern is influenced by Florida Bay; inimical and unpredictable water quality from Florida Bay impedes reef development. The upper and lower keys block Florida Bay waters from egress into the Atlantic. In the middle keys area, there are small islands and large channels between Florida Bay and the Atlantic allowing free exchange of Florida Bay Waters. Recent studies have documented that coral growth near Florida Bay\n\n254\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nchannels is retarded in contrast to corals isolated from this influence (Personal communication, Clay Cook, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Foundation). Patch reefs are also common in the Dry Tortugas, north and south of Garden Key.\nPatch reefs of the Florida Keys have received the most comprehensive treatment as far as ecology and systematics of corals in the management area are concerned. Generally, patch reefs found in the lagoon between the outer reefs and the Florida Keys may include star corals Montastraea spp., fire corals Millepora spp., regular finger coral Porites porites (P. furcata or P. divaricata), mustard hill coral P. astreoides, starlet coral Siderastrea spp., brain coral Diploria clivosa, and staghorn Acropora cervicornis. Acropora palmata (elkhorn) is almost always absent. Antonius, et al. (1978) found that five species composed 50 percent of the stony corals found on the patch reefs at Looe Key; Millepora complanata, the star corals Dichocoenia stellaris, Siderastrea siderea, and Montastraea annularis accounted for eight to ten percent each, while staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis dominated with 15 percent of the total.\nThroughout the Florida Keys, hardbottom communities are distributed from nearintertidal to beyond 90 m depth. These are characterized as a low relief rocky substrate with attached algae, sponges, octocorals, and in some cases, stony corals are a conspicuous component. These habitats in the inshore waters in the immediate vicinity of the Keys are dominated by hardy corals (including brain coral Diploria clivosa, Favia fragum, Porites porites, P. astreoides, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, rose coral Manicina areolata, and Cladocora arbuscula), which appear to have a greater tolerance to silt, thermohaline changes, and unconsolidated bottom (Vaughan, 1919; Kissling, 1965). Voss and Voss (1955) have described such an environment in the vicinity of Soldier Key, the northernmost of the Florida Keys, as have Turmel and Swanson (1976) at Rodriguez Bank, near Tavernier, Florida. The dominant scleractinian in both locations is Porites porites (Porites divaricata), found in a distinct seaward band associated with the coralline alga Goniolithon sp. and turtle grass Thalassia testudinum.\nDeep reef communities (80 to 120 ft) that appear as reefs that were unable to keep pace with rising sea level are relatively common seaward of many of the individual bank reefs (Carysfort, French, Molasses, Sand Key). These formations often have low relief spur and groove formations. The area referred to as, Tortugas Banks, is a similar deep reef system with channels and characteristics of the deep reefs in the Florida Keys. Because of the low light, the coral growth is not prolific on the deep reefs.\nQuantitative information dealing with distribution and abundance of gorgonians is available for several back reef areas in the Florida Keys. Opresko (1973) has analyzed gorgonian data for Boca Chita Pass, Soldier Key, and Red Reef. The first two locations lie on the seaward side of Biscayne Bay and are subject to fluctuations in salinity, temperature, and turbidity. Boca Chita Pass is the least oceanic in character and not surprisingly possesses the lowest diversity and density of gorgonians. Red Reef is a lagoonal patch reef located on Margot Fish Shoal, approximately 4 km (2 nm) east of Elliott Key and about 3 km (1.6 nm) west of the outer reef arc (Long Reef); this location displayed the greatest diversity and density of the areas studied by Opresko.\nComparative information is available for the gorgonian fauna on other lagoonal patch reefs. Bagby (1978) has studied three sites off Key Largo, Florida, chosen to provide a view of the influence of increasing oceanic conditions. The patches, hereafter referred to as Five, Seven and Nine Kilometer Reefs, are named for their respective distances from Key Largo, Florida. Nine Kilometer Reef is immediately shoreward of the outer reef arc just south of Molasses Reef. Distribution and abundance records of gorgonians from both Opresko (1973) and Bagby (1978). It is apparent that Pseudopterogorgia americana (slimy sea plume) and P. acerosa (porous false\n255\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nPlexaura) are the most widespread species, being found at every station. In agreement with the conclusions of Opresko (1973), P. acerosa is most common inshore, while P. americana is more dominant at offshore patch reef stations. Equally widespread, but numerically less dominant, are the species Plexaurella dichotoma (double-forked Plexaurella) and Plexaura flexuosa (sea rod). The former is present at all stations but is abundant only at Soldier Key and Five Kilometer Reef. Two species, Eunicea succinea (amber Eunicea) and Pterogorgia citrina (yellow sea whip), are distributed in abundance at both Soldier Key and Nine Kilometer Reef, but not in intermediate areas. Pseudoplexaura porosa was dominant on Five Kilometer Reef and Plexaura homomalla (black sea rod) was of considerable importance on Red Reef, but neither was prominent elsewhere in the areas studied.\nSpecies with patchy or widespread distributions are apparently the rule rather than the exception. Goldberg (1973a) noted that offshore patch reefs near the 9 m (30 ft) isobath off the southeast Florida coast could be dominated by either Pseudopterogorgia americana or P. acerosa. Plexaura flexuosa was equally abundant along with Eunicea calyculata (warty Eunicea) and Muricea muricata (spiny Muricea). Reefs at 14 to 20 m (46 to 66 ft) depths off Palm Beach are dominated by Plexaura flexuosa and Pterogorgia citrina (Wheaton, 1976). Plexaura flexuosa and Pseudopterogorgia americana dominated the shallow reefs at Long Key, Dry Tortugas (Wheaton, unpublished). Thus, any or all of these species can be found prominently on inshore or offshore reefs, in shallow water or on outer reefs at depths up to 20 m (66 ft). Their relative abundance on a given reef must therefore be interpreted with caution. Shallow patch reefs near the outer reef tract display a number of clear-water indicator species. Gorgonia ventalina (common sea fan), Muriceopsis flavida (rough sea plume), Briareum asbestinum (corky sea finger), and Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata all fall in this category, in decreasing order of consistency (Opresko, 1973; Bagby, 1978). However, only the sea fan G. ventalina showed any correlation between abundance and reef position. At Red Reef and Five Kilometer Reef, this species accounted for 2.7 to 4.1 percent of the total fauna. At Seven Kilometer Reef this figure increased to 6.4 percent, and at Nine Kilometer Reef it increased again to 12.8 percent.\n3.3.7.2.2 Deepwater Corals As noted in Section 5.1.2, information concerning deepwater corals is exceedingly\nsparse. In most instances, the information is too incomplete to make assessments as to the abundance of the stocks. With respect to the condition of the stock (i.e., mortality versus replacement rates) and overall stock stability, it is impossible, possible to make an informed assessment. In one sense of the word \"condition\", however, the lack of exploitation and other damaging development activities in deepwater areas (except for limited collection and damage by research dredging) infers that the stocks should be in a pristine state. Cairns (1979) documented 55 species of solitary or colonial Scleractinia referenced as \"deep-water\" off the east Coast of Florida including the Florida Keys. These species bathymetric ranges were from 2 to 2634 m, most were found in depths greater than 30 m.\nIn the Atlantic, bioherms have been reported along the margins of the Straits of Florida from Miami to the north (Squires, 1963; Neumann and Ball, 1970). One such mound observed from a submersible in 825 m (2,700 ft) depth on the Miami Escarpment was described by Neumann and Ball (1970) as \"small mounds of muddy sand capped by thickets of branching, deepwater azooxanthellate-branching species of scleractinian corals.\" The uncollected species were possibly of the genera Lophelia, Madrepora, and Dendrophyllia. Cairns (1979, personal communication) studied collections housed at the Smithsonian Institution and suggested that\n256\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\ndeep water banks may possibly occur commonly along the Atlantic continental slope within the coral management area--particularly around the 600 to 800 m (1,980 to 2,640 ft) depth contour. If this is true, associated deepwater corals including Enallopsammia (which Cairns believes to be the Dendrophyllia reported by earlier investigators) and Lophelia may be relatively abundant in many localized areas.\nAlso identified within the Atlantic coral management area are \"bump areas\" (Stetson, et al., 1962; Squires, 1963) located in a broad area about 370 km (200 nm) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, in 720 to 970 m (2,350 to 3,200 ft) of water. Here, a 5,145 km2 (1,130 nm2) area contains thousands of \"humps\" (hummocks of low relief) hypothesized to represent accumulations of coral material. As in the Straits of Florida, the corals were predominantly the branching azooxanthellate corals Lophelia prolifera and Enallopsammia profunda.\nIn the Atlantic, solitary corals may also occur along the shelf flank, slope, and plain. Although solitary deepwater corals have occasionally been collected from a single trawl in numbers exceeding several hundred individuals, such collections are rare and fit no discernable pattern.\n3.3.7.3 Ecological Relationships Most coral assemblages are so complex that holistic approaches to community\nmetabolism are useful primarily for the purpose of comparison with similar measurements made elsewhere. Therefore, most of the attention on coral reef systems has focused on metabolism and interactions of component parts. Lewis (1977) has reviewed the components which contribute to the well known high production rates on coral reefs. Reviews of coral reef primary production and calcification rates include: Gladfelter (1985), Kinsey, (1985), Larkum and Koop (1997), Venier and Pauly (1997).\nAlthough summarized here, supplemental information on ecological relationships is included in Appendix G.\n3.3.7.3.1 Coral Ecosystems as a Special Resource The importance of coral ecosystems and associated habitats has been well documented by\nnumerous studies, reviews, and symposia (e.g., Jones and Endean, 1973, 1976; Bright and Pequegnat, 1974; Taylor, 1977; Bright, Jaap and Cashman, 1981, Jaap, 1984, Jaap and Hallock, 1990, Chiappone, 1996). Many of those documents emphasize the complex structure of coral ecosystems, the importance of coral for habitat, the sedentary lifestyle and its implications, the wide geographic and bathymetric distributions, and the many behavioral, physiological, ecological, and physical associations that combine to yield an exceedingly complex biological community. The Magnuson-Stevens Act recognizes these values and lists several corals as continental shelf fishery resources subject to exclusive U.S. use beyond the EEZ.\nEcosystems which include coral (solitary corals, hard bottoms or banks, bioherms, and coral reefs) often represent unique arrays of plants and animals in an integrated ecosystem system. The key to many of these systems, if there can be one most important link, is often coral itself, since the corals provide habitat and/or food for most of the other members of the ecosystem. Connell (1973) and Grassle (1973) have studied aspects of population ecology and diversity within coral reefs (see below, Section 6.2.1). Individual biotic components have also been studied -among them, microbes (DiSalvo, 1973), algae (Cribb, 1973), holothurians (Bakus, 1973), shrimps and prawns (Bruce, 1976), echinoderms (Clark, 1976), fishes (Goldman and Talbot, 1976), and others. The resultant coral community is exceedingly complex and productive. Helfrich and Townsley (1965), Odum (1971), DiSalvo (1973), Sorokin (1973c), and\n257\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nothers have attempted to quantify and qualify the productivity of corals and their associated biota (e.g., microorganisms) compared to other marine and terrestrial communities.\nBecause of their vast species diversity, trophic complexity, and productivity, mature coral communities possess numerous mechanisms that enable them to resist normal disturbances, especially those biological in nature (Endean, 1976). As classified by Sanders (1968), coral reefs in deeper water (10 m) may be termed biologically accommodated communities with interspecific competition and predation major determinants of stability. Shallow reef areas (less than 10 m) may be more appropriately termed physically controlled. Numerous other factors also play major roles in coral health. It is many of those other factors that potentially threaten the continued viability of domestic corals.\nThe special nature of corals as a fishery is further highlighted by their sedentary attached (not mobile) existence, which separates them from the subjects of many other fishery plans. Protection via escape or camouflage is limited by the design of coral skeletons and polyps. Although some protection is afforded by polyp withdrawl, strict energy budgets restrict the use of such behavior. Hence, in the midst of persistent adversity, (e.g., water pollution, cold temperatures, sedimentation), corals appear precariously susceptible. The life history of the octocorallian and scleractinian corals is similar to the other invertebrate species. The fruits of coral sexual reproduction are planulae larvae; the larvae are free living (planktonic or benthic). The larvae select settlement sites through chemoreceptors, settle, and undergo metamorphosis to juvenile, sessile corals.\nPart of the uniqueness of the reef corals covered by this FMP is their position at the northernmost limits of zooxanthellate corals in U.S. waters. Although Solenastrea (stump coral) and Siderastrea (starlet coral) occur off North Carolina where bottom temperatures drop to 10\u00b0 C or 50\u00b0F (MacIntyre and Pilkey, 1969), zooxanthellate corals and coral reef development of a shallow-water and tropical nature is limited to south of Stuart Florida and dynamic coral reef accumulation is found south and west of Fowey Rocks.\nPatch reef, hard bottom, and solitary corals occur north of Fowey Rocks and off west Florida, but not to the extent seen off the Florida Keys, northeast of Key Largo, or southwest of Big Pine Key. Most corals inhabiting our nation's continental EEZ, especially the hermatypic species which are less temperature tolerant, are at the very limit of their geographical range.\n3.3.7.3.2 Value as Essential Fish Habitat Coral's most valuable contribution to the marine environment is as habitat for numerous\nassociated organisms. As described by Jones and Endean (1973, 1976), Antonius, et al. (1978), Starck (1968) Jaap (1984) Bohnsack et al. (1987) and Chiappone and Sluka (1996), and many other researchers, a coral assemblage within the management area may support rich populations of invertebrates (corals, sponges, tunicates, echinoderms, crabs, lobsters, gastropods, etc.), vertebrates (primarily fish, turtles, birds, and marine mammals), and plants (coralline algae, fleshy algae, eelgrass, turtle grass, etc.). Wells (1957) emphasized this habitat value in defining a coral reef as \"... fauna and flora ... (that) ... provide the ecological niches essential to the existence of all other reef dwelling animals and plants.\" Undoubtedly coral is a primary provider of high quality refuge habitat for a multitude of attached and mobile organisms.\nAll demersal fish species under SAFMC management which can associate with coral habitats are contained within the snapper-grouper FMP. Seventy-three managed species within ten diverse families are under this plan (Section 2.2). Several of these families are among the most commercially and recreationally valuable fishes of the south Atlantic coast of the United States (e.g., snappers and groupers). All of these species can show some association with coral\n258\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nor hardbottom habitats during their life history. Among species, these associations differ as some coral habitat use patterns are obligate while some are facultative. In addition, temporal variations in habitat use operate at broad scales ranging from interannual to seasonal to daily (nocturnal feeding migrations). The value of coral habitats can vary accordingly. Within snapper grouper species, ontogenetic changes in habitat use lead to further variation in coral habitat use. However, the coral reef ecosystem is fundamental to the occurrence and survival of all of these species by providing direct food or shelter resources to at least some life stages of all snappergrouper species, or providing food or shelter to their prey resources (SAFMC, 1983).\nOf the ten families within the snapper-grouper plan, the three most diverse and valuable are the groupers, snappers, and grunts, with 21, 14, and 11 managed species, respectively. In groupers, the entire demersal life history of almost all Epinephelus species, several Mycteroperca species, and all Centropristis species, takes place in direct or peripheral association with coral or hard bottom habitats. In contrast, several species of Mycteroperca (gag, scamp), utilize nearshore, vegetated habitats before offshore migrations to hard structures with maturation. This latter pattern (primary use of coral/hardbottom structures during later ontogenetic stages) is also seen in many species of snappers and grunts. However, some species, particularly those preferring deeper water, utilize coral/hardbottom structures throughout their life cycle while others utilize both vegetated and hard structures opportunistically.\nSimilar variations in use of coral habitats are present within most of the other snappergrouper families. For example, some managed species of triggerfish and porgy utilize coral/hardbottom during their entire demersal life history, while spadefish and hogfish typically settle in vegetated, nearshore areas and use coral/hardbottom structures only during later ontogenetic stages. Other patterns are also present. Most notably, jacks are not demersal and commonly associate with coral/hardbottom habitats as free-swimming transients, not demersal residents. Nonetheless, coral habitats are primary aggregators of prey species for many species of jacks, providing habitat of essential value for the maintenance of food resources.\nThe habitat diversity within a coral community is usually proportional to ecosystem diversity. Complex reef systems usually provide greater types and quantities of habitat than the more unidimensional hard bottoms. The living and nonliving components of the ecosystem are also of considerable significance in assessing value as habitat. Corals and associated benthos, e.g., sponges, tunicates, and algae, contribute most of the living habitat. Dead corals, perhaps parts of relic reefs, coral limestone, or lithified coral rock contribute refuge habitat and areas where the larvae of corals and sponges can settle. Regardless of the type of substrate or source of protection, the coral community offers space for organisms ranging from microscopic invertebrates to large fish. Those animals in turn contribute to the food webs of the entire ecosystem.\nOctocorals have numerous interactions with other animals, including functioning as a refuge and food for numerous other invertebrates and fish. Octocorals are a primary substrate for encrusting fire coral (Millepora). Additionally, octocorals contribute to calcium carbonate production, adding over a ton of limestone spicules per acre/ per year to a reef habitat (Cairns, 1977).\nData from a five-year study at Biscayne National Park (BNP) support the importance of octocoral habitat. Average octocoral density was as high as 58 colonies/m2 for eight patch reefs studied within BNP (Wheaton, unpublished). Stony coral density on the same sites averaged only 8.5 colonies/m2 (Jaap, 1984). Tilmant, et al. (1979) reported 214 fish species from these same octocoral dominated reefs. This exceeds 134 species for Tortugas and 146 species for\n259\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nPennekamp reported by Jones and Thompson (1978). These octocoral dominated reefs are thus rich in reef fish and serve not only as refuge habitat and probably as a recruitment area.\n3.3.7.3.3 Economic Values Due to state and Federal laws prohibiting coral taking and the subsequent shift of supply\nto foreign sources, such as the Philippines, India, and Haiti, much of the current economic value derived from corals in the management area comes from the nonconsumptive recreational uses of living corals or collection of other reef resources.\nThroughout the management area but especially in the Florida Keys, dive shops, glass bottom boats, reef fishing tours, snorkel trips, boat ramps, and/or tropical specimen collecting companies, emphasize the importance of corals to many local economies. Coastal regions depend on viable coral ecosystems therefore, extreme care must be taken to protect the long-term viability of the reef and the closely related economics of coastal counties, particularly Monroe County, Florida.\nThe key fact in the above discussion is the derivation of value from living corals in the natural environment rather than from any collected coral specimens. Collection of coralassociated biota constitutes another value that is related to corals. If managed appropriately, both consumptive use of associated biota and nonconsumptive uses of corals and coral reefs should not be detrimental to the environment or any user group's economic well-being. Preservation of existing fisheries that are related to corals should be of vital economic concern.\nThe Florida Keys are probably the mostly heavily fished area in Florida and many species are dependent on or associated with coral habitats (Bohnsack et al., 1994). Increasing fishery effort in these areas has resulted in substantial reductions in stocks of many fishery species. Sixty-three percent of the stocks (22 of 35 stocks) analyzed in Ault et al. (in press) were considered overfished with Spawning Potential Ratios below 30%.\n3.3.7.3.4 Buffer Values Coral reefs occurring along southern Florida, and indeed throughout the world, are\nmarkedly affected by patterns of water circulation. The most highly developed reefs in the management area are the Florida reefs, confined to the windward or southeastern margins of the land masses (Glynn, 1973j Shinn, 1976). Less developed coral communities and other distinguishable biotic assemblages, e.g., grass beds, frequently occur leeward of the reef barriers.\nThe protection offered by land from cross-platform currents (Ginsburg and Shinn, 1964) is mirrored by the buffer provided to the islands by relic and/or live coral reefs. Offshore reefs help dissipate storm energies and serve to minimize impacts of storms, wave action, and other physical stresses.\nThe net result of these two buffering systems is a peculiar, abiotic \"symbiosis\" -- islands protect corals by shielding away cold water and low salinity flows from the Florida Bay and Eastern Gulf and the corals protect land masses and nearshore communities from oceanic effects. As a result, the distribution of coral reefs parallels the distribution of islands (Shinn, et al., 1977).\nProtection offered by corals may be crucial to the existence of other shallow-water, continental shelf communities. Coastal Florida, and elsewhere in the management area, is represented by a band of grasses shoreward of the coral reefs. These beds of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), and shoal grass (Halodule wrightii) represent highly productive communities (Helfrich and Townsley, 1965), on which numerous species, e.g., spiny lobster (Herrnkind, 1979, personal communication; Davis, 1979, personal communication) and commercial finfish (Weinstein and Heck, 1979), depend for\n260\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\ndevelopment and recruitment. Fishes and other species also use the beds as prime foraging grounds. Another coastal community protected to a lesser extent by the corals are mangroves, which along with grass beds, are crucial to nutrient flows in the coastal environment. Lastly, many less developed coral communities, categorized as solitary corals or hard bottoms, shoreward of the coral reefs are also spared from storm damage. Although not as prominent as massive coral reefs, grass beds, mangroves, and small coral assemblages are all important components of the coastal ecosystem. Without the buffer of coral reefs, those three zones would be exposed to unusually destructive forces. Also, without grass beds and mangroves to assist in filtering sediments, coastal waters would deposit particulates on corals and other bottom dwellers.\n3.3.7.3.5 Sources of Energy Stony corals and octocorals derive energy from several sources including from sunlight\nthrough their photosynthetic, symbiotic zooxanthellae (algae living in the coral tissue), from consumption of zooplankton, from bacteria (which act as biochemical recycling agents), from consumption of detritus, and perhaps even directly from dissolved organics. Antipatharian corals such as Cirripathes apparently rely heavily upon stinging nematocysts to feed upon animal tissues, although plant material has been noted in the gut of black corals. These energy sources are detailed in Appendix G.\n3.3.7.3.6 Predators and Associations As described in detail in Appendix G, corals are subject to the ecological pressures of\npredation (by fish and invertebrates), competition for space, and other interactions with associated organisms. In some instances, such as the symbiotic relationship of corals to zooxanthellae, the association is mutually beneficial. At the other end of the spectrum, however, are predatory pressures such as those applied by certain reef fishes and invertebrates that eat corals.\n3.3.7.4 Biological Factors 3.3.7.4.1 Growth and Size 3.3.7.4.1.1 Octocorals (Gorgonians, Precious Corals)\nThe published data on gorgonian growth has been determined from work on the black sea rod (Plexaura homomalla). Kinzie (1974) calculated a range of growth rates of 1.0 to 40 mm (0.05 to 1.6 in) yr~1 with a mean increase in height of 20 mm (0.8 in) yr~1. In that same study, Kinzie also noted that colonial growth in terms of height need not be mirrored by growth of new branch tips. Mature P. homomalla colonies are 25 to 35 cm (10 to 14 in) high with multiple branches arising from a single stem; other gorgonians in the management area attain sizes averaging 18 cm (7 in) up to 2.25 m (7.4 ft.) (Cairns, 1977a). These measurements parallel data collected by Wheaton (unpublished) off Biscayne National Park.\nResearch on the precious black, bamboo, and pink corals has been restricted because of their occurrence in deep waters. Other than Cirripathes lutkeni, which lives at 20 to 174 m (66 to 535 ft), most other corals in this category occur below 200 m (660 ft).\nGrowth and size data for the precious corals in the management area is represented only by the work of Goldberg (1977) on Cirripathes lutkeni.\n261\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.7.4.1.2 Stony Corals (Fire Corals, Branched Scleractinians, Brain Corals, etc.) Growth data for stony corals is concentrated on the scleractinian species, especially the\nbranched reef corals (Acropora spp.) and the head corals (Montastraea and others). Limited information is available on deepwater species and the hydrocorals. Growth in terms of stock size and number of colonies is not limited to new corals initiated by settling larvae; Shinn (1979, personal communication) and other have noted that many stony corals including the branched corals (Acropora spp.) may regenerate from small pieces remaining after damage to or destruction of a larger colony.\nMuch of the growth data on the branched scleractinians comes from Acropora palmata (elkhorn), A. cervicornis (staghorn), and A. prolifera (fused staghorn). Generally, these corals have different growth rates dependent upon temperature (A. palmata and A. prolifera), placement in the reef zone (A. palmata), and geographic area (A. cervicornis) (Gladfelter, et al., 1978). Growth rates of Acropora in the management area and on Caribbean reefs range from 34 to 266 mm per year for A. cervicornis, 47.3 to 105 mm per year for A. palmata, and 59.2 to 81.8 mm for A. prolifera. Those rates are lower if expressed solely for corals in the management area.\nGladfelter, et al. (1978) found that calcification rates (the amount of calcium carbonate deposited per unit branch perimeter) in Acropora palmata were independent of temperature yet dependent upon zonation; 0.85 9 per cm per year in the backreef, 1.66 in the shallow forereef, and 1.35 in the deeper forereef were typical.\nThe data of Shinn (1966) and Gladfelter, et al. (1978) indicate that Acropora spp. growth rates in terms of linear extension are higher in the warm fall months than in cooler spring months. Similarly, corals in the management area may exhibit slower growth rates than the same species in warmer climates.\nGrowth data for other shallow-water scleractinians (brain corals and finger corals) has been summarized by Bright, et al. (1981) and Gladfelter, et al. (1978). Generally, growth rates for these species are only ten to 20 percent that of Acropora spp.\nMost growth rates for Montastraea, Porites, and Diploria are less than 10 mm (0.2 in) per year, excepting the work of Lewis, et al. (1968) in the Caribbean. Rates between geographic areas are more consistent than observed in Acropora. Also, rates recorded by Gladfelter, et al. (1978) at the backreef (2 m) and deep forereef (10 m) of Buck Island, Virgin Islands, indicated that depth did not affect growth; both portions of the reef had identical average growth rates of 7.6 mm (0.3 in per year based on colonies ranging in size from 9.63 cm2 to 138 cm2 (1.5 to 23 in2). Highest density bands of Montastraea annularis seem to be deposited in the warmest months of the year (Hudson, et al., 1976).\nAlthough not quantified, several references to Millepora and Manicina aereolata growth rates have conveyed the preliminary conclusion that growth rates on suitable hard surfaces are quite high. Recently discarded bottles, rocks, and other debris may be covered by Millepora alcicornis or other stinging corals within several months to a year. Prior to the existing Florida coral law, several collectors have suggested rapid recolonization in the rose coral M. aereolata in Florida Keys waters. Limited data indicate that growth may be rapid in the first three to four years and much slower thereafter (Vaughn, 1911, 1916).\nData on growth rates of deepwater scleractinians within the management area are practically nonexistent. In general, growth rates observed in these limited reports are significantly lower than growth rates reported above for shallow-water corals in the management area.\n262\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.7.4.2 Mortality Rates Most of the information on natural or human-related mortalities of corals in the\nmanagement area is in accounts of destruction related to storms, groundings, etc. These qualitative reports relay limited information on death of a coral area (e.g., \"many head corals near the grounding were overturned and smashed\") and occasionally certain species (e.g., \"the 13\u00b0C water killed 90 percent of the staghorn corals, Acropora cervicornis, at Dry Tortugas,\" Davis, 1979, personal communication). Such conversational data represents the best available information. General aspects of coral mortality are discussed in the work of Antonius (1975, 1976, 1977, and in press).\nOne quantitative study was that of Antonius, et al. (1978) at Looe Key, Florida. Dive transects and inspections of the reef-building corals were transformed in to a \"percent dead\" number: patch reefs (ten percent); reef flat (25 percent); fore reef (ten percent); and deep reef (22 percent). The total at the Looe Key study area was 13 percent dead. These data are presented by species in the report.\nGrigg (1976) calculated the annual instantaneous natural mortality rate of pink coral (Corallium secundum) in the Makapuu Bed off Hawaii to be 0.066 or 6.6 percent.\nNatural massive mortalities of staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) at Dry Tortugas have been observed on two occasions: 1878 when nearly 100 percent of the colonies died because of unidentified \"black water\" (Vaughan, 1911) and in 1976 to 1977, when a winter cold front killed about 90 percent of the staghorn corals (Davis, 1979, personal communication).\nThe work of Jaap (1979, personal communication) at Biscayne National Park also provides some insight into coral mortalities. By measuring recruitment, Jaap quantified net changes in 4 m2 quadrats. Negative net changes show mortality. Gain and loss in corals in fixed station quadrats must be qualified. Loss and gain in many cases is not a case of larval settlement and death. In shallow depths, storms dislodge corals and transport them to areas outside or within the sampling station. These individuals often survive the dislodgment by a process called fragmentation recruitment.\n3.3.7.4.3 Abundance and Density Calculations of the total amount of percent coverage of corals in the management area in\nthe 1980's was estimated by extrapolating from small scattered studies. Jaap and Wheaton at Biscayne National Park, provided some percent coverage data however, their data were not representative of the entire management area. The EPA coral hardbottom monitoring project encompasses 40 sampling sites from Key Largo to Key West. This project has begun analyzing percent cover for stony corals, octocorals, sponge and macroalgae at these sites (Wheaton et al., 1996).\nQualitative statements on the distribution and abundance of corals may be made. Coral reefs are very limited in distribution, perhaps to less than one percent of the total management area; patch reefs cover slightly more area than outer bank reefs. Deepwater banks again account for less than one percent, probably less than the coral reefs. Most of the corals in the management area occur in hard bottom areas or as solitary specimens.\n3.3.7.4.3.1 Octocorals Wheaton (unpublished and 1987), Opresko (1973), and Goldberg (1973a), detailed\nabundance and diversity for octocorals in the southeastern Florida and Florida reef tract areas. Very limited information exists for the remainder of the management area.\n263\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nAt four pairs of reefs in Biscayne National Park Wheaton (unpublished) surveyed octocoral abundance and density by transect, species count, and photographic analysts. Octocoral colonies usually comprised more than half of the total coral colonies. The five most abundant species (53.9 percent of total octocorals) were Plexaura flexuosa, P. homomalla, Gorgonia ventalina, Eunicea succinea, and Pseudopterogorgia americana.\nMean numbers of octocoral colonies counted along a 20 m (66 ft) transect of the eight reefs were 102.81 and 155.17 (Wheaton unpublished). In 1977, as counts per quadrat, were 27.41 colonies/m2 (range 16.00 to 46.50); in 1978, photo plot counts were 26.28 colonies/m2 (range 9.75 to 50.00).\nOpresko (1973), based on field studies at Soldier Key, Boca Chica Pass, and Red Reef, calculated mean densities of gorgonians of 11.3, 6.9, and 27.1/ m2 respectively. Most common genera at the three areas were Eunicea, Pterogorgia, Pseudopterogorgia, Briareum, and Plexaura.\nThe only other density information for octocorals is from off; Palm Beach County, Florida. Goldberg (1973) reported an average density of 25.1 colonies/m2. No data were given on abundance in that area.\n3.3.7.4.3.2 Stony Corals Data on abundance and density of stony corals in the management area were presented in\nJaap (unpublished). Stony corals comprised only about 21 to 22 percent of the coral biota at eight reefs in Biscayne National Park. The most common five species were Porites astreoides, Millepora alcicornis, Porites porites, Montastraea annularis, and Siderastrea siderea. Based on 25 m (80 ft) diver transects, stony coral abundance at the Biscayne reefs in 1977 and 1978 averaged 25.06 and 26.95 colonies, respectively.\nStony coral densities were 7.53 colonies/ m2 in 1977 (quadrant sampling; range O to 23) and 6.16 colonies/ m2 in 1978 (photographic analysis; range 2 to 16).\n3.3.7.4.4 Diversity 3.3.7.4.4.1 Octocorals\nData on diversity was done by Wheaton (unpublished) in Biscayne National Park. Highest octocoral diversities along a single 20-m (66-ft) transect were 3.2 at Schooner Reef Control in 1977 and 3.98 at the same reef in 1978. All calculations using the H'n ShannonWeaver species diversity index were relatively high, mostly above 3.00. Diversities of octocorals reported for Looe Key (Wheaton, 1988) ranged from 1.19 (on the reef flat) to 3.72 (back reef).\n3.3.7.4.4.2 Stony Corals Species diversity for stony corals at Biscayne National Park was comparably lower than\nthat for octocorals (Jaap, 1979). Whereas many transects revealed octocoral diversities of over 3.00, the highest stony coral diversities (Shannon-Weaver H'n) were 2.80 at Star Reef in 1977, 3.33 at Dome Reef in 1978, and 3.06 at Schooner Reef in 1979; diversity values remained under 3.00 in all but four cases for the three years combined. Compared to other regions (see Loya, 1972; Porter, 1972; Ott, 1975), these diversities are low for stony corals. H'n ranged from 0.47 to 3.06, H'max from 1.58 to 3.46, evenness J' from 0.30 to 0.94.\n264\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n3.3.7.4.5 Age Age data on corals include scattered reports on the age of living corals and relic reefs. In\nthe relic reefs underlying the Florida reef tract, Shinn, et al. (1977), calculated accumulation rates and ages (+ standard deviation) by Carbon-14 dating of drill cores from six reef sites identified below.\nThese data confirm the thickness and ages of coral rock in relic reefs. The corals present varied between sites but included Siderastrea, Montastraea annularis, M. cavernosa, Colpophyllia, and Diploria. Acropora palmata, long considered a major reef-builder in Florida, was absent in most reefs drilled.\nShinn (1979), in a coring survey at the Grecian Rocks off Key Largo, stated that the growth rates of Montastraea sp. indicate 1 m (3.3 ft) of upward growth in less than 150 years.\nIn Makapuu Bed, Hawaii, the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (1979) calculated the \"critical age\" at which coral growth gains are overtaken by natural mortality losses. For the pink coral (Corallium secundum), that age was 31.4 years, which corresponds to an average colony weight of 237 g (8.2 oz.).\n\nAccumulation Rate\n\nSite\n\n(m/1,000 yrs)\n\n1.

Research quantified changes in marked plots between the summers of 1978 and 1979 (Jaap, 1979). Results were variable, ranging from an addition of 34 colonies at Elkhorn Plot 1-7 or five species at Elkhorn Plot 1-9 to a loss of ten colonies at Star Plot 3-7 or four species at Elkhorn Plot 1-4. Generally, recruitment did not appear to differ between control and experimental reefs. However, some plots (e.g., Elkhorn Controls 1-6 to 1-9) did have exceptionally high changes.\nMass spawning in corals has been observed by divers in late August, early September in Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas reefs.\nPink corals in Hawaiian waters apparently reach sexual maturity at a height of about 12 cm (4.7 in) or an age of 13 years (Grigg, 1976). The reproductive cycle is annual with spawning taking place in June and July.\n\n265\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nBased on the assumption of steady state recruitment of the Makapuu Beds off Hawaii (Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, 1979), an estimate of recruitment was obtained by calculating the quantity of coral lost via mortality. In a system in equilibrium, the rates should be equal. The estimate of annual recruitment to Makapuu for pink coral was 5,227 colonies (Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, 1979). Fluctuations between year classes are probable. There is some indication that the assumption of an equilibrium state may not be valid in coral reefs.\n3.3.7.4 Distribution Data on the areal distributions of corals in the management area have become available\nthrough GIS. Previously isolated collection records pinpointed locations of certain species but conveyed little information on the area of stony coral beds. However paucity of abundance data in many regions prevents a realistic calculation of standing stock and biomass.\n3.3.7.5 Probable Future Conditions The information available on productivity and health (see Sections 3.3.7.4 and 3.2.1.1.1)\nenable several cursory statements to be made:\n1) Coral growth rates are so slow in most species that recovery rates following largemagnitude harvest, human impact, or natural stresses are far slower than observed in most other living resources. In most respects many corals may be considered as a nonrenewable resource.\n2) Human impacts that have been identified as possible limiting factors in coral health do not appear to be subsiding. Many chronic problems such as shipping bilge discharges, industrial and recreational pollution, and sewage have not subsided since the implementation of the original fishery management plan.\n3) Natural stresses continue to act on portions of the management area where species occur at or near their geographical limits.\nDespite the data gaps already mentioned, several recent efforts have generated preliminary data for use in indicating any future trends. Coring studies at Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary indicate that coral growth rates have increased in the past decade (Hudson, 1981). Whether or not that improvement is attributable to management practices is masked by the discovery by Hudson in the same study that cyclical coral growth may be normal.\nStudies at Biscayne National Park have shown concentrated damage to coral immediately adjacent to several mooring buoys (Tilmant, 1979, personal communication). The variability in apparent impact was summarized as total counts of corals and diversities between buoyed and control plots which revealed no pattern in all 24 sampled plots. Perhaps the approach of directing users to particular areas may be detrimental to objectives of preserving corals. Conversely, limited damage in high use areas; may decrease damage to other areas and enhance overall coral management efforts. Quantifying these impacts is difficult.\nOne future determinant of coral health in the management areas is the status of stocks in nations that export corals to the United States, i.e., the Philippines and a few others. The possibility that coral exports from other countries may be curtailed or even stopped could redirect resource pressures to domestic stocks.\n266\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nTo allow a realistic assessment of future conditions, it appears mandatory that a multiyear survey of coral growth, stress factors, and management practices be initiated on a species- and area-specific basis. These data are a minimal base from which estimates of future conditions could be made and supported.\nThe fishery for snapper and grouper introduced various types of bottom fishing gear directed at those fish closely associated with hard bottoms and reefs. Roller trawls, bottom longlines, and fish traps are now prohibited for use in this fishery due to potential for bottom damage when fishing in close proximity to coral, coral reefs, or live/hard bottom. Some gear may also be lost when it becomes entangled in coral and continue to ghost fish. The competition among fishermen for a finite resource has increased fishing effort in all areas thus increasing the incidental damage to corals and coral reefs. Similarly the high recreational fishing level increasingly subjects coral bottoms to injury from anchoring by small boats and vessels.\nOctocorals (other than reticulate sea fans) are being harvested for aquarium use off Florida without apparent damage to the stocks. Because they are a rich source of marine medical products, the possibility exists for harvest of substantial amounts for experimental or even commercial purposes. One American pharmaceutical company estimated its annual need to be ten tons per year of Plexaura homomalla for use in extraction of prostaglandin for medical research prior to the synthesis of the desired hormones. The stocks can most likely provide adequate material for experimental research purposes, but may not be able to sustain an extended commercial market should one develop. In either case, local depletion could occur as the result of localized harvest of large numbers of colonies.\n3.3.7.6 Essential Fish Habitat for Coral, Coral Reefs and Live/Hard Bottom Essential fish habitat for corals (stony corals, octocorals, and black corals) must incorporate\nhabitat for over 200 species. EFH for corals include the following:\nA. Essential fish habitat for hermatypic stony corals includes rough, hard, exposed, stable substrate from Palm Beach County south through the Florida reef tract in subtidal to 30 m depth, subtropical (15\u00b0-35\u00b0 C), oligotrophic waters with high (30-35 o/oo) salinity and turbidity levels sufficiently low enough to provide algal symbionts adequate sunlight penetration for photosynthesis. Ahermatypic stony corals are not light restricted and their essential fish habitat includes defined hard substrate in subtidal to outer shelf depths throughout the management area.\nB.Essential fish habitat for Antipatharia (black corals) includes rough, hard, exposed, stable substrate, offshore in high (30-35 o/oo) salinity waters in depths exceeding 18 meters (54 feet), not restricted by light penetration on the outer shelf throughout the management area.\nC. Essential fish habitat for octocorals excepting the order Pennatulacea (sea pens and sea pansies) includes rough, hard, exposed, stable substrate in subtidal to outer shelf depths within a wide range of salinity and light penetration throughout the management area.\nD.Essential fish habitat for Pennatulacea (sea pens and sea pansies) includes muddy, silty bottoms in subtidal to outer shelf depths within a wide range of salinity and light penetration.\n3.3.7.7 Essential Fish Habitat - Habitat Areas of Particular Concern for Coral Areas which meet the criteria for essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern\n(EFH-HAPCs) for coral, coral reefs, and live/hard bottom include The 10-Fathom Ledge, Big\n267\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nRock, and The Point (North Carolina); Hurl Rocks and The Charleston Bump (South Carolina); Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (Georgia); The Phragmatopoma (worm reefs) reefs off the central east coast of Florida; Oculina Banks off the east coast of Florda from Ft. Pierce to Cape Canaveral; nearshore (0-4 meters; 0-12 feet) hard bottom off the east coast of Florida from Cape Canaveral to Broward County); offshore (5-30 meter; 15-90 feet) hard bottom off the east coast of Florida from Palm Beach County to Fowey Rocks; Biscayne Bay, Florida; Biscayne National Park, Florida; and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.\n3.3.8 Calico Scallops 3.3.8.1 Description and Distribution of the Species\nThe calico scallop, Argopecten gibbus, occurs most often at moderate depths of 18-73 m (59-240 ft) and restricted generally to the continental shelf of the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico between about 35\u00b0 N and 20\u00b0 N latitude (Broom, 1976). Identification of calico scallops can be made from shell color and morphology. The upper (left) valve has red or maroon calico markings over a white or yellow base; the lower (right valve) is more lightly pigmented. The calico markings on the shell distinguish this scallop from the solid gray or brown upper valve of the bay scallop, which resembles the calico scallop in size. Calico scallop shell morphology varies with locality, but generally the species reaches 40 to 60 mm (1.6-2.4 in) in shell height (a straight line measurement of the greatest distance between the umbo and the ventral margin), with a maximum size reported to be about 80 mm (3.2 in) in shell diameter (a straight line measurement of the greatest distance between the anterior and posterior margin) (Roe et al., 1971). The shells are almost equally convex, deeply ridged, with 17 to 23 ribs on the right valve (Allen and Costello, 1972).\nCalico scallop, Argopecten gibbus\nThe calico scallop ranges from the northern side of the Greater Antilles, throughout the Gulf of Mexico, to Bermuda and slightly north of Cape Hatteras (possibly Delaware Bay) in waters varying from 2 m (6.6 ft) at Bermuda to 370 m (1,214 ft) on the northern side of the Greater Antilles (Allen and Costello, 1972). Off the Florida east coast, depth of occurrence was 9 to 74 m (30-243 ft) while off North Carolina, south of Cape Hatteras, calico scallops were reported at depths of 13 to 94 m (43-308 ft) (Allen and Costello, 1972). Roe et al. (1971) reported depth distributional differences off Florida, noting scallops south of Cape Canaveral were generally found in shallower water than north of the Cape. However, Sutherland (unpublished report) reported that scallop beds located north of Cape Canaveral were not always found in deeper water than those south of the Cape. The beds usually occur in open marine water rather than estuarine areas (Waller, 1969).\nCalico scallop beds are generally distributed on the continental shelf parallel to the coastline. These beds are most abundant off Cape Lookout, North Carolina; Cape Canaveral, Florida; and Cape San Blas, Florida, in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. On the Cape Canaveral grounds, scallops occur in long narrow bands, or beds, more than 800 m (2,625 ft) long and several hundred meters wide. A calico scallop bed near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, was\n268\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nelliptical and 15 km (9.3 mi) long. Off Cape San Blas, in 1957, a bed 16 km (9.9 mi) long by 816 km (5.0-9.9 mi) wide was located (Bullis and Ingle, 1959). The greatest concentrations of these scallops appeared to be near coastal prominences (Allen and Costello, 1972).\nPopulations of calico scallops were located in 1977 offshore of the South Carolina/Georgia border in 37-45 m (121-148 ft) (Anderson and Lacey, 1979). The scallop bed was elliptically shaped and oriented perpendicular to the coast.\nMaturity in Atlantic calico scallops is correlated with age rather than size (Roe et al., 1971). Scallops may spawn intermittently many times during the spawning season. No data on fecundity of Atlantic calico scallops was located. Water temperatures may stimulate spawning. Atlantic calico scallops are hermaphroditic, ejecting first sperm and then eggs into the water where fertilization occurs. Part of the North Carolina Atlantic calico stock may result from larvae transported northward from the Cape Canaveral grounds by the Gulf Stream. However, oceanographic data suggest that most larvae would be retained at Cape Canaveral. Larvae settle as spat in 14 to 16 days and attach to substrates with byssal threads from the foot. Spat attach to navigation buoys, other floating objects, and dead or living mollusk shells. The spat remain attached until they reach about 2.5 cm (1 in) shell height; they then detach and can swim. Small scallops swim more readily, and adult scallops can swim 30 cm ( 1 ft) with one squirt (Allen and Costello, 1972). Unattached scallops have been reported from hard sand, sand with shell, and a smooth sand-gravel-shell substrate. They reach commercial shell height of 4 to 4.5 cm (1.6 to 1.8 in) in 6 to 8 months, and have a life span averaging only 18 to 20 months, with a maximum of 24 months(Allen and Costello, 1972). Monthly mortality is about 12 to 23 percent, and varies seasonally (Roe et al., 1971). Disappearance of Atlantic calico scallops from a particular area commonly occurs, and the size of the stock shows considerable annual fluctuations. Declines and mass mortalities have occurred on the grounds off North Carolina. Possible causes include migration, poor larval transport from elsewhere, and increased fishing pressure following introduction of shucking and eviscerating machines. Spawning stock is maintained because (1) not all beds are harvested each year; (2) the spawning stock includes scallops too small to market; and (3) individuals at densities too low to harvest. Atlantic calico scallops filter small particles such as unicellular algae from the water as food. Predators on juvenile and adult scallops include seastars, gastropods, squid, octopus, crabs, sharks, rays, and bony fishes.\nSubstrates required by calico scallops vary with scallop size. Under natural conditions, the spat usually attach to dead or living mollusk shells (Allen and Costello, 1972). However, spat has been found attached to navigation buoys (Waller, 1969) and plastic floats (Pequegnat et al., 1967). Allen (1979) reported that young calico scallops attach to a variety of materials in addition to calico scallop shells. Young scallops were found among attached hydroids, but it was not determined that spat attach to hydroids or erect bryozoans before attaching to shell. The dependence of spat on shell for setting and survival has not been studied.\nLarger, unattached scallops have been reported from bottoms of hard sand (Rivers, 1962), sand and shell (Cummins et al., 1962), quartz sand (Hulings, 1961), smooth sand-shell-gravel (Struhsaker, 1969), and sand and dead shell (Drummond, 1969). Sutherland (unpublished report) described the environment of the scallop grounds off Cape Canaveral as consisting of shell fragment sands predominantly. Shelf sediments off Cape Canaveral average 60 percent calcium carbonate content; conversely, shelf sediments off Georgia average only 10 percent. High carbonate sediments off Cape Canaveral lie along the western boundary of the northerly flowing Gulf Stream and southern flowing counter currents.\nSalinities of areas where calico scallops occur range between 31 and 37. However, in the laboratory at Florida State University, small scallops taken from waters off Panama City,\n269\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nFlorida, have been grown at a salinity range of 25 to 30 (R.W. Menzel, Fla. State Univ., Tallahassee, Fla.; pers. comm.).\nDepths of the heaviest concentrations of calico scallops off Cape Canaveral from 19601967 ranged from 26-49 m (85-161 ft), as recorded by exploratory fishing cruises (Miller and Richards, 1980). The most productive area of the shelf in the South Atlantic Bight for calico scallops occurs in the open shelf zone at 33-40 m (108-131 ft), an area with stable warm temperatures (Miller and Richards, 1980). Inshore waters (to 18 m or 59 ft) are cooled below 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F), and offshore waters (55 m or 180 ft) are subjected to cold water intrusions off Cape Canaveral, Florida, leaving the intermediate shelf zone with warm temperatures (Miller and Richards, 1980). This warm shelf zone had temperatures ranging from 20\u00b0 to 23\u00b0C (68\u00b0-73\u00b0F) during February-March 1973 and was bounded on both sides by colder water (Mathews and Pashuk, 1977). Deep, cold water intrusions may have favorable impacts on calico scallops by initiating spawning and producing an abundance of phytoplankton for food, or unfavorable impacts by lowering temperatures below 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F), causing mortalities of scallops (Miller et al., 1981). Off Cape Canaveral, bottom temperatures  15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) occurred in depths as shallow as 40 m (131.2 ft) (Leming, 1979).\nRelative abundance of the calico scallop varies with scallop size both within and between areas, seasonally and annually. They are generally most abundant off the Florida east coast near Cape Canaveral, with lesser concentrations near Cape Lookout, North Carolina and Cape San Blas, Florida. Concentrations have also been reported from the eastern Gulf of Mexico between Sanibel Island and Dry Tortugas, and 96.5 km (60 mi) offshore of the South Carolina/ Georgia border. Scallop abundance fluctuates at each area, with good years followed by years when none are available.\nThe Cape Canaveral scallop grounds are among the largest in the world, extending over 321.8 km (200 mi) from St. Augustine to near Stuart, Florida. Sutherland (unpublished report) made estimates of the calico stock distribution and abundance from data obtained with RUFAS (to visually capture the scallop resource) and tumbler dredges (to obtain samples). He found the bed width was highly variable and ranged from 6.7 to 2,633.5 m (22 to 8,640 feet). Juvenile calico scallop beds in 1970 surveys accounted for almost 4 percent of scallop distribution. Scallop occurrence was uniformly less than 4 percent of completed transect miles.\nFigures 51a and 51b were provided by representatives of the calico scallop industry during scoping meetings and public hearings on calico scallop management and present recent calico scallop harvest areas/distribution, spawning locations, and shell distribution off southeast Florida. Additional information on calico scallop biology, harvest and distribution is presented in the Calico Scallop Fishery Management Plan (SAFMC, 1998e)\n3.3.8.2 Essential Fish Habitat for Calico Scallops The essential fish habitat for calico scallops is the unconsolidated sediments including\nhard sand bottoms, sand and shell hash, quartz sand, smooth sand-shell-gravel, and sand and dead shell in 43-308 ft (13 - 94 m) with concentrations occurring on the Cape Canaveral grounds (Stuart to St. Augustine, Florida) and sporadically occurring northeast and southwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina in 62-102 ft (19 - 31 m), and offshore of the South Carolina/Georgia border in 121-148 ft (37-45m).

The Council noted, in so doing, that the Magnuson-Stevens Act requires Councils to comment on projects proposed for authorization by federal or state governments which have the potential to effect habitats, including essential fish habitats, of anadromous species. The Final Rule for Essential Fish Habitat, for the purpose of compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act, defined anadromous species under the authority of the Council as those which inhabit the EEZ for any portion of their life cycle. This section therefore describes the species which occur in the South Atlantic waters of the EEZ, and which are therefore deemed to be under the authority of the Council at some life stage. This text describes the species which occur, their distribution, and the habitats which they use, including those which would be defined as Essential Fish Habitat if there was a Council plan for amendment. Information in the accounts for these species is taken largely from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Species Profiles report series, and from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission Fishery Management Plans and stock assessment documents or National Marine Fisheries Service Recovery Plan for the shortnose sturgeon. These references are cited in the individual accounts for each species.\n\n3.3.11.1\n\nAlewife\n\nThe alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is a moderate-sized member of the clupeid (shads\n\nand herrings) family which is an important forage species for both Council-managed (bluefish)\n\n274\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nand Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission-managed (weakfish and striped bass) species. Its normal life history is that of an anadromous form, in which adults spawn in the spring in coastal rivers, and juveniles return to the ocean to grow and mature. It has also been widely stocked in inland freshwater lakes and reservoirs where it lives and reproduces entirely in freshwater and serves as a prey base for game fish such as largemouth bass, striped bass and catfish. The species is under the management of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\n3.3.11.1.1 Description of the Species and Distribution The alewife is a moderate-sized member of the herring family, with a grey to grey-green\nback and silvery sides. They range in size from about 230 mm (9 in) to over 330 mm (13 in). Alewives begin spawning at age three, have usually spawned once by age four, and have all spawned by age five. Fecundity in females ranges from 60,000 to 100,000 eggs (Fay et al. 1983). Spawning populations are younger in the south, with fish in North Carolina being primarily age three, and none older than age four. The percentage of repeat spawning is also less than 10 percent in NC (Fay et al. 1983). Spawning occurs in the spring, started earlier in the south and later in the north. Alewives generally spawn 3-4 weeks before blueback herring in areas where the two species co-occur. Alewives begin spawning at minimum water temperatures of 10.5\u00b0 C (51\u00b0 F) and select a wide variety of spawning sites. Eggs of alewife hatch at approximately 50 to 360 hours, depending upon temperature. The alewife yolk-sac stage lasts from 2-5 days. Larval alewives range in size from 4.3 to 19.9 mm (0.2-0.8 in). Transformation to the juvenile stage occurs at about 20 mm (0.8 in). Like juvenile blueback herring, juvenile alewives may initially exhibit upstream movement, later moving downstream as fall approaches. Emigration occurs between June and November of the first year of life. Emigration of juvenile alewives may be stimulated by heavy rainfall, high water, and sharp declines in water temperatures. Adult alewives were sampled offshore during National Marine Fisheries Service trawl surveys. The majority of catches occurred in less than 100 m (328 ft). Alewives were more abundant than blueback herring when all samples were combined. Alewives were most abundant at depths between 56 and 110 m (184 and 361 ft). Catches of the species were confined to areas north of 40 degrees north latitude in summer and fall. Winter catches were between 40 and 43 degrees north latitude. Spring catches were distributed over the entire Continental Shelf. Alewives primarily consume zooplankton, although fish eggs, crustacean eggs, insects, insect eggs and small fishes may be eaten in some areas or by larger individuals.\nThe alewife is reported to range from Newfoundland south to South Carolina. However, surveys conducted by Rulifson et al. (1982) in 1980 and repeated 12 years later (Rulifson 1994) indicate that the species occurs in coastal rivers only in the NC portion of the Council's area of jurisdiction, although it could occur offshore of other South Atlantic states in waters of the EEZ. In North Carolina, populations were reported in the North, Pasquotank, Little, Perquimans, Yeopim, Chowan, Meherrin, Roanoke, Cashie, Scuppernong and Alligator Rivers (all tributaries of Albemarle Sound); Tar-Pamlico, Pungo, Neuse, and Trent Rivers (tributaries to Pamlico Sound); New River; Cape Fear, North East Cape Fear and Brunswick Rivers; and White Oak River. Status of these populations is presented in Table 4 of Rulifson (1992). All populations were listed as either \"declining\" or \"status unknown\" as of 1992.\n3.3.11.1.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Spawning habitats for alewives can vary from streams only a few meters (yards) wide to\nlarger rivers. Although some authors have reported that alewives ascend further upstream than\n275\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nblueback herring, others believe that upstream distribution is a function of finding appropriate spawning habitats. Alewives use standing water, oxbow lakes and mid-stream areas as spawning sites, as well as coastal ponds with an open connection to the ocean. Optimum hatching temperature was 18\u00b0 C (64\u00b0 F). Temperatures below 10\u00b0 C resulted in the absence of a functional jaw in alewives. Alewives apparently tolerate salinity changes well. In the South Atlantic Council's area of jurisdiction, alewife occur only in the coastal rivers and estuaries of North Carolina, and in the offshore marine areas as described above.\n\n3.3.11.2\n\nAmerican Shad\n\nThe American shad (Alosa sapidissima) has long been viewed as the premier species of\n\nthe shad and herring family, and has a long tradition of supporting both commercial and\n\nrecreational fisheries along the east coast since the early 1800's. It was the most valuable food\n\nfish on the east coast prior to World War II. In recent years, the sport fishery for the species has\n\nbecome more important economically that the commercial fishery. The species is the target of\n\nmajor restoration programs in the northeast and is beginning to be the focus of such programs in\n\nthe South Atlantic. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission management plan for the\n\nspecies is currently being amended.\n\n3.3.11.2.1 Description of the Species and Distribution The American shad is the largest member of the herring family (Facey and Van Den\nAvyle 1986). Large females may reach a total length of 600 mm (23.6 in) and a weight of 5.4 kg (11.9 lb). American shad have a greenish to bluish-metallic luster on the back and are bright silver on the sides. There is usually a dark spot on the shoulder, just behind the posterior edge of the gill flap, which may be followed by 3 to 27 smaller spots. American shad are believed to enter their natal streams to spawn, entering when water temperatures are between 10 and 15\u00b0 C. The peak of spawning migration generally occurs progressively later in the year from south to north, with the earliest spawning migration in the St. Johns River, FL. Peak spawning occurs in mid-January to mid-February in FL, and may occur through mid-June in the Roanoke River, NC (Kim Sparks, Department of Zoology, NC State University, personal communication). Spawning usually occurs in fresh water over substrates of sand, gravel and mud, at water temperatures of 14 to 21\u00b0C. The range of fecundity is about 100,000 to 600,000 eggs per female. Most American shad from rivers in the South Atlantic die after spawning. There are some repeat spawners in South Atlantic river systems, with the percentage generally increasing from south to north. American shad eggs generally hatch in 4-6 days at 15-18 degrees C. Larvae are about 710 mm (0.3-0.4 in) long upon hatching, and absorb the yolk by the fifth day. Larvae develop into juveniles after 4-5 weeks at lengths of about 25 mm (1 in). Juveniles usually form schools and move downstream at rates dictated by water temperature and current velocity. They reside in the downstream portions of coastal rivers and their associated estuaries, migrating to sea at about 90 mm (3.5 in). Emigration usually begins when temperatures drop below 15.5\u00b0 C. Juveniles migrate to the Bay of Fundy and then to the Gulf of Maine where they join the adults each summer. They probably move southward and spend the winter in the mid-Atlantic area. American shad become sexually mature at age 3-5 in North Carolina for males and ages 4-6 for females. Adults which survive spawning leave the rivers and move to the Gulf of Maine where they remain through the summer and early fall. They consume a variety of invertebrate organisms and may prey on small fishes in some areas. Juvenile shad consumed amphipods, aquatic insects and terrestrial insects.\n\n276\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nAccording to the recent survey by Rulifson, (1994), American shad occur in the following South Atlantic river systems and their attendant estuaries: NC--North, Pasquotank, Little, Perquimans, Yeopim, Chowan, Meherrin, Roanoke, Cashie, Scuppernong and Alligator Rivers (Albemarle Sound tributaries); Tar-Pamlico and Neuse Rivers (Pamlico Sound tributaries); New River; and Cape Fear, North East Cape Fear and Brunswick Rivers (Cape Fear River estuary); SC--Waccamaw, Little Pee Dee, Great Pee Dee and Black Rivers (Winyah Bay); Santee River, Cooper River and Ashley River (Charleston Harbor); Edisto, Ashepoo and Combahee Rivers (ACE Basin); Sampit River; Salkehatchie River; Lynches River and Savannah River; GA--Savannah, Ogeechee, Altamaha, Oconee, Satilla, Ocmulgee and St. Marys Rivers; and FL--St. Marys, Nassau, St. Johns, Pellicer and Tomoka Rivers.\n\n3.3.11.2.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements American shad require spawning habitats in inland portions of coastal rivers with water\ntemperatures of between 14 and 21\u00b0 C, with appropriate substrates and current velocities. Juvenile shad can tolerate sharp salinity changes, which allows them to use both the fresh and saline portions of estuarine nursery areas. Adults typically remain in the estuarine portion of their natal systems for 2-3 days before moving upstream. Dissolved oxygen values of at least 4.0 mg/l are required in spawning areas and values below this level can result in mortality of eggs and larvae. Proper development of American shad requires water velocities that keep the eggs suspended in the water column. Spawning commonly occurs in velocities of 30.5 to 91.4 cm/sec (1-3 ft/sec). Preferred spawning habitats seem to be shallow areas dominated by sand or gravel substrates. At sea, adults appear to prefer depths of 50-100 m, in the areas noted above.\n\n3.3.11.3\n\nAtlantic Sturgeon\n\nThe Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) is currently the subject of a major\n\namendment to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's management plan for the\n\nspecies (Atlantic Sturgeon Plan Development Team 1998), a new stock assessment (Kahnle et al.\n\n1998), and a Status Review conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish\n\nand Wildlife Service (Atlantic Sturgeon Status Review Team 1998). The species is the largest\n\nfish to inhabit freshwater on the east coast(Van Den Avyle 1984), and historically formed the\n\nbasis of significant subsistence and commercial fisheries. Stocks are depressed range wide, and\n\na moratorium on possession of the species is in effect in state waters and is being recommended\n\nfor federal waters.\n\n3.3.11.3.1 Description of the Species and Distribution Atlantic sturgeon are one of two species of anadromous sturgeon which occur on the east\ncoast of the United States. Historically, the species was abundant in most large coastal rivers. It has a long slender body with five rows of bony plates, called scutes, which give it the appearance of being armored. Larger individuals develop relatively shorter snouts, smooth scutes from wear, and the lower lobe of the caudal fin becomes relatively longer. Atlantic sturgeon females historically grew to great sizes, with one reportedly 427 cm (14 ft) in length and weighing 368 kg (811 lbs). Sexes are indistinguishable except during the spawning season when females are swollen with eggs. Spawning migrations in the South Atlantic begin in February and occur later to the north. In the Winyah bay system, SC, adults first appear when water temperatures were 78 degrees C. Spawning during late May and early June occurred in downstream areas of the Pee Dee River that are bordered by palustrine forested wetlands, with substrates characterized by relatively low current velocities, turbid water, and sand and silt bottom substrates with an\n\n277\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nabundance of organic debris (Van Den Avyle 1984b). In most other systems, Atlantic sturgeon prefer spawning sites with relatively hard substrates and flowing water. Eggs are demersal and adhesive and usually attach to substrate or submerged vegetation. Hatching times vary from 94 to 168 hours depending upon temperature. Fecundity for SC females is estimated at between 871,800 and 1,616,992 eggs for fish of 48-104 kg. Newly hatched fry are approximately 11 mm (0.4 in) long. Young-of-the-year Atlantic sturgeon are found in their nursery areas, the lower portions of coastal rivers and their associated estuaries. Young Atlantics may spend several years in freshwater before migrating to sea. Juvenile Atlantics which were tagged and subsequently recaptured tended to move southward along the coast during November through January and northward during late winter and early spring. While in the estuarine nursery areas, juveniles generally occupied tidally influenced freshwater during warmer months and moved to brackish estuaries during colder periods. Tagging studies have repeatedly shown that juvenile Atlantic sturgeon wander widely, with fish tagged in SC being recaptured in NC and VA. Atlantic sturgeon are very long-lived. In SC waters, males spawned first at 5-13 years of age, and females at 7-19 years. Females also do not spawn annually, but spawn at irregular intervals. Sturgeon are benthic feeders, with protrusile mouths which resemble vacuum cleaner hoses. They are likely opportunistic feeders, feeding upon a variety of benthic macroinvertebrates in the Atlantic ocean as adults and in estuaries as juveniles. Recorded food items include polychaete worms, snails, shrimps, amphipods and isopods in marine/estuarine areas and aquatic insects, amphipods, oligochaete worms and mayfly larvae in freshwater areas.\nCurrent distribution of the Atlantic sturgeon in the South Atlantic is reviewed in the draft of Amendment 1 to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission management plan (Atlantic Sturgeon Plan Development Team 1998) and the draft Status Review Report (Atlantic Sturgeon Status Review Team 1998). Based on the documented presence of either age 0 or 1 juveniles and/or mature males and/or females in spawning condition during the last five years (1993 to present), populations are thought to exist in the following systems: NC--Albemarle Sound and tributaries; Pamlico Sound and tributaries, including the Tar-Pamlico; Cape Fear River and tributaries; SC--Winyah Bay and tributaries (Waccamaw, Little Pee Dee, Great Pee Dee, Black Rivers); Santee River; Cooper River; ACE Basin (Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto Rivers); and Savannah River; GA--Savannah River; Ogeechee River; Altamaha River; and Satilla River; and FL--no known spawning populations currently.\n\n3.3.11.3.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Spawning areas for Atlantic sturgeon have not been identified in all South Atlantic Rivers\nat this time. Identification of these habitats is a stated need in the current stock assessment (Kahnle et al. 1998). Nursery areas are the downstream portions of coastal rivers which support Atlantic sturgeon, and their associated estuaries. Nursery areas in the Waccamaw and Edisto Rivers are broad, downstream reaches which are tidally influenced and have hard sand or shale substrates. Salinities in such areas ranged from 1-5 ppt in the Edisto and 0-3 ppt in the Waccamaw. The Atlantic sturgeon's feeding mode reflects an adaptation to gathering food from relatively soft-bottom substrates which are frequented by macroinvertebrates. The demersal, adhesive eggs suggests the need for reduced flow velocities of well-oxygenated water, low levels of suspended solids during incubation, and relatively hard-bottom substrates in spawning areas.\n\n3.3.11.4\n\nBlueback Herring\n\nThe blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) is a small species of the herring family which is\n\nalso an important forage species for other species managed by the Council and Commission. It\n\n278\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nis preyed upon by the same species that prey on alewife and other clupeid species. It is a schooling species which spawns in the lower portions of the tributary rivers of estuaries along the east coast from Nova Scotia to the St. Johns River in Florida (Fay et al. 1983). It, along with alewife, historically has formed the basis of an important commercial fishery, as well as being an important link in estuarine and marine food webs, forming a linkage between zooplankton and top predators.\n3.3.11.4.1 Description of the Species and Distribution Blueback herring have a blue to blue-green back and silver sides with a prominent dark\nspot on the shoulder. In contrast to the alewife, bluebacks have a black peritoneum lining the body cavity. They range in size from around 230 mm (9 in) at age three to around 313 mm (12.3 in) at age eight or nine. Bluebacks vary more than alewives in age of first spawning, though in general their maturation rates are similar (Fay et al. 1983). Fecundity of blueback herring females ranged from 45,800 eggs in a 238 mm (9.4 in) individual to 349,700 from a 310 mm (12.2 in) fish. Blueback begin spawning at warmer temperatures than alewives, around 14 degrees C (57 F). Both species cease spawning when water temperatures rise above 27 degrees C. Both species scatter their eggs and spawn in groups. Blueback herring eggs hatch in approximately 55 to 94 hours, depending upon the temperature. Yolk-sac larvae average 5.1 mm (0.2 in) at absorption and remain in the stage for 2-3 days. Larval blueback herring range from 4-15.9 mm (0.2-0.6 in) in length. Larvae appear to prefer areas with less than 12 ppt salinity. Transformation to the juvenile stage is completed at about 20 mm (0.8 in) in length. Juveniles may exhibit an initial upstream movement during the summer, followed by downstream movement beginning in October. Juveniles exhibit diel movement, moving toward the bottom during the day and toward the surface at night. Emigration from estuarine nursery areas occurs between June and November of their first year. Little information is available on the species once emigration to sea has occurred. Catch data from National Marine Fisheries Service trawl surveys indicate that bluebacks spend most of their time offshore in water depths of less than 100 m (328 ft). Bluebacks were most abundant, north of Cape Hatteras, at depth between 27 and 55 m (89 and 180 ft). Catches of bluebacks in summer and fall were confined to the areas north of 40 degrees north latitude. Winter catches were between 40 and 43 degrees north latitude. Spring catches were distributed over the entire Continental Shelf portion of the study area (Fay et al. 1983). Blueback herring, like alewives, are primarily zooplankton feeders. Young-of-the year bluebacks consumed various species of copepods.\nBluebacks have a broader range in the South Atlantic, occurring in coastal rivers of all four states. Rulifson's (1994) recent survey indicates that the species occurs in the following river systems: NC--North, Pasquotank, Little, Perquimans, Yeopim, Chowan, Meherrin, Roanoke, Cashie, Scuppernong and Alligator Rivers (all tributaries of Albemarle Sound); TarPamlico, Pungo, Neuse, and Trent Rivers (tributaries to Pamlico Sound); New River; Cape Fear, North East Cape Fear and Brunswick Rivers; and White Oak River; SC--Waccamaw, Little Pee Dee, Great Pee Dee, Lynches and Black Rivers (tributaries of Winyah Bay); Santee River; Cooper River; Ashley River; the Edisto, Ashepoo and Combahee Rivers (ACE Basin); Sampit River, Salkehatchie River; and Savannah River; GA--the Savannah, Ogeechee, Altamaha, Oconee, Satilla, Ocmulgee and St. Marys Rivers; and FL-- the St. Marys, Nassau, St. Johns, Pellicer, Moultrie and Tomoka Rivers.\n279\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\n3.3.11.4.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Blueback herring are reported to prefer spawning sites with fast currents and associated\nhard substrates; however, in South Atlantic coastal rivers, they frequently use flooded back swamps and spawn in and among the vegetation of aquatic bed habitats. Preferred temperatures of juveniles ranged from 20 to 22 degrees C, but they were encountered in the field at temperatures ranging between 11.5 to 32 degrees C (53-89 F). Bluebacks are apparently highly tolerant of salinity changes, since direct transfers of adults from fresh water to salt water and the reciprocal produced no mortality. The species requires coastal rivers, associated palustrine forested and aquatic bed wetland habitats, and downstream estuaries as well as the offshore marine environment for completion of its life cycle.\n\n3.3.11.5\n\nHickory Shad\n\nThe hickory shad (Alosa mediocris), is a medium-sized member of the shad family which\n\nhas a center of abundance in the mid-Atlantic region of the east coast (Klauda et al. 1991). Its\n\nbiology and life history are not as well known as other shad and herring species. In contrast to\n\nAmerican shad, it was not important to historical commercial fisheries, but in more recent years\n\nhas provided the basis for an important recreational fishery in some South Atlantic rivers such as\n\nthe Roanoke in NC.\n\n3.3.11.5.1 Description of the Species and Distribution Hickory shad are grey-green along the back, with iridescent silvery or sometimes bronzy\nsides. They are distinguished from other anadromous clupeid fish by the presence of a strongly projecting lower jaw, among other features. Hickory shad reach a maximum length of about 600 mm (23.6 in). They are usually the first of the anadromous clupeid to ascend spawning rivers in the spring, when water temperatures are 12 or 13 degrees C. Spawning can occur as early as March in southern rivers. Little information is available about hickory shad spawning activity, but it is thought that they spawn largely at night. Fecundity ranged from 61,000 eggs in two-year old females to over 500,000 eggs in older females. Eggs hatch in 48-72 hours at temperatures between 18 and 21 degrees C. Larvae are 5.2-6.5 mm (0.2-0.3 in) in length. The yolk sac is fully absorbed at four to five days of age. Postlarvae transform to juveniles at 10-35 mm in length (0.4-1.4 in). Young hickory shad leave the freshwater and brackish portions of rivers in the early summer and migrate to estuarine nursery areas at an earlier age than the other clupeid species. Studies in the Neuse River estuary of NC suggest that young hickory shad may migrate directly to saline areas and not use the fresher portions of estuaries. The distribution and migration of hickory shad once they depart to oceanic waters is essentially unknown, although they are occasionally harvested along the coast of southern New England during summer and fall. This suggests that they may migrate in a pattern similar to that of American shad. The age of hickory shad populations in the South Atlantic ranged from two to eight years. Repeat spawning occurs, but percentages are variable. Food habits of juvenile hickory shad have not been studied. Adults are primarily fish eaters, but also consume squid, fish eggs, small crabs and pelagic crustaceans. Adults apparently do not feed during the spawning migration.\nIn the South Atlantic region, hickory shad are documented as occurring in the following river/estuary systems (Lee et al. 1980 et seq., Rulifson 1994): NC--Chowan, Roanoke and Scuppernong Rivers (Albemarle Sound tributaries); Tar-Pamlico, Neuse, Trent Rivers (Pamlico Sound tributaries); New River; Cape Fear and North East Cape Fear Rivers; SC--Waccamaw, Little Pee Dee, Great Pee Dee, Black, Santee, Cooper, Ashley, Edisto, Ashepoo, Combahee, Sampit, Salkehatchie, Savannah and Lynches Rivers; GA--Savannah, Ogeechee, Altamaha,\n\n280\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nOconee, Satilla, Ocmulgee and St. Marys Rivers; and FL--St. Marys, Nassau, St. Johns and Tomoka. The most recent comprehensive survey (Rulifson 1994) indicated that status of the species was unknown in about half of the SC rivers and all FL rivers.\n\n3.3.11.5.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Information on the habitat requirements of hickory shad is sparse. Major spawning sites\nfor hickory shad are in the freshwater reaches of coastal rivers, including tributary streams and flooded back swamps. Studies of conducted in the Roanoke and Neuse Rivers, NC and the Altamaha River, GA, suggest that the species may prefer tributary streams and flooded back swamps as spawning habitat, rather than the main river channel. Hickory shad eggs have been collected in water temperatures ranging from 9.5 to 22 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen levels at egg collection sites ranged from 5-10 mg/l. Juveniles were collected in salinities ranging from 10-20 ppt. No additional information is available on the habitat requirements of this species.\n\n3.3.11.6\n\nShortnose Sturgeon\n\nThe shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) is a federally-listed endangered species,\n\nfor which a Recovery Plan is currently being prepared (NMFS 1997). The species occurs in\n\nSouth Atlantic rivers, and on occasion in marine waters. There are apparently no documented\n\nrecords from the EEZ in the South Atlantic (Mark Collins, SC Department of Natural Resources,\n\npersonal communication to R.W. Laney);however, the species is included here since the Council\n\nalso must consider the impacts of its plans on federally listed protected species. It is an\n\nanadromous species which historically, with the Atlantic sturgeon, formed the basis for a\n\nvaluable commercial fishery. Information in this account is taken largely from the August, 1997\n\nversion of the draft Recovery Plan for the species (National Marine Fisheries Services 1997),\n\nwith supplementation from other sources as cited.\n\n3.3.11.6.1 Description of the Species and Distribution The shortnose sturgeon occurs in large coastal rivers of eastern North America,\nhistorically from the St. John River in New Brunswick, Canada to the Indian River, Florida (NMFS 1997). The shortnose is a small species for sturgeon, reaching maturity at fork lengths of 45-50 cm (18-20 in) and maximum size of approximately 120 cm (47 in)(Dadswell et al. 1984). It differs from juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in having a shorter nose, wider mouth, and no enlarged bony plates between the base of the anal fin and the lateral row of scutes (see Figure 6 in Gilbert 1989).\nShortnose sturgeon are found in rivers, estuaries and the sea, but populations spend most of their time in their natal rivers and estuaries (NMFS 1997). In the southeast, the species is estuarine anadromous (i.e., spends most of the year in estuaries and ascends the freshwater portions of rivers to spawn in the spring). Adults in rivers in the south Atlantic forage at the interface of fresh tidal water and saline estuaries. Spawning occurs in the early spring. At hatching, shortnose sturgeon larvae are blackish-colored, 7-11 mm (0.3-0.4 in) long and resemble tadpoles (Dadswell et al. 1984). Larvae have a large yolk-sac, poorly developed eyes and fins, and are capable of only limited swimming. It is likely that they hide under available cover at spawning sites. The yolk-sac is absorbed in 9-12 days, and larvae resemble miniature adults by about 20 mm (0.8 in) in length. They likely begin swimming downstream at this size. Larvae collected in the wild were in the deepest waters of the channel. Laboratory studies suggest that their is a two-stage downstream migration: a 2-day migration by larvae, followed by a residency period of young-of-the-year fish, then a resumption of migration by yearlings the second summer of life. Juveniles occur in or at the saltwater/freshwater interface in most rivers\n\n281\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n(Savannah-see Hall et al. 1991; Altamaha-see Flournoy et al. 1992). Juveniles in the Savannah River use sand/mud substrate in depths of 10-14 m (33-46 ft) (Hall et al. 1991). Warm summer temperatures above 28 degrees F may severely limit available juvenile nursery habitat in some southern rivers. Summering habitat in the Altamaha River was limited mainly to one cool, deep water refuge (Flournoy et al. 1992). Adults which occur in freshwater or tidal fresh reaches of rivers in summer and winter often occupy only a few short reaches of the total river length. As with juveniles, adult summer habitat may be limited to cool, deep refugia.\nShortnose sturgeon historically occurred in most rivers of the four South Atlantic states from the Albemarle Sound system in NC through the Indian River system in FL. There have been no recent documented captures in the Albemarle Sound or any of its tributaries (Chowan and Roanoke Rivers being the major ones), or in the Pamlico Sound and its tributaries (Tar, Neuse Rivers). There are several recent reports of sturgeon from the Albemarle Sound which were allegedly shortnose, but there has been no confirmation by professional fishery biologists. There is currently a population of shortnose in the Cape Fear River and the NC portion of the Waccamaw River. In South Carolina, populations presently exist in the Winyah Bay system (Waccamaw, Pee Dee and Black Rivers), the Santee River, the Cooper River, the ACE Basin (Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto Rivers) and the Savannah River. Georgia populations occur in the Savannah, Ogeechee, Altamaha, St. Marys and Satilla Rivers. Florida has shortnose presently only in the St. Johns River.\n3.3.11.6.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Shortnose sturgeon in the south Atlantic portion of the range require the use of large\ncoastal rivers from the estuarine portions to upstream spawning areas. At present in the South Atlantic, populations exist in the Cape Fear River (NC); Waccamaw River (NC/SC), Pee Dee River (NC/SC) and Black River tributaries of Winyah Bay (SC); Santee River (SC); Cooper River (SC); the ACE Basin tributaries, Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto Rivers (SC); Savannah River (SC/GA); Ogeechee River (GA); Altamaha River (GA); Satilla River (GA); St. Marys River (GA/SC); and St. Johns River (FL). Historic populations occurred in the Chowan River (NC) and likely Roanoke River and Albemarle Sound (NC); likely the Pamlico Sound and tributaries the Tar and Neuse Rivers (NC); possibly the North and New Rivers (NC); and Indian River (FL). These latter systems should be considered potential areas for restoration of shortnose sturgeon populations.\nHabitat and environmental requirements of shortnose sturgeon are reviewed in Gilbert (1989). Shortnose require large rivers unobstructed by dams, or in which the dams are above their preferred spawning areas, or at which fish passage has been provided. Shortnose are apparently able to maintain completely freshwater populations (Connecticut River; Santee River). Preferred temperature ranges and upper and lower lethal temperatures for shortnose are not currently known. Shortnose sturgeon is seldom found in shallow water where water temperatures exceed 22 degrees C; however, in the Altamaha they were found at temperatures as high as 34 C. Temperatures at wintering sites ranged from 5-10 C in Winyah Bay. Shortnose spawning generally occurs earlier and at lower temperatures than Atlantic sturgeon. Dadswell et al. (1984) report that most shortnose spawn at between 9-12 C. Spawning habitat for shortnose in SC was reported to be flooded hardwood swamps along the inland portions of rivers . Shortnose sturgeon prefer waters of lower salinity than Atlantic sturgeon. The maximum salinity at which shortnose were found is 30-31 ppt, slightly less than sea water. In areas where shortnose sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon co-occur, shortnose are typically found in waters less than 3 ppt. Adult sturgeon are typically found in areas with little or no current throughout their\n282\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nlives, especially when they are present in the lower portions of rivers and in the estuaries. Shortnose have been reported from shallower waters in the summer (2-10 m; 6.5-33 ft) and deeper water in the winter (10-30 m; 33-99 ft). They have been observed feeding in heavily vegetated, muddy backwater areas; however, in general submerged aquatic vegetation does not appear to be an important factor in their life history.\n\n3.3.11.7\n\nStriped Bass\n\nThe striped bass (Morone saxatilis) is a wide-ranging species of considerable commercial\n\nand recreational importance. While all stocks of striped bass which occur in South Atlantic\n\nrivers are anadromous, it appears that only the Albemarle Sound stock is migratory to any\n\ndegree. Riverine striped bass stocks in rivers to the south of Albemarle Sound apparently do not\n\nundertake oceanic migrations. All North Carolina riverine striped bass stocks are managed under\n\nthe Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's management plan. Remaining South Atlantic\n\nstocks are managed by individual state jurisdictions, or cooperatively in cases where states share\n\na watershed. Striped bass have also been widely stocked in inland reservoirs as a game fish.\n\n3.3.11.7.1 Description of the Species and Distribution The striped bass is a larger-sized member of the perch family. It has an elongate,\nmoderately compressed body. Dorsal coloration ranges from shades of green, to steel blue and almost black. Laterally, striped bass are silver with seven or eight horizontal black stripes, one of which always follows the lateral line. In contrast to the clupeids, striped bass have an anterior spiny dorsal fin, and also have sharp spines on the posterior edge of the gill flap. Striped bass spawn in the spring in fresh water or nearly fresh portions of coastal rivers in the South Atlantic beginning mid-February in FL to as late as mid-June in North Carolina. Most spawning occurs at temperatures of 18-21 degrees C. Peak spawning in the Savannah River occurred at 17 C, and in the Roanoke at 19 C. Eggs are semi-buoyant and require suspension by currents of at least 30 cm/sec. Buoyancy of the eggs may vary from river to river. Fecundity ranges from 15,000 to 40.5 million eggs, depending on the size of the female. Hatching time varies from about 30 to 80 hours, depending upon temperature. Striped bass have three larval stages: yolk-sac, fin-fold and post fin-fold. Yolk-sac larvae are 5-8 mm (0.2-0.3 in) in length and absorb the yolk at 7-14 days of age. Fin-fold larvae are 8-12 mm and remain in this stage for 10-13 days. Juvenile body form is attained at about 30 mm and 20-30 days. Little is known about the distribution and movements of juveniles in South Atlantic rivers. They do school and apparently prefer clean sandy substrates, but have been found over gravel beaches, rock bottoms and soft mud.\nJuveniles move downstream to nursery areas which may include tidally-influenced fresh waters and estuaries. Maturation rates of striped bass in southern coastal rivers is not generally available. Striped bass are fairly long-lived, with migratory races living as long as 30 or more years. Aged fish in southern rivers were generally age 11 or less (see Hill et al. 1989, Table 3). Striped bass initially feed on mobile planktonic invertebrates, shifting to larger aquatic invertebrates and fish as they grow. In FL, juvenile striped bass feed predominantly on mosquito fish, mollies and freshwater shrimp, larger juveniles feed on threadfin shad, and adults feed primarily on schooling prey fishes, especially clupeids.\n\n3.3.11.7.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Preferred spawning sites vary. In the Roanoke River, NC, preferred spawning sites near\nRoanoke Rapids and Weldon are rocky and relatively deep, with relatively fast currents. Spawning habitat on the Roanoke is approximately 208 km (130 mi) upstream from the river\n\n283\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\n\nmouth and even further from the ocean. In other South Atlantic rivers, spawning sites are typically within 60 km (37.5 mi) of the coast, with some sites in tidally-influenced fresh areas. Actual spawning habitats for most South Atlantic rivers are specified in Table 2 of Hill et al. (1989). Sites identified include: NC--Tar-Pamlico River, km 90-238; Neuse River, NC Highway 55 to SR 1915 bridge; North East Cape Fear River, downstream of Lands Ferry; SC-Waccamaw-Pee Dee system, either the Pee Dee River or Intercoastal Waterway; Pee Dee River, upstream from US 301 bridge; Black River, upstream from US 701 bridge; Wateree River, downstream of km 51; Congaree River, km 8-85, but most near km 60; Lynches River, upstream of Highway 41 bridge; Cooper River, lower end of tailrace canal; Ashley River, near km 55; Combahee River, between US 17 and 17-A bridges; GA--Savannah River, km 30-40; Ogeechee River, km 47-55; Altamaha River, km 16; and FL--St. Johns River, Oklawaha River, Wekiva River, Black Creek and Dunn's Creek.\nJuvenile striped bass prefer shallow areas with substrates ranging from sand to rock, in the lower portions of coastal rivers and estuaries. Normal development and hatching of striped bass eggs requires dissolved oxygen levels of at least 3-5 mg/l. Adequate current velocity is also a key factor influencing the survival of striped bass eggs, as noted above. Larvae require oxygen levels of 5-6 mg/l, and the optimal range for juveniles is probably 6-12 mg/l. Adult striped bass do not tolerate oxygen levels below 3 mg/l. Larval striped bass tolerate temperatures of 12-23 degrees C, with an optimal range of 16-19 C. Optimal temperature for juveniles is between 2426 C. As striped bass grow, temperature preference shifts toward cooler waters. In southern rivers, the presence of thermal refugia in the form of springs, spring-fed streams, artesian upwellings may be essential to survival of adults during hot summers. Tolerance of salinity varies with age. Low salinities of 0-3 ppt enhance the survival of eggs and larvae. The range of salinity tolerances and optima generally expand with age. Combinations of high salinity and low temperature cause the highest mortality in young striped bass.\n\n3.3.11.8\n\nAmerican eel\n\nThe American eel is the only catadromous species which occurs in the South Atlantic\n\nregion. Catadromous species are those which live in freshwater as adults, but return to the\n\nAtlantic Ocean where they were spawned to complete their life cycle. The American eel\n\nsupports valuable commercial and limited recreational fisheries throughout its range. Harvested\n\nadults are often shipped alive to markets in Europe. The juvenile eels, called glass eels or elvers,\n\nare highly valuable because they are used in aquaculture operations for growing out for market.\n\nThe American eel is also an important prey species for larger marine and freshwater fishes.\n\n3.3.11.8.1 Description of the Species and Distribution The American eel has an elongate and snakelike body, with dorsal and anal fins which\nare confluent with the caudal fin, producing an apparent single fin which encompasses much of the body. The body is covered by minute embedded scales. Eels range in color from gray, through yellow to green on the dorsal surface and are usually lighter in color on the ventral side. Color changes with the change in life stage. Large females can reach 1270 mm (50 in) in length. The life cycle of the American eel includes oceanic, estuarine and riverine phases. Adult eels migrate from freshwater portions of inland rivers to the spawning area in the Atlantic Ocean, generally south of Bermuda and north of the Bahamas, centered about 25 degrees N and 69 degrees W. Maturity occurs beyond age 3 for males and age 4-7 for females in northern populations, but may occur earlier in the south. Fecundity is 10-20 million eggs per female. Hatching occurs in February through August, with the larval stage lasting a year or longer.\n\n284\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nLarvae are 7-8 mm at hatching. The larval stage is called a leptocephalus, and the leptocephali drift with and are transported by ocean currents. The Gulf Stream is the principal means of transportation for larvae along the eastern seaboard of North America. Larvae are abundant in the Florida Straights and in the area between Bermuda and the Bahamas from April through August. The leptocephali metamorphose into a glass eel stage. Glass eels actively migrate toward land and fresh water, and as they approach coastal areas, external pigmentation develops and the body becomes uniformly dark brown or black. This stage is called an elver. Most elvers move into coastal estuaries and up coastal rivers in the late winter or spring of the year. They generally arrive earlier in southern rivers. Migrating elvers have been collected in January in FL and SC, and in January through May, with peaks in March and April, in NC. Elvers are typically 46-60 mm (1.8-2.4 in) in length in south Atlantic estuaries. Elvers occupy portions of estuaries near the salt-fresh water interface before ascending rivers. Once elvers cease their migration, they begin metamorphosis to the next phase called yellow eels. Some authors believe that yellow eels which remain in the estuarine portion of systems are predominantly male, while those moving further inland become female; however, such a pattern has not been consistently observed. Yellow eels remain in estuaries or rivers for up to 14 years before undertaking the spawning migration back to the Atlantic Ocean. Yellow eels begin metamorphosis into the final stage, called silver eels, in the fall prior to seaward migration. Eels are primarily nocturnal and have a diverse diet. Eels in freshwater feed on insects, worms, crayfish and other crustaceans, frogs and fish. Elvers in saltwater are planktivorous. Blue crabs and clams may be significant prey items in some estuaries. Eels serve as prey for both largemouth bass and striped bass.\nThe American eel historically occurred throughout the entire South Atlantic, in all coastal rivers and inland freshwater streams, lakes and ponds. In some watersheds, however, construction of dams has prevented juvenile recruitment and has effectively eliminated the American eel from that portion of the watershed above the dams (e.g. Roanoke River Basin in NC and VA). Investigations should be conducted in all South Atlantic rivers with dams to assess whether American eels have been eliminated from the upper portions of other southeastern watersheds.\n3.3.11.8.2 Habitat and Environmental Requirements Spawning occurs in the Atlantic Ocean at the general locality noted above. Depths at\nwhich spawning occurs are not known; however, larvae collected near Bermuda occurred only at depths between 550 and 2200 m (1800-7205 ft). Postlarval eels tend to be bottom dwellers and hide in burrows, tubes, snags, plant masses, other types of shelter, or the substrate itself. Presence of soft, undisturbed bottom sediments is important to migrating elvers as shelter.\nAmerican eels have broad tolerances for varying temperature and dissolved oxygen. Preferred temperature was 16.7 degrees C. Salinity may provide a key factor in American eel migration movements during the larval, glass eel, and elver stages, along with currents. Alterations in the pattern or magnitude of freshwater inflows into coastal rivers and estuaries could alter salinity and current regimes and thereby affect the number, timing and spatial patterns of upstream migrations by elvers. Since elvers can absorb 60 percent of their oxygen requirements through their skin, they are able to tolerate low DO conditions, as can adult eels, which can use both branchial and cutaneous respiration.\n3.4 Essential Fish Habitat Degradation: Marine Biodiversity Implications The protection of fish habitat is an essential component of marine biodiversity\nconservation (Norse, 1993). The conservation of biodiversity is fundamental to maintenance of\n285\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nthe characteristic structures and functions of ecosystems. The objectives of conservation and enhancement of Essential Fish Habitat under the Magnuson-Steven Act parallel objectives of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, a binding international agreement adopted in 1993. To accomplish the objectives of conservation and sustainable use under the Convention, specific Articles address the requirement for identification and monitoring, sustainable use of components of biological diversity, research and training, and public education and awareness. In addition, one Article explicitly addresses the importance of marine protected areas, the need to restore degraded ecosystems, and the recovery of threatened species.\nThe National Research Council panel on marine biodiversity (NRC, 1995) concluded that to describe, understand, and predict changes in marine biodiversity, information is needed on: (1) patterns of biodiversity (mapping), (2) anthropogenic and natural processes that generate or alter these patterns, and natural processes that generated a given pattern (linkages and processes), and (3) consequences to ecosystem function of biodiversity change. Those changes are often due to environmental stressors resulting from human activities. These include effects of fishing, alteration of habitats by nearshore construction projects, and chemical pollution (summarized elsewhere in Section 4.0 of this document).\nIn requiring the FMCs, along with NMFS, to describe EFH (mapping), identify EFH (linkages and processes), identify stressors, and make recommendations on how best to restore degraded habitats, the Magnuson Act closely parallels the recommendations of other national and international forums. The major threats to biodiversity include overexploitation, introduction of alien species, unsustainable mariculture, land-based activities, and habitat alteration and destruction. Managing threats to biodiversity will require integrated marine and coastal area management, marine protected areas, and socio-economic alternatives. The encompassing goal is to maintain ecosystem structure and function. Research gaps that currently retard that goal are information on: (1) patterns of biodiversity (genetic, species, ecosystem), (2) effects of biodiversity changes on ecosystem function, (3) the effects of changes in habitat (quality and quantity) on biodiversity, and (4) alternative management models (socio-economic and biological). Successful implementation of measures to conserve and enhance EFH will be consistent with the now internationally agreed need for habitat and biodiversity conservation.\nSeveral non-fishing effects on EFH may influence marine biodiversity in coastal areas of the southeast U.S. Of particular relevance to nearshore areas is the potential for faunal shifts in response to coastal urbanization, an infrequently considered issue of potentially high significance to biodiversity. For example, the majority of artificial habitats in nearshore waters of southeast Florida result from construction activities for waterfront access and shoreline stabilization, not fishery enhancement. Rip-rap , seawalls, and dock piles are replacing mangrove and grass shoreline habitat in large areas of southeast and east-central Florida via mitigation or restoration activities.\nExtensive structural modifications of estuaries may result in species abundance shifts that are not attributable only to water quality and salinity changes induced by upland modifications. Increased channelization by dredging and the addition of rocky structures to the water column may favor shifts from \"estuarine\" assemblages to \"reef\" assemblages because of comparatively higher abundances and diversities of incoming ichthyoplankton and the replacement of vegetation with hard structure favoring reef species (Lindeman, 1997). Such shifts may not only involve relative species abundances but also longer nearshore residence times for the maturing life stages of certain reef species. For example, the artificial, 12 m deep reefs adjacent to the side of the leeward barrier island (the Government Cut jetties) of South Miami Beach may lengthen the time interval before maturing reef fishes undergo substantial offshore migrations. Adults of\n286\n\n\f3.0 Description, Distribution and Use of Essential Fish Habitat\nmany grunts and snappers (bluestriped grunts, sailors choice, gray snappers, porkfishes, etc.) are commonly found on these structures. In areas lacking artificially maintained inlets and the massive rip-rap jetties they require, these adult reef fish faunas would only be found on the deep reefs at the outer shelf edge, several kilometers offshore.\nReef species that remain in or near modified estuaries through reproductive maturity may ultimately reinforce faunal shifts. Inshore-spawned eggs and larvae are more likely retained within estuaries or coastal lagoons than eggs and larvae that would normally be spawned offshore. For example, reproductively active porkfishes, angelfishes, and other reef species occur on bridges within southeast Florida lagoons, presumably because of the steep vertical relief created by bridge construction and channelization. Pile structures supporting large bridges connecting barrier islands and keys generate eddies and other turbulence that can allow settlement of certain fishes. Perhaps more importantly, these structures often support large concentrations of planktivorous juvenile and adult fishes. Therefore, narrow gauntlets of predators may be present across bridged inlets and channels of southeast Florida. These could decrease numbers of larvae ingressing through channels while, paradoxically, providing significant habitat for juveniles and adult reef fishes (Lindeman, 1997).\nRecognition of the importance of tidal channel and leeward barrier island areas as conduits of larval ingress into estuaries and as concentrated settlement sites and juvenile nurseries is needed. Gilmore (1988) found that seagrass beds associated with inlets possessed the richest faunas within the Indian River Lagoon, east-central Florida. Management agencies should place considerable emphasis on limiting negative habitat impacts in these areas. This goal is difficult in application because it may conflict with existing coastal management policies. For example, channels are often considered optimal areas for the siting of large marinas because of better flushing characteristics. However, construction of marinas and docks at previously vegetated channel shorelines increases depth and structural relief, and can ultimately favor greater colonization and inshore residence of reef species.\nInshore faunal shifts from estuarine to reef species operate at population through ecosystem levels and deserve recognition by management agencies and long-term evaluation by researchers (Lindeman, 1997). Superimposed on these factors is the role of anthropogenic modifications of freshwater runoff into estuaries; a factor which may also change existing faunal measures of biodiversity due to differential responses to salinity stress (Serafy et al., 1997).\n287\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n\n4.0 THREATS TO ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT 4.1 Adverse Impaets of Non-Fishing Aetivities on Essential Fish Habitat\nThe waters and substrate that comprise essentialfish habitat (EFH) as defined by the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), and under jurisdiction ofthe South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), are diverse, widely distributed, and closely affiliated with other aquatic and terrestrial environments. These characteristics make them readily susceptible to a large number ofhuman activities.\n\nThe Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Interim Final Rule (Federal Register 62 FR 244) defines EFH as \"those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.\" The following definitions apply for interpreting the definition of the EFH rule:\n\n\u00b7\n\nWaters include aquatic areas and their physical, chemical, and biological properties that\n\nare used by fish and invertebrates, and where appropriate may include areas historically used by\n\nfish and invertebrates;\n\n\u00b7\n\nSubstrate includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and\n\nbiological communities;\n\n\u00b7\n\nNecessary means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and a healthy\n\necosystem; and\n\n\u00b7\n\nSpawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity covers species' full life cycle.\n\nFish habitat is the geographic area where the species occurs at any time during its life. This area can be described by ecological characteristics, location, and time. EFH includes waters and substrate that focus distribution; e.g., coral reefs, marshes, or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and other characteristics that are less distinct such as turbidity zones, water quality, and salinity gradients. Habitat use may change or shift over time due to climatic change, human activities and impacts, and/or other factors such as change with life history stage, species abundance, competition from other species, and environmental variability in time and space. The type of habitat available, its attributes, and its functions are important to species productivity, diversity, health, and survival.\n\nConvention for Threats Identification The ecological requirements for managed species and biotic communities, including\nidentification of EFH, are\u00b7 addressed in this document. Threats to those habitats are described in terms of those that generally occur landward of the shoreline (Threats to Estuarine Processes) and those that occur oceanward of the shoreline (Threats to Offshore Processes). Threats to Estuarine Processes include agriculture, aquaculture, silviculture, urban/suburban development, commercial and industrial activities, navigation, recreational boating, mining, hydrologic modifications, and natural events and global change. Threats to Offshore Processes include navigation; dumping; offshore sand and mineral mining; oil and gas exploration, development, and transportation; commercial and industrial activities; and natural events and global change. A more comprehensive list of individual activities that may be considered as threats is provided in Section 6.3 .17.\n\n288\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nEvery reasonable effort was made to identify the principal non-fishing and fishing-related threats to EFH and to provide examples and information concerning the relationship between threat-related activities and EFH. Other information sources and examples undoubtedly exist and related studies are underway or are in various stages of publication. Accordingly, the following discussion is a starting point for the identification of threats to EFH. While it meets the strict time limitations imposed by the MSFMA, regular updating is required to ensure comprehensive and current coverage of the topic addressed. 4.1.1 Estuarine Processes\nMany species of the south Atlantic region are dependent during at least some life history stages on near-shore waters vulnerable to impacts from land-based sources. Especially vulnerable are species or species groups that require estuaries or freshwater tributaries as primary larval or post-larval habitat. In the Southeast, these species include anadromous fish such as striped bass, blueback herring, alewife, American shad, hickory shad, and sturgeons; and brackish species including Atlantic menhaden, summer and southern flounder, red drum, spot, croaker, weakfish, penaeid shrimp, blue crab and others (Epperly and Ross 1986).\nNear-shore EFHs at risk from land-based impacts include submerged shellfish beds; subtidal and intertidal mudflats and shell hash; SAV beds, including eelgrass (Zostera marina), Cuban shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima); and emergent tidal marshes including both saltmarshes dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and brackish marshes dominated by black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus). These habitats may be affected both by direct destruction and by degradation of water quality or other factors such as hydrologic modification. Elimination or degradation of wetlands not immediately adjacent to EFH also may diminish the quality and productiveness of downstream estuaries.\nThe precise relationship between fishery production and habitats in undetermined. Accordingly, the exact degree to which habitat alteration has affected fishery production is also unknown, but is thought to be substantial. Turner and Boesch (1987) assembled and examined evidence of the relationship between the extent of wetland habitats and the yield of fishery species that depend on coastal bays and estuaries. The evidence examined show that fishery stock losses follow wetland losses and fishery stock gains follow wetland gains. While most of the studies were related to shrimp production, other fisheries are likely follow this trend.\nIn the southeastern U.S., the dominant sources of land-based impacts include major land disturbing activities such as agriculture, silviculture, and residential and commercial development. The following discussions characterize major threats in the coastal zone of the Southeast, summarize ways that EFH is impacted, and characterize the current extent of such impacts. Impacts can occur at three scales: immediate watersheds of EFH; broader watersheds of important estuarine nurseries; and distant or indirect impacts mediated through more widespread movement of water and its chemical and physical make-up. 4.1.1.1 Agriculture\nAgriculture in the Southeast has undergone dramatic changes over time. Most operations were at one time individual and small-scale enterprises, but in recent years have transformed into highly integrated, large-scale industries. Besides the extensive conversion of wetlands to crop and animal production, the most dramatic change in southern agriculture is the large scale expansion in animal production that has occurred during the last decade. The most dramatic increases have occurred in corporate hog operations in North Carolina. According to North Carolina Agricultural Statistics, the 1996/1997 hog numbers (8,969,200) for the 44 coastal\n289\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\ncounties are more than quadruple the 1986 numbers (2,117,800) for the same area. At the same time, the number of hog farms has declined precipitously, by a factor of three.\nOther southeastern states have not yet experienced the same increase in swine herds. South Carolina's coastal counties, in fact, experienced a net reduction in swine herds from 374,000 head in 1986 to 194,900 head in 1996 (South Carolina Agricultural Statistics). Georgia had a similar decrease in the coastal plain counties, decreasing from 400,911 head in 1987 to 317,795 head in 1992 (Georgia Agricultural Statistics). Florida numbers experienced a decline in Atlantic watersheds from about 23,541 head in 1987 to 12,482 head in 1992 (Florida Agricultural Statistics). Part of the reason for the differences in hog production among the states is the development of industrial hog-growing technologies in North Carolina, plus differences in state regulatory programs. South Carolina, for instance, recently adopted very stringent and restrictive new laws governing hog-growing operations.\nPoultry production, a second major agricultural animal product, has also increased substantially in the Southeast. Again, North Carolina leads the nation in several poultry categories. In 1996, 313,735,000 birds were produced in coastal North Carolina; up from 45,588 966 birds in 1986. South Carolina coastal counties also showed a significant increase in production over this decade: 57,834,000 birds were produced in 1986 and 140,038,000 in 1996. The increases in the Georgia and Florida Atlantic coastal counties were much more moderate from 1987 to 1992, with production rates of 12,907,265 to 15,438,031 birds, and 2,780,706 to 2,886,335 birds, respectively (all data from state agricultural statistics).\nPatterns in cropland use also have been in flux. In the North Carolina coastal plain, harvested cropland has remained almost static during the past decade, at about three million acres. However, fertilizer use has increased from 848,927 tons in 1986 to 2,006,251 tons in 1996 (not including swine and other animal waste land application). During the same period, South Carolina has experienced a net decrease in harvested acreage in the coastal plain, from 1,759,162 acres to 1,589,420 acres, but a net increase in fertilizer usage of about 38 percent to 331,597 tons. Harvested cropland along the Georgia coast is up slightly, to about 900,000 acres in 1992. Comparable data on fertilizer usage are not yet available. Harvested cropland in the Florida Atlantic coastal plain is down from about 1.1 million acres in 1992 to 675,081 acres in 1996. (All data from state agricultural statistics).\nThe overall pattern in crop production is one of great intensification of use on a fairly stable land base. Large increases in fertilizer usage and manure-based nitrogen fluxes (from surface and groundwater and from airborne sources) have occurred during the last decade in at least some southeastern states, including watersheds that were already artificially enriched.\n4.1.1.1.1 Potential Threats to Effl from Agriculture Potential threats include: conversion of wetlands to agricultural lands, or for farm\nrelated purposes such as roads and irrigation ponds; direct and non-point source discharge of fill, nutrients, chemicals, and surface and ground waters into streams, rivers, and estuaries; hydrologic modification of ditches, dikes, farm ponds and other similar structures and water control devices; damage to wetlands and submerged bottoms by livestock grazing and/or movement; and cumulative and synergistic effects caused by association of these and other related activities.\nCertain agricultural activities present a threat to EFH in the Southeast. The major components of this threat include wetland conversion, nutrient over enrichment with subsequent deoxygenation of surface waters, shading by excessive algae and plant growth, and stimulation of toxic dinoflagellates; sedimentation; and delivery of toxicants into sensitive waters.\n290\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n\nAgriculture (including silviculture) accounted for 87 percent of all wetland losses observed nationally between the mid 1950's and mid 1970's (Tiner 1984). This loss has been estimated at more than 458,000 acres per year between the mid 1950's and mid 1970's in the coterminous U.S. (Tiner 1984). The most extensive loses observed in the Southeast were in Florida and North Carolina where agricultural drainage continues to destroy large tracts of wetlands (finer 1984). Current agriculture conversion statistics for the Southeast show that:\n\n\u00b7\n\nDuring the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's \"Florida showed a net wetland loss of 260,000\n\nacres, mainly from the destruction of palustrine wetlands. Two-thirds of the loss of palustrine\n\nwetlands was attributalbe to agricultural development...\" (Hefner et al 1994)\n\n\u00b7\n\n\"Between the mid-1970's and mid 1980's, more than 100,000 acres of freshwater forested\n\nwetlands in Georgia were destroyed, mostly because of conversion to land uses such as\n\nagriculture.\" (Dahl et al 1991)\n\n\u00b7\n\nBetween 1982 and 1989, South Carolina lost 155,500 acres, of this amount agriculture\n\nwas responsible for 28 percent. (Dahl 1997)\n\n\u00b7\n\nIn North Carolina about one-third of the wetland alteration in the coastal plain has\n\noccurred since the l 950's. Of this amount, agriculture was responsible for about 42 percent.\n\n(Cashin et al 1992)\n\nExcessively enriched waters often do not support desirable species or populations of fish and invertebrates. They also may not support food chain and other ecological assemblages needed to sustain desirable species and populations. When overly abundant, nutrients such as nitrogen (ammonia) and phosphorus may degrade or eliminate EFH and its flora and fauna through several processes. Most problematic of these is the process whereby dissolved oxygen in the water is reduced by decaying plant life that prospered under nutrient rich conditions. In severe oxygen depletion situations fish and invertebrates may suffocate from oxygen deprivation.\nNutrient enrichment may also lead to direct toxicity when toxic organism populations \"bloom\" or become excessively large -- situations that are becoming more prevalent and which are discussed in detail in subsequent sections. Although affected by acidity, water temperature, and other factors, total ammonia concentrations in excess of about 2 mg/L normally exceed the chronic exposure level for fish (Mueller and Helsel 1996). In alkaline water at high temperature, the criteria may be exceeded by total ammonia concentrations of less than 0.1 mg/L. The natural conversion of ammonia to nitrate in streams removes oxygen from water and, therefore, may also harm fish (Mueller and Helsel 1996). While less problematic in estuarine and marine environments, phosphorus is a major factor in nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of freshwater systems. There are no minimum discharge standards for phosphorus; however, the U.S. EPA recommends that phosphates should not exceed 0.05 mg/L when discharged into streams entering lakes and reservoirs (Muller and Helsel 1996). Since freshwater systems may be used directly by anadromous fish, and they may also discharge into coastal waters, the quality of these waters has considerable bearing on many commercially and recreationally important aquatic resources and their habitats, including EFH.\nIn extreme situations living resources may be temporally or permanently displaced due to shifts in the aquatic food web, or by the physical presence of certain plant life. Excessive plant growth may also impede requisite functions (e.g., photosynthesis) of desirable plant life, hence\n\n291\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nEFH, as in the case of SAV where leaves may become covered with dense growths of algae, diatoms, and other biota such as bacteria and fungi.\nAgriculture is believed to be the single largest contributor of nutrients into southeastern watersheds. In the Tar-Pamlico Estuary Basin in North Carolina, agriculture is responsible for approximately 45 percent of total nitrogen loading to the estuary, and 55 percent of phosphorus loading (NCDEHNR 1997a). An additional 33 percent of nitrogen and 17 percent of phosphorus comes from atmospheric sources that include, but is not limited to agriculture (NCDEHNR 1994, 1997a). In the adjacent Neuse River Basin, 54 percent of nitrogen is estimated to arise from agricultural sources (NCDEHNR 1993, 1997b). These two tributaries discharge into Pamlico Sound, the nation's second largest estuary, and the largest in the Southeast.\nAnimal production is a threat to southeastern estuarine nutrient balances. The current usual management practice for manure from swine and other confined domestic mammals is storage and treatment in anaerobic lagoons followed by land application. This process relies on volatilization of nitrogen to account for roughly 80 percent of the total produced nitrogen, with concomitant downwind delivery in a zone of influence of roughly 100 kilometers (Rudek 1997). Airborne deposition of nitrogen into coastal waters in the region has been verified from field data to be a major source of enrichment in a number of southeastern estuaries. The most complete work at this time is focused on the Neuse River Estuary in North Carolina, where primary production was boosted two to three times by atmospheric deposition at ambient levels (Paerl et al 1995a, 1995b). Actual plant uptake by crops on land-application fields accounts for no more than 10 percent of nitrogen use. Surplus nitrogen is delivered to shallow groundwater systems which, in turn, feed warm-season surface flows into adjacent streams and rivers. Thus, the vast majority of this material is redeposited on land and in surface waters.\nStudies by Barker 1997 and Barker and Zublena 1995 also show that many North Carolina coastal counties are receiving swine-based nitrogen and/or phosphorus at levels in excess of total crop-plant growth needs. This analysis actually underestimates the problem, because it considers only direct land-applied nutrients and ignores swine-based atmospheric deposition in these counties. A report compiled for Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) analyzed manure production patterns nationally by county and found zones of very high production in coastal North Carolina and in individual counties in the other three southeastern states. That document also reports excessive production above crop growth needs in many areas (Minority Staff 1997).\nA recent estimate of agricultural emissions of ammonia from the North Carolina coastal plain is about 200.3 million pounds of nitrogen from animal waste, and 15 million pounds of nitrogen from fertilizers. Hogs alone contribute about 135 million pounds of nitrogen emissions in coastal North Carolina; larger than the entire National Atmospheric Deposition Program estimate of airborne deposition from all sources in the North Carolina coastal plain (Rudek 1997).\nIn response to nutrient enrichment problems and public concern, the North Carolina General Assembly has moved to impose a two-year moratorium on the development of new or enhanced hog farms, pending the replacement of current anaerobic lagoon technology with a more acceptable alternative.\nHigh nutrient loadings also have been documented in other southeastern river basins and estuaries. Among seven river basins in Florida and Georgia examined recently by the U.S. Geological Survey, two in Georgia (the Altamaha and the Satilla) were found to be very high in nitrogen inputs at 5,470 (kg/yr)/km2 and 5,430 (kg/yr)/km2, respectively. Animal waste was the dominant source of nitrogen loading in both basins. Fertilizer was the biggest source in the St.\n292\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nJohns River Basin in Florida, and the Ogeechee Basin in Georgia. The most dominant sources of nutrient loading are non-point-source in origin, and predominantly agricultural (USGS 1997).\nThe National Water Quality Assessment Program is also examining the Santee Basin and nearby coastal drainages in South Carolina. Data from 1994 covering 24,868 square miles in South and North Carolina are being considered for this analysis. Although definitive information is \u00b7not yet available, nutrient pollution of lakes and the rivers themselves has been identified as a major water quality issue for the program (USGS 1994). The first reports from this program are now available and include an annotated bibliography of water quality databases and recent publications on the water quality of the region (Abrahamsen et al 1997).\nImpacts of sediment from non-point-sources including agriculture and silviculture remain at the top of the water pollution list nationally (USEPA 1990) and in the southeasterin states (NCDEHNR 1996b). While sediment-based impacts are typically considered to be most acute in freshwater systems, sediment pollution can also threaten EFH. Because sedimentation is a natural process in most aquatic systems it is generally not problematic except where deposition rates vastly exceed ambient conditions. In these situations, benthic animals and plants and demersal fishes that are unable to adjust or relocate may be buried or undergo disruption in growth and reproduction. Lethal and non-lethal effects of turbidity include ingestion of non-food particles by shellfish and polychaete worms, clogging of pores and gills, erosion of gills and other apparatuses such as fins, tentacles, and cilia that may be used for locomotion and feeding, burial of eggs and juveniles, and burial of substrates that may be needed for cover, attachment, and reproduction. In areas that support SAV, primary production levels may be reduced where light penetration is limited by increased turbidity.\nWhile generally less important as a potential threat to EFH in the south Atlantic region, sediment deprivation may be locally troublesome since subsidence and erosion of wetlands and other habitats may result. Impounded coastal wetlands used for rice culture and other agricultural crop production in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia are notable since large areas have been permanently altered even though tidal flow has been restored in many cases. In the Altamaha River Estuary in Georgia vast areas of freshwater and brackish tidal forested wetlands have been converted to emergent wetlands following construction of dikes and ditches that interrupted both deposition of alluvial materials and other processes.\nSediment pollution from agriculture is widespread in the coastal zone of the southeastern states. For example, North Carolina's \"303d list,\" the listing of degraded water bodies required to be compiled by the Clean Water Act, contains an array of coastal streams degraded at least in part by agricultural sediment pollution. These include tributaries of the Northeast Cape Fear River and Black River; Potecasi Creek (Chowan River); Trent River (Neuse Basin); Little River (Pasquotank Basin); Tranter's, Grindle, Conetoe and Town creeks (Tar-Pamlico Basin); and Newport River (NCDEHNR 1996a).\nPathogens from agricultural sources also threaten EFH, especially shellfish waters. The biggest single threat is probably poorly managed animal waste. A secondary source is land disturbing activity related to putting new land into agricultural production. This may result in additional delivery of fecal-coliform bacteria in quantities of potential concern.\nThe most dramatic cases of contamination of EFH from agricultural sources include spills of animal waste into coastal watersheds. North Carolina has suffered a number of recent spills, including many in the summer of 1995. A large swine lagoon rupture in 1995 spilled about 25 million gallons of waste into the New River Estuary causing severe anoxia, stimulating toxic algal blooms, and elevating fecal bacteria concentrations in both the receiving waters and sediments. Effects of this event persisted for over 61 days (Burkholder et al 1997). Similar ,but\n293\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nsmaller, events were documented into tributaries of the Cape Fear River Estuary,North Carolina, from both swine and poultry sources. Impacts included large nutrient delivery, algal blooms, and contamination with huge loads of fecal bacteria; including pathogenic Clostridium perfringens (Mallin et al 1997). This study documented 30 animal waste spills inNorth Carolina in 1995 and 1996.\nBacteria from other agricultural sources also may contribute to contamination of shellfish waters. As wetland landscapes are developed for agriculture, offsite water delivery is enhanced (Skaggs et al 1980). Many scientists believe that this hydrologic effect may contribute to elevated fecal colifonn counts in receiving waters. This is suggested by preliminary studies in Otter Creek, Broad Creek, and the South River,North Carolina (J. Sauber personal communication).\nThe variation in the scope and composition of agricultural non-point-source discharges and in the receiving waters creates an almost endless range of possible effects on aquatic resources, including EFH. Exposure of estuarine finfish and shellfish to toxic levels of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides may occur, resulting in significant declines in populations Scott (1997). Sublethal effects also are evident. For example, many compounds released by agricultural operations may adversely affect hormones such as estrogen and androgen that are linked to immune suppression (Scott 1997). These compounds usually do not kill the animal immediately, but reduce its life span and often its ability to reproduce.\nAgricultural compounds that have been identified as having properties damaging to aquatic organisms include the commonly used herbicides aldicarb and atrazine and others such as, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, and trace metals such as copper and mercury.\nThe enormous variation in the scope and composition of agricultural nonpoint source discharges and in the environmental nature of the receiving waters creates an almost endless range of possible effects on aquatic resources, including EFH. As noted in Scott (1997):\n\n\"Agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) runoffmay result in significant discharges of\n\npesticides, suspended sediments and fertilizers into estuarine habitats adjacent to\n\nagricultural areas or downstreamfrom agricultural watersheds. Exposure of estuarine\n\nfinfish and shellfish to toxic levels of insecticides, herbicides, andfungicides may occur,\n\nresulting in significant declines infield populations. Development of new management\n\ntechniques such as Integrated Pest Management (IPMs), Best Management Practices\n\n(BMPs), and Retention Ponds reduce contaminant riskfrom\n\na(RgrPi)cualrteurraislkNmPaSnraugneomffen,,t\n\ntools\n\nwhich\n\nhave\n\nbeen\n\nused\n\nto\n\nIn association with Scott's (1997) observations, theNational Ocean Service (NOS), Charleston Laboratory examined effects ofNPS agricultural runoff on living marine resources in an attempt to define impacts on fishery resources and to develop risk reduction strategies to minimize/mitigate impacts. Investigations involving coastal estuarine ecosystems in South Carolina examined several sites used for vegetable farming (e.g. tomatoes, cucumbers and snap beans), where varied levels of risk reduction strategies were employed. The studies used grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) as well as other macropelagic populations. These two species represent more than 85% of the total macrofaunal {>15mm) densities in small tidal creek nursery grounds in South Carolina and they are important due to their role in estuarine food webs. The studies demonstrated that pesticide exposure caused fish and invertebrate abundance reductions and mortality. Comparison of field results with laboratory toxicity tests clearly established that implementation of an integrated risk\n\n294\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nreduction strategy can significantly reduce NPS agricultural pesticide runoff. At intensively managed (IPM, BMPs, and RP) agricultural sites where strict NPS control techniques were administered, instream pesticide (azinphosmethyl, endosulfan, and fenvalerate) levels were reduced by 89-90%. (Preceding from : Scott 1997.)\nAccording to Scott ( 1997) the commonly used herbicides aldicarb and atrazine are potential endocrine disrupting chemicals (e.g. compounds that adversely affect hormones such as estrogen and androgen) and are linked to immune suppression. A 1992, Texas investigation found atrazine at concentrations > 60 ug/L in 98% ofsurface water samples that were taken on an annual basis. Laboratory toxicity tests of atrazine effects on estuarine phytoplankton revealed that chronic, low level atrazine exposure over multiple generations lead to enhanced sensitivity ofphytoplankton and combined alachlor and atrazine exposure caused greater than simple additive toxicity in phytoplankton. (Scott 1997.)\nThe chronic effects ofagriculture derived non-point source discharge have been extensively studied in Florida where impacts are occurring on a large scale basis. Essentially all of Florida Bay has undergone significant and undesirable biological, chemical, and physical change due to large scale agricultural practices, including hydrologic modification, in the Everglades . While these changes are occurring primarily in waters that lie outside of SAFMC jurisdiction, they are notable because of their size, magnitude, and complexity. Two basic lessons from the Everglades/Florida Bay situation also have application in watersheds found along the south Atlantic. They are : (1) the chronic environmental and ecological effects of regional agricultural practices may be extremely large and devastating and (2) the financial costs associated with analyzing and remedying these effects are likely to be enormous and possibly ineffective .\nThe factors associated with EFH degradation by agricultural related hypoxia are only poorly understood, but are ofconcern. Thus far, the extensive hypoxic zones and conditions observed in the Gulf of Mexico have not occurred the south Atlantic region. Exceptions include relatively small, yet harmful, localized events in portions ofNorth Carolina and South Carolina. In this region, North Carolina 's estuarine waters are particularly vulnerable due to their shallow depths, poor flushing characteristics, and the abundance ofhog farms found in the coastal zone. Although the most conspicuous effect ofhypoxia is the mortality of larger fish and possibly invertebrates, even greater harm may be occurring with sensitive larval and juvenile forms since they are most vulnerable to oxygen depletion and other forms of environmental perturbation.\n4.1.1.2 Aquaculture The U.S. is not a major competitor in the global aquaculture marketplace and ranks ninth\nworldwide (1993 figures) in the value of its aquaculture products ( 1996 DNAP). About $ 1.5 billion in farm-raised seafood is imported annually, including virtually all Atlantic salmon and more than half ofthe shrimp. Estimates indicate that the U.S. supplies only 5.9 percent of its actual seafood needs ( 1996 Draft National Aquaculture Development Plan. Unpublished document prepared by the National Science and Technology Council). Considering the substantial economic incentive to increase U.S. aquaculture production and gradual elimination of technological barriers involving production and disease control, expanded aquaculture efforts can be expected in the southeast and the nation.\n4.1.1.2.1 Potential Threats to EFH from Aquaculture Potential threats include: dredgjng andfilling ofwetlands and other coastal habitats and\nother modification ofwetlands, submerged bottoms, and waters through introduction ofpens,\n295\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nnets, and other containment and production devices; introduction ofwaste products and toxic chemicals; and introduction ofexotic organisms.\nExisting aquaculture activities along the south Atlantic seaboard are limited almost exclusively to rearing subadult fish and invertebrates in enclosures such as pens or impoundments that are located either on high ground or in aquatic systems. Other techniques such as rearing in floating pens in open waters have been proposed in other regions of the country, however, we are currently unaware of any large scale proposals of this type within the south Atlantic coastal zone.\nMechanical enclosures can cause localized disturbance of benthic environments. This includes burial or occupation of the area used by epifauna and infauna, and disturbance of this zone by production and harvest related activities. In South Carolina, where grow out of juvenile clams is conducted on a moderately large scale, the pens that are used (essentially crab exclusion devices) occupy a substantial area of intertidal bottom. Although the extent of this activity is such that large-scale elimination or damage to estuarine bottoms has not occurred, the situation may eventually need closer inspection and adjustment. Presently, most related complaints are minor and deal with the loss of natural aesthetics and interference with recreational boating. No EFH related concerns have been documented as of this writing. In its review of permit applications involving placement of structures and nets, the NMFS routinely recommends that these structures be removed immediately following resource harvest or use.\nCoastal impoundments are used for production of shrimp, crayfish, red drum, and talapia in several southeastern states. In most instances, this involves use of existing impoundments, however, some of these have been modified to attain better enclosure and to better accommodate water control. From a physical or structural perspective the use of existing impoundments is not problematic in terms of filling or directly eliminating aquatic habitat, except where repairs or modifications are needed. Modifications usually involve excavation and/or filling of wetlands and submerged bottoms. Impoundments are most detrimental when they physically isolate productive habitats and preclude use by native species, or when they interfere with natural processes needed for water quality maintenance. According to Dr. Charles Wenner of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (personal communication), extremely low dissolved oxygen levels and fish kills frequently occur in impounded wetlands where tidal and wind circulation are severely limited and the enclosed waters are subjected to solar heating.\nAquaculture related impacts that adversely affect the chemical and biological nature of coastal systems may include the introduction of excessive waste products, exotic organisms, and toxic substances. {As previously noted, significant and adverse chemical and biological change is also possible with the construction and operation of coastal impoundments.)\nProblems resulting from the introduction of food and fecal wastes from aquaculture operations may be similar to certain agricultural activities (see Section 4.1.1. 1 ). Important distinctions exist, however, principally with regard to the level of magnitude between discharges associated with each entity. While agricultural operations have been shown to have large regional effects, those associated with aquaculture operations are, for the time being, likely to be less of a problem and most prevalent when pond or other enclosures are drained or flushed. In these situations Engle (personal communication) reports that entire tidal creek systems may tum bright green for a period of time depending upon the flushing rate. Except as noted below, greater nutrient input and localized eutrophic conditions are currently the most probable environmental effect of aquaculture activities in the southeast. In association with this, it is important to note that shellfish harvest closure may occur where coliform bacteria levels exceed state standards.\n296\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nThe introduction of exotic organisms through aquaculture activities is an extremely serious matter. Many of Florida's aquatic systems are undergoing ecological change as a result of numerous introductions, in connection with the aquarium and other trades, of freshwater fish and aquatic plants. Although similar results are possible in connection with the marine environment, such changes have been less common. South Carolina officials and shrimpers have been concerned over occurrence of a highly contagious and lethal virus that has been found in imported shrimp that were being grown in coastal impoundments. Concern also has been raised over the open-water capture of blue shrimp (Penaeus stylorostris) which is a Pacific species grown in c oastal impoundments . Fortunately, there is no evidence to suggest that the blue shrimp is reproducing in South Carolina coastal waters.\n4.1.1.3 Silviculture Forested wetlands are the most abundant wetland type along the eastern seaboard. They\ninclude such diverse types as black spruce bogs, cedar swamps, red maple swamps, and bottomland hardwood forests (Tiner 1984). Scrub/shrub and forested wetlands account for over 59.4 million acres within coastal counties from North Carolina to Florida (Field et al 1 99 1 ). These wetlands also have been the most affected by forestry practices and, to a lesser degree, development. At a national level, from the mid 1 950's to the mid 1 970's, about 440,000 acres/year of palustrine wetlands (including forested wetlands) were lost (Tiner 1984). About 87 percent of this loss is accounted for by agricultural development; including silviculture (Tiner 1 984). Trends in the Southeast follow the national trend with North Carolina and Florida registering the most extensive wetland losses (Tiner 1 984).\n4.1.1.3.1 Potential Threats to EFH from Silvaculture Potential threats include: conversion ofwetlands to silviculture production sties orfor\ntree removal and other silviculture relatedpurposes such as roads and irrigation ponds; direct and/or non-point-source discharge offill, nutrients, chemicals, and surface and ground waters into streams, rivers and estuaries; hydrologi.cal modification to include ditches. dikes, irrigation ponds and other similar structures and water control devices; damage to wetlands and submerged bottoms by timber harvest activities; and cumulative and synergi.stic effects caused by association ofthese and other silviculture and non-silviculture related activities.\nSilviculture presents a significant threat to EFH largely due to the concentration of this activity in landscape positions near certain EFH, especially anadromous fish spawning and nursery areas and brackish primary and secondary nursery areas. Although silviculture typically is a less intensive land use activity than agriculture or urban development (Hughes 1 996), the periodic intense disturbances associated with harvest, the installation and maintenance of dense drainage systems in wetlands and former wetlands, changes in vegetation, and the use of nutrient supplements and toxicants can significantly and adversely affect surface waters, EFH, and their associated biota.\nThe most important fundamental change with installation of intensive silviculture, pertains to the water management system. Dense drainage systems allow the removal of significant amounts of water from hydric soil sites, intercept rain, and dewater stored groundwater. The effect on the wetlands can be serious if water tables are lowered such that hydric soils loose their water content. Organic constituents of hydric soils can then be oxidized, causing soil subsidence and liberation of previously bonded metals and nutrients. Clearing vegetation from wetland soils may also divert surface water into runoffpathways to the extent that both annual average runoff and event-related peak flows are exacerbated (Daniel 1 98 1 ,\n297\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nMcCarthy and Skaggs 1 992). This runoff is a threat because it can change salinity regimes in receiving brackish water systems and it carries excess nutrients and other potential pollutants into sensitive waters and EFH (Pate and Jones 1 980).\nThe sensitivity of EFH to water balance perturbations is variable and poorly understood. Although some important species are highly sensitive to excessive salinity changes at young age classes (e.g., brown shrimp; Hunt et al 1 980), relatively little is known about the overall implications of flow modification from drained silvicultural areas. Limited studies on pumped drainage water in North Carolina showed minor impact to juvenile and adult spot and Atlantic croaker in response to pumping (Broad Creek Study Report). Effects on spring post-larval settlement periods for brown shrimp remain speculative since the effects of rainfall during pumping have not been determined.\nIn the Altamaha drainage in Georgia, water balance disturbance is thought to be a key factor in declining catch per unit effort of blue crab and shrimp (J. Holland personal communication) and an in-depth hydrological investigation ofthat area has been proposed. Livingston et al (1 997) showed that reductions in freshwater inflow to the Appalachicola River Estuary in Florida led to initial turbidity reductions and increased primary productivity. Over time productivity reductions and major food web shifts were observed, probably in response to decreased nutrient delivery. As reported by Livingston et al (1 997) food web shifts remained minor so long as river flow did not greatly exceed natural limits. There is a concern that southeastern watersheds would respond in a similar manner.\nSilviculture also has the potential to significantly affect nutrient delivery patterns into EFH, both through soil amendments with nitrogen and phosphorus and through changes in nutrient processing and delivery systems. Modification of these delivery patterns can be a threat to EFH. Typical forestry operations in the Southeast add limited nitrogen and phosphorus during the growing cycle (Amatya et al 1 996). In addition, typical wetland soils are effective at removing incident nitrogen through nitrification and denitrification pathways. Wetlands are important sinks for atmospherically derived nitrogen. As such, riparian and isolated wetlands may buffer EFH from vehicle and animal waste-derived nitrogen enrichment. Drainage networks effectively short-circuit this buffering capacity by reducing retention periods and denitrification opportunities (Whigham et al 1 988, EDF and WWF 1 992) .\nThe huge areas involved and their proximity to sensitive estuaries makes forestry a major player in nutrient enrichment. For instance, in North Carolina's Neuse River Estuary, forests accowit for 1 7 percent of total nitrogen delivery (NCDEHNR 1 993). The adj acent Pamlico Basin reflects a forestry contribution for nitrogen of about 1 0 percent (NCDEHNR 1 994).\nSediment yields from silviculture in the coastal zone are not considered a substantial threat to EFH. Sedimentation is typically lower than Piedmont or mowitain sites as a result of lower terrestrial slopes and enhanced opportunity for deposition in the slower moving receiving waters, including canal systems.\nInformation is poor on forestry contributions to fecal coliform contamination in the Southeast. Initial studies have found relationships between elevated runoff rates after clear cutting and fecal coliform delivery, but other factors were also at work (J. Sauber personal commwiication).\nNon-nutrient pollution from silviculture is also of concern, though poorly documented. A number of studies have shown release of mercury and other metals from peat soils subjected to intensive drainage (Evans et al 1 984, Gregory et al 1 984). Elevated mercury concentrations also have been found in organic sediments in riparian coastal watersheds (Otte et al 1 987). In North Carolina, fish from the Waccamaw Basin show elevated mercury levels (NCDEHNR 1 996b) and\n298\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nmetal levels in sediments are elevated throughout the Albemarle-Pamlico Region due to a variety of sources (Riggs et al 1991). Although not directly related to silviculture, real estate ventures by timber companies have converted large areas of forest land to residential property. This has resulted in much faster rates of surface water runoff and discharge of waters that contain higher concentrations of pesticides and fertilizers. In coastal areas and in inland locations bordering rivers and streams, property values may be greatly increased and the conversion of forest land to residential and commercial property is proceeding at a rapid rate. 4.1.1.4 Urban/Suburban Development\nThe coastal region of the southeast is a highly sought after place to live. With its extensive and accessible coastline and mild winter climate the southeast coastal zone is one of the nation's fastest growing regions. The regional growth rate here is more than four times the national average (Chambers 1992) and between 1980 and 201 0 the south Atlantic coastal population is expected to increase by as much as 73 percent (Chambers 1 992).\nAs the population increases so does urbanization. People require homes and related infrastructure such as roads, schools, water and sewer facilities, power transmission lines, etc. These needs often are met at the expense of EFH since residential growth has led to large scale modification of wetlands and other irreplaceable environments. Tiner (1984) estimates that about 8 percent of the national rate of wetland losses that occurred from the mid 1950's to the mid 1970's resulted from urban development.\nChemicals produced and used by people also find their way into the waters as point source and non-point-source runoff. Examples include oil from roads and parking lots, and pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers from golf courses and residential lawns etc. This has lowered water quality in waters and wetlands adjacent to urban developments. As a result, the quality of EFH is often much reduced and thousands of acres of shellfish waters are closed. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources' (SCDNR) Tidal Creek Project (TCP) provides insight into the effects of urbanization and suburban development on South Carolina tidal creeks (Holland et al 1996). This study has implications for other states as well. The study is examining developmental effects on salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pollution in tidal creeks having trophic, shelter, and nursecy functions required by commercially, recreationally, and ecologically important fish and invertebrates. The study reveals the complexity of the environmental and ecological factors involved and shows correlations between development; changes in tidal creek chemical, physical, and biological characteristics; and alteration of species distribution, composition, and abundance.\nThe TCP identifies salinity as a major factor in controlling the distribution and abundance of living marine resources (Holland et al 1996). In watersheds having the greatest areas of roofs, roads, and parking lots it was found that recruitment and colonization by benthic fauna in these areas was less predictable than in more stable environments. TCP confirms that suitable DO concentrations are essential for maintaining balanced indigenous populations of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic biota in tidal creeks and that pollution- related decreases in DO may pose the greatest threat to the environmental quality of estuaries (Holland et al 1996). With respect to contaminants, bioassays of sediments taken in connection with the TCP study indicate that potentially toxic conditions for living marine resources may occur in the upper reaches of tidal creeks in developed watersheds. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons in sediments were highest where surface runoff from roads was discharged into tidal creeks and sediment bound pesticides were more prevalent in the marsh and near houses (Holland et al 1 996).\n299\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nAs the linkage between urban and suburban development and declining fish abundance and health or quality is reenforced, the implications of anticipated population growth in coastal areas become even greater. This situation is especially critical in the Southeast where recreationally and commercially important species are almost totally dependent on estuaries for their survival and for about $5.5 billion in annual commercial fishery benefits (Chambers 1990).\n\n4.1.1.4.1 Potential Threats to EFH from Urban/Suburban Development\n\nPotential threats: conversion ofwetlands to sites/or residential and relatedpurposes\n\nsuch as roads, bridges, parking lots, commercialfacilities, reservoirs, hydropower generation\n\nfacilities, and utility corridors; direct and/or non-point-source discharge offill, nutrients,\n\nchemicals, cooling water, and surface waters into ground water, streams, rivers and estuaries;\n\nhydrological modification to include ditches, dikes, flood control and other similar structures;\n\ndamage to wetlands and submerged bottoms; and cumulative and synergistic effects caused by\n\nassociation ofthese and other developmental and non-developmental related activities. Wetlands and other important coastal habitats continue to be adversely and irreversibly\n\naltered for urban and suburban development. (Note: certain related activities such as navigation are discussed in later sections). Of major concern is the piecemeal elimination of wetlands by\n\nfilling for houses, roads, septic tank systems, etc. Wetland filling can directly eliminate or\n\ndiminish the functional value of EFH and associated areas and resources. While the total area of\n\nwetlands affected by development is unknown, the rate of conversion was once estimated at 8\n\npercent of the national average loss of 458,000 acres or 36,640 acres per year (Tiner 1984).\n\nRequests to alter coastal areas remain high and between 198 1 and 1996, in the southeast the\n\nNMFS reviewed more than 23,87 1 proposals requesting to alter wetlands for housing, shoreline\n\nstructures, docks, roadways, and other related activities. A survey of 5,622 of these proposals\n\ninvolved 19,729 acres of wetlands (see Tables 26, 27, 28, & 29).\n\nAnother major threat posed by urban and suburban development is that of non-point\n\nsource discharges of the chemicals used in day to day activities, in operating and maintaining\n\nhomes, roads, vehicles, etc. In addition to chemical input, changes that affect the volume, rate,\n\nlocation, frequency, and duration of surface water runoff into coastal rivers and tidal waters are\n\nlikely to be determinants in the distribution, species composition, abundance, and health of\n\nsoutheastern fishery resources and their habitat.\n\nResults of various studies in the South Atlantic Bight indicate that chemical contaminants\n\nfrom industrial, urban/suburban, and agricultural sources may cause impacts in estuarine\n\necosystems . Highest contaminant concentrations and greatest impacts were observed in the\n\nheadwaters of small tidal creeks which are the true nursery grounds for fish, crustacean and\n\nmollusc. Protection and management of non-point-source runoff loading into these watersheds is\n\nessential in protecting habitat quality (Scott et al 1997). In the long-term, impacts of chemical pollution (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, metals, etc.) are likely to\n\nadversely impact fish (Schaaf et al 1987). Despite current pollution control measures and stricter environmental laws, toxic organic and inorganic chemicals continue to be introduced into marine\n\nand estuarine environments.\n\nResults of the previously mentioned TCP investigation confirm that suitable DO\n\nconcentrations are essential for maintaining balanced indigenous populations of fish, shellfish,\n\nand other aquatic biota in tidal creeks and that pollution related decreases in DO may pose the\n\ngreatest threat to the environmental quality of estuaries.\" The study found that:\n\n\u00b7\n\nDO in tidal creeks fluctuated with phases of the moon, time of day, and tidal stage.\n\n300\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n\n\u00b7\n\nD O in tidal creeks in developed and undeveloped watersheds often did not meet the state\n\nwater quality standard of 4mg/L.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe most stressful DO levels occurred during early morning and at night-time low tides.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe DO levels in tidal creeks in developed watersheds were less predictable and had\n\ngreater unexplained variance than those of undeveloped watersheds.\n\n\u00b7\n\nPoint in time DO measurements in tidal creeks do not adequately represent exposure of\n\nliving resources stressful low DO levels .\n\n\u00b7\n\nLiving resources in tidal creeks in developed watersheds were more frequently exposed\n\nto stressful low DO levels than those inhabiting tidal creeks with undeveloped watersheds.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe factors that contribute to low DO in South Carolina tidal creeks need further study\n\nand a DO budget for tidal creeks and associated saltmarshes is needed so that the major factors\n\ncontrolling low DO conditions can be identified and addressed from a management perspective.\n\nWith respect to contaminants, bioassays of sediments taken in connection with the\n\nTCP study indicate that potentially toxic conditions for living marine resources may occur in the\n\nupper reaches of tidal creeks in developed watersheds. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons in sediments\n\nwere highest where surface runoff from roads was discharged into tidal creeks and sediment\n\nbound pesticides were more prevalent in the marsh and near houses.\n\n(Preceding is a summary taken from Holland et al 1996)\n\nFinally with regard to urban/suburban development, and in particular regard to non-point\n\nsource discharges, the South Carolina Statewide Water Quality Assessment for FY 1992-1993\n\n(SCDHEC 1994) provides an indication of the role of non-point source discharges in one\n\nsoutheastern state. According to the Assessment:\n\n\u00b7\n\nNon-point source (NPS) pollution is the most responsible factor for nonsupport of\n\nclassified water uses in rivers, lakes, and estuaries in the state.\n\n\u00b7\n\nOf the 26,313 river miles assessed via water quality monitoring stations, 10,534 miles, or\n\n40%, were determined to be partially supporting or not supporting overall use. NPS sources of\n\npollution were identified as the contributing factor 33% of the time. These NPS. sources included\n\nagriculture, pasture Ian silviculture, construction, urban runoff/storm sewers, resource\n\nextraction, and hydromodification.\n\n\u00b7\n\nSouth Carolina has approximately 945 square miles of estuaries, including marshes. The\n\nassessment analyzed data collected from 342 square miles of estuaries . About 30% of the\n\nestuarine areas do not fully support overall use. NPS pollution sources were identified as the\n\ncontributing factor 38% of the timeo.\n\n\u00b7\n\nOf the 135 shellfish areas assesse 63% were impacted by NPS, including marinas, 22%\n\nwere impacted by point sources, and 27% were unconditionally approved. (The percentages\n\ntotaled exceed 100% due to multiple source impacts.)\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe South Carolina NPS Task Force listed the 32 highest priority water\n\nbodies/watersheds that are targeted for implementation action. Of these water\n\nbodies/watersheds, 15 are located in the coastal zone.\n\n\u00b7\n\nSixty-two watershed units are located in the coastal zone. Based on information from the\n\nStatewide Assessment and from more recent Watershed Water Quality Management Strategies,\n\n44% of these units have been impaired by NPS pollution; 39% have been impaired by unknown\n\nsources ofopollution; 24% have been impaired by point sources; 16% have been impaired by\n\nnatural or other sources; and 30% have no known impairment. [The percentages totaled exceed\n\n100% due to multiple source impacts. Also, based on the Statewide Assessment, 38 of the 62\n\nwatershed units (or 61%) have not been fully assessed.]\n\n301\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nPoint sourc e discharges related to urbanization derive mainly from municipal sewage treatment facilities or storm water discharges that are controlled through Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-mandated regulations under the Clean Water Act and by state water quality regulations. Threats related to these discharges are probably less important than the other factors previously discussed because efforts are underway to improve treatment. The primary concerns with municipal point-source discharges involve treatment levels needed to attain acceptable nutrient inputs and overloading of treatment systems due to rapid development of the coastal zone. It is also important to consider that the portion ofwater entering estuaries from sewage treatment plants is increasing. In locations where treatment is poor, or water conditions are unsuitable for adequate dilution of discharges, EFH may be adversely affected. Ofprimary concern is excessive nutrification of receiving waters, but other factors such as those associated with non-point-source discharges also apply.\nThe EPA withdrew the storm water Phase II direct final rule published on April 7,1995 (60 FR 17950) and promulgated a new final rule in its place (60 FR 17958). This action by the EPA instituted changes to theNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater permit application regulations under the Clean Water Act for Phase II dischargers. Phase II dischargers generally include all.spoint-source discharges of storm water from commercial, retail, light industrial and institutional facilities and from municipal separate storm sewer systems serving populations of less than 100,000. This rule establishes a sequential application process in two tiers for all Phase II stormwater discharges. The first tier provides the NPDES permitting authority flexibility to require permits for those Phase II dischargers that are determined to be contributing to a water quality impairment or are a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the U.S. \"Permitting authority\" refers to the EPA or States and Indian Tribes with approvedNPDES programs. The EPA expects this group to be small because most ofthese types of dischargers have already been included under Phase I of the storm water program.\nThe second tier includes all other Phase II dischargers. This larger group will be required to apply for permits by the end of six years, but only ifthe Phase II regulatory program in place at that time requires permits. The EPA has stated that it is open to, and committed to, exploring a number of non-permit control strategies for the Phase II program that will allow efficient and effective targeting of real environmental problems. As part of this commitment, the EPA has initiated a process to include stakeholders in the development of a supplemental Phase II rule under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This rule will be finalized by March 1, 1999 and will determine the nature and extent of requirements, if any, that will apply to the various types of Phase II facilities prior to the end ofthe six-year application period defmed by the rule. 4.1.1.5 Industrial/Commercial Activities\nThe southeastern U.S. is a prime location for industrial siting. The climate is favorable, economic incentives exist, land is readily available and relatively inexpensive, an adequate labor base exists, and the infrastructure for shipping of supplies and products is well developed. Further, the region's many rivers and streams provide an abundance of water needed for textile mills, paper mills, and heavy manufacturing (e.g., steel fabricating) and other similar facilities.\nIn addition to a favorable setting for industrial development, commercial growth is ever expanding. Although less conspicious in many areas, the tourist industry also is a vital part of the coastal economy and many of the South's most popular vacation spots are located on or near the coast. With expansion of this industry, new hotels, related businesses, marinas, roads, and other facilities are being built. The increase in visitors and resource users is expected to\n302\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\ncontinually grow and may diminish only when, as a result of over use and development, the environmental quality of the area is reduced.\n\n4.1.1.5.1\n\nPotential Threats to EFH from Industrial/Commercial Activities\n\nPotential threats include: conversion ofwetlands to industrial and appurtenant sites such as roads, parking, and administrative and distribution centers; point and non-point-source discharge offill, nutrients, chemicals, cooling water, air emissions, and su,face andground waters into streams, rivers, estuaries andocean waters; hydrological modification to include ditches, dikes, water and waste lagoons; intake and discharge systems; hydropowerfacilities; and cumulative and synergistic effects caused by association ofthese and other industrial and non-industrial related activities. In addition to ongoing activities, previous industrial and commercial activities have, in many locations, ledto deposition ofharm.fol materials that are subject to resuspension and reincorporation into aquaticfood chains.\nIndustrial and commercial development can affect EFH in a number ofways. Most apparent is the conversion ofwetlands and upland buffers to sites for buildings, plants, parking, storage and shipping or materials and products, and treatment or storage of wastes or by products. Because of an abundance of hard impervious surfaces associated with industrial and commercial operations they are often major contributors ofnon-point-source contaminants into aquatic environments, including those that support EFH. Many industries; e.g., paper mills, consume and pollute large volumes ofwater including that which is needed to sustain a healthy coastal environment. Industries may also produce airborne emissions that contain contaminants. These contaminants have been shown to reappear in coastal waters and EFH. A readily observable example is acidification ofwaters from atmospheric deposition of industrial emissions and coal fired power plants.\nCommercial development along the south Atlantic coast also has been extensive and relatively few coastal areas are free of commercial development. Past development practices were especially detrimental and before adequate regulation it was not uncommon excavate and fill marshes and shallow water environments for residential, commercial and industrial uses. Such practices have been largely eliminated because most ofthe coast is either developed or protected from such practices. However, uplands are a decreasing commodity in the coastal zone and the demand for filling wetlands and other aquatic sites is likely to persist. Consequently, proposals aimed at altering wetlands for commercial and other purposes will continue to require local, state, and federal involvement if significant adverse impacts to EFH are to be effectively controlled.\nThe total amount ofEFH that has been eliminated or degraded by commercial and industrial development is unknown, but it is extensive. NMFS data show that between 1 98 1 and 1 996, 1 ,466 proposals were received for industrial and commercial development in wetlands that are subject to regulatory provisions the River and Harbor Act and Section 404 ofthe Clean Water Act. In association with this, 430 proposals sought approval to alter about 3,202 acres of EFH (see Tables 26, 27, 28, & 29).\nPoint-source-discharges from commercial activities may be similar to those associated with urban and suburban development. Accordingly, the information and discussions contained in Section 4. 1 . 1 .3 should apply. Pollution and water use may alter the flow, pH, hardness, dissolved oxygen, and chemical composition other parameters that affect individuals, populations, and communities (Carins 1 980). Within aquatic systems industrial point-source discharges also may alter species and population diversity, nutrient and energy transfer,\n\n303\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nproductivity, biomass, density, stability, connectivity, and species richness and evenness both at the point of discharge and downstream locations (Carins 1980). Growth, visual acuity, swimming speed, equilibrium, feeding rate, response stimuli, predation rate, photosynthetic rate, spawning seasons, migration routes, and resistance to disease and parasites of finfish, shellfish, and related organisms may be altered by chemical and thermal changes. Some industries, such as paper mills, are major water users and associated effluent can dominate and control conditions in substantial portions of rivers and other water bodies where they are located. Usually parameters such as substrate, currents, dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients, temperature, and suspended materials are key factors affecting the distribution and abundance of EFH. The direct and synergistic effects of other discharge components such as heavy metals and various chemical compounds are not well understood, but current research shows that these constituents may be of greater importance than previously thought. For example, more subtle factors such as endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms and reduced ability to reproduce or compete for food are being uncovered (Scott et al 1997).\nThe cumulative effect of many types of discharges on various aquatic systems also is not well understood, but attempts to mediate their effects are reflected in various water quality standards and programs in each state and within the various water systems. Industrial wastewater effluent is regulated by the EPA through the NPDES permitting program. This program provides for issuance of waste discharge permits as a means of identifying, defining, and controlling virtually all point-source-discharges. The complexity and the magnitude of effort required to administer the NPDES permit program limit overview of the program and federal agencies. Consequently, the NMFS and the FWS generally do not provide comments on NPDES application notices. For these same reasons, it is not presently possible to estimate the singular, combined, and synergistic effects of industrial (and domestic) discharges on aquatic ecosystems.\nWhere chronic non-point-source discharges and accidental releases of harmful or toxic substances mix, especially harmful effects on aquatic life and habitat, including EFH, is likely. An added concern with industrial operations is the release of contaminants into the atmosphere. Such materials may be transported various distances and directly and indirectly deposited into aquatic ecosystems (Baker et al 1993). In the southeast, surface water acidification and mercury accumulation in sediments are of particular concern since sources of these material lie in other regions and are not subject to local and regional (southeastern) controls. In view of this, the regulation of surface water contamination from atmospheric pollution should be addressed from a local, regional, and international perspective. 4.1.1.6 Navigation\nSupport for navigation in the southeast Atlantic region has resulted in widespread modification of subtidal and intertidal areas used by commercial and recreational vessels. This includes the construction and maintenance of thousands of miles of waterways such as the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and the myriad of other channels that lead to ports, turning basins, and harbors of refuge. Construction and maintenance of existing ports and recreationally-based marinas and basins have altered substantial areas ofnEFH. Dredged material disposal and disposal of contaminated sediments is a dominant issue. Filling of wetlands and conversion of EFH from shallow to deep water habitats are persistent threats associated with new facilities and the maintenance and expansion of existing facilities. Where coastal inlets are stabilized and maintained for navigation pwposes effects on nearshore environments and fish and invertebrate populations may be substantial.\n304\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nA second major concern related to navigation is the host of environmental problems associated with vessel operations. These range from contamination of water by oil, grease, anti fouling paints, and discharges of sewage, garbage, and debris to the direct destruction of EFH by grounding, anchor damage, propwashing, scarring, etc. Most physical damage is accidental; however, activities such as propwashing may be intentional.\n\n4.1.1.6.1\n\nThreats to EFH from Navigation\n\nPotential threats: Navigation related threats to EFH located within estuarine waters can\n\nbe separated into two categories: Navigation support activities and vessel operations.\n\nNavigation support activities include, but are not limited to, excavation and maintenance of\n\nchannels (includes disposal ofexcavated materials); construction and operation ofports,\n\nmooring and cargo handlingfacilities; construction and operation ofship repairfacilities; and\n\nconstruction ofchannel stabilization structures such asjetties and revetments. Potentially\n\nharmfal vessel operations activities include, but are not limited to: discharge or spillage offuel,\n\noil, grease, paints, solvents, trash, and cargo; grounding/sinking/prop scaring in\n\necologically/environmentally sensitive locations; exacerbation ofshoreline erosion due to\n\nwakes; and transfer and introduction ofexotic and harmful organisms through ballast water\n\ndischarge.\n\n4.1.1.6.1.1 Navigation Support Activities The most conspicuous navigation-related activity in many estuarine waters is the\nconstruction and maintenance of navigation channels and the related disposal of dredged materials. The amount of subtidal and intertidal area affected by new and maintenance dredging is unknown, but undoubtedly great. Orlando et al (1 988) analyzed 1 8 major east coast estuaries from North Carolina to Florida east coast and found over 703 miles ofnavigation channels and 9,844 miles of shoreline modifications related to navigation works. Between 1981 and 1 986 the NMFS received over 4,877 proposals for new navigation projects in the south Atlantic region. A detailed analysis showed that 1 ,692 ofthese proposals involved plans to alter 24,825 acres of EFH through dredging and filling (Tables 26, 27, 28, & 29).\nWhile channel excavation itself is usually visible only while the dredge or other equipment are in the area, the need to dispose of excavated materials has left its mark in the form of confined and unconfined disposal sites, including those that have undergone human occupation and development. Chronic and individually small discharges and disturbances routinely affect water and substrate and may be significant from a cumulative or synergistic perspective. EFH impacts include, direct removal/burial of organisms as a result of dredging and placement of dredged material; turbidity/siltation effects, including increased light attenuation from turbidity; contaminant release and uptake of nutrients, metals, and organics; release of oxygen consuming substances; noise disturbance to aquatic and terrestrial organisms; and alteration of hydrodynamic regimes and physical habitat.\nThe maintenance and stabilization of coastal inlets also is a prominent navigation activity. Studies and reports by the COE, the NMFS, and others link jetty construction to possible changes in plankton movement (USACE 1 980, USDC 1 991, Miller 1 988, Miller et al 1 984). This is a major concern since significant modification of inlet hydrodynamics may diminish the ability of sub-adult fish and invertebrates to reach estuarine nursery grounds. Where significant reductions in recruitment (into estuarine waters) of desirable species is realized, production declines in ecologically, recreationally, and commercially important species may result. The use ofjetties to stabilize navigation channels at coastal inlets also has been\n\n3 05\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat linked to changes in coastal geomorphology that affects nearshore environments. For example, coastal geologists have expressed concern that construction ofjetties at Oregon Inlet on the North Carolina Outer Banks could cause catastrophic beach erosion and accelerate barrier island migration (Pilkey and Dixon 1996). Such change could adversely affect the extensive and highly productive submerged vegetation beds which are located behind the coastal barriers.\nThe relocation of freshwater/saltwater transition zones due to channel deepening may, in some cases, be responsible for significant environmental and ecological change. As an example, salinity shifts after channel deepening and water diversion in the lower Savannah River caused vegetation shifts from freshwater to brackish species in surrounding wetlands. In the lower Savannah River, increased mortality ofsub-adult striped bass also has been linked to salinity increases caused by navigation-related modifications such as channel deepening and flow diversion. Modifications that increase estuarine salinities may also create more hospitable conditions for shellfish predators such as boring sponge, oyster drill, and keyhole limpet. In south Florida, increased channelization by dredging and the addition of rocky structures may have favored shifts from estuarine assemblages to reefassemblages because of comparatively higher abundances and diversities ofincoming ichthyoplankton, higher inshore salinities, and replacement ofvegetation with hard structure that favors reefspecies (Lindeman 1997). Similar situations are possible in other watersheds where dredging and dredged material disposal are prominent features; however, little documentation of these changes is available.\nThe expansion ports and marinas has become an almost continuous process due to economic growth, competition between ports, and significant increases in vessel numbers and vessel size. Elimination or degradation of aquatic and upland habitats are commonplace since port and marina expansion almost always require the use of open water, submerged bottoms, and riparian zones. Ancillary related activities and development often utilize even larger areas, many ofwhich provide water quality and other functions needed too.sustain living marine resources. Vessel repair facilities use highly toxic cleaners, paints, and lubricants that can contaminate waters and sediments. Modem pollution containment and abatement systems and procedures can prevent or minimize toxic substance releases; however, constant and diligent pollution control efforts must be implemented. The operation of these facilities also poses an inherent threat to EFH by adversely affecting water quality in and around these facilities. The extent of the impact usually depends on factors such flushing characteristics, facility size, location, depth, and configuration. When facilities such as marinas are constructed it is common to restrict shellfish harvest in a set or established zone that may be affected by sewage and other hazardous materials. It is now common practice to consider safe zones with respect to public health and aquatic resources when siting marina and port facilities.\nMajor ports in the south Atlantic region include Morehead City and Wilmington in North Carolina; Georgetown, Charleston, and Port Royal in South Carolina; Savannah and Brunswick in Georgia; and Fernandina Beach, Jacksonville, Port Canaveral, Port Everglades, Port St. Joe, Fort Pierce, Palm Beach, and Miami in Florida. Cargo arriving and departing through these ports is diverse and ranges from highly toxic and hazardous chemicals and petroleum products to relatively benign materials such as wood chips. Major spills and other discharges ofhazardous materials are uncommon, but are of constant concern since large and significant areas of estuarine habitat and fishery resources are at risk. Expansion of these facilities and certain operation and maintenance activities are likely to occur at the expense ofEFH.\nThere have been recent positive trends in the development of beneficial uses for clean dredged materials. For example, the deepening of the Wilmington Harbor navigation channel in North Carolina generated rock that is being used for creation ofan offshore reef. Similar\n306\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nactivities are being investigated in connection with planned deepening of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina. These activities will require monitoring to evaluate their success, but if beneficial other uses of dredged material could be developed. On a cautionary note, conversion of one habitat type to another may not be desirable since associated ecological trade-offs could be harmful to desirable or managed species. The classic example of this is the Winyah Bay, South Carolina dredged material disposal site, where submerged and intertidal bottoms have been converted to emergent marsh without any assessment of the ecological role of the disposal site.\nDredging and disposal of excavated materials is a major component of all southeastern ports and many marinas. Dredged materials are often contaminated and extensive testing for heavy metals and other contaminants is required. At many locations finding suitable disposal sites for dredged materials is also difficult and costly. Whenever contaminated dredged materials are placed in offshore waters, or in locations where decant is discharged into surrounding waters there is high probability that these contaminants will reenter aquatic food webs. As existing upland disposal sites are filled this problem is likely to be exacerbated. Already, direct overboard dispersal of dredged material occurs at some location such as in reaches ofthe Atlantic lntracoastal Waterway in North Carolina. In other locations such as the Savannah River, Georgia, a technique referred to as \"agitation dredging\" is used. In this case, about 200,000 cubic yards of materials are resuspended from ship berths each year by bottom dragging or by hydraulic excavation with direct disposal into the adjacent navigation channel. In addition, hydraulic bottom scour systems are presently in place in Wilmington, North Carolina, and experimental use of these devices is planned at one facility in Savannah and at the U.S. Navy's Kings Bay, Georgia, Submarine Base. The environmental impact associated with the use of this technique is unclear, but significant use of bottom scouring devices could be problematic since planktonic and weak swimming fish and invertebrates could be impinged or entrained in intakes and plumbing, and turbidity and sedimentation could be exacerbated. Ofparticular concern is those aquatic environments that contain anadromous fish since planktonic and weak swimming fish could be heavily impacted.\nAn additional, but more limited dredging practice is the prop dredging ofbottoms, mostly by recreational vessels, to obtain navigable depths. This practice is generally performed without benefit ofstate or federal permits and is almost always destructive.\nThe SAFMC is opposed to open water disposal of dredged material into aquatic systems when adverse impacts to habitat used by fisheries under their jurisdiction is likely to be adversely impacted. The SAFMC urges state and federal agencies, when reviewing permits considering open water disposal, to identify the direct and indirect impacts such projects could have on fisheries habitat. It is also their view that the conversion of one naturally functioning aquatic system at the expense of creating another (marsh creation through open water disposal) must be justified using the best available information. Construction of piers and docks also affects EFH, but the degree of the impact is often disputed. Impacts are dependent on the size, location, and number of similar structures in a given area. Pier and dock construction involves often involves jetting of pilings and this causes temporary and localized affects on EFH due to increased sedimentation and habitat displacement. Sedimentation may be a problem in systems such as SAV that are already stressed and are declining or marginal value due to low water clarity. The pilings are treated and toxic chemicals are released into the waters and sediments, but this is not perceived to be a major problem since the pilings are eventually covered with encrusting and fouling organisms. Perhaps the greatest threats from piers and docks are those associated with marsh and SAV shading and the erosion, due to wave action, of substrates in the vicinity of\n307\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nsupport piles. Substantial harm to SAV and benthic communities may also result from secondary effects associated with boat use, including constant grounding due to wave and tidal action.\nThe overall biological effects of piers and docks has not been well quantified. However, between 1981 and 1996, the NMFS reviewed requests for almost 6,000 piers and docks along the southeast coast between North Carolina and Florida. In areas having marginal depths and especially where SAV is present, habitat damage in the vicinity of piers and docks may be substantial and disproportionately large in cases where such structures are abundant (Ludwig et al 1997). These structures represent a substantial feature in southeastern watersheds and they warrant continued monitoring and regulatory review. 4.1.1.6.1.2 Vessel Operations\nIn connection with watercraft operation and support the USEPA (1993) has identified several principal concerns. These include pollutants discharged from boats; pollutants generated from boat maintenance activities; exacerbation of existing poor water quality conditions; pollutants transported in storm water runoff from parking lots, roofs, and other impervious surfaces; and the physical alteration or destruction of wetlands and of shellfish and other bottom communities during the construction of marinas, ramps, and related facilities.\nMarinas and other sites where vessels are moored or operate often are plagued by accumulation of anti-fouling paints in bottom sediments, by fuel spillage, and overboard disposal of trash and wastewater. In areas where vessels are dispersed and dilution factors are adequate, the water quality impacts of vessel operations is likely to be offset to some degree. In a study of marinas in North Carolina it was found that marinas may contribute to increases in fecal coliforms, sediment oxygen demand, and chlorophyll a, and decreases in dissolved oxygen (NCDEHNR 1990). In addition, boating and other activities (e.g., fish waste disposal) may contribute to increased water temperature, bioaccumulation of pollutants by organisms, water contamination, sediment contamination, resuspension of sediments, loss of SAV and estuarine vegetation, changes in sediment composition loss of benthic organisms, changes in circulation patterns, shoaling, and shoreline erosion. Pollutants associated with marinas include nutrients, metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, pathogens, and polychlorinated biphenyls (USEPA 1993).\nMarina personnel and boat owners use a variety of boat cleaners, such as teak cleaners, fiberglass polish, and detergents and cleaning boats over the water, or on adjacent upland, creates a high probability that some cleaners and other chemicals will enter the water (USEPA 1993). Copper-based antifouling paint is released into marina waters when boat bottoms are cleaned in the water (USEPA 1993). Tributyl-tin, which is a major environmental hazard, has been largely banned except for use on military vessels. Fuel and oil are often released into waters during fueling operations and through bilge pumping. Oil and grease are commonly found in bilge water, especially in vessels with inboard engines, and these products may be discharged during vessel pump out (USEPA 1993).\nOne of the more conspicuous byproducts of commercial and recreational boating activities in coastal environments is the discharge of marine debris, trash, and organic wastes into coastal waters, beaches, intertidal flats, and vegetated wetlands. The debris ranges in size from microscopic plastic particles (Carpenter et al 1972), to mile-long pieces of drift net, discarded plastic bottles, bags, aluminum cans, etc. In laboratory studies, Hoss and Settle (1990) demonstrated that larvae of estuarine-dependent fishes including Atlantic menhaden, spot, mullet, pin:fish, and flounder consume polystyrene microspheres. Investigations have also found plastic debris in the guts of adult tuna, striped bass, and dolphin (Manooch 1973, Manooch and\n308\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nMason 1983). Based on the review of scientific literature on the ingestion of plastics by marine fish, Hoss and Settle (1 990) conclude that the problem is pervasive. Most media attention given to marine debris and sea life has focused on threatened and endangered marine mammals and turtles, and on birds. In these cases, the animals become entangled in netting or fishing line, or ingest plastic bags or other materials. Recently, a 35-foot- long sperm whale stranded and died in North Carolina due to ingestion of a plastic float, plastic jugs, a large piece of rubber, 50 feet of nylon rope, and a large plastic bag (D. Engel personal communication).\nThe production of plastic resin in the U.S. increased from 6.3 billion pounds in 1960 to 47.9 billion pounds in 1 985. The increased production, utilization, and subsequent disposal of petro-chemical compounds known as plastics has created a serious problem of persistent marine debris. Marine ecosystems have, over the years, become the final resting place for a variety of plastics originating from many ocean and land-based sources including the petroleum industry, plastic manufacturing and processing activities, sewage disposal, and littering by the general public and government entities (commercial fishing industry, merchant shipping vessels, the U.S. Navy, passenger ships, and recreational vessels) (Department of Commerce, 1988c).\nEffective January 1 , 1 989, the disposal of plastic into the ocean is regulated under the Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987, implementing MARPOL Annex V (Appendix L). Recognizing worldwide concern for preservation of our oceanic ecosystems, the Act prohibits all vessels, including commercial and recreational fishing vessels, from discharging plastics in U.S. waters and severely limits the discharge of other types of refuse at sea. This legislation also requires ports and terminals receiving these vessels to provide adequate facilities for in-port disposal of non-degradable refuse, as defined in the Act.\nThe utilization of plastics to replace many items previously made of natural materials in commercial fishing operations has increased dramatically. The unanticipated secondary impact of this widespread use of plastics is the creation of persistent marine debris. Commercial fishing vessels have historically contributed plastics to the marine environment through the common practice of dumping garbage at sea before returning to port and the discarding of spent gear such as lines, traps, nets, buoys, floats, and ropes. Two types of nets are routinely lost or discarded drift gill nets and trawl nets (Department of Commerce 1988c). These nets are durable and may entangle marine mammals and endangered species as they continue to fish or when lost or discarded\nAn estimated 16 million recreational boaters utilize the coastal waters of the United States (Department of Commerce, 1988c). Disposal of spent fishing gear (e.g. monofilament fishing line), plastic bags, tampon applicators, six pack yokes, styrofoam coolers, cups and beverage containers, etc. is a significant source of plastic entering the marine environment.\nIn the mid 1 970s, the National Academy of Science (NA S) estimated that approximately 14 billion pounds of garbage was disposed of annually into the world's oceans. Approximately 85% of total trash is produced from merchant vessels, with 0.7% of that total, or eight million pounds annually being plastic. The use of plastics has risen dramatically since the NAS study. At present, 20% of all food packaging is plastic and by the year 2000 this figure may rise to 40% (CEE, 1987).\nThe main contribution of plastic to the marine environment from cruise ships is the disposal of domestic garbage at sea. Ships operating today carry between 200 and 1,000 passengers and dispose of approximately 62 million pounds of garbage annually, of which a portion is plastics (CEE, 1987).\nThe U. S. Navy operates approximately 600 vessels worldwide, carrying about 285,000 personnel and discharging nearly four tons of plastic refuse into the ocean daily (Department of\n309\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nCommerce, 1988a). The U.S. Coast Guard andNOAA operate 226 vessels which carry nearly 9,000 personnel annually and have internal operating orders prohibiting the disposal of plastic at sea. MARPOL Annex V does not apply to public vessels although the Plastic Pollution Research Control Act of 1987 requires all Federal agencies to come into compliance by 1994 (CEE, 1987).\nSewage and other wastes discharged from recreational boats may be most problematic in marinas and anchorage sites where vessels are concentrated. Despite existing federal and state regulations involving discharges of sewage and other materials, detection and control of these activities are difficult and discharges still occur. According to the 1989 American Red Cross Boating Survey, there were about 19 million recreational boats in the U.S. (USEPA 1993). About 95 percent ofthese boats were less than 26 feet in length and a large number of these boats used a portable toilet, rather than a larger holding tank. Given the large percentage of smaller boats, facilities for the dumping of portable toilet waste should be provided at marinas that service significant numbers of boats under 26 feet in length (USEPA 1993).\nIncreased recreational boating activity may contribute significantly to pollution of southeastern coastal waters by petroleum products. All two-cycle outboard engines require that oil be mixed with gasoline, either directly in the tank or by injection. That portion of the oil that does not burn is then ejected, along with other exhaust products, into the water. In 1990, 52,030 boats were registered in coastalNorth Carolina (North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, personal communication). Based on this number, conservative estimates indicate that about 84,549 gallons per year of oil (in fuel) is discharged annually intoNorth Carolina's coastal waters (Hoss and Engel 1996). For comparison purposes, hydrocarbon discharges for coastal North Carolina in 1982, from boating and urban runoff are about 470 and 2,270 tons, respectively. Increased use of personal water craft such as jet skis has added to the volume of hydrocarbon being introduced into southeastern waters since the engine exhaust from these vessels is discharged directly into the propellant water jet. Similar problems are inferred for other states and areas having high concentrations of boats.\nThe chronic effects of vessel grounding, prop and jet ski scarring, and anchor damage are generally more problematic in conjunction with recreational vessels. While grounding of ships and barges is less frequent, individual incidents can have significant localized effects. Propeller damage to submerged bottoms occur in all areas where vessels ply shallow waters. In addition, direct damage to multiple life stages of associated organisms, including egg, larvae, juveniles, and through water column destratification (temperature and density), resuspending sediments, and increasing turbidity (Stolpe 1997, Goldsborough 1997) have been observed in connection with vessel operation. This damage is particularly troublesome inNorth Carolina and Florida, the two South Atlantic states with submerged rooted vegetation in their coastal waters. InNorth Carolina, no official quantitative estimate of SAV damage has been performed; however, preliminary observations indicate that damage to the state's 135,000 acres of SAV is localized around marinas or other boat access points ( R.L. Ferguson personal communication). Scarring estimates for Florida indicate that about 173,000 of the state's 2.7 million acres of SAV are scarred (Sargent et al 1995). On the Atlantic coast of Florida there are about 69,360 acres of SAV and 3,770 acres (18 percent) have been scarred by prop and other water craft action.\nThe ever increasing number of registered power boats along the south Atlantic coastal zone, and those temporarily entering coastal areas through tourism ensure that this threat is likely increase over time. Power boat registrations on Florida's east coast, not including sailboats, totaled 108,048 vessels in 1992-93. Of these, 95 percent were pleasure craft (Sargent et al. 1995).\n310\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nThe rapid increase in popularity of jet skis or \"personal water craft\" is also problematic. While these vessels are not propeller driven, the water jet removes sediment from seagrass roots and rhizomes and can cause damage. Further, these craft can operate in shallower waters and can access seagrass areas with relative ease. In addition to direct impacts to grassbeds. These machines are exceedingly loud and can create large wakes. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the audio and physical environment of shallow nursery areas may be disrupted in manners which stress postlarval life stages. The degree of stress is currently uninvestigated.\nIncidences of commercial groundings are few, but where they occur on hard bottom habitats damage may be extensive and long-term. For example, groundings in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary have caused extensive damage to coral reefs and signs of recovery are slow to appear.\nThe cumulative effect of anchor scarring in seagrass beds is not as damaging as that caused by propeller and jet powered vessels. On coral reefs, however, damage caused by anchoring of recreational boats is significant (Davis, 1 977). Dragging or pulling anchors through coral beds breaks and crushes the coral, destroying the coral formation. Most reef damage of this type occurs in the Florida Keys and in nearshore waters.\nThe effects of vessel induced wave damage have not been quantified, but may be extensive. The most damaging aspect relates to the erosion ofintertidal and SAV wetlands located adjacent to marinas, navigation channels, and boating access points such as docks, piers, and boat ramps. Wake related erosion in places along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and elsewhere is readily observable and has undoubtedly converted substantial area of emergent wetlands to less important habitat such as submerged bottom. In heavily trafficked areas bottoms may become unstable and colonization by bottom dwelling organisms may not be possible. Indirect effects may include the resuspension of sediments and contaminants that can affect EFH. Where sediments flow back into existing channels, the need for maintenance dredging, with its attendant impacts, may increase.\nThe introduction of exotic species by vessel operations is linked largely to the world wide movement of commercial vessels. Exotic species may be brought into the U.S. by several methods, but capture and release in ballast waters is of most concern. With the introduction of the zebra mussel into the Great Lakes and its rapid dispersal into other waters, considerable attention is being directed at this problem. According to one estimate, two million gallons of foreign ballast water are released every hour into U.S. waters (Carlton 1 985). This possibly represents the largest volume offoreign organisms released on a daily basis into North American ecosystems. The introduction of exotic organisms threatens native biodiversity and could lead to changes in relative abundances of species and individuals that are of ecological and economic importance. This has already been observed in other parts of the world. While EFH has not been directly affected, recent introduction of a brown mussel into the Gulf of Mexico is of concern and is being investigated. It is anticipated that technology such as use of filters or open ocean exchange of bilge waters can be used to reduce the spread of non-native species. Considering the extent ofport development and shipping along the south Atlantic, addressing this issue is ofparamount importance. 4.1.1.7 Inshore Mining\nInshore mining, as a category ofEFH threats, is generally confined to a few specific locations where associated effects may be substantial. Between 1 98 1 and 1996 the NMFS received only 434 ofthese proposals for review. Of these, 307 were from Florida and involved phosphate mining. While these activities undoubtedly have a dramatic effect on local landscapes\n311\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nand wetlands, the majority are well inland of most EFH locations. Where these activities occur along the coast, phosphate rock, sand, gravel, stone, and marl are generally mined. Phosphate rock is sought mostly for fertilizer production and the other materials are used mostly for fill, roadbed construction, and concrete production. The products of mining operations may eventually be transported to other locations and construction and operation of shipping facilities and navigation channels could involve EFH.\n4.1.1.7.1 Threats to EFH from Inshore Mining Activities Potential threats include: conversion ofwetlands to minepits and uplands, or to\nreclaimed aquatic sites and uplands that lackpre-mine habitat and.fisheryproduction values; direct and/or non-point-source discharge offill, tailings, chemicals, cooling andprocessing water, and surface and ground waters into streams, rivers and estuaries; hydrological modifications including those associated with ditches, dikes, water and waste lagoons, intake and discharge systems; and cumulative and synergistic effects associated with other mining and non-mining activities. Related shipping, storage, andprocessingfacilities also can threaten EFH.\nWhere mining activities occur in areas identified as EFH, the local effect is often dramatic and extremely damaging. In eastern North Carolina phosphate mining has essentially eliminated an entire estuarine creek ecosystem in Beaufort County. In Dade and Monroe Counties, Florida, limestone removal operations have converted large areas of wetlands to open pits. While most state and federal regulations require restoration of mine sites, such action is costly and often fails to produce environments that are similar in ecological character and productivity to those that were destroyed.\nEFH designation could further fishery management opportunities in certain locations and in the case of certain mining activities. In locations where suitable mitigation cannot be provided, the creation of new mines and expansion of existing operations may be curtailed or prohibited. Other less intrusive mining operations, such as minor removal of sand and gravel, are likely to continue, but needed environmental protection measures (e.g., seasonal work restrictions) could be specified to minimize impacts to fishery resources and prevent significant harm toiEFH.\nThe construction and operation of mining-related facilities such as storage, processing, and shipping facilities and other related infrastructure such as roads, also presents a threat to EFH. Discussions found in Sections 4. 1. 1.6 and 4. 1. 1.7 address these factors.\n4.1.1.8 Hydrologic Modifications Alteration of freshwater flows into coastal marine waters, typically via the construction\nof canals, has changed temperature, salinity, and nutrient regimes, reduced the extent of wetlands, and degraded estuarine and nearshore marine habitats (Reddering 1988, Whitfield and Bruton 1989). The following summary is largely taken from Serafy et al (1997). Profound changes to the South Florida ecosystem have occurred with the construction of an extensive inland and coastal canal system by the COE which began as early as 19 17 (Hoffmeister 1974, Teas et al 1976). Today, the system constitutes a 1400-mile network of canals, levees, locks and other flood control structures which modulates fresh water flow from Lake Okeechobee, the Everglades, and coastal areas. These areas, which serve as nursery areas for a wide diversity of organisms, have experienced drastic changes in both the amount of freshwater they receive, and in the fashion in which it is delivered. For example, in southern Biscayne Bay, Florida, canal locks are all that separate this occasionally hypersaline lagoon from the entirely freshwater canal\n312\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nsystems. When the locks open, the salinity of marine waters downstream often drops 20 ppt within 60 minutes before recovering as rapidly (Wang and Cofer-Shabica 1988). This may occur several times a day and over several months, particularly during the rainy season (i.e., May to October) when water temperatures are also at maximum levels.\n\n4.1.1.8.1\n\nThreats to EFH from Hydrologic Modifications\n\nPotential threats: Most hydrologi,c modifications are performed with other activities that\n\nare identified as having potential to adversely impact EFH As such, the activities involved are\n\nsimilar or identical to those identified in other sections. Other threats are possible with\n\nmosquito control, aquaculture, wildlife management, and/food control projects and activities.\n\nHydrologic modification can involve entire watersheds and drainage basins for large scale\n\nwater diversion projects, where silviculture and/or agriculture activities are large in scale\n\nand/or intensity, and where runofffrom urban and suburban development is substantial. Threats\n\nrelated to hydrologi,c modification can involve any activity that alters water quality or the rate,\n\nduration, frequency, or volume at which water enters or moves through an aquatic system.\n\nConsequently, activities associated with industrial, urban, and suburban development (including\n\nthose occurring on uplands), ditching, draining, diking, and impounding may all qualify as\n\nhydrologic modification related threats. Rapid salinity fluctuations can represent a significant stress for a marine organism,\n\ndepending on its osmoregulatory ability and/or its behavioral response (Serafy et al. 1997). In fishes, abrupt salinity changes can cause mineral imbalances in the blood which tends to become\n\ndiluted as salinity drops, and concentrated as it rises -.. either of which can be lethal (Mazeaud et al 1977). Rectification of proper osmotic balance in response to salinity stress requires energy expenditure, often at the cost of growth, reproduction and/or resistance to other stressors,\n\nincluding high temperature (Moore 1972, Schreck 1990). The combination ofshigh temperatures\n\nand low salinity pulses on marine organisms has received only limited attention (Moore 1972,\n\nAlbertson 1980).\n\nOnly one study has examined the combined effects of high temperature and freshwater\n\npulses on subtropical marine fishes of the Western Atlantic. Serafy et al. (1997) combined a field survey ofsnearshore fishes in Biscayne Bay, Florida, with a series ofslaboratory-based\n\nfreshwater pulse experiments. A 13-month trawl project was supplemented with high\n\ntemperature - low salinity challenge experiments on eight fishes: five species that dominated\n\ncanal-influenced habitats (Eucinostomus gula, Lagodon rhomboides, Haemulon sciurus, Opsanus beta, and Lucania parva) and three species that were less common in these areas (Cynoscion nebulosus, Haemulonfavolineatum, and Cyprinodon variegatus). Of the five fishes that dominated the nearshore habitats, three exhibited no mortality when subjected to freshwater\n\npulses, while L. rhomboides and L. parva exhibited 12.5 percent and 50.0 percent mortality rates, respectively. Mortality was 100 percent for the three species that were less common in habitats\n\ninfluenced by canals. These laboratory and field results support the hypothesis that\n\nanthropogenic changes to fresh water delivery regimes can play a partial role in determining the\n\nspecies compositions of nearshore fish assemblages within Biscayne Bay, Florida.\n\nHolland et al (1996) found that salinity was a major factor in controlling the distribution and abundance of living marine resources in South Carolina estuaries. In watersheds having the\n\ngreatest areas of roofs, roads, and parking lots it was found that surface water discharges tended\n\nto be ''flashier'' and that recruitment and colonization by benthic fauna in these areas was less\n\npredictable than in more stable environments.\n\n313\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n4.1.1.9 Dams, Impoundments, and Other Barriers to Fish Passage Thousands of wetland acres have been impounded each year in the Southeast for\npurposes such as waterfowl habitat creation, aquaculture, agriculture, flood control, and mosquito control. Historically, large areas of wetlands were impounded in South Carolina for rice production. Projects range in size from minor, such as repair of existing embankments, to large-scale projects where constructing dikes and water- control structures may affect relatively large wetland tracts.\nNumerous dams and other structures have been built on major rivers for industrial water uses, hydropower facilities, reservoirs, and as part of flood control projects. Those facilities near the coast can have an adverse effect by blocking fish passage, and modifying hydrology and sediment and nutrient flows to coastal waters.\n4.1.1.9.1 Threats to EFH from Dams, Impoundments, and Other Barriers to Fish Passage\nPotential threats: Direct effects of impoundments and other barriers are removal of habitat, conversion of habitat awayfrom historic usage, alteration of hydrology, and modification of water quality by modification of temperature, salinity, and nutrient and sediment fluxes. Flow regimes often are controlled and differ substantiallyfrom pre-impoundmentflows. This can adversely affect anadromousfish migration and spawning as well as food production for prey species needed by larvae andjuveniles.\nLarge acreages of coastal wetlands have been impounded along the Southeast Atlantic. Reasons vary, but include aquaculture, waterfowl production, mosquito control, and in the Old South prior to 1912, rice production. The overall amount of impounded coastal wetlands is not known, but probably exceeds 200,000 acres. Between 1981 and 1996, the NMFS reviewed 721 proposal of varying sizes that blocked or impounded EFH {Tables 26-29). A review of 190 of these projects revealed that about 7, 13 1 acres ofEFH would be adversely altered through these projects.\nA primary biological concern for barriers and impoundments is the impact on estuarine dependent marine fisheries production. Most impoundments are managed for resources other than fish (e.g., waterfowl). The management regimes, based largely on seasonal consideration, may exclude or severely restrict access by fish and invertebrates. This decreases habitat area and proportionately, the production of fishery resources. Even if fisheries gain access, conditions within impoundments may not be hospitable and organisms may not be able to escape and enter harvestable and reproductively active populations found in surrounding waters. Other management regimes, such as marsh burning, may adversely affect fishery resources. Water quality and nutrient outflow also may be compromised.\nNew impoundments pose a potential risk to EFH and fish production and must be carefully evaluated. However, within the south Atlantic, some positive aspects are evident related to existing impoundments. Because wetlands have been extensively damaged, these areas (especially old rice fields) provide a wealth of available habitat. Further, production of fisheries organisms within these areas is often excellent. Crab production, for example, has been shown to be high in some areas and the production of many estuarine-dependent species has been observed. Strides have been made in revising existing m anagement regimes to better accommodate fishery production and these early efforts are producing positive results. In Florida, the Subcommittee on Managed Marshes, an interagency ad hoc group is making impressive strides in reestablishing fisheries access to impounded wetl ands. These types of efforts provide a positive solution for better integrating the uses associated with these areas.\n314\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nDams and other barriers have been constructed on almost every major southeastern river. They serve multiple purposes including hydropower production, water supply, and flood attenuation. Dams located on the Roanoke and Neuse Rivers in North Carolina, the Cooper and Santee Rivers in South Carolina, and on the Savannah River on the South Carolina - Georgia border are major impediments to anadromous fish migrations. Most of these structures are old and were built either before their effects on fish and other wildlife were known, or at a time when environmental concerns were of lesser importance than economic andpolitical factors. Considering the present level ofknowledge oftheir\u00b7effect on fish migration and production, water quality, and flow alteration, it is unlikely that major new structures will be built. The present challenge is to revisit older structures to determine their usefulness and where their negative impacts outweigh their benefits, they should be removed or modified. An example is removal of the Quaker Neck Dam on the Neuse River in North Carolina. Where removal is not feasible then consideration must be given to providing for, or improving fish passage and for modifying flow regimes to mimic pre-impoundment flows. These considerations will rely on new research and improvements in fish passage technologies.\n\n4.1.1.10\n\nNatural Events\n\nCoastal processes may be dramatically altered by natural events. These include short\n\nterm events such as severe storms, hurricanes, floods, etc., and longer-term events such as global\n\nwarming and sea level rise. Effects vary from potentially positive to catastrophic. For example,\n\na moderate storm may provide needed freshwater, flush and recharge stagnant water bodies, and\n\ntransfer nutrients from uplands and high marsh surfaces to tidal waters. On the other hand,\n\nshoreline erosion, wetlands destruction and subsidence and substantial changes in the structure of\n\ncoral communities (e.g., Bythyell et al., 1993) are possible. The eventual result of global climate\n\nchange is even less predictable. However, it is evident that coastlines and related ecosystems are\n\nchanging and human activities may be involved and could largely frame the outcome.\n\nConsidering the extensive level of coastal development in the coastal zone, even a minor\n\nincrease in sea level rise can have serious consequences for humans, EFH, and the fishery\n\nresources that rely on coastal habitats.\n\n4.1.1.10.1 Threats from Natural Events Potential threats: Coastal and inland storms can cause severe acute and chronic\nperturbations including habitat erosion, burial ofhabitat and organisms by sediment deposition; creation ofstrong cu\"ents that alter habitats and remove biota; damage by wind and waves; creation of turbidity levels that can causephysiological damage and disruptfeeding, spawning migration, and other vitalprocesses; and abrupt changes in salinity and other water quality characteristics such asfecal coliform levels. Long-tern climatological changes can bring about similar changes by altering weatherpatters. Large scale ecological changes may also occur where temperature changesfavor or harm aparticular species or group. Changes that cause relocation offrontal boundaries, weed lines, and stratification and temperature boundaries may also cause substantial and undesirable environmental change.\nHurricanes and other severe climatological events and change can drastically alter shorelines and associated environments including wetlands. Some changes may be positive such as the flushing of stagnant systems. However, wind induced erosion and overwash can remove and fill large areas of SAV and emergent wetlands. In overwash areas, newly created \"uplands\" are often quickly developed and stabilized and geomoiphological processes that lead to rebuilding of wetlands and shallow water areas may be precluded.\n\n315\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nAlthough the issue of global warming is controversial, all models predict some temperature increases, especially in the higher latitudes ofthe Northem Hemisphere (USDC 1997). According to the U. S. Department of Commerce, significant Arctic warming, particularly after 1920, may be related to increased solar radiation, increased volcanic activity, and other naturally occurring factors (USDC 1997). Human induced increases in greenhouse gas concentrations combined with natural conditions to cause unprecedented warming in the Arctic in the 20th century, and between 1840 and the mid-20th century the Arctic warmed to the highest level in the past four centuries.\nGlobal temperature increases of a degree or two can cause sea level rise if melting of the Arctic tundra and ice cap follow. Possible effects include: significant loss of coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangrove swamps that are unable to keep up with sea level rise; loss of species whose temperature tolerance ranges are exceeded (this could be especially problematic for corals); elevated nutrient and sediment loading; saltwater intrusion into freshwater ecosystems such as freshwater marshes and forested wetlands; invasion ofwanner water species into areas occupied by cooler habitat species; and physical changes that could have much broader implications by altering flows, food chains, and climate (USDC 1997). The severity of impact on natural resources, including certain EFH will be determined by natural and human obstruction to inland habitat shifts, resilience ofspecies and populations to withstand changes in environmental conditions, and the rate of environmental change (USDC 1997).\nOther relevant information on this topic is contained in Section 4.1.2.6.\n4.1.2 Offshore Processes 4.1.2.1 Navigation\nOffshore dredging for navigation is mainly limited to inlet bar channels and other port entrances; e.g., Port Canaveral, Florida. Toe sediments are typically coarse and the bottom communities are low diversity reflecting the dynamic nature of these areas. Bottom organisms occupying this zone are generally sparse and adapted to the dynamic nature of the habitat they occupy. As such, dredging in these locations generally does not pose the same magnitude or type of impact incurred when working in nearshore environments. The same is true for vessel operations, although to some degree the problems discussed in Section 4.1.1.6 also apply. Vessel operation impacts are mainly linked to sinking, grounding, routine disposal trash and wastes, and the accidental release or spillage of cargo and fuel.\n4.1.2.1.1 Threats to EFH from Navigation Potential threats include: excavation and burial of EFH in connection with creation and\nmaintenance of navigation channels; elevation of turbidity and resuspension of toxic and harmful components of dredged materials (includes material that cause elevated sediment and dissolved oxygen demands); interruption of coastal sand movement and sub-adultfish migration through construction of channel stabilization structures such asjetties; potentially harmful vessel operations such as discharge or spillage offuel, oil, grease, paints, solvents, trash, and cargo; grounding/sinking/prop scaring in ecologically/environmentally sensitive locations; exacerbation of shoreline erosion due to wakes; and transfer and introduction of exotic and harmful organisms through ballast water discharge.\nWith a few exceptions, offshore dredging is performed using hopper dredges. Hopper dredges generally dump accumulated material through a split hull; however, the use of these dredges in connection with pipelines and vessel pump out is becoming more commonplace,\n3 16\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nespecially where sand is needed for beach replenishment. Closer inshore, sidecast dredges may be used where wave amplitude is slight and dredging volumes are relatively minor. In protected waters pipeline dredges are almost always used since they provide the most effective and efficient means for removing and redepositing bottom sediments. On rare occasion, as in the case of the Cape Canaveral Ship Channel, pipeline dredges may be used in open waters but their vulnerability to wave damage generally precludes this. Bucket dredges and scows are employed in some locations, but such use is usually limited to situations where other dredges cannot operate due to water depth and pumping distances (for pipeline dredges).\nIn connection with offshore waters, threats to EFH are most significant in terms of possible burial of benthic communities in the vicinity of dump sites and in connection with turbidity from dumped materials. Contamination of the water column and bottoms is also possible if the dredged material is contaminated. Sediments may also be re-dispersed after being dumped in offshore sites and burial of productive bottoms is possible. On occassion, designated dump sites are not adequately studied or they change and high quality benthic habitat may be damaged or destroyed\nConsidering that most ports are located in estuarine waters, other navigation related threats may be less severe in offshore waters. Notable exceptions may include the overboard disposal of trash, cargo, and wastewater from ocean going vessels (see Section 4.1.1.2.), and disposal of dredged material (see Section 4.1.2.2). Although comparisons are unavailable, it is likely that most vessel related disposal occurs on the open ocean, rather than in estuarine and nearshore waters where such activities are likely to be observed.\nWithin Florida waters, particularly in the Florida Keys, vessel groundings represent a chronic threat to live coral habitat. Anchoring is also a problem, however, it has become less of a threat through wide spread use of single point mooring buoy systems. Vessel groundings can be broken into two broad categories: large vessel and ship groundings that often result in severe injury to live coral colonies and non-living reef framework; and small recreational boat groundings that result in numerous strikes to individual coral colonies in both inshore and offshore areas. Large vessel and ship groundings occur infrequently, but result in far more significant injury to coral reefs and other habitat types. Recreational boat groundings are much more frequent. Between 1993 and 1997, 2089 groundings were reported in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Many more are likely unreported.\n\nReported Vessel Groundings* in\n\nFlorida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FK.NMS)\n\n1993 to 1997\n\nYear\n\nTotal Reported Vessel Groundings\n\n1993\n\n280\n\n1994\n\n550\n\n1995 **\n\n400\n\n1996**\n\n399\n\n1997**\n\n460\n\nTotal\n\n2089\n\n*Data from FKNMS & Florida Marine Patrol Computer Assisted Dispatch Report\n\n** Grounding data for 1 995 through 1997 are incomplete and require further data anaylsis. Note: The above numbers do not represent coral reefgroundings alone. Reported groundings occur in all\n\ntypes ofhabitats found in the FKNMS.\n\n317\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nAccurate baseline data for live coral coverage does not exist for the vast majority of Florida coral reefs. In some cases though, sufficient data are available to allow calculation of the actual extent of a grounding incident. For example, on August 1 0, 1994, the RN Columbus Iselin, a 1 54-foot research vessel, was conducting survey work for the University of Miami when it struck Looe Key, a spur and groove reef. Approximately 345 square meters of living coral and 338 square meters of non-living coral reefframework were destroyed.\nInjuries to coral from groundings take several forms and include crushing, splitting and fragmentation, dislodging colonies, and depending on the severity of the incident, sedimentation and/or burial. In general, groundings occur on or near the reef crest where coral formations are closest to the water surface. Species commonly injured in the reef crest include elkhom coral (Acroporapalmata), staghom coral (Acropora cervicornis), fire coral (Millepora complanata), starlet coral (Siderastrea siderea), mustard hill coral (Parities astreoides), and knobby zoanthidean (Palythoa mammillosa). Species that inhabit deeper areas such as brain coral (Diploria strigosa), star coral (Montastrea annularis), and large star coral (Montastrea cavernosa) are at risk from deep draft vessels. Small individual groundings may recover over time, but the loss of live coral coverage is likely to take decades. Catastrophic groundings involving large ships or freighters may never fully recover.\n4.1.2.2 Dumping\nDredged material disposal in ocean waters generally involves disposal of sediments dredged from inshore areas such as port facilities. Where navigation approaches from offshore and inlets are involved these materials may also be placed in offshore sites. Most of the sediments taken from inshore areas are fine, contain some degree of contamination, and produce at least short-term impacts such as turbidity plumes when removed or deposited The overall effects of dumping on or near EFH may be serious, but are not well studied. The SAFMC policy on dumping (see Section 5.3.1) provides additional detail on the subject. The principal authority for designating ocean disposal sites for placement of dredged material is the Regional Administrator of the EPA. The EPA develops and publishes Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and the rule making paperwork for ocean disposal site designations. Corps ofEngineer Districts provide the EPA with the necessary information to prepare the EIS and to identify significant issues to be addressed in the site designation process. Information required from the Districts includes: zone or siting feasibility data, justification for the need for ocean disposal, and alternatives to ocean disposal. The purpose of the EPA site designation process (see Appendix K) is to establish sites that minimize impacts to the environment, economize disposal site management and monitoring activities, and support multiple users (C. McArthur personal communication).\nUnder provisions of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), ocean disposal ofhazardous and toxic materials, other than dredged materials, is prohibited by U. S. flag vessels and by all vessels operating in the U.S. territorial sea and contiguous zone. The EPA may issue emergency permits for industrial waste dumping into ocean waters if an unacceptable human health risk exists and no other alternative is feasible. The MPRSA assigns responsibility the ocean disposal of dredged material to the EPA and the COE. This involves designating ocean sites for disposal of dredged material; issuing permits for the transportation and disposal of the dredged material; regulating times, rates, and methods of disposal and the quantity and type ofdredged material that may be dumped; developing and implementing effective monitoring programs for the sites; and evaluating the effect of dredged material disposed at the sites (C. McArthur personal communication).\n318\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nTo date, offshore ocean dumping sites have been approved for ports at Wilmington, North Carolina; Brwtswick, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Miami, Fort Pierce, Jacksonville, and Fernandina Beach, Florida (C. McArthur personal communication). The COE has identified Port Everglades and Palm Beach, Florida; Port Royal, South Carolina; and Wilmington, North Carolina as locations in need of new or additional designated ocean dumping sites.\nRegion N of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identifies the following concerns in connection with existing South Atlantic Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Sites (ODMD S):\n\nOcean Dredged Material Disposal Site Charlesto\u00b0' SC ODMDS Miami, FL ODMDS Fort Pierce, FL ODMDS\nJacksonville, FL ODMDS Fernandina, FL ODMDS Brunswick, GA ODMDS Wilmington, NC ODMDS\n\nSite Specific Concerns Live bottom areas proximal to the site subject to possible impact. Effect of disposal plumes on nearshore coral reefs are under investigation. Offsite transport of disposed dredged material and subsequent burial of nearby hard bottom communities is of concern to local community. Lies within Northern Right Whale Critical Habitat and site may be undersized. Lies within Northern Right Whale Critical Habitat. Lies within Northern Right Whale Critical Habitat. Wood debris in dredged material suspected of migrating off site into shrimping grounds.\n\nDumping of trash, wastewater, and unwanted cargo is more likely to occur on the open seas since it is less observable here than in inshore waters. Prior to passage of the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA) of 1987 (PL 100-220) an estimated 14 billion pounds of garbage was being dumped into the ocean each year. More than 85 percent was believed to have come from the world's shipping fleet in the form of cargo-related wastes.\n\n4.1.2.2.1 Threats to Effl from Dumping Potential threats include: burial of habitats and their flora and fauna, introduction of\ncontaminants and toxic substances into waters and substrates, increased and harmful turbidity levels, and creation ofhazards tofishing and navigation.\nThreats associated with ocean dumping sites include covering of live bottom areas in or near a dump site; impacts to nearshore coral reefs and live bottoms by disposal plumes; offsite transport of disposed dredged material and subsequent burial of nearby hard bottom communities; designated sites that are too small to handle the load; migration of debris (e.g., wood) to fishing grounds; and the location of dumping sites within critical habitat of endangered species such as the northern right whale.\nBecause monitoring of disposal activities is sometimes inadequate, there are reports of dredged material dumping outside of designated dump sites (short dumping). One recent\n\n319\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nexample of a possible short dumping event involves the excavation associated with the Fort Pierce Harbor, Florida, expansion project. In this case, over 400,000 cubic yards of fill from this project was dumped at a mid-shelf site. Numerous complaints arose thereafter from fisherman and divers that the fill was short-dumped and large areas of reef habitat had been covered. These sites had previously served as productive snapper/grouper fishing locations. Only limited monitoring information is available to examine the specifics of this incident; however, Reed (1 996) summarizes much of the available information regarding the mud deposits potentially derived from this event.\nEven with the use of approved practices and disposal sites, ocean disposal of dredged materials is expected to cause environmental harm since contaminants will continue to be released, productive bottoms will still be filled, and localized turbidity plumes and reduced oxygen zones will persist. Further, analyses are needed for use in dump site designation. For example, there have already been observed cases (e.g., at Charleston) where dump sites were designated and then, after dumping had been initiated, it was determined that valuable hard bottom habitats were located in or near the dump site. The effects of new disposal techniques such as creation of nearshore berms and \"beneficial uses\" of dredged material such as creation of shallow water habitats and emergent wetlands are, in many cases, wiclear and may cause long term geomorphological and ecological change that is harmful to certain species and environments. The SAFMC recognizes offshore berm construction as a disposal activity. As such, its policies regarding disposal of dredged materials apply. The SAFMC also recommends that research should be conducted to quantify larval fish and crustacean transport and use of inlets prior to any consideration of placement of widerwater berms. Until the impacts of berm creation in inlet areas on larval fish and crustacean transport is determined, the SAFMC recommends that disposal activities should be confined to approved ODMDS. The SAFMC further believes that new offshore and near shore underwater berm creation activities should be reviewed under the most rigorous criteria and on a case\u00b7by-case basis.\nIn the absence of MPRSA and MPPRCA repeal or weakening, major dumping threats to EFH within federal waters should be limited mostly to illegal dumping and accidental disposal of material in unapproved locations. However, many agencies lack sufficient staff and funds to carry out mandated responsibilities and the opportwiity for illegal and accidental dumping may be substantial. The effect of insufficent monitoring and enforcement is evident by the tons of debris, sometimes including hazardous materials such as syringes and medical wastes, that are deposited along the nation's beaches every year.\nAs noted in Section 4. 1 .2.2 (above) the SAFMC has developed Policies for disposal of dredged material in waters wider its jurisdiction. With regard to use of Ocean Dredged Material D\u00b7 isposaOl DSiMteDs (SOsDhMouDldSb)ethdeespioglnicaytepdroorvirdeedsestihgant:ated so as to avoid the loss of live or hard bottom habitat and minimize impacts to all living marine resources. \u00b7 Notwithstanding the fluid nature ofthe marine environment, all impacts from the disposal activities should be contained within the designated perimeter of the ODMDS. \u00b7 The final designation of ODMDS should be contingent upon the development of suitable management plans and a demonstrated ability to implement and enforce that plan. \u00b7 The Council encourages EPA to press for the implementation of such management plans for all designated ODMDS. \u00b7 All activities within the ODMDS are required to be consistent with the approved management plan for the site. The Council's Habitat and Environmental Protection Advisory Panel when requested by the Cowicil will review such management plans and forward comment\n3 20\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n\nto the Council. The Council may review the plans and recommendations received from the\n\nadvisory sub-panel and comment to the appropriate agency.\n\n\u00b7\n\nODMDS management plans should specify those entities/ agencies which may use the\n\nOD:rvtDS, such as port authorities, the U.S. Navy, the Corps of Engineers, etc. Other potential\n\nusers of the ODMDS should be acknowledged and the feasibility of their using the ODMDS site\n\nshould be assessed in the management plan.\n\n\u00b7\n\nFeasibility studies of dredge disposal options should acknowledge and incorporate\n\nODMDS in the larger analysis of dredge disposal sites within an entire basin or project.

Earlier consideration of mining for manganese nodules and removal of useable materials and metals from seawater have not materialized, probably due to market conditions. Recent discovery of large phosphate deposits in waters off North Carolina could eventually lead to requests to mine these deposits. As readily available upland sources of minerals and other materials are depleted, the extraction of marine deposits will become more feasible and likely to occur.\nThe mining of sand for beach nourishment presents a large, complex, and politically charged threat to EFH in the southeast. Between 1981 and 1996, the NMFS reviewed more than 200 dredge proposals to nourish beaches. Most of these projects are large in scope and affect miles of coastline and nearshore habitats. Where sand is removed from nearshore environments, channels, and inlets , additional EFH alteration is possible due to a number of factors such as down drift erosion and removal of materials that eventually nourish shallow waters located behind barrier islands. A survey of 120 of the more than 200 beach nourishment projects received by the NMFS showed that about 5,735 acres of aquatic sites were subject to excavation and filling.\n\n4.1.2.3.1 Threats to EFII from Offshore Sand and Mineral Mining Potential threats include: removal ofsubstrates that provide habitatforfish and\ninvertebrates; creation (or conversion) ofhabitats to less productive or uninhabitable sites such as anoxic holes or silt bottom; burial ofproductive habitats in the vicinity ofthe mine site or in nearshore disposal sites (as in beach nourishment); release ofharmful or toxic materials either with actual mining, or in connection with machinery and materials usedfor mining; creation of harmful turbidity levels; and modification ofhydrologic conditions that cause erosion of desirable habitats.\nOffshore mining of sand for beach nourishment has steadily increased along the south Atlantic coast. Presently, sand mining and beach nourishment activities are performed along the entire south Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Florida. Major projects include those at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina; Myrtle Beach and Folly Beach in South Carolina; and many of Florida's beaches such as Palm Beach, Boca Raton, and Miami Beach. Large-scale beach nourishment has also been performed at Tybee Island in Georgia, however, the material for that project was obtained from the Savannah Harbor deepening project. In addition to the larger proj ects that can involve millions of cubic yards of material, a substantial number of smaller projects involving beach scraping and removal of nearshore and inlet sand deposits are\n\n321\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nperformed annually. While most of the larger projects are publicly funded and performed by the COE, many ofthese smaller projects are paid for with local revenues and/or private funds.\nAlthough some ofthe environmental effects ofsand mining and beach nourishment are documented there is much that is not known or studied (National Research Council 1995). NMFS and the FWS began raising questions over related effects as long as twenty years ago. In North Carolina and South Carolina concern over nearshore populations of mole crab (Emerita talpoida) and donax (Donax spp. ) was raised with several projects. Although frequently requested, no long term studies on impacts to these and other beach fauna were ever performed. The fate of these species, from a population perspective, is of concern since they are important food items for transitory and resident fishes (e.g., Florida pompano, kingfishes, and spot) that are of economic and recreational importance (Hackney et al., 1 996). Limited studies performed by Reilly and Bellis (1 978) showed significant reductions in occurrence and biomass of mole crabs and donax at nourished beaches. Considering that many miles of southeastern beach front are now filled and/or subjected to scraping and sand relocation each year the cumulative effect of this activity could be substantial.\nIn Florida, beach nourishment projects require the dredging and filling of millions of cubic yards offine sediments among shallow cross-shelfhabitats, repetition or these activities at 3-10 year intervals, and tens of millions of dollars in annual expenditures (ACOE, 1996). Among mid-shelf sand plains, often having nearby reefhabitats, dredges create large craters and increased turbidity. At both dredge and fill sites, acres of shallow water hard bottom, seagrass, or other habitats can be directly buried or subjected to elevated turbidity. Nearshore reefs buried or indirectly affected by dredging in south and central Florida can be utilized by over 325 invertebrate species (Nelson, 1 989), 190 fish species, and serve as nursery habitats for many managed species (Lindeman, et al., In press). The timing of burial and anthropogenic turbidity spikes may have important effects upon the recruitment of settlement-stage fishes and invertebrates. Early spring through early fall dredge related burial of hard bottom may eliminate habitat required by larvae of many marine organisms during peak recruitment periods (Hackney et al., 1996, Lindeman and Snyder, MS).\nBased primarily on summary tabulations of data for southeast Florida within ACOE (1 996), Lindeman (1 997) estimates that: \u00b7 At least 47 large-scale offshore dredge and inshore fill projects have occurred since 1960. \u00b7 Approximately 97 additional large-scale dredge projects are conservatively planned to occur between 1997 and 2046. \u00b7 Over 48,000,000 cubic yards of offshore sediments have been dumped within an intertidal/subtidal corridor of approximately 500 feet x 1 1 0 miles in the last 36 years. \u00b7 Over 80,000,000 additional cubic yards of excavated offshore material may be dumped within the same corridor of subtropical southeast Florida in the next SO years.\nLong-term estimates of mean turbidity values under natural conditions are not available for most areas. Therefore, the percentages of affected animals and algae that can tolerate repetitious (e.g. 2 to 4 hours to 4 to 6 times a day for three months) sedimentation and elevated turbidity events (that may approximate continuous three-month storms), are unknown. With exception of hurricanes, highly turbid nearshore conditions in southeast Florida are typically the product of winter storms and heavy runoff during the rainy season. Near Miami, Florida turbidity in the nearshore hard bottom habitat is highly variable, and affected by winds, longshore currents, swell condition and upland runoff. Summer-fall months normally show lower turbidity level (1-4 NTUs [Nepphlometric Turbity Units] and winter-spring months show higher average levels (3-7 NTUs) (Miami-Dade DERM unpublished). Direct effects of dredging\n322\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nactivities on corals have been discussed by Marszalek (1981), Goldberg (1 988) and Blair et al. (1 990). Although sublethal effects ofelevated turbidity are poorly known in tropical marine environments, some information is available. Bak (1 978) showed that a relatively short period of dredge-induced turbidity stress created an abrupt decrease in growth in two species of hard corals (Agaricia and Madracis). From both the magnitude and duration of suppressed calcification, he concluded that such metabolic shock may have long-term consequences on reproduction. Long term resuspension of bottom sediments has been shown to adversely affect an important hard coral, Montastrea annularis (Dodge et al., 1974). Teleniski and Goldberg (1 995a; 1 995b) have recently demonstrated negative effects of sediment loads on hard corals at turbidity levels of approximately 1 8 NTUs. This is noteworthy, as the Florida state administrative threshold for temporary shut-downs of dredge operations is substantially higher (29 NTUs). Such work is needed for other tax.a and would provide a scientific basis for maximum turbidity thresholds (Goldberg, 1 988; Teleniski and Goldberg, 1 995b). Herrnkind et al. (1 988) demonstrated that increased siltation can cause direct loss of critical habitat for spiny lobster recruitment. Enhanced resuspension of sediments over time and chronic turbidity may lower key growth and reproduction rates of some algal and invertebrate populations which are a basis for primary and secondary production on an ecosystem scale (Lindeman, 1997b). The potential for management decisions to multiply over time and impact unintentionally large spatial scales is of concern (Odum, 1 982; Rothschild et al., 1 994) and is particularly relevant when affected species are also over harvested (Ault et al., in press).\nMineral and other mining presently does not occur along the south Atlantic coast. Extensive phosphate deposits have been located in Onslow Bay in North Carolina and large quantities of mineral nodules containing manganese and other metals are abundant along the continental shelf floor. It is reasonable to conclude that mining of these and other materials could become economically feasible. Ifinitiated, mining of marine bottoms would cause substantial bottom disturbance that could impact productive hard bottom communities, shellfish beds,. and wintering grounds for demersal fish. Since related port and processing facilities do not presently exist, new mooring and dockside facilities would be needed and related secondary impacts would be expected These impacts are discussed in detail in Section 4. 1 . 1 .6 of this document. 4.1.2.4 Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, and Transportation\nExtensive areas of the south Atlantic have been designated and blocked off for oil and gas development. This activity, however, has been relatively dormant, unlike the activities that proliferate in the Gulf of Mexico. Initial exploration in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras several years ago did not advance due to environmental and other concerns including consistency issues associated with North Carolina's Coastal Zone Management Program. As of this writing, interest in the potential for renewed oil and gas exploration off North Carolina is again being considered. Environmental Impact Statements have been prepared for Mid-Atlantic Sale 1 2 1 and South Atlantic Sale for the exploration of oil and gas offshore of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Should gas or oil be found, the laying ofpipe to North Carolina's shoreline facilities would likely have to traverse barrier islands and associated wetlands. As oil and gas levels decline, exploration will undoubtedly resume and if economically viable reserves are located, this activity could expand and inshore and offshore EFH could be at risk.\n323\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n4.1.2.4.1 Threats to EFH from Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, and Transportation\nPotential threats include: elimination or damage to bottom habitat due to drill holes and positioning ofstructures such as drillingplatforms, pipelines, anchors, etc., release ofharmful and toxic substancesform extracted muds, oil, and, gas andfrom materials used in oil andgas recovery; damage to organisms and habitats due to accidental spills; damage tofishing gear due to entanglement with structures and debris; and damage tofishery resources and habitats due to effects of blasting (used in platform supporl removal); and indirect and secondary impacts to nearshore aquatic environments affected byproduct receiving, processing, and distributionfacilities.\nAlthough the continental shelf of the South Atlantic Bight has been the focus of moderate interest for exploration of oil and gas resources, there are presently no ongoing related activities in the region with exception ofthat mentioned in Section 4. 1 .2.4 (above). Considering the current status of the industry, a brief overview of the facilities that might be emplaced on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to facilitate oil and gas exploration, development, and production is presented. This includes drilling vessels Gack-ups, semi-submersibles, and drill ships), production platforms, offshore moored terminals, and pipelines.\nOil and gas related activities are inherently intrusive and pose a considerable level of threat to marine and estuarine ecosystems, including EFH. As discussed below, exploration and recovery operations may cause substantial localized bottom disturbance. Where large scale development is undertaken the area ofimpact may be greatly expanded and become regional in scale. The toxic nature ofhydrocarbon products and certain drilling materials (e.g., drilling muds), spill clean up chemicals, and the large volume of unrefined and refined products that must be moved within the coastal zone places large areas and resource bases as risk.\nStructure emplacement can be expected to disturb some bottom area and, if anchors are deployed, the area of disturbance could be expanded. Jack-up rigs and semi-submersibles are generally used in water depths not exceeding 400 meters and disturb about 1 .5 ha (3.7 ac) of bottom each. Conventional fixed platforms are also employed where water depths are less than 400 meters and they disturb about 2 ha (4.9 ac). Where water depths exceed 400 meters, dynamically positioned drill ships may be used and sea floor disturbance is usually limited to the well site. Tension leg platforms may also be employed at these depths and the potential bottom disturbance area associated with these structures is about 5 ha (1 0.25 ac).\nEach exploration rig, platform, terminal, and pipeline emplacement on the OCS can be expected to disturb surrounding areas. Exploration rigs, platforms, and pipe laying barges use an array of eight 9,000 kg anchors to position a rig and barge, and to move the barge along the pipeline route. These anchors are continually moved as the pipe laying operation proceeds and the total area actually affected by the anchors will depend on water depth, wind, currents, anchor chain length, and the size of the anchors and chain (MMS 1 996). With conventional, fixed multi-leg platforms, which are anchored to the sea floor by steel pilings, explosives are generally used to sever conductors and pilings. These support structures are substantial in size since they must withstand hurricane conditions and have an average lifespan of about 20 years. The Minerals Management Service requires severing support structures at five meters below the sea floor surface so as to preclude interference with commercial fishing operations.\nPossible injury to biota from use of explosives extends horizontally to 900 meters from the detonation site, and vertically to the surface. Based on MMS data, it is assumed that approximately 80 percent ofremovals of conventional fixed platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, in water less than 400 meters in depth, will be performed with explosives (MMS 1996). Alternative methodologies such as mechanical cutting and inside burning are often ineffective and are hazardous to workers.\n324\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nAssociated bottom debris commonly associated with over water oil and gas operations includes cable, tools, pipe, drums, assorted trash, and structural parts ofplatforms. The amount of bottom debris deposited around a site may vary and may be measured in tons. Extensive analysis of remotely-sensed data within developed lease blocks indicates that the majority of ferromagnetic bottom debris falls within a 450 meter radius of the site. The Fisherman's Contingency Fund, which was established by the oil and gas industry, provides recourse to commercial fishing interests for recovery of equipment losses due to shrimp net entanglement (MMS 1 996).\nBlowouts occur when improperly balanced well pressures result in sudden, uncontrolled releases of petroleum hydrocarbons. Blowouts can occur during any phase of development: exploratory drilling, development drilling, production, or workover operations. About 23 percent of all blowouts will have associated oil spills, ofwhich eight percent will result in oil spills greater than 50 barrels, and four percent will result in spills greater than 1000 barrels. In subsurface blowouts, sediment will be resuspended and bottom disturbance will generally occur within a 300 meter radius. Whereas larger grain sediment will settle first, fined grained material may remain in suspension for periods ofup to thirty days or longer. Fine grained material may be redistributed over a significantly large area depending on the volume of sediment disturbed, bottom morphology, and currents (MMS 1 996).\nThe major operational wastes associated with offshore oil and gas exploration and development include drilling fluids and cuttings, and produced waters. Other important wastes include: from drilling--waste chemicals, fracturing and acidifying fluids, and well completion and workover fluids; from production\u00b7produced sand, deck drainage, and miscellaneous well fluids; and from other sources--sanitary and domestic wastes, gas and oil processing wastes, ballast water, storage displacement water, and miscellaneous minor discharges (MMS 1 996). Major contaminants or chemical properties of material used in oil and gas operations may include those that are highly saline; have a low ph.; contain suspended solids, heavy metals, crude oil compounds, organic acids, priority pollutants, and radionuclides; and those which generate high biological and chemical oxygen demands. Pierce et al. (1 980) documented that wild fish have been injured by petroleum pollutants. Grizzle (1 983) suggested that larger liver weights in fish collected in the vicinity ofproduction platforms versus control reefs could have been caused by increased toxicant levels near the platforms. He also suspected that severe gill lamella epithelium hyperplasia and edema in red snapper, vermilion snapper, wenchman, sash flounder, and creole fish were caused by toxicants near the platforms. These types of lesions are consistent with toxicosis.\nAccidental discharge of oil can occur during almost any stage of exploration, development, or production on the OCS or in near shore base areas. Oil spills may result from many possible causes including equipment malfunction, ship collisions, pipeline breaks, human error, or severe storms. Oil spills may also be attributed to support activities associated with product recovery and transportation. In addition to crude oil spills, chemical, diesel, and other oil-product spills can occur with OCS activities. Of the various potential OCS-related spill sources, the great majority are associated with product transportation activities (MMS 1996).\nAs ofthis writing, only test wells have been drilled in the South Atlantic Bight area and these have been confined to inshore areas. All ofthese wells were capped immediately after drilling. No production or transportation facilities such as offshore terminals and pipelines have been built, nor are any such facilities currently planned in South Atlantic Bight waters. Despite this, millions of barrels of crude oil and refined product transit South Atlantic Bight waters by tank vessel every year and the potential exists for the discharge of thousands of barrels of oil duee.\n325\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nto vessel collision or sinking. Discharge ofuntreated ballast water from transiting vessels is also a chronic low level source of petroleum-based pollution. 4.1.2.S Commercial and Industrial Activities\nDirect physical encroachment into offshore environments by industrial activities is relatively limited along the south Atlantic seaboard. Notable exceptions include thermal intake and outfall structures associated with power plants in North Carolina and Florida, and sea walls that are used to protect commercial and industrial development. Several municipal sewage outfalls which discharge commercial and possibly light industrial wastes also exist. Because these facilities are relatively uncommon, direct physical impacts may be minor on a regional scale. Indirect effects, such as those associated with point and non-point-source discharges are thought to be substantially greater since it has been shown that discharges, including trash and debris, from land based activities may reach coastal waters and food webs.\nCommercial development for hotels, motels, and related infrastructure along the south Atlantic shoreline has been extensive. Because many of these developments are located on unstable and shifting coastlines, maintaining associated buildings, revetments, bridges, causeways, beaches etc. has, and will continue to have an adverse effect on nearshore and offshore processes and environments. 4.1.2.S.l Threats to EFH from Commercial and Industrial Activities\nPotential threats include: direct and/or non-point-source discharge of chemicals, placement of intake structures, and protective sea walls (often used in connection with commercial establishments), and cumulative and synergistic effects caused by these and other industrial and non-industrial related activities.\nFuture exploration and recovery of marine resources and placement of offshore mooring and unloading facilities could substantially threaten offshore EFHs. Although none of these activities or facilities are presently being planned. it is likely that continued economic growth, depletion of limited natural resources, and use of limited coastal lands will eventually lead to greater exploitation of offshore resources.\nElectric power generation is needed for commercial and industrial development, and for residential purposes (See Section 4. 1 . 1 .4). When located in coastal waters, power generation facilities may adversely affect EFH and associated biota. Potential threats include direct displacement of wetlands, submerged bottoms, and vegetated upland buffer areas for generation facilities and ancillary uses such as fossil fuel storage, cooling towers, and water intake and outfall structures; construction of navigation channels and docks for unloading coal, oil, and other materials needed for operation of generators and equipment; discharge of toxic substances from air emissions; cooling waters (e.g., chlorine); and from point and non-point-source discharges emanating from impervious surfaces and coal and slag piles; discharge of thermal discharges that may be lethal to flora and fauna, or that serve as attractants that subject fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals to thermal stress when changes in plant operation or weather occur; and entrainment and impingement of living marine resources in which organisms succumb to or are damaged as a result of entrapment in intake structures or capture on screens.\nAlthough relatively minor in its present scale, the commercial harvest of Sargassum from coastal waters off North Carolina is of concern. Sargassum weed lines and associated frontal zones provide cover, trophic, and other attributes needed to sustain endemic fish and invertebrates ofthe pelagic Sargassum community and associated fauna. The weed lines may be\n326\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nespecially important during early life stages of sea turtles and certain fish and they are important sites for the North Carolina and South Carolina offshore recreational fishery.\nThe occurrence of methyl mercury in the flesh of the large piscivorous fish such as king and Spanish mackerel and other large pelagic and demersal species such as amberjack, wahoo, snapper, and grouper has been documented and is of concern largely with respect to human consumption of these species (D. Engel personal communication). The probable source of these contaminants is atmospheric input from worldwide inventories associated with emissions from incinerators, fossil fueled power plants, automobiles, and industry. As such, the regulation of surface water contamination from atmospheric pollution may require local, regional, and international efforts.\nEffects related to commercial development are similar to those from urban and suburban development and the discussions in Section 4. 1 . 1.4 apply. Further, effects of shoreline modifications such as beach nourishment are found in Section 4. 1.2.3.\n4.1.2.6 Natural Events/Global Change Coastal processes may be dramatically altered by natural events. These include shorter\nterm forces such as storms, hurricanes, floods, etc., and longer-term events such as global warming and sea level rise. Minor events can be beneficial, but severe events are almost always substantial or catastrophic in terms of their environmental effect (see Section 4.1.1.10). With extensive development of the coastal zone, sea level rise can have serious consequences for humans, EFH, and the fishery resources that rely on coastal habitats. The eventual result of global change is even less predictable. However, it is evident that coastlines and related ecosystems are changing and human activities may be involved and could largely frame the outcome. Considering the extensive level of coastal development in the coastal zone, even a minor increase in sea level rise can have serious consequences for humans, EFH, and the fishery resources that rely on coastal habitats.\n4.1.2.6.1 Threats to EFH from Natural Events/Global Change Potential threats: Coastal and inland storms can cause severe acute and chronic\nperturbations including habitat erosion, burial by deposition ofsediment onto submerged bottoms; creation ofstrong currents that alter habitats and remove biota; damage by wind and waves, elevation ofturbidity that can cause physiological damage and disruptfeeding, spawning, migration, and other vitalprocesses; and abrupt changes in salinity and other water quality characteristics such asfecal coliform levels. Long-tern climatological changes can bring about similar changes by altering weather patters and through sea level rise which can inundate habitats and cause depths that do not support existing habitats and biota (e.g., corals). Large scale ecological changes may also occur where temperature changesfavor or harm a particular species or group. Changes that cause relocation offrontal boundaries, weed lines, and stratification and temperature boundaries may also cause substantial and undesirable environmental change.\nCatastrophic storms can substantially alter nearshore and inner shelf environments. Some of these changes may be brief and insignificant while others may persist and affect the long-term geological and ecological evolution of coastal environments. How well coastal wetlands survive climate change and resultant sea level rise depends upon the rate of relative sea level rise and marsh accretion. Relative sea level rise is a function of both land submergence and real water level rise. Since both processes lower land surface relative to water levels, it is often difficult to separate the relative magnitudes of each. Global estimates on sea level rise conceal a significant\n327\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nvariation in relative sea level change found in various regions of the U.S., ranging from over 1 0 mm per year decline in the sea surface along the coast of southeastern Alaska to a 10 mm per year rise along the northeastern Main and Louisiana coasts (Stevenson et al 1 986).\nIn the face of rising relative sea level, coastal marshes may keep pace if vertical marsh accretion increases sufficiently. At the current rate of sea level rise, most coastal wetlands of the East and Gulf Coast of the U.S. have kept pace with sea level rise (Stevenson et al 1 986). Out of 1 8 U.S. wetlands for which sufficient data on accretion rates and relative sea level rise are available, only four sites (encompassing the Mississippi River Delta and Blackwater Marsh in the Chesapeake B ay) have not accrued sediment fast enough to keep pace with relative sea level rise. Wetland response to sea level rise is determined largely by tidal range magnitude and, in general, wetlands in regions with relatively small tidal ranges have lower rates of vertical accretion because less sediment is transported by tidal action (Stevenson et al 1 986). By the same token, coastal areas with higher tidal ranges are less vulnerable to sea level rise (Reid and Trexler 1 991 ).\nHurricanes play a critical role in the structure of both coral reef habitats and the organism assemblage that use these habitats. See Linnan and Fong (1 997) for a recent summary of much of this litterature relevant to the Florida Reef Tract.\nBoth sea level rise and changing water temperatures will influence U.S. coral reefs located in southern Florida, on small isolated banks in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana and Texas, and off Puerto Rico and Hawaii. At current rates, sea level rise (1 to 2 mm/yr) does not inhibit coral reefvertical growth, estimated to be roughly 1 0 mm/yr (Grigg and Epp 1 989); sea level rise under scenarios of global warming is likely to equal or exceed these limits (Reid and Trexler 1 991 ).\nCoral bleaching, which involves the loss of the mutualistic algae living with the coral is believed to stem from such stresses as sedimentation, pollution, or unusually cold or warm water temperatures. With bleaching, energy needed for growth is insufficient and if bleaching is frequent protracted death may result (Goreau 1990a). Coral bleaching has been observed sporadically around the world for decades and was almost always linked to localized conditions such as muddy river water plumes, or elevated water temperature. In the past decade; however, coral bleaching has taken place on an unprecedented and worldwide scale with bleaching episodes occurring in 1 980, 1983, 1 987-88, and 1 990 (Goreau 1 990a, William and Williams 1 990, Williams 1 990). In the Caribbean, all ofthe major bleaching episodes in the 1 980's have been associated with above-normal water temperatures (Goreau 1990b).\nWater temperature increases of2 to 3 degrees above normal can cause bleaching at any latitude. Corals may be able to adapt physiologically to gradual temperature increases, but rapid increases, as presently predicted with global warming could cause coral die-offs. 4.2 Adverse Impacts of Fishing Activities on Essential Fish Habitat 4.2.1 Introduction\nThe Sustainable Fisheries Act requirement for identification ofthreats to EFH posed by fishing activities will be addressed in a report by Peter Auster and Richard Langton that is being prepared, under contract, for the NMFS. A copy ofthe draft report (Auster and Langton 1998) is is available and is included as Appendix M to this document. Information relavant to the south Atlantic contained in the final report will summarized and included in a later version of this document.\nThe effects of fishing are the subject of numerous, mostly site specific and fishery specific, investigations that focus largely on economic and social factors. Most early fisheries\n328\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nmanagement efforts deal with increased yields, gear, and identifying and locating new target species and markets. With the world wide decline ofmany fish stocks emphasis has shifted, in recent years, to stock management and recovery. This change in management emphasis has gradually led to realization that reductions in the size and quality of fishery habitats have reached critical levels. It has also furthered the view that, in certain situations, fishing itself may be profoundly changing the physical and biological character offish harvest and life requisite areas.\nTrawling and other fishing activities that involve direct contact between fishing gear and the aquatic environment can alter the structural character of fish habitats. When the change is sufficient enough to preclude or limit use by fishery directed or target species, declines in catch abundance and individual fish size may occur. Although a clear cause and effect relationship is evident, determination of the level of effect inducted by physical change may be complex. Relevant factors, in addition to the magnitude of the direct physical change, may include disturbance frequency and duration, seasonality, and other environmental, ecological, and physiological processes that control recovery and recruitment of requisite species of the community. As noted by Auster and Langton (1 998) \"... mobile fishing gear reduced habitat complexity by (1 ) directly removing epifauna or damaging epifauna leading to mortality, (2) smoothing sedimentary bedforms and reducing bottom roughness, and (3) removing taxa which produce structure (i.e., taxa which produce burrows and pits).\"\nAs difficult and complex as restoring habitats and controlling fish harvest has proven to be, success in these efforts still may not yield satisfactory results. Environmental changes brought about by physical alteration of substrates and changes in species composition may create conditions that cannot sustain preexisting plant and animal assemblages or abundances. As noted by Auster and Langton (1 998), population response (and successful fishery management) may be linked to parameters that are closely correlated to...ecological relationships (and) population response may be the result of \"(1 ) independent single-species (intraspecific) responses to fishing and natural variation, (2) interspecific interactions such that as specific populations are reduced by fishing, non-harvestedpopulations experienced a competitive release, (3) interspecific interactions such that as non-harvested species increase from some external process, their population inhibits the population growth rate of the harvested species, and (4) habitat mediation of the carrying capacity for each species, such that gear induced habitat changes alter the carrying capacity of the area.\" As further implied by Auster and Langton (1 998), the magnitude of environmental or ecological change needed to affect a fishery may not need to be monumental from a physical perspective. After all, significant reductions in benthic diatoms and microalgae can affect higher trophic levels.\nIn their conclusion Auster and Langton (1998) state, \"...primary information is lacking for us to strategically manage fishing impacts on EFH without invoking precautionary measures. A number of areas where primary data are lacking, which allow better monitoring and improved experimentation, ultimately leading to improved predictive capabilities, are:\n1 . The spatial extent of fishing induced disturbance . While many observer programs collect data at the scale of single tows or sets, the fisheries reporting systems often lack this level of spatial resolution. The available data makes it difficult to make observations, along a gradient offishing effort, in order to assess the effects of fishing effort on habitat, community, and ecosystem processes.\n2. The effects of specific gear types, along with a gradient of effort on specific habitat types. These data are the first order needs to allow an assessment of how much effort produces a\n329\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nmeasurable level of change in structural habitat components and the associated communities. Second order data should assess the effects of fishing disturbance in a gradient of type 1 and type 2 disturbance treatments.\n3. The role of sea floor habitats on the population dynamics of harvested demersal species. While there is often good time series data on late juvenile and adult populations, and larval abundance, there is a general lack of empirical information (except in coral reef, kelp bed, and for SAV fishes) on linkages between EFH and survival, which would allow modeling and experimentation to predict outcomes of various levels of disturbance.\"\nAuster and Langton (1998) further state that, \"Recovery of benthic communities, especially for sessile invertebrates, is dependent upon recruitment at the larval stages. Two aspects of this process that are necessary for success are 1) proximity of reproductively mature adults, and 2) an undisturbed site for settlement and growth to maturity. If the intensity of fishing is too great then the possibility of a type 2 disturbance, where a small patch of reproductive animals is isolated by large expanses of sea floor, exists. The frequency of disturbance is equally important because newly settled juveniles may be damaged or destroyed if their settlement surface is perturbed at a critical time in their life cycle. Fishing should therefore be conducted with an intensity that does not create isolated benthic communities that are then expected to recolonize an area if the objective is a sustainable level of harvest. Similarly the habitat requirements of the harvested species have to be taken into account, as suggested in terms of 1 and 3 above, to insure that the habitat itself is not disturbed anymore frequently than is required to maintain the integrity of the benthic community that supports the fishery.\" 4.2.2 Gear Impacts and Council Action 4.2.2.1 Gear Used in Fisheries Under South Atlantic Council Fishery Management Plans\nThe following is a list of gear currently in use (or regulated) in fisheries managed under the South Atlantic Council fishery management plans. In general if gear is not listed it is prohibited or not commonly used in the fishery: Snapper Grouper Fishery Management Plan 1. Vertical hookand-line gear, including hand-held rod and manual or electric reel or\n\"bandit gear\" with manual, electric or hydraulic reel (recreational and commercial). 2. Spear fishing gear including powerheads (recreational and commercial). 3. Bottom longlines (commercial).\n- Prohibited south of a line running east of St. Lucie In1et, Florida and in depths less than SO fathoms north of that line. -May not be used to fish for wreckfish. 4. Sea bass pots (commercial). -May not be used or possessed in multiple configurations. -Pot size, wire mesh size and construction restrictions. -May not be used in the EEZ south of a line running due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n330\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n5. Special Management Zones (created under the Snapper Grouper FMP). -Sea bass pots are prohibited in all Special Management Zones. -Fishing may only be conducted with hand-held hook-and-line gear (including manual, electric, or hydraulic rod and reel) and spearfishing gear in specified Special Management Zones, however, in other specified Special Management Zones a hydraulic or electric real that is permanently affixed to a vessel (\"bandit gear\") and/or spear fishing gear (or only powerheads) are prohibited.\nShrimp Fishery Management Plan 1 . Shrimp trawls -- wide-ranging types including otter trawls, mongoose trawls, rock shrimp\ntrawls, etc. (commercial). -Specified areas are closed to trawling for rock shrimp. Red Drum Fishery Management Plan 1. No harvest or possession is allowed in or from the EEZ (no gear specified). Golden Crab Fishery Management Plan 1. Crab traps (commercial). -May not be fished in water depths less than 900 feet in the northern zone and 700 feet in the middle and southern zones. -Trap size, wire mesh size and construction restrictions. Coral, Coral Reefs, and Live/Hard Bottom Habitat. 1. Hand harvest only for allowable species (recreational and commercial). 2. Oculina Bank Habitat Area of Particular Concern -Fishing with bottom longlines, bottom trawls, dredges, pots or traps is prohibited. -Fishing vessels may not anchor, use an anchor and chain, or use a grapple and chain. Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resource Fishery Management Plan 1. Hook and line gear, usually rod and reel or bandit gear, hand lines, flat lines etc. (recreational and commercial). 2. Runaround gillnets or sink nets (commercial). -A gillnet must have a float line less than 1,000 yards in length to fish for coastal migratory pelagic species. -Gillnets must be at least 4-3/4 inch stretch mesh. 3. Purse seines for other coastal migratory species (commercial) with an incedental catch allowance for Spanish mackerel (10%) and king mackerel (1%). 4. Surface longlines primarily for dolphin. Spiny Lobster Fishery Management Plan 1. Traps, hand harvest, dip nets and bully nets (recreational and commercial). -Trap size and construction restrictions. 4.2.2.2 Physical Alterations Commercial and recreational fishing can potentially stress the health of the coral or coral reefs. These fishing operations are directed at a multitude of finfish and shellfish that live near or in coral habitats. Among the most important such species near outer bank reefs are snappers\n331\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n(Lutjanus spp. and Rhombop/ites spp. ), grouper (Mycteroperca spp.), and tilefish (Lopholatilus spp. ) (Bright and Pequegnat, 1974; Antonius, et al., 1978). Patch reefs and hard bottoms supply habitat to comparably diverse fisheries stocks, including the fish listed above, plus stone crabs (Menippe mercenaria), spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus), shrimp (Penaeus spp. ), and many others (Smith, 1976; Hopkins, et al ., 1977; Davis, 1979, personal communication). Nearly all areas in which corals live support some type of fishing venture. Tropical specimen collectors harvest fish from areas with or without corals. Extensive tropical fish collecting may alter ecological relationships. Fish collectors harvest mostly juveniles from waters less than 15 m (50 ft) deep (Feddem, 1979, personal communication). Fish populations in deeper waters and in difficult collecting areas (e.g. coral reefs) may remain as recruitment reserves.\nIn addition to specific fishing-related stresses, fish gear impacts may also be an important source of coral destruction both inside and outside state waters. Based on observations ofthe industry and conversations with scientists in the field, these potential gear damages could include shrimp trawling in hard bottom areas, calico scallop dredging, snapper-grouper trawling, shrimpers trawling for lobsters, lobster pot fishing, and reef fish traps. In each case, the gear is equipped with weights or chains that may physically damage corals and associated biota. Geographically, these activities occur in the northeastern and eastern Gulf of Mexico (shrimp trawling, scallop dredging), the shelf off western Florida between St. Marks and Tarpon Springs (trawling), Florida Middle Grounds near parts of Tarpon Springs and Madeira Beach (snapper and grouper}, the Florida Keys (lobster potting, lobster trawling, fish traps), off northeastern Florida and Georgia (rock shrimp, brown shrimp), and off Georgia and South Carolina (shrimp trawling, snapper-grouper trawling). The potential impacts include disruption of the hard bottom communities inhabited by the silt-tolerant corals (Solenastrea, Oculina, and Siderastrea), sponges, shellfish, and fin.fish in the Gulf and off the southeastern states; physical harm to coral reefs that have fish or shellfish traps dropped on, dragged through, or swept into them; and possible biological harm to the reefassociated biota (e.g., lobster pot removal of adult tropical fish and fish trap removal of resident reef species). The opinion that lobster traps are harmful to hard bottom areas when they are fished with excessively long buoy lines has been expressed. These practices in shallow waters entail dragging the traps across the bottom during retrieval.\nBottom longline fishing for snapper and grouper had expanded in the management area as a result of economic stress in other fisheries. Lines were frequently set adjacent to coral reefs where reef fishes congregate. They are not normally set across the reefs because ofpotential loss of the gear. An increased use of stronger wire cable for longline allows use of the gear over hard bottom with less risk of gear loss, but with more potential for habitat damage. Jaap (1981, personal communication) has identified two species ofcorals brought in by bottom longline fishermen.\nSignificant user conflict developed between traditional reef fish fishermen and roller trawl fishing vessels off Daytona Beach. The former claims that roller trawls are destroying the habitat, including Oculina varicosa coral banks.\nTunnicliffe (1980) reported coral damage in Jamaica where large fish traps thrown on the reefs caused much breakage and death of corals. Similarly, a Florida fish trap study (Taylor and McMichaels, 198 1 , personal communication) reported coral pieces, some identified as staghom in traps, indicating that wire traps will break some fragile corals.\nThe impact of fishing activities on coral via incidental catch has been studied by the St. Petersburg laboratory of the Florida Department ofNatural Resources. The study, sponsored by the National Marine Fisheries Service during 1978, consisted of onboard sampling ofcollections from 196 shrimp trawls on the shelf off western Florida, between Apalachicola and Dry\n332\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nTortugas. Results showed soft corals (Renilla) in 25 of the 196 trawls, with most of those trawls in the northern Gulf region near Apalachicola. The quantity of corals per trawl ranged from only a few pieces to about 25.\nImpacts from fishing may be categorized as physical or chemical. Physical impacts may result from gear damage or simply gear use. Nets and pots may be lost on reef outcroppings as seen near Dry Tortugas and at the Sambo Reefs In the Keys (Bright and Jaap, in press). Hand fishing by spear or lobster loop may result in overturned coral heads or damaged corals from diver contact. Hook and line fishing may affect corals to a limited extent, but not nearly so much as towed or emplaced gear. Lobstering with traps directly on corals is a rare, accidental occurrence that can damage fragile species (Acropora cervicornis or staghom coral) or large brain corals like Diploria (Bright and Jaap, in press). Lobsters and other reef residents may also be collected by stunning with poisons or explosions. Jaap and Wheaton (1975) conducted field studies on acetone, quinaldine in an acetone solution, and Chem-Fish-Collector (a commercial rotenone preparation) and also reviewed the literature on anesthetics and poisons. Their field studies on gorgonians and scleractinians at Eastern and Western Sambo Reefs off Boca Chica Key, Florida, revealed that rotenone and quinaldine often induced coral polyp retraction and occasionally caused tissue discoloration. The scleractinians Acropora cervicornis, A. palmata, Siderastrea siderea, Diploria strigosa, and Dichocoenia stokesii were damaged by the rotenone (Jaap and Wheaton, 1974). Several gorgonians and other test corals were not affected by the chemicals at the test levels. Associated reef species such as the urchin, Diadema antillarum and some crabs and shrimps, vacated the treatment area or died. Quinaldine and bleach are used to stun or drive out mobile animals to ease live capture; rotenone is a toxicant when used in sufficient doses (Jaap, 1979, personal communication). In the Bahamas, chlorine bleach fishing among corals was a common practice of fishermen. Often, a characteristic pattern of infection ensues whereby zones of the blue-green algae, Oscillatoria submembranacea, the bacteria, Desulfovibrio and Beggiatoa invade the stressed coral tissues (Campbell, 1977). Explosives may be used in some areas to collect fish (Ronquillo, 1950; Christian, 1973) or move coral rock, but its damage to living corals has never been adequately quantified (Johannes, 1975). Explosives do not appear to be in use at this time, but were used at Carysfort Reef near Key Largo from about 1900 to the early 1950s (Shinn, 1979, personal communication). Damage throughout that period was severe but recovery since the 1950s has resulted in no visible effects of the blasting.\nLastly are the possible impacts of artificial fishing reefs. Throughout the management area, fishing associations, state resource agencies, and private groups have built artificial reefs on the inner continental shelf. In many instances tires have been the primary reef building blocks. Problems arise, however, when the bundles of tires weighted with concrete break loose from their mooring and roll about unanchored. In Monroe County, Florida, near Coffins Patch Reef off Marathon, the damage to coral has been so severe that the tires were removed (Richard Heibling, personal communication). A similar problem occurred off Fort Myers, Florida (Casey, 1979, personal communication). The problem appears to be proper placement of the reef and not the construction, Although the untethered tires are doing much damage, artificial reefs finnly attached do provide valuable habitat for many fishes.\n4.2.2.3 Fish Traps 4.2.2.3.1 Trap Loss and Ghost Fishing TRAP LOSSES (from Kelly, 1990 as summarized in SAFMC 199 1a)\nThere are many reasons why fish traps are lost both inshore and offshore. A common reason is gear failure, which includes pot warp (line) parting, the buoy separating from the pot\n333\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nwarp or the buoy breaking up. This gear failure can be caused by normal wear and tear, powerboat propellers, and sea turtles or sea gulls biting the buoys or pot warp. Theft is also a major cause of lost traps in many areas. Losses occur because of setting the traps too deep or on too steep a slope. Storm surge and wave action can cause loss of traps, particularly in shallow inshore waters. Traps without buoys are less susceptible to storm damage, but may be moved from a site by currents or wave action and become unretrievable. In coralline areas, the buoy lines may become entangled on coral, chafe, and break. Offshore, losses are primarily caused by large vessels cutting or dragging gear, gear failure, and storms. Strong currents submerging buoys or sweeping traps away from the locations where they were set and traps becoming entangled with other fishing gear and anchors have also been cited as causes oftrap loss.\nThe percentage of traps lost varied considerably among studies by both area and depth fished. Wolf and Chislett (1 974) reported pot losses of 10-20% per trip in exploratory efforts in deep water shelf edges in the Virgin Islands. They attributed these losses to pots tumbling down steep slopes. While trap fishing off Boca Raton, Florida, Craig (1 976) had a trap loss approaching 20% for a period of six months, with at least some loss due to theft. In Broward County, Florida trap fishermen, had an average of 20.3% annual loss due mainly to strong currents, entanglement and theft. Dade County, Florida trap fishermen reported losing 1 -5 traps per trip, with an annual loss of 1 00%. Losses were due to theft or loss ofbuoys. Traps (sic) theft was such a problem that traps were brought back to port at the end of each fishing day in Dade (Sutherland and Harper, 1 983). Munro (sic) County, Florida trap fishermen had estimated average annual trap losses of 63%. The losses were mainly from currents and severance of buoys by large ships in deep water and from vandalism inshore. Trap loss was not a problem in Collier County, Florida with an annual loss of only 5%. This was possibly due to the fact that fishermen brought back traps to the dock after each trip (Taylor and McMichael, 1 983). About 85% of traps used ofIKey Biscayne, Florida in a study on mesh selectivity by Sutherland et al. (1 987) were lost with most losses attributed to theft. Trap loss due to theft and vessels cutting of fouling lines was reported as a major problem in the Virgin Islands (Swingle et al., 1 970; Olsen et al., 1 974; Sylvester, 1972).\nIn Jamaica, Munro and Thompson (1 973) had such a theft problem in their study that the use of buoyed traps had to be abandoned. While losses due to theft, storms, and vessels can not easily be controlled, the trap fishermen can inspect gear frequently for wear and tear and use more durable materials. GHOST TRAPS AND DERELICT TRAPS (from Kelly, 1 990 as summarized in SAFMC 1 991a)\nFish traps that fishermen cannot locate and retrieve or that are abandoned, but still capable of catching fish, are referred to as ghost traps. Ghost traps have long been a subject of concern, but opinions have changed considerably since Olsen et al. (1 978) made their observations. They noted that if traps were lost, mortality ofjuvenile and forage species could decimate a fishing ground. They suggested that considerable mortality could take place over the 1 -2 years before the mesh corroded away, and indicated corrosion time would be longer and mortality would be greater for small sizes of mesh. A more recent study made by Harper and McClelland (1 983) estimated the average fishing life of eight traps observed off Key Biscayne to be from 5.5 to 157 days before becoming unable to capture fish. While the decay and catch rates of ghost traps are not well documented, at least some evidence indicates that lost traps quickly become damaged and ineffective (Sutherland et al., 1 978). Most of the reports of injury and mortality of ghost traps appear to be anecdotal. However, an underwater video was presented to the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council on June 1 1 , 1 990 that documented dead and\n334\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\ninjured fish in ghost traps in the Florida Keys. The video was presented by Femand Braun in an effort to persuade the council to ban fish traps. Also, in the Hatper and McClelland (1 983) study, 19.2% ofthe 130 fish known to enter their traps were reported to die.\nDerelict traps are lost or abandoned traps that are incapable of catching fish due to structural damage or deterioration. Derelict traps have small holes or breaks in the wire mesh, gaps between ceiling and floor panels and walls, or entire panels deteriorated or missing (Smolowitz, 1978).\nTraps become derelict in a number of ways. Predator damage, wire mesh corrosion, escape windows opening, and materials fastened to escape devices decomposing have all been documented.\nMunro et al. (1971) speculated that lost traps that have accumulated large numbers of fish may be attacked and rendered ineffective by large predators such as nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma ci\"atum). Hatper and McClelland (1 983) found the funnel openings enlarged with the prongs bent back and speculated that the damage was by large predators attempting to escape. Seams were also split by predators such as cubera snapper (Lutjanus cyanopteros), great barracuda (Sphyraena ba\"acuda), yellow jacks (Caranx bartholomae), and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) in Hatper and McClelland's study. He found mortality of these large predators to be high. In Craig's study (1 976) escapement through trap holes caused by predators became a problem if traps were not hauled after 5 or 6 days. Fish are rarely caught in traps with holes or breaks in the mesh (Craig, 1 976; Sutherland and Hatper, 1 983; Ward, 1 983). Even small holes or breaks in the wire mesh apparently render them ineffective as fish traps.\nUsing a submersible for observation, Sutherland et al. (1 983) found juvenile fish numerous in and around derelict traps. The derelict traps and other man made objects appeared to serve as artificial reefs on \"barren\" sand sea floor areas (Sutherland et al. 1 983; Hatper and McClelland, 1 983). Sutherland et al. (1 983) observed that fish were absent or rare near traps on or adjacent to reefs. TRAP DESIGN AND GHOST FISHING (from Kelly, 1990 as summarized in SAFMC 1 99 1 a)\nVarious methods have been proposed to alleviate the concerns of ghost traps. Since trap design is one of the keys as to whether a ghost fishing situation will be created (Smolowitz, 1978), many of these methods deal with trap design. .Designs to prevent ghost fishing were primarily developed for northern or temperate invertebrate (lobster) fisheries.\nDegradable sections ofhinges that rot in a specified time period are one such design requirement that has been adopted by both the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Councils. When the degradable link fails, the trap no longer fishes. The selfdestruct devices are designed to prevent or reduce ghost fishing without reducing efficiency of the trap or significantly increasing the costs.\nKumpf (1 980) conducted a limited experiment to determine the durability and suitability of 4 types ofmaterials for self-destruct devices that were inexpensive, available locally, and simple to replace. He tested unoiled jute, sisal, 1 6 gauge, and 1 8 gauge galvanized wire in his experiments. The unoiledjute and sisal lasted 42 days while the galvanized wire was still intact at the end ofthe 120 days of the testing. He noted the galvanic couplings with a short life spans (sic) are available or could be manufactured ifthere was a sufficient demand.\nSeveral problems are encountered in the use of self-destruct panels and hinges. They are not readily accepted by fishermen because of possible catch losses and the time lost in repair or replacement. The trap may land with the degradable panel facing down. And, time for degradable panels or hinges to deteriorate may be longer than predicted. Corrosion of metal\n335\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nhinging materials occurs more slowly in colder, slower moving water and biodegradable materials take longer to break down in deeper water where there are fewer organisms to attack the materials.\nGordon Sharp, a Florida Marine Patrol officer in Key West, stated that he found 95% of the traps he has seized in areas closed to trap fishing to be constructed illegally. The primary construction violations he found were uses of non..degradable hinge materials such as rubber, nylon or stainless steel, or the use of illegal thicknesses ofjute.\nEscape vents for sublegal fish are another design element demonstrated to reduce the catch of and damage to sublegals (Smolowitz, 1 978). Smolowitz also noted other advantages to the use of sublegal vents such as improving the quality ofthe catch and increasing trap efficiency. Fewer fish in the traps should result in fewer injuries, and in areas with large populations, sublegal escape vents should allow more legal sized fish to be caught.\nOne design feature that has received little attention is the trap funnel. The funnel size, shape, mesh size, and type of funnel (straight or horseneck) all have effects on retention of trapped fish and would therefore have an effect on the ability of a ghost trap to retain fish (see trap design and structure). 4.2.2.3.2 Prohibition of Fish Traps\nThe Council prohibited the use of fish traps in the South Atlantic EEZ; however, black sea bass traps may be used north ofCape Canaveral (Vehicle Assembly Building, 28\u00b0 35. l' N Latitude).\nTraps are inexpensive, easily constructed, easy to use and require little skill (although the most successful fishing depends on skill in locating productive fishing grounds), fish unattended, catch a wide range of species not caught by other gear, allow economic exploitation of low density fish stocks, allow fishing where other methods are uneconomical or have become uneconomical because of overfishing and are able to be fished over a wide range of depth, bottom types and conditions. On the other hand, traps are bulky, result in trap loss and ghost fishing, catch species that were not traditional food fish, are fished near live bottom causing habitat damage, result in a bycatch ofwhich a portion dies upon release, result in gear and user group conflict, and existing regulations are extremely difficult or impossible to enforce.\nThe Council concluded that the issue oftraps is a critical issue to the State ofFlorida and in the long term to the entire South Atlantic as well. Florida deliberated the issue of traps for many years and the Florida State Legislature prohibited the use of fish traps in 1 980. There have been many problems since then due to the inconsistency between state and federal regulations. The snapper grouper resource offthe Florida Atlantic coast has continued to decline. The snapper grouper stocks are more overfished off Florida than they are anywhere else in the South Atlantic.\nThe Council concluded that ifthey cannot prohibit fish traps, they will never be able to stop overfishing of the snapper grouper resource. The Council concluded that traps are non selective by size and by species (e.g., red grouper recruit to the hook and line fishery at around 19\" and to the trap fishery at around 1 1 \"). Bohnsack et al. (1 989) do note that modifications to mesh size will alter the size of fish caught. They noted that total value, species caught, number of individuals and mean total weight per haul declined with meshes larger or smaller than 1 .5\" hexagonal mesh. The mesh sizes required to correlate with the 20\" minimum sizes would be so large as to result in de facto prohibition on use of fish traps.\nTraps unnecessarily kill an abundance of tropical fish because they harvest angel fish, tangs, parrot fish, etc. The Council has based this conclusion on input from commercial and\n336\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nrecreational fishermen and from processors and dealers. In addition, information contained in Bohnsack et al. (1989) document the catch of these species. Unfortunately, these species were not recorded separately in the commercial landings data until recently, thus the commercial landings data are not available to quantify the extent to which catches of these species have increased.\nSince March 1, 1991 the State of Florida has prohibited the harvest of tropical fish: \"The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to protect and conserve Florida's tropical marine life resources and to ensure the continued health and abundance of these species. The further intent of this Chapter is to ensure that the harvesters in this fishery use non-lethal methods of harvest and that the fish, invertebrates and plants so harvested be maintained alive for the maximum possible conservation and economic benefits.\" Allowing fish traps in federal waters would make Florida's regulations difficult, if not impossible, to enforce and would not address Problem #5 which is, that \"the existence of inconsistent state and federal regulation makes it difficult to coordinate, implement and enforce management measures and may lead to overfishing. Inconsistent management measures create public confusion and hinder voluntary compliance.\"\nThe way in which fish traps were used made enforcement extremely difficult. All other kinds of fishing gear are eventually brought back to the dock where they can be examined by state marine patrol officers or other law enforcement personnel. Once traps are placed in the water, they were seldom are brought back to the dock. Testimony documents the various kinds of violations recorded in the Key West area (e.g., biodegradable panel requirement violations). The loss of traps was high ranging from 20% to 63% and in certain sectors trap loss may be as high as 1 00%.\nThe SAFMC Law Enforcement Committee and Advisory Panel were established to advise the Council on enforceability of various management approaches. They noted that the existing system is difficult to enforce and is incompatible with Florida state law, that the 1 00 foot contour limitation is difficult to enforce and that poaching is a big law enforcement problem in the fish trap fishery. These two bodies recommended to the Council that a total prohibition on use of fish traps in the South Atlantic EEZ was the most enforceable of all alternatives considered.\nThe enforcement issue was summarized by Kelley (1990): \"Enforcement is the largest problem of all. There are widespread abuses of the regulations governing the use of fish traps. There seems to be no effective way to enforce regulations in a fishery, such as trap fishing, where gear can't be observed readily by enforcement officials. The largest present day problems in the Florida Keys and South Florida are the extensive trap poaching and the use of illegally constructed or deployed traps.\" In addition, Officer Gordon Sharp (a Florida Marine Patrol officer in Key West) presented information at public hearings and Council meetings indicating the great difficulty in enforcing existing regulations and noted a large number of violations of existing regulations.\nThe Council recognized that gear that is not brought back to shore at the end of a fishing trip makes enforcement extremely difficult. The Council considered other, less drastic measures that would allow traps to be used but concluded that the at\u00b7sea enforcement required to effectively monitor and ensure compliance with existing regulations does not and will not exist. Therefore, the Council was persuaded that nothing short of a total ban would be enforceable.\nContinued use of such highly efficient gear in a stressed fishery is no longer biologically tolerable. Thirteen of 27 snapper grouper species identified in Amendment 4 are documented as overfished with SSRs of less than 30%. Although insufficient data are available to determine SSRs for the remaining 15 species, they are also thought to be overfished. From a\n337\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nsocioeconomic perspective, continued use of fish traps will result in a small group of fishermen removing a disproportionate share of the available fish, thus precluding their use by all other user groups at best and at worst leading to overfishing.\nThere is evidence that fish trapping causes habitat damage where fish traps are set in trawls on live bottom and where grappling hooks are dragged across live bottom to retrieve them. Testimony and video records of damaged Ocu/ina reefs off Palm Beach County, provided to the Council at the February 199 1 meeting, depicted significant and measurable damage to coral reef and live bottom communities. These activities leave an imprint of the trap upon the bottom communities and trenches caused by grappling hooks dragged over the bottom for the purpose of locating and recovering traps. Lost traps not only continue to fish, as it has been pointed out in the ghost trap discussion, but may contribute considerable secondary habitat damage by becoming mobilized at times of storm activity and impacting delicate bottom communities. These problems cannot be alleviated by trap design modifications even if such modifications could be enforced.\nThe affect of selective removal of herbivores on the health of coral reefs was discussed LaPointe (1989). These species were harvested by fish traps more frequently than by hook and line gear. Again, due to the fact that commercial statistics did not record these fish by species, data was unavailable to document the level of harvest by fish traps or by hook and line.\nProhibiting fish traps was determined to be consistent with Florida's Coastal Zone Management Plan. Also, internationally, a number of countries (e.g., Bermuda) have tried to manage fish trap gear only to end up prohibiting their use. Bermuda has managed their snapper grouper fishery for a number of years and imposed a limited entry system with trap limitation. In addition, modifications to mesh size were also attempted. The Bermudian Government concluded that regulation the fish trap fishery was not effective and recently imposed a total ban on use of fish traps. The Council concluded that a total prohibition on the use of fish traps was the most effective alternative to address the stated problems and to achieve the plan's stated objectives. 4.2.2.4 Entanglement Nets (summarized from SA.FMC, 199 1 a)\nCatch by entanglement nets during 1988 was 1 ,398 pounds from North Carolina through Georgia (less than 1 % of the combined state catch) and 253,739 pounds from the Florida East Coast (6% Florida East Coast catches). Much of the Florida landings are from a directed stab net fishery for gray snapper that operates in the EEZ. The Gulf Council and the State of Florida have prohibited entanglement nets. Florida regulations read as follows: ''No person shall harvest in or from state waters any snapper of the family of Lutjanidae or any member of the genera Epinephelus or Mycteroperca by or with the use of any gear other than those types of gears specified in Subsection 1 , provided however that snapper and grouper harvested as an incidental bycatch of other species lawfully harvested with other types of gears shall not be deemed to be unlawfully harvested in violation of this section, if the quantity of snapper/grouper so harvested does not exceed the bag and possession limits as specified elsewhere.\" The South Atlantic Council's actions track the Florida regulations in intent with respect to limiting possession to the bag limit and for species without a bag limit, no possession is allowed. Florida prohibited entanglement nets because it is an inappropriate gear to use on live bottom. Some of the reef fish are not necessarily found on the live bottom, however, many are and fishermen use stab nets to catch gray snapper on the live bottom areas.\n338\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nThe Council has concluded that entanglement nets are not an appropriate gear for the snapper grouper fishery and the prohibition will prevent use and/or expansion from North Carolina through Florida's East Coast.\nEntanglement nets targeting species other than those included in the management unit are limited to the bag limit ifthe species is under a bag limit, and ifno bag limit is applicable, then no retention is allowed. 4.2.2.4.1 Prohibition on the Use of Entanglement Nets\nThe Council prohibited the use of entanglement nets (including, but not limited to, gill nets and trammel nets) for the harvest of species in the snapper grouper management unit in Snapper Grouper Amendment 4 (SAFMC 1 991a). The simultaneous possession of entanglement nets and species in the management unit is prohibited. 4.2.2.5 Bottom Longlines (summarized from SAFMC 1991a) 4.2.2.5.1 Prohibition on the Use of Bottom Longlines in the WreckrJSh Fishery\nThe Council prohibited bottom longlining in the wreckfish fishery in the entire South Atlantic BEZ (SAFMC 1 991a). Bottom longline is defined as a stationary, buoyed, and anchored groundline with hooks attached. Regulations are written to prohibit simultaneous possession ofwreckfish and all the necessary components for bottom longlining.\nIn February 1991 the South Atlantic Council requested an emergency prohibition of longlining for wreckfish (i.e., prohibit the simultaneous possession of wreckfish and operable bottom longline gear and prohibit use ofbottom longlines). The 1 991/92 fishing year was to begin on April 1 6 and the Council requested that the prohibition be in place by April 1 6. This same action was included in Amendment 4 which would not be implemented prior to the April 1 6 start of the fishing year.\nThe Council was concerned about wastage of fish, gear loss, gear conflict, habitat damage and negative economic effects (both short and long run) attributable to the use ofbottom longline gear in the wreck:fish fishery. The bottom habitat on the wreckfish fishing grounds, which comprise an area of the Blake Plateau of approximately 50-75 square nautical miles, is characterized by a rocky ridge system having a vertical relief greater than 50 meters and a slope greater than 1 5\u00b0 (SAFMC 1993). The depth range in this area is 450-600 meters; the substrates in areas ofthe Blake Plateau exhibiting significant relief are generally characterized as composed of manganese phosphate pavements, phosphorite slabs and coral banks (Pratt and McFarlin, 1 966; Stetson et al, 1 969). This high relief, in conjunction with the strong tidal effects, makes gear loss probable (as reported by fishermen who have already tried longlines in the wreckfish fishery) which results in the loss of all fish on the gear as well as those which get hooked subsequently. Testimony from fishermen indicated gear loss on wreckfish longline sets was as great as 100% ofthe gear taken out on a single trip. According to accounts from fishermen, extensive lengths of lost longline gear have been observed on their fathometers. Fishermen can apparently see fish hooked on parted longline gear but are unable to recover the parted gear and its catch. Wreckfish fishermen use circle hooks that virtually prevent fish from working the hook free. The Council recognized that there was also some ghost fishing potential from lost vertical gear but believes that the extent of potential loss with vertical gear is much smaller by virtue of the fewer number ofhooks used and the greater control over the gear.\nAlthough the area is 50-75 square nautical miles, virtually all wreckfish fishing takes place along limited, high relief ledge areas within this area because wreckfish are found along the ledges and are not evenly distributed over the wider area. The sub-areas that produce\n339\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nwreckfish are typically 300 yards wide and 1 - 4 nautical miles long. Thus far, fishermen fishing vertical drop gear have been able to work in relatively close proximity without any major conflicts. If bottom longlines had been allowed to be used in this area, vessels would have not only lost gear due to the rough bottom, but this lost gear would create a hazard for those using vertical lines which would result in loss ofthat gear. This problem would have become progressively worse over time as more gear was lost, the more hangs were created for both longline and vertical gear, creating even more gear loss. This condition could have continued until much ofthe ground is unfishable. The wire cable that is used will remain a hazard for many years as the rate of decay is slow. While extensive hangs may ultimately provide protection for the resource due to much of the fishing grounds being unfishable, it may well result in the loss of the fishery. The use of longlines will result in gear losses to vertical hook and line fishermen that far exceed their losses prior to the introduction of longlines. This will serve to reduce benefits to those fishing with the traditional vertical gear.\nThe potential for gear entanglement and gear conflict also raised the issue of vessel safety. It was the Council's opinion that this situation would have lead to conflicts that jeopardize the safety ofthe vessels and fishermen participating in the wreckfish fishery.\nLongline cable on the bottom has the potential to break some of the ledges, overhangs and associated organisms, and otherwise damage the habitat on which the wreckfish depend. Habitat damage caused by the longlines would violate the SAFMC habitat policy and should be avoided.\nThe wreck.fish fishery has employed efficient vertical gear since its inception, and the addition of longlines would have eroded benefits to the majority offishermen and adversely impact the resource and habitat. If longlines had been allowed, then all or at least many wreckfish fishermen may have been forced to adopt the gear in order to compete resulting in more gear loss from parted longlines.\nThe Council determined that bottom longlines were not in the best interest of the wreckfish resource, habitat, fishermen or society at large. Further, the problems outlined justified prohibiting this gear/fishing method in the wreckfish fishery. 4.2.2.5.2 Use of Bottom Longlines in the Snapper Grouper Fishery (summarized from SAFMC 1994)\nThe Council prohibited the use of bottom longline gear for snapper grouper in the South Atlantic EEZ within 50 fathoms (SAFMC 1994).\nCatch by bottom longlines during 1988 was 470,306 pounds from North Carolina through Georgia (6% of the combined state catches) and 576,3 10 pounds from the Florida East Coast (1 3% Florida East Coast catch). The Council was concerned about the use of bottom longline gear targeting species in the snapper grouper management unit in live bottom areas. Habitat damage and intense competition among users are problems that arise when this gear is used within 50 fathoms where significant live bottom occurs and where competition with hook and line vessels occurs. The Council concluded that this gear is appropriate for use in the deep-water snowy grouper/tilefish fishery where much of the bottom is mud with sparse live bottom areas. Allowing use of this gear deeper than 50 fathoms would preserve the traditional fishery which takes place in deeper water out to 50 fathoms. Based on information from South Carolina, up until 1983 the snapper grouper fishery was limited to vertical hook and line or bandit reels. Bottom longlines were introduced in the Gulfof Mexico after hook and line gear became less effective due to decreases in resource abundance; use of the gear grew rapidly. Up until this point there has been no gear prohibition on bottom longlines. After the golden tilefish and\n340\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nsnowy grouper fisheries were developed, bottom longlines became the predominant gear, again as resource abundance declined. For species like snowy grouper and tilefish, it was not very efficient to use vertical hook and lines as the resource abundance declined from unfished levels. As the tilefish and snowy grouper stocks off South Carolina declined, the number of people using longlines decreased. Off South Carolina virtually all of the golden tilefish occurred well outside the 50 fathom mark and there was more than enough gear to adequately harvest these resources in the mid-depth zone. Vertical lines are much more environmentally acceptable and less damaging than bottom longlines.\nThis regulation essentially segments the mid-shelf and the deep-water complex to the bottom longlines. This measure was supported during the public hearing process and the Council concluded that prohibiting use ofnlongline gear within 50 fathoms will prevent the problems of habitat damage and intense competition while at the same time allow fishermen using this gear to continue fishing in deeper water. This action effectively limits longlines to targeting the deep water component of the snapper grouper fishery and keeps the use of longlines outside of the rough bottom habitat.\nThe Council very briefly considered moving the line in to the 40 fathom contour but was concerned that there are substantial Oculina coral banks along this depth zone. It was further noted that the 50 fathoms was a compromise from the 1 00 fathom contour (which was mentioned) and that the 50 fathom contour effectively separates the inshore and deep water snapper grouper complexes. 4.2.2.6 Bottom Trawls 4.2.2.6.1 Prohibition on the Use of Bottom Trawls (from SAFMC 1987)\nThe use of trawl gear to harvest fish in the directed snapper grouper fishery south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (35\u00b015' N. Latitude) and north of Cape Canaveral, Florida (Vehicle Assembly Building, 28\u00b035. l ' N. Latitude) is prohibited (SAFMC 1 987). A vessel with trawl gear and more than 200 pounds of fish in the snapper grouper fishery on board will be defined as a directed fishery. The amendment also establishes a rebuttable presumption that a vessel with fish in the snapper grouper fishery on board harvested its catch of such fish in the Exclusive Economic Zone.\nThe Council based the trawl prohibition on habitat destruction and the desire to prevent overfishing of vermilion snapper. Fishes present in live bottom areas are described by Grimes et al. (1 982) and include 1 1 3 species representing 43 families of predominantly tropical and subtropical fishes. Vermilion snapper were more abundant on the shelf edge than on the open shelf (Grimes et al., 1982). Miller and Richards (1 980) described the distribution of live bottom habitat in the South Atlantic Bight and reported the most productive area of the shelf for commercial reef fish as being in the open shelf zone between 33 and 40 meters. Parker et al. (1983) reported on a survey of the areas from Cape Canaveral, Florida to Cape Fear, North Carolina and from Cape Fear to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. From Cape Hatteras to Cape Fear 14,486 square km between 27 and 101 m were surveyed and contained 2,040 square km (14%) ofnreefnhabitat of which only 204 square km (1 0%) had one meter or more relief (distance from the highest point of the live bottom to the ocean floor). In the area from Cape Fear to Cape Canaveral, 24,826 square km between 27 and 101 m were surveyed and contained 7,403 square km (30%) ofnreefnhabitat of which 1,743 square km (7%) had one meter or more relief. The Oregon II cruise report (Anon, 1978) supports the scattered nature of live bottom in the South Atlantic from Cape Canaveral, Florida to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The Fishery\n341\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nManagement Plan reported that in terms of the entire shelf are current data suggest that from three to 30 percent of the shelf is suitable bottom for snapper grouper species (SAFMC, 1983a).\nThe report on effects of a research trawl on live bottom (Van Dolah et al., 1987) documents that habitat damage does occur from the use of trawl gear even in the case of one pass through an area in a controlled study. The abstract is as follows : \"The effects of a research trawl on several sponge and coral species was assessed in a shallow water, hard-bottom area located southeast of Savannah, Georgia. The study entailed a census of the numerically dominant species in replicate 25-m2 quadrants located along five transects established across a trawling alley. The density of undamaged sponges and corals was assessed in trawled and non-trawled (control) portions of each transect immediately before, immediately after, and 12 months after a 40/54 roller\u00b7rigged trawl was dragged through the alley once. Some damage to individuals of all target species was observed immediately after trawling, but only the density of barrel sponges (Cliona spp.) was significantly reduced. The extent of damage to the other sponges (Jrcinia campana, Haliclona oculata), octocorals (Leptogorgia virgulata, Lophogorgia hebes, Titanideumfrauenfeldii) and hard corals (Oculina varicosa) varied depending on the species, but changes in density were not statistically significant. Twelve months after trawling, the abundance of specimens counted in the trawled quadrants had increased to pre-trawl densities or greater, and damage to the sponges and corals could no longer be detected due to healing and growth. Trawl damageo\u00b7observed in this study was less severe than the damage reported for a similar habitat in a previous study. Differences between the two studies are attributed to (1) differences in the roller-rig design of the trawls used, and (2) differences in the number of times the same bottom was trawled.\"\nThe authors point out that in a study by Tilmant (1979) looking at the effects of commercial bait shrimping with roller-frame trawls in a shallow-water area of Biscayne Bay, Florida damage was much more severe: \"Tilmant observed severe damage (specimens crushed or tom loose) to more than 80% of the stony corals, 50% of the sponges and 38% of the soft corals along the trawl path.\" It should be noted however, that this frame trawl consists ofa solid, rectangular frame to which a net is attached and is used to fish grass bed areas; it was not designed to \"roll over\" live bottom and would be expected to cause signific ant damage to corals, etc.\nImportantly, habitat damage described by Van Dolah et al. (1987) resulted from one tow of trawl gear through the study area. That study was designed to evaluate the effects of a research trawl that does not typically cross the same bottom area more than once. Commercial trawling does not operate in this manner . Under commercial fishing conditions, a live bottom area would be fished over and over until the catches from such an area become unprofitable. Under such conditions, habitat damage would be expected to be much greater than is indicated from the above study.\nThe Oregon II cruise report (Anon, 1978) indicated that drags with a trawl yielded a total catch of 476 pounds which included 424 pounds ofofinfish and 46 pounds of sponges and corals (10 percent of the total catch). This area was reported to have been on a mud bottom but turned out to be a low profile live bottom of sand ridges, clumps of sponges and scattered corals . Further indication of habitat damage is reported by Wenner (1983): \"The 3/4 Yankee trawl net effectively covers a much wider area of the bottom than the measured sweep (8.7 m) due to the configuration of the otter doors, ground cables, and bottom leg lines.\n342\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nAlthough this arrangement cannot increase the actual spread of the net beyond the head.rope length, the passage of these cables over the substrate creates a disturbance that serves to herd fish in the path of the net (Baranov 1969). This net does, however, damage the sponge-coral habitat by shearing off sponges, soft corals, bryozoans, and other attached invertebrates. The 56 trawl tows made in the sponge-coral habitat for this study collected 2,351 kg of attached invertebrates (including sponges, soft corals, tunicates, bryozoans, and hydroids) yielding an average 42 kg/tow. This is only the amount of bottom material actually removed from the habitat. An estimate of the total amount of bottom destroyed by the doors, ground, cables, and leg lines cannot be ascertained from the current study.\nPersonal observations and interviews with commercial fishermen attest to the productivity of the sponge-coral habitat. Most studies indicate the importance of habitat availability and space in determining the abundance and diversity of reef fishes (Emery 1 978). With this in mind, and given the knowledge that 1 ) the use of the 3/4 Yankee trawl net reduces the amount of attached invertebrate growth (the amount damaged by doors and ground cables is presently not quantifiable); 2) the places where the invertebrates had been attached may be sanded over and rendered unsuitable for recolonization; and 3) the removal of these attached invertebrates reduces refugees for decapods, polychaetes, etc., that are food items for Centropristis striata and other benthic feeders, one must conclude that the continued use of this trawl net reduces the amount of productive fish habitat. For these reasons, in addition to the ineffectiveness of the gear in sampling commercially important species, alternate nondestructive methods, such as direct observations or the use of mark-recapture techniques with trap catches, should be employed in assessment surveys of the commercially important species of this habitat.\"\nResults of trawl survey work in Australia provide some insight into what can happen to catches in an area after the continued use of commercial trawl gear. Young and Sainsbury (1985) report that \"At moderate to low levels of fishing effort, the main effect of fishing on the relative abundance of bottom shelf fishes is by alteration of the relative frequency and spatial distribution of habitat types. In particular this refers to the conversion of areas with dense epibenthos (sponge, corals, hydroids, gorgonians) to areas with sparse epibenthos. (It may be noted that even at the relatively low intensity of trawling of the past few years the fishing effort exerted on the main trawl grounds is sufficient to sweep 50 to 100 per cent of the area of those grounds per year.).\" These results are from trawling conducted in 1982 as compared to trawl catches in 1966 from the same locations and at the same time of year. The catch composition shifted from species associated with sponges, soft corals etc. (during 1966) to those associated with open sandy bottom (during 1982).\nA similar type of scenario for the South Atlantic was suggested by Bob Low (pers. comm.):\nParker et al. (1 983) estimated that, in the area they surveyed between Cape Fear and Cape Canaveral, there were 7,403 square km of reef habitat. Of this, 1,743 square km had an average profile exceeding 1 m. Assuming that such ground could not be trawled, this leaves about 5,660 square km {1,398,000 acres) ofstrawlable reef habitat. The average boat might pull a net with a footrope of 120 feet, giving an effective sweep of the roller gear of about 72 feet maximum. A typical tow over open bottom is perhaps 3 hours at 2 knots. The area swept by the roller gear per tow is then about 20 acres/hour or 60 acres/tow. Assume that 20 boats participate for 4 months (January-April) each year. [Note: The actual number of vessels during 1987 was seven.] The average vessel makes 3 trips/month, with 3 days of fishing each trip. The average (24 hr) fishing\n343\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n(24 hr) fishing day includes perhaps 4 tows. A typical trip therefore consists of 1 2 tows or 36 hr of fishing. The 20 boats make an aggregate of 240 trips. This equates to 2,880 tows, covering around 1 72,800 total acres. If each tow was over a previously unswept area, the total area covered by the roller gear would then amount to about 12% of the trawlable reef habitat estimated by Parker et al. (1 983). Under one set of assumptions, the area affected by the doors, bridles, and warps would add to this. Under a second set, repetitive trawling over identical areas would reduce the total area impacted. Van Dolah et al. (1 987) noted a substantial renewability within a year. There are likely to be 8 months of recovery time between trawling seasons. Doesn't that allow for significant restoration in many of the trawled areas?\"\nThe above scenario indicated that about 1 2 percent of available habitat between Cape Fear and Cape Canaveral would be impacted annually by trawling, whereas in the Australian work the area impacted was between 50 and 1 00 percent. The Council has concluded that the level of damage to the live-bottom habitat in the South Atlantic is significant and that our available knowledge is not sufficient to risk impacting the long\u00b7term abundance of snapper and groupers by reducing their habitat. The results shown by Van Dolah et al. (1 987) indicated that regeneration of tissue sufficient to have rounded offthe tops ofpartially severed sponges and to have closed wounds on other sponges occurs within a year but that additional growth is limited as indicated by some of the sponges being obviously shorter than before the trawling damage. This supports the Council's concern because in a four month trawling season there would be a net loss ofhabitat (i.e. more damage than regrowth) with the effects being cumulative over time. By destroying habitat we destroy the productivity ofthe resource being harvested and we are in essence drawing on the principal, not just taking the interest so that next year the same amount of trawling will represent more than 1 2 percent ofthe habitat and the year after even more. Given this information, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council concluded that over the long term there would be a net loss of existing habitat, which is counter to the Council's habitat policy and the Magnuson Act.\nIndirect evidence of habitat damage is provided in Christian et al. (1 985) where they report on attempts to use crab nets rigged with light chain and plastic mud rollers. These nets proved to be inadequate for offshore fish trawling on broken bottom because the light molded plastic mud rollers were not durable and did not prevent net damage. They further reported that captains who tried crab nets soon switched to nets with heavy netting, properly rigged sweep systems and steel vee-doors for trawling over rough bottom. Further indication ofhabitat damage was presented in Section II of Snapper Grouper Amendment 1 with the numerous references to gear damage, gear loss and the need to use rollers and modified doors to be able to trawl in rough and broken areas.\nAn additional reference concerning potential habitat damage is provided by Moore and Bullis (1960) when they reported on the discovery of a deep water reef in the Gulf of Mexico. The MV Oregon was cruising over the continental slope about 40 nautical miles due east ofthe Mississippi Delta and observed an unusual tracing on the depth recorder. They sampled this bottom area using a shrimp trawl and reported the following: \"A drag, made over the area with a shrimp trawl, contained a large mass ofcoral, other invertebrates, and fish. The netting ofthe trawl was tom and most of its contents were lost, but about three hundred pounds of coral remained in the bag. A sample was brought back to the laboratory where is was identified by Moore as Lophelia prolifera.\"\nInvertebrates associated with sponges and corals occur in disproportionately high densities which suggests that they may use sponges and corals as a food source or a refuge from\n344\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\npredation (Wendt et al., 1985). These invertebrates in tum serve as a food source for various snapper and grouper species. In addition, corals are very slow growing with some such as Oculina sp. only growing between 1 1 and 16 mm per year (Reed, 198 1 ). Damage to these areas can negatively affect the food and shelter available to snappers and groupers. Further, Grimes et al. (1982) note the importance ofthe live bottom and shelf edge habitats in serving as reservoirs for recruits in shallow areas (less than 30 m).\nThe best estimate ofthe number ofboats operating in the fishery during the winter of 1986/87 was four boats (one South Carolina boat fishing in South Carolina and three North Carolina boats fishing in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida). The number of vessels increased to seven during the winter of 1987/88. These vessels fished during the slow period for shrimp which is normally January to March/April. Even though the actual number of boats is small, the amount of habitat damage is significant when one realizes that these boats fish directly on the limited live bottom habitat in these areas. Productive snapper grouper habitat on the continental shelf is limited and trawl gear is fished repeatedly in these areas over this three to four month period. Most, if not all, fishermen use Loran which allow them to return to the exact spot and trawl a particular rock out-cropping repeatedly. The data previously described from Australia points out the changes to bottom habitat and catches resulting from such a fishery.\nVermilion snapper in the early 1980s were experiencing growth overfishing (see SAFMC 1983a p. 44-58 for a more detailed discussion). Yield per recruit (or yield per individual) analysis indicated that a 12 inch minimum size will increase yield per recruit from 1 32 g to 1 77 g which is equivalent to a 34 percent increase in yield ifrecruitment is constant. Confidential data available to the South Atlantic Council indicated that the minimum mesh size of 4 inches is not being adhered to and as a result the Council's prior action establishing the mesh restriction has not been effective in releasing small vermilion (less than 12 inches). The trawl prohibition will result in an increase in yield for vermilion snapper. Catch data from South Carolina (Bob Low, pers. comm.) show a slight negative correlation between trawl landings and hook & line landings\n(r = -0. 13). A good fishery independent index of abundance would allow us to examine the\naffect oftrawl catches on abundance of vermilion snapper. Given the available information, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council concluded that the trawl prohibition would increase yield; however, our ability to measure this increase is lacking.\nThe potential existed for more vessels to enter the fishery particularly ifthe calico scallop, shrimp and sea scallop fisheries have not been productive or are not active during this time period. The actual number ofvessels during 1987/88 was seven, greater than the number expected. This further supported the Council's concern that effort could have increased rapidly.\nImpacts on affected vessels from prohibiting use of trawl gear in the snapper grouper fishery were not significant. Input from public hearings, committee and Council meetings indicated that income from fish trawling made up a small portion of total income. No trawl fishermen came forward with information during the public hearing process indicating that impacts would be significant. Fishermen used this fishing method primarily as a fill-in activity and had the ability to utilize other gear (e.g. electric & hydraulic reels, black sea bass traps, longlines, etc.) to fish snappers and groupers. These general conclusions are supported by the following in Christian et al. (1 985): \"The major seafood industry in the South Atlantic Bight is based on shrimp, and this dependence on one crop has made the industry financially precarious. . .. Therefore, fishermen have looked to other activities such as bottom trawling for finfishes to supplement their income. This is not the single salvation for the whole industry. Although fish trawling can offer an alternative which\n345\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nmay aid some shrimpers in maintaining year-round income, suitable trawling bottom in this area is limited, and target species of such a fishery (snapper, grouper, and porgies) are relatively long lived, slow-growing, and can sustain only limited fishing pressure.\" 4.2.2.7 Gear in State Waters\nAppendix H presents a compilation of gear types used in North Carolina, and the Habitat Subcommittee recommendations to the North Carolina Marine Fisheries Commission concerning the habitat impacts of specific commercial and recreational gears used in North Carolina.\nIn Biscayne National Park, Florida, spiny lobster, stone crab, and blue crab are targeted with heavy, medium and light traps respectively. These traps can inflict damage in a number of ways including contact with the bottom habitat during deployment, retrieval and when lost. The fishery is prosecuted by using heavy traps that are frequently set near structural complex and fragile offshore reefs and may be loss or abandoned by the end of the season (Ault et al., 1997). Spiny lobster and stone crab traps area used over Tha/assia while blue crab traps\nThe conclusions and recommendations of the study documenting the \"Impacts of Commercial Fishing on Key Habitats within Biscayne National Park\" (Ault et al., 1997) are as follows:\n\"The bait shrimp fishery regularly comes in contact with a largest contiguous area of BNP's submerged habitat resources. Depending on season, from 25% to 52% of BNP's entire area is swept by the fishery. Restriction of commercial bait shrimp fishing in BNP's seagrass habitats cannot be justified solely on physical habitat damage. However, the issue of juvenile fish and crab bycatch deserves further attention, if not directed research. While rollerframe trawling does not appear to damage seagrasses, damage to sessile invertebrates (sponges and corals) in hardbottom communities is conspicuous and is likely to be long-lasting. Hardbottom habitats would undoubtedly benefit from closure of commercial bait shrimping in areas supporting high densities of sponges and corals. The feasibility of accurately making the boundaries of BNP's hardbottom areas and preventing nocturnal trawling within them should be investigated. Further trawl damage experiments in conjunction with closure area essential for obtaining accurate estimates of rates of recovery for trawl-damaged sponges and corals.\nThe primary resource that the three major trap fisheries affect is seagrass with damage to underlying plants dependent on trap type and soak time. Loss of underlying Thalassia averages about 13% of trap area per week for lobster traps and 28% per week for stone crab traps. For blue crab traps, loss of underlying Halodule averages about 30% of trap area per week. Further measurements of size and spatio-temporal extent of each of the trap fisheries is required before reliable estimates of trap-induced damage can be made. Additional field experiments which focus on the rate at which Tha/assia and Halodule recolonize areas trap-damaged are strongly recommended.\" 4.3 Cumulative Impacts\nThis section analyzes cumulative impacts, which are defined as 'impacts on the environment that result from the incremental impact of an action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of who undertakes such actions.\" The overall cumulative impact of human-induced activities and natural events remains poorly documented, understood and in dire need of more study. Even so, it is evident that the effect of human activity on aquatic systems has been substantial in locations where access and economically profitable modification could be readily accommodated. Dahl ( 1990) reports that in the 1780's there were about 20.3 million acres of wetlands in Florida, about 6.8 million acres\n346\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nin Georgia, about 6.4 million acres in South Carolina, and about million acres in North Carolina. By the 1980's Florida's wetlands had been reduced to 1 1 .0 million acres, Georgia's to 5.3 million acres, South Carolina's to 4.7 million acres, and North Carolina's to 5. 7 million acres. Overall about 36.3 percent of all wetlands in states under SAFMC purview have been eliminated. O,:i a state-by--state basis this includes 46 percent of Florida's wetlands, 23 percent of Georgia's wetlands, 27 percent of South Carolina's wetlands, and 49 percent ofNorth Carolina's wetlands.\nAs an indication of the scope of developmental pressure, hence one aspect cumulative effect on EFH (coastal and tributary wetlands), NMFS data show receipt of more than 20,778 individual development proposals (COE pennit applications, federal projectse, etc.) in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida between 1 98 1 and 1996 (See Tables 26, 27, 28, & 29). A subsample of 4,000 ofthese development proposals involved over 1 3,856 acres of various wetland habitats.\nWhile it is believed that most regulated activities are implemented as planned, Mager and Thayer ( 1 986) report that limited monitoring indicate that about 20 percent of the projects they examined did not comply with provisions of the associated permits. Notably, most of the differences observed related more to design of structures and not the area ofhabitat affected. As shown in the following tables, individually and cumulatively significant impacts to EFH can be moderated through the COE regulatory program; however, significant wetland perturbations persist. This situation is largely perpetuated by (1) regulatory provisions that exempt regulation of certain wetland types and activities and (2) by severe staffing limitations within regulatory and environmental review agencies. In the absence of substantial correction in these two areas, significant wetland areas will continue to be adversely altered or eliminated, and regulatory and review agency effectiveness will be limited.\nIn addition to the direct cumulative effecflncurred by developmental type activities, EFH is also jeopardized by persistent increases in certain chemical discharges. In that case incremental change in habitats, hydrology, and chemical inputs produced, over time, an enormous and extremely harmful result whose negative economic and social implications may far exceed any benefits related to the causative factors. Unfortunately, the effect of adding ever greater volumes and varieties of chemicals to surface waters is often insidious and resulting declines in the abundance and quality ofaffected and harvested resources may be slow and difficult to identify. As illustrated by Scott et al (1 997), the effects may be realized at rudimentary trophic and ecological association levels in key portions (including EFH) of estuarine environments.\nThe rate and magnitude of anthropomorphic change on EFH, whether cumulative, synergistic, or individually large, is influenced by natural parameters such as temperature, wind, currents, rainfall, salinity, etc.. Consequently, the level of threat posed by a particular activity or group of activities may vary considerably from location to location. This situation may be most acute in locations that are subject to extreme weather and oceanic conditions such as hurricanes and large waves, or where the effects of periodic or global change is most prevalent.\nNutrient over enrichment has become a large cumulative problem for southeastern EFH. Excessive nutrients may be directly toxic. Even relatively low nitrate-nitrogen levels (as low as 3.5 uM NOrN) have been found to cause impacts on both growth and survival in eelgrass (Z. marina) during spring and fall growing seasons (Burkholder et al 1 992). In contrast, Cuban shoal grass (Halodule wrightii) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) were stimulated by nutrient enrichment (Burkholder et al 1994). Eelgrass provides important brackish water habitat element for finfish, crustaceans and molluscs in North Carolina (Thayer et al 1 984). Nitrate toxicity to eelgrass in the field has yet to be documented, although nitrate concentrations in the\n347\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nrange found to have an impact in mesocosm experiments certainly occurs in many estuarine settings.\nThe effects of nutrient enrichment and stimulation of toxic dinoflagellates and other algae, especially Pfiesteria piscidida, has been widely reported by the news media. The high abundance of small heterotrophic algae in southeastern estuaries was well known among plankton researchers during the 1980's and earlier; however, the toxic nature of Pfiesteria was not reported until the late 1980's (Burkholder et al 1992, 1993, 1995; Noga et al 1993). The most recent analyses suggest that a large suite of Pfiesteria-like small heterotrophic dinoflagellates exist in most southeastern estuaries (P. Tester personal communication.). These organisms include toxic forms, like Pfiesteria, and may be responsible for a significant nwnber of fish kills associated with eutrophic estuaries (Burkholder et al 1992). Recent fish kills in North Carolina and Maryland have been attributed, at least in part, to these organisms (Burkholder et al 1995), and recent analyses suggest that toxic dinoflagellates (and related organisms) are on the rise at a global scale (Paerl 1988, Smayda 1989, Paerl et al 1995a).\nThe stimulation of toxic organism population growth by nutrient enrichment may be related to factors outside the south Atlantic region. The most notable recent case was the transport of the toxic dinoflagellate Ptychodiscus brevis in 1989 by the Gulf Stream and associated eddies into Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Among other impacts offshore and inshore, this seriously impacted scallop production in Bogue Sound, North Carolina (Tester et al 1989).\nEnrichment of estuarine algal and bacterioplanktonic communities by excessive nutrients is probably the most often cited example of estuarine degradation globally (Nixon 1995, NRC 1994, Ryther and Dunstan 1971 ). In general, the ecological pathway involves enhanced algal or bacterial production and metabolism followed by excessive oxygen uptake and subsequent deoxygenation. Anoxia and hypoxia have been identified as the fundamental problems facing Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River Estuaries, and other locations throughout the world (Paerl 1988). Associated processes may be complex. For example, nutrient uptake and excessive autotroph production may result in deposition of organic material into benthic sediments, where increased sediment oxygen demand may occur at some later time. In stratified estuaries, the process may even be exacerbated by the re-release of nutrients as sediment oxygen demand is exerted in bottom, anoxic waters. The ecological effects of modification of production patterns also includes hypercapnia (elevated levels of carbon dioxide), which exerts powerful effects on some organisms (Burnett 1997).\nAlgal blooms in Southeastern waters represent a major threat to EFH. Important algal blooms have been docwnented in Albemarle Sound, the Chowan River, the Tar-Pamlico River, the Neuse River Estuary, the New River Estuary, Bogue Sound, the St. Johns River and Indian River (NOAA 1996). Algal levels can be extremely high in grossly enriched waters. A one-day survey of the Pamlico Estuary in 1988 found chlorophyll a (an algal pigment) in excess ofn200 ug/1, compared to a North Carolina Water Quality Standard of 40 ug/1 (15A NCAC 2B.0200). Another type of algal community stimulation occurs when airborne nitrogen from all sources, including agriculture, is deposited through wet and dry deposition into distant oceanic waters. This phenomenon was largely unrecognized until recently (Paerl, 1985, 1993). Consequences of this type of deposition, where the majority of \"new\" primary production comes from this source, can be quite significant, both on patterns in primary and secondary production and in the taxonomic makeup of that production, including the toxic forms cited above.\nAmong the most serious problems caused by algal blooms and other effects of over enrichment is the removal of oxygen from the water. The extent of deoxygenation in\n348\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\nsoutheastern estuaries has been well documented (Rader et al 1 987; Stanley, 1 985). A more recent survey of the south Atlantic region found periodic hypoxic conditions in 1 3 ofthe 21 estuaries surveyed, with bottom-water anoxia in 11 locations. Only once instance of anoxia was found along the Sea Island Coast of South Carolina and Georgia, and this was linked to stratified conditions in the Savannah River. Major anoxic events were documented in the Neuse River, the Tar-Pamlico River Estuary, the Indian River and St. Helena Sound (NOAA 1 996). Although seasonal low-oxygen events may be natural in Southeastern stratified estuaries, expansion in the size or persistence of deoxygenated areas has been identified for some of the above listed waters (Breitburg 1 990, Rabalais et al 1 996).\nEffects of deoxygenation on resident and post-larval fish, crustacean, and mollusc communities can be significant. The enonnous fish kills that have plagued the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River Estuaries have received abundant popular press since the late 1980's, and have recently been systematically analyzed (Pietrafesa and Miller 1 997). This study identified 246 kills in the Pamlico during the period 1 985-1995, and 73 in the Neuse, including many over 1 ,000,000 fish. Fish kills have also been documented in the St. John River, Florida and Charleston Harbor, South Carolina (Burkholder et al 1995).\nAnother possible manifestation of nutrient over enrichment is the occurrence of chitonoclastic shell disease in blue crabs. This is believed by some to be related to water pollution (either stress incurred after exposure to anoxic conditions or cadmium). Little is known absolutely (Noga et al 1 990). In addition, fish diseases have been implicated throughout polluted estuaries, but the link to pollution remains uncertain (Noga et al 1 989).\nThe impact of fish kills from nutrient over enrichment is difficult to assess in terms of their effect on stocks of commercially important fish. Many of the fish killed are juveniles and Atlantic menhaden appear especially vulnerable. If these stocks are density independent, then kills translate directly into reduced adult population sizes. Vaughan (1 986) found that in Atlantic menhaden, catastrophic kills, where 1 0 percent mortality events occur periodically, coupled to the accumulating 1 percent annual losses from permanent habitat loss, could cause a loss of 60 percent of the fishery within 30 years.\nImpacts of atmospheric deposition of nutrients on inshore EFH is well documented, as cited above (and in Fisher and Oppenheimer, 1991). Some studies suggest that nutrient enrichment from atmospheric and more traditional surface water sources can also modify planktonic and epibenthic algal communities to the detriment of fish. Changes in the phytoplankton community lead to changes in the grazer community, including the reduction or elimination ofpreferred prey items for planktivorous fish and fish larvae. One example is the plankton community of Western Albemarle Sound, North Carolina, where nanoplankton (the small-celled algae that are the principal food source for crustacean zooplankters) are replaced in part in some years by blue-green algae of low food value, with a concomitant elimination of the zooplankters preferred by soine anadromous fish larvae andjuveniles (Rulifson et al 1 986).\nBesides fish, plankton, and algae, vascular marine plants also are adversely affected by excessive nutrients and their consequences. Eutrophication may cause the reduction in coverage of SAV due to shading associated with water column turbidity and the growth of epiphytic filamentous algae. Although significant dieoffs of SAV have occurred in some locations in the Southeast, including the Pamlico River Estuary, the direct caus of algal growth stimulation has not been established (Davis et al 1 985). NOAA's recent survey of impacts on SAV found declines in 5 of 2 1 estuaries of the Southeast, including Albemarle/Pamlico Sounds, but increases in Biscayne Bay and Charleston Harbor (NOAA 1 996).\n349\n\n\f4.0 Threats to Essential Fish Habitat\n\nNew analytical approaches may advance managemnt evaluations of cumulative environmental effects. Ecological risk assessment procedures provide a useful frame for comprehensively structured analyses of anthropogenic effects (EPA, 1992). These procedures involve the systematic evaluation of stressors and effects using flexible methods that foster detailed evaluations of effects (Harwell et al., 1995). The application of risk assessment principles to environmental assessments could result in more comprehensive scientific products that also carry more administrative weight. In addition, systematic applications of decision support systems can offer logically consistent methods to evaluate multiple policy alternatives. Decision support systems aid the objective identification of appropriate decision combinations according to multiple priorities and they support group-based policy evaluations (Saaty, 1990; Keyes and Palmer, 1 993; Schmoldt et al., 1994)). Combined utilization ofthese approaches may identify previously underemphasized factors and objective policy alternatives (Lindeman, 1997b). Ultimately, they may foster more logical and explicit decision-making regarding cumulative effects issues.\n\nTable 26.

The cumulative result of technologically enhanced fishing effort has been the accelerated removal of those top predators with most economic value. Therefore, intensive effort is now being expended to obtain species that are lower on the food chain (Pauley et al., 1 998). This has serious implications; as the lower levels of the food chain decline, the chances of revival at the top ofthe food chain are diminished even further (Williams, 1 998). Top-down ecosystem degradation can result in a variety of unfavorable species abundance shifts (Goeden, 1 982) and, potentially, outright ecosystem collapse (Pauley et al, 1998). Further cumulative assessments of managed species in the South Atlantic may reveal long-term declines similar to those now identified in the Keys. Under such circumstances, traditional management measures (e.g., size and harvest limits), may not be adequate to rebuild sustainable fisheries for the most desirable species.\n\n352\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\n5.0 ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS Established policies and procedures ofthe SAFMC and the NMFS (Appendix N) provide\nthe framework for conserving and enhancing essential fish habitat. Integral components of this framework include adverse impact avoidance and minimization; provision of compensatory mitigation whenever the impact is significant and unavoidable; and incorporation of enhancement as a fundamental component of fishery resource recovery. New and expanded responsibilities contained in the MSFCMA will be met through appropriate application of these policies and principles. In assessing the potential impacts of proposed projects, the SAFMC, the NMFS, and USFWS are guided by the following general considerations:\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe extent to which the activity would directly and indirectly affect the occurrence,\n\nabundance, health, and continued existence of fishery resources;\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe extent to which the goal of \"no net-loss of wetlands\" would be attained;\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe extent to which an unacceptable precedent may be established or potential for a\n\nsignificant cumulative impact exists;\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe extent to which adverse impacts can be avoided through project modification or\n\nother safeguards;\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe availability of alternative sites and actions that would reduce project impacts;\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe extent to which the activity is water dependent if loss or degradation of EFH is\n\ninvolved; and\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe extent to which mitigation may be used to offset unavoidable loss of aquatic habitat\n\nfunctions and values.\n\n5.1 SAFMC Essential Fish Habitat and Environmental Protection Policy In recognizing that managed species are dependent on the quantity and quality of their\nessential habitats, it is the policy of the SAFMC to protect, restore, and develop habitats upon which species fisheries depend; to increase the extent of their distribution and abundance; and to improve their productive capacity for the benefit of present and future generations. For purposes ofthis policy, 'habitat\" is defined as the physical, chemical, and biological parameters that are necessary for continued productivity of the species that is being managed. The objectives of the SAFMC policy will be accomplished through the recommendation of no net loss or significant environmental degradation of existing habitat. A long-term objective is to support and promote a net-gain of fisheries habitat through the restoration and rehabilitation of the productive capacity of habitats that have been degraded, and the creation and development of productive habitats where increased fishery production is probable. The SAFMC will pursue these goals at state, Federal, and local levels. The Council shall assume an aggressive role in the protection and enhancement of habitats important to species, and shall actively enter Federal, decision-making processes where proposed actions may otherwise compromise the productivity of fishery resources of concern to the Council.\n\n353\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nS.2 SAFMC Essential Fish Habitat Policy Statements S.2.1 SAFMC Policy Statements on Essential Fish Habitat Types S.2.1.1 SAFMC Policy for Protection and Enhancement of Marine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Habitat.\nThe South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) and the Habitat and Environmental Protection Advisory Panel has considered the issue of the decline of Marine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation SAV (or seagrass) habitat in Florida and North Carolina as it relates to Council habitat policy. Subsequently, the Council's Habitat Committee requested that the Habitat Advisory Panel develop the following policy statement to support Council efforts to protect and enhance habitat for managed species.\nDescription and Function: In the South Atlantic region, SAV is found primarily in the states of Florida and North\nCarolina where environmental conditions are ideal for the propagation of seagrasses. The distribution of SAV habitat is indicative of its importance to economically important fisheries: in North Carolina, total SAV coverage is estimated to be 200,000 acres; in Florida, the total SAV coverage is estimated to be 2.9 million acres. SAV serves several valuable ecological functions in the marine systems where it occurs. Food and shelter afforded by SAV result in a complex and dynamic system that provides a primary nursery habitat for various organisms that is important both to the overall system ecology as well as to commercial and recreationally important fisheries. SAV habitat is valuable both ecologically as well as economically; as feeding, breeding, and nursery ground for numerous estuarine species, SAV provides for rich ecosystem diversity. Further, a number ofnfish and shellfish species, around which is built several vigorous commercial and recreational fisheries, rely on SAV habitat for a least a portion of their life cycles.\nStatus: SAV habitat is currently threatened by the cumulative effects of overpopulation and\nconsequent commercial development and recreation in the coastal zone. The major anthropogenic threats to SAV habitat include:\n(1 ) mechanical damage due to: (a) propeller damage from boats, (b) bottom\u00b7disturbing fish harvesting techniques, (c) dredging and filling;\n(2) biological degradation due to: (a) water quality deterioration by modification of temperature, salinity, and light attenuation regimes; (b) addition of organic and inorganic chemicals.\nSAV habitat in both Florida and North Carolina has experienced declines from both natural and anthropogenic causes. However, conservation measures taken by state and federal agencies have produced positive results. The National Marine Fisheries Service has produced maps ofnSAV habitat in the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound region of North Carolina to help stem the loss of this critical habitat. The threats to this habitat and the potential for successful conservation measures highlight the need to address the decline of SAV. Therefore, the South Atlantic Council\n354\n\n\f5 .0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nrecommends immediate and direct action be taken to stem the loss of this essential habitat. For more detailed discussion, please see Appendix 2.\n\nManagement: Conservation ofexisting SAV habitat is critical to the maintenance ofthe living resources\nthat depend on these systems. A number of federal and state laws and regulations apply to modifications, either direct or indirect, to SAV habitat. However, to date the state and federal regulatory process has accomplished little to slow the decline of SAV habitat. Furthermore, mitigative measures to restore or enhance impacted SAV have met with little success. These habitats cannot be readily restored; the South Atlantic Council is not aware of any seagrass restoration project that has ever prevented a net loss of SAV habitat. It has been difficult to implement effective resource management initiatives to preserve existing seagrass habitat resources due to the lack of adequate documentation and specific cause/effect relationships. (for more detailed discussion, please see Appendix 3)\nBecause restoration/enhancement efforts have not met with success, the South Atlantic Council considers it imperative to take a directed and purposeful action to protect remaining SAV habitat. The South Atlantic Council strongly recommends that a comprehensive strategy to address the disturbing decline in SAV habitat in the South Atlantic region be developed. Furthermore, as a stepping stone to such a long-term protection strategy, the South Atlantic Council recommends that a reliable status and trend survey be adopted to verify the scale of local declines of SAV.\nThe South Atlantic Council will address the decline of SAV, and consider establishing specific plans for revitalizing the SAV resources of the South Atlantic region. This may be achieved by the following integrated triad of efforts:\n\nP\u00b7 lanninTgh:e Council promotes regional planning which treats SAV as a integral part of an ecological system.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe Council supports comprehensive planning initiatives as well as interagency\n\ncoordination and planning on SAV matters.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe Council recommends that the Habitat Advisory Panel members actively seek to\n\ninvolve the Council in the review of projects which will impact, either directly or\n\nindirectly, SAV habitat resources.\n\nM\u00b7 onitoPreinrigodaincdsuRrevseeyasrocfh:SAV in the region are required to determine the progress toward the goal of a net resource gain.\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe Council supports efforts to\n\n(1 ) standardize mapping protocols,\n\n(2) develop a Geographic Information System databases for essential habitat including\n\nseagrass, and\n\n(3) research and document causes and effects of SAV decline including the cumulative\n\nimpacts of shoreline development.\n\n355\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nEducation and Enforcement: The Council supports education programs designed to heighten the public's awareness of the importance of SAV. An informed public will provide a firm foundation of support for protection and restoration efforts. Existing regulations and enforcement need to be reviewed for their effectiveness. Coordination with state resource and regulatory agencies should be supported to assure that existing regulations are being enforced.\n356\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nSAFMC SAV Policy Statement- Appendix 1 DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTION\nWorldwide, Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) constitutes one of the most conspicuous and common shallow-water habitat types. These angiosperms have successfully colonized standing and flowing fresh, brackish, and marine waters in all climatic zones, and most are rooted in the sediment. Marine SAV beds occur in the low intertidal and subtidal zones and may exhibit a wide range of habitat forms, from extensive collections of isolated patches to unbroken continuous beds. The bed is defined by the presence of either aboveground vegetation, its associated root and rhizome system (with living meristem), or the presence of a seed bank in the sediments, as well as the sediment upon which the plant grows or in which the seed back resides. In the case of patch beds, the unvegetated sediment among the patches is considered seagrass habitat as well.\nThere are seven species of seagrass in Florida 's shallow coastal areas: turtle grass (Tha/assia testudium); manatee grass (Syringodiumfiliforme); shoal grass (Halodule wrightii); star grass (Halophi/a enge/manni); paddle grass (Ha/ophila decipiens); and Johnson's seagrass (Halophi/ajohnsonii) (See distribution maps in Appendix 4). Recently, H. johnsonii has been proposed for listing by the National Marine Fisheries Service as an endangered plant spe cies. Areas of seagrass concentration along Florida 's east coast are Mosquito Lagoon, Banana River, Indian River Lagoon, Lake Worth and Biscayne Bay. Florida Bay, located between the Florida Keys and the mainland, also has an abundance of seagrasses, but is currently experiencing an unprecedented decline in SAV distribution.\nThe three dominant species found in North Carolina are shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii), eelgrass (Zostera marina), and widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima). Shoalgrass, a subtropical species has its northernmost distribution at Oregon Inlet, North Carolina. Eelgrass, a temperate species, has its southernmost distribution in North Carolina. Areas of seagrass concentration in North Carolina are southern and eastern Pamlico Sound, Core Sound, Back Sound, Bogue Sound and the numerous small southern sounds located behind the beaches in Onslow, Pender, Brunswick, and New Hanover Counties (See distribution maps in Appendix 4).\nSeagrasses serve several valuable ecological functions in the marine estuarine systems where they occur. Food and shelter afforded by the SAV result in a complex and dynamic system that provides a primary nursery habitat for various organisms that are important both ecologically and to commercial and recreational fisheries. Organic matter produced by these seagrasses is transferred to secondary consumers through three pathways : herbivores that consume living plant matter; detritivores that exploit dead matter; and microorganisms that use seagrass-derived particulate and dissolved organic compounds . The living leaves of these submerged plants also provide a substrate for the attachment of detritus and epiphytic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, meiofauna, micro- and marcroalgae, macroinvertebrates. Within the seagrass system, phytoplankton also are present in the water column, and macroalgae and microalgae are associated with the sediment. No less important is the protection afforded by the variety of living spaces in the tangled leaf canopy of the grass bed itself. In addition to\n357\n\n\f5 .0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nbiological benefits, the SAVs also cycle nutrients and heavy metals in the water and sediments, and dissipate wave energy (which reduces shoreline erosion and sediment resuspension).\nThere are several types of association fish may have with the SAVs. Resident species typically breed and carry out much of their life history within the meadow (e.g., gobiids and syngnathids). Seasonal residents typically breed elsewhere, but predictably utilize the SAV\nduring a portion of their life cycle, most often as a juvenile nursery ground (e.g., sparids and\nlutjanids). Transient species can be categorized as those that feed or otherwise utilize the SAV only for a portion of their daily activity, but in a systematic or predictable manner (e.g., haemulids).\nIn Florida many economically important species utilize SAV beds as nursery and/or spawning habitat. Among these are spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebu/osus), grunts (Haemulids), snook (Centropomus sp. ), bonefish (A/bu/u vu/pes), tarpon (Mega/ops atlanticus) and several species of snapper (Lutianids) and grouper (Serranids). Densities of invertebrate organisms are many times greater in seagrass beds than in bare sand habitat. Penaeid shrimp, spiny lobster (Panuli111s argus), and bay scallops (Argopecten i\"adians) are also dependent on seagrass beds.\nIn North Carolina 40 species of fish and invertebrates have been captured on seagrass beds. Larval and juvenile fish and shellfish including gray trout (Cynoscion regalis), red drum (Sciaenops ocel/atus), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebu/osus), mullet (Mugil cepha/us), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), pinfish (Orthopristis chrysoptera), gag (Mycteroperca microlepis}, white grunt (Haemulon plumieri), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), southern flounder (P. /ethostigma), blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), hard shell clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), and bay scallops (Argopecten i\"adains) utilize the SAV beds as nursery areas. They are the sole nursery grounds for bay scallops in North Carolina. SAV meadows are also frequented by adult spot, spotted seatrout, bluefish (Pomatomus sa/tatrix), menhaden (Brevortia tyrannus), summer and southern flounder, pink and brown shrimp, hard shell clams, and blue crabs and offshore reef fishes including black sea bass (Centropristis striata), gag (Mycteroperca microlepis), gray snapper (Lutianus griseus), lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris), mutton snapper (Lutianus analis), and spottail pin.fish (Dip/odus holbrooki). Ospreys, egrets, herons, gulls and terns feed on fauna in SAV beds, while swans, geese, and ducks feed directly on the grass itself. Green sea turtles (CheIonia mydas) also utilize seagrass beds, and juveniles may feed directly on the seagrasses.\n358\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nSAFMC SAV Policy Statement- Appendix 2 STATUS\nThe SAV habitat represents a valuable natural resource which is now threatened by overpopulation in coastal areas. The major anthropogenic activities that impact seagrass habitats are: 1 ) dredging and filling, 2) certain fish harvesting techniques and recreational vehicles, 3) degradation of water quality by modification ofnormal temperature, salinity, and light regimes, and 4) addition of organic and inorganic chemicals. Although not caused by man, disease (\"wasting disease\" of eelgrass) has historically been a factor. Direct causes such as dredging and filling, impacts ofbottom disturbing fishing gear, and impacts ofpropellers and boat wakes are easily observed, and can be controlled by wise management of our seagrass resources (See Appendix 3 ). Indirect losses are more subtle and difficult to assess. These losses center around changes in light availability to the plants by changes in turbidity and water color. Other indirect causes of seagrass loss may be ascribed to changing hydrology which may in turn affect salinity levels and circulation. Reduction in flushing can cause an increase in salinity and the ambient temperature of a water body, stressing the plants. Increase in flushing can mean decreased salinity and increased turbidity and near-bottom mechanical stresses which damage or uproot plants.\nIncreased turbidity and decreasing water transparency are most often recognized as the cause of decreased seagrass growth and altered distribution of the habitats. Turbidity may result from upland runoff, either as suspended sediment or dissolved nutrients. Reduced transparency due to color is affected by freshwater discharge. The introduction of additional nutrients from terrigenous sources often leads to plankton blooms and increased epiphytization of the plants, further reducing light to the plants. Groundwater enriched by septic systems also may infiltrate the sediments, water column, and near-shore seagrass beds with the same effect. Lowered dissolved oxygen is detrimental to invertebrate and vertebrate grazers. Loss of these grazers results in overgrowth by epiphytes.\nLarge areas of Florida where seagrasses were abundant have now lost these beds from both natural and man-induced causes. (This is not well documented on a large scale except in the case of Tampa Bay). One of these depleted areas is Lake Worth in Palm Beach County. Here, dredge and fill activities, sewage disposal and stonnwater runoff have almost eliminated this resource. North Biscayne Bay lost most of its seagrasses from \u00b7urbanization. The Indian River Lagoon has lost many seagrass beds from stonnwater runoff has caused a decrease in water transparency and reduced light penetration. Many seagrass beds in Florida have been scarred from boat propellers disrupting the physical integrity of the beds. Vessel registrations, both commercial and recreational, have tripled from 1 970-7 1 (235, 293) to 1 992-93 (7 1 5,5 16). More people engaged in marine activities having an effect on the limited resources of fisheries and benthic communities, Florida's assessment of dredging/propeller scar damage indicates that Dade, Lee, Monroe, and Pinellas Counties have the most heavily damaged seagrass beds. Now Florida Bay, which is rather remote from human population concentrations, is experiencing a die-off of seagrasses, the cause ofwhich has not yet been isolated. Cascading effects of die-offs cause a release of nutrients resulting in algal blooms which, in turn, adversely affect other seagrass areas, and appear to be preventing recolonization and natural succession in the bay. It appears that Monroe County's commercial fish and shellfish resources, with a dockside landing value of $50 million per year, is in serious jeopardy.\n359\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nIn North Carolina total SAV coverage is estimated a 200,000 acres. Compared to the state's brackish water SAV community, the marine SAVs appear relatively stable. The drought and increased water clarity during the summer of 1 986 apparently caused an increase in SAV abundance in southeastern Pamlico Sound and a concomitant increase in bay scallop densities. Evidence is emerging, however, that characteristics of\"wasting disease\" are showing up in some of the eelgrass populations in southern Core Sound, Back Sound, and Bogue Sound. The nwnber ofpermits requested for development activities that potentially impact SAV populations is increasing. The combined impacts of a number of small, seemingly isolated activities are cwnulative and can lead to the collapse of large seagrass biosystems. Also increasing is evidence of the secondary removal of seagrasses. Clam-kicking (the harvest of hard clams utilizing powerful propeller wash to dislodge the clams from the sediment) is contentious issue within the state ofNorth Carolina. The scientific community is convinced that mechanical harvesting of clams damages SAV communities. The scallop fishery also could be harmed by harvest-related damage to eelgrass meadows.\n3 60\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nSAFMC SAV Policy Statement- Appendix 3 MANAGEMENT\nConservation ofexisting SAV habitat is critical to the maintenance ofthe living resources that depend on these systems. A nwnber of federal and state laws require permits for modification and/or development in SAV. These include Section 1 0 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (1 899), Section 404 ofthe Clean Water Act (1 977), and the states' coastal area management programs. Section 404 prohibits deposition of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States without a permit from the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act gives federal and state resource agencies the authority to review and comment on permits, while the National Environmental Policy Act requires the development and review of Environmental Impact Statements. The Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act has been amended to require that each fishery management plan include a habitat section. The Council's habitat subcommittee may comment on permit requests submitted to the Corps of Engineers when the proposed activity relates to habitat essential to managed species.\nState and federal regulatory processes have accomplished little to slow the decline of SAV habitat. Many of the impacts cannot be easily controlled by the regulations as enforced. For example, water quality standards are written so as to allow a specified deviation from background concentration, in this manner standards allow a certain amount of degradation. An example of this is Florida's class III water transparency standard, which defines the compensation depth to be where 1% ofthe incident light remains. The compensation depth for seagrass is in excess of 10% and for some species is between 1 5 and 20%. The standard allows a deviation of 1 0% in the compensation depth which translates into 0.9% incident light or an order of magnitude less than what the plants require.\nMitigative measures to restore or enhance impacted areas have met with little success. SAV habitats cannot be readily restored; in fact, the South Atlantic Council is not aware of any seagrass restoration project that has ever avoided a net loss of seagrass habitat. It has been difficult to implement effective resource management initiatives to preserve seagrass habitat due to the lack of documentation on specific cause/effect relationships. Even though studies have identified certain cause/effect relationships in the destruction of these areas, lack of long-term, ecosystem-scale studies precludes an accurate scientific evaluation of the long-term deterioration of seagrasses. Some of the approaches to controlling propeller scar damage to seagrass beds include: education, improved channel marking restricted access zones, (complete closure to combustion engines, pole or troll areas), and improved enforcement. The South Atlantic Council sees the need for monitoring of seagrass restoration and mitigation not only to determine success from plant standpoint but also for recovery of faunal populations and functional attributes of the essential habitat type. The South Atlantic Council also encourages long-term trend analysis monitoring of distribution and abundance using appropriate protocols and Geographic Information System approaches.\nSAFMC SAV Policy Statement- Appendix 4 (SAV Distribution Maps in SAFMC 1995 and Revised in Appendix C)\n361\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\n\nS.2.2 SAFMC Policy Statements on Activities Affecting Habitat\n\nS.2.2.1\n\nSAFMC Policy Statement Concerning Dredging and Dredge Material\n\nDisposal Activities\n\nS.2.2.1.1 Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Sites (ODMDS) and SAFMC Policies The shortage of adequate upland disposal sites for dredged materials has forced dredging\n\noperations to look offshore for sites where dredged materials may be disposed. These Ocean\n\nDredged Material Disposal Sites (ODMDSs) have been designated by the U. S. Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (EPA) and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) as suitable sites for disposal of dredged materials associated with berthing and navigation channel maintenance\n\nactivities. The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC; the Council) is moving to\n\nestablish its presence in regulating disposal activities at these ODMDSs. Pursuant to the\n\nMagnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (the Magnuson Act), the regional\n\nfishery management Councils are charged with management of living marine resources and their\n\nhabitat within the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States. Insofar as\n\ndredging and disposal activities at the various ODMDSs can impact fishery resources or essential\n\nhabitat under Council jurisdiction, the following policies address the Council's role in the\n\ndesignatio operation, maintenance, and enforcement of activities in the ODMDSs:\n\nThe Council acknowledges that living marine resources under its jurisdiction and their\n\nessential habitat may be impacted by the designation, operation, and maintenance of ODMDSs\n\nin the South Atlantic. The Council may review the activities of EPA, COE, the state Ports\n\nAuthorities, private dredging contractors, and any other entity engaged in activities which impact, directly or indirectly, living marine resources within the EEZ.\n\nThe Council may review plans and offer comments on the designation, maintenance, and\n\nenforcement of disposal activities at the ODMDSs. ODMDSs should be designated or redesignated so as to avoid the loss of live or hard\n\nbottom habitat and minimize impacts to all living marine resources.\n\nNotwithstanding the fluid nature of the marine environment, all impacts from the disposal\n\nactivities should be contained within the designated perimeter of the ODMDSs. The final designation of ODMDSs should be contingent upon the development of suitable\n\nmanagement plans and a demonstrated ability to implement and enforce that plan. The Council\n\nencourages EPA to press for the implementation of such management plans for all designated\n\nODMDSs. All activities within the ODMDSs are required to be consistent with the approved\n\nmanagement plan for the site.\n\nThe Council's Habitat and Environmental Protection Advisory Panel when requested by the Council will review such management plans and forward comment to the Council. The\n\nCouncil may review the plans and recommendations received from the advisory sub-panel and\n\ncomment to the appropriate agency. All federal agencies and entities receiving a comment or\n\nrecommendation from the Council will provide a detailed written response to the Council\n\nregarding the matter pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1 852 (i). All other agencies and entities receiving a\n\ncomment or recommendation from the Council should provide a detailed written response to the\n\nCouncil regarding the matter, such as is required for federal agencies pursuant to 16 U. S.C. 1852\n\n(i).\n\nODMDSs management plans should indicate appropriate users of the site. These plans should specify those entities/ agencies which may use the ODMDSs, such as port authorities, the\n\nU. S. Navy, the Corps of Engineers, etc. Other potential users of the ODMDSs should be\n\n362\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nacknowledged and the feasibility of their using the ODMDSs site should be assessed in the management plan.\nFeasibility studies of dredge disposal options should acknowledge and incorporate ODMDSs in the larger analysis of dredge disposal sites within an entire basin or project. F or example, Corps of Engineers analyses of existing and potential dredge disposal sites for harbor maintenance projects should incorporate the ODMDSs. as part of the overall analysis of dredge disposal sites.\nThe Council recognizes that EPA and other relevant agencies are involved in managing and/or regulating the disposal of all dredged material. The Council recognizes that disposal activities regulated under the Ocean Dumping Act and dredging/filling carried out under the Clean Water Act have similar impacts to living marine resources and their habitats. Therefore, the Council urges these agencies apply the same strict policies to disposal activities at the ODMDSs. These policies apply to activities including, but not limited to, the disposal of contaminated sediments and the disposal of large volumes of fine-grained sediments. The Council will encourage strict enforcement of these policies for disposal activities in the EEZ. Insofar as these activities are relevant to disposal activities in the EEZ, the Council will offer comments on the further development of policies regarding the disposal/ deposition of dredged materials.\nThe Ocean Dumping Act requires that contaminated materials not be placed in an approved ODMDS. Therefore, the Council encourages relevant agencies to address the problem of disposal of contaminated materials. Although the Ocean Dumping Act does not specifically address inshore disposal activities, the Council encourages EPA and other relevant agencies to evaluate sites for the suitability of disposal and containment of contaminated dredged material. The Council further encourages those agencies to draft management plans for the disposal of contaminated dredge materials. A consideration for total removal from the basin should also be considered should the material be contaminated to a level that it would have to be relocated away from the coastal zone. 5.l.l.1.l Offshore and Nearshore Underwater Berm Creation\nThe use of underwater berms in the South Atlantic region has recently been proposed as a disposal technique that may aid in managing sand budgets on inlet and beachfront areas. Two types of berms have been proposed to date, one involving the creation of a long offshore berm, the second involving the placement of underwater berms along beachfronts bordering an inlet. These berms would theoretically reduce wave energy reaching the beaches and/or resupply sand to the system.\nThe Council recognizes offshore berm construction as a disposal activity. As such, all policies regarding disposal of dredged materials shall apply to offshore berm construction. Research should be conducted to quantify larval fish and crustacean transport and use of the inlets prior to any consideration of placement of underwater berms. Until the impacts of berm creation in inlet areas on larval fish and crustacean transport are determined, the Council recommends that disposal activities should be confined to approved ODMDSs. Further, new offshore and near shore underwater berm creation activities should be reviewed under the most rigorous criteria, on a case-by-case basis. 5.l.2.1.3 Maintenance Dredging and Sand Mining for Beach Renourishment\nThe Council recognizes that construction and maintenance dredging of the seaward portions of entrance channels and dredging borrow areas for beach re-nourishment occur in the\n363\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nEEZ. These activities should be done in an appropriate manner in accordance with the policies adopted by the Cowicil.\nThe Council acknowledges that endangered and threatened species mortalities have occurred as a result of dredging operations. Considering the stringent regulations placed on commercial fisherman, dredging or disposal activities should not be designed or conducted so as to adversely impact rare, threatened or endangered species. NMFS Protected Species Division should work with state and federal agencies to modify proposals to minimize potential impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles and marine mammals.\nThe Council has and will continue to coordinate with Minerals Management Service (MMS) in their activities involving exploration, identification and dredging/mining of sand resources for beach renourishment. This will be accomplished through membership on state task forces or directly with MMS. The Council recommends that live bottom/hard bottom habitat and historic fishing growids be identified for areas in the South Atlantic region to provide for the location and protection of these areas while facilitating the identification of sand sources for beach renourishment projects. 5.2.2.1.4 Open Water Disposal\nThe SAFMC is opposed to the open water disposal of dredged material into aquatic systems which may adversely impact habitat that fisheries under Council jurisdiction are dependent upon. The Council urges state and federal agencies, when reviewing permits considering open water disposal, to identify the direct and indirect impacts such projects could have on fisheries habitat.\nThe SAFMC concludes that the conversion of one naturally functioning aquatic system at the expense of creating another (marsh creation through open water disposal) must be justified given best available information. 5.2.2.2 SAFMC Policy on Oil & Gas Exploration, Development and Transportation\nThe SAFMC urged the Secretary of Commerce to uphold the 1988 coastal zone inconsistency determination of the State of Florida for the respective plans of exploration filed with Minerals Management Service (MMS) by Mobil Exploration and Producing North America, Inc. for Lease OCS-G6520 (Pulley Ridge Block 799) and by Union Oil Company of California for Lease OCS-G649 1/6492 (Pulley Ridge Blocks 629 & 630). Both plans of exploration involve lease blocks lying within the lease area comprising the offshore area encompassed by Part 2 of Lease Sale 116, and south of 26\u00b0 North latitude. The Council's objection to the proposed exploration activities is based on the potential degradation or loss of extensive live bottom and other habitat essential to fisheries under Council jurisdiction.\nThe SAFMC also supported North Carolina's determination that the plans of exploration filed with MMS by Mobil Exploration and Producing North America, Inc. for Lease OCS Manteo Unit are not consistent with North Carolina's Coastal Zone Management program.\nThe Council has expressed concern to the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing and Development Task Force about the proposed area and recommends that no further exploration or production activity be allowed in the areas subject to Presidential Task Force Review (the section of Sale 116 south of 26\u00b0 N latitude).\nThe SAFMC recommends the following to the MMS when considering proposals for oil and gas activities for previously leased areas under Council j urisdiction:\n364\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\n1) That oil or gas drilling for exploration or development on or closely associated with live bottom habitat, or other special biological resources essential to commercial and recreational fisheries under Council jurisdiction, be prohibited. 2) That all facilities associated with oil and gas exploration, development, and transportation be designed to avoid impacts on coastal wetlands and sand sharing systems. 3) That adequate spill containment and cleanup equipment be maintained for all development and transportation facilities and, that the equipment be available on site within the trajectory time to land, and have industry post a bond to assure labor or other needed reserves. 4) That exploration and development activities should be scheduled to avoid northern right whales in coastal waters off Georgia and Florida as well as migrations of that species and other marine mammals off South Atlantic states. 5) That the EIS for Lease Sale 56 be updated to address impacts from activities related to specifically natural gas production, safety precautions which must be developed in the event of a discovery of a \"sour gas\" or hydrogen sulfide reserve, the potential for southerly transport of hydrocarbons to near shore and inshore estuarine habitats resulting from the cross-shelf transport by Gulf Stream spin-off eddies, the development of contingency plans to be implemented if problems arise due to the very dynamic oceanographic conditions and the extremely rugged bottom, and the need for and availability of onshore support facilities in coastal North and South Carolina, and an analysis of existing facilities and community services in light of existing major coastal developments.\nThe SAFMC recommends the following concerns and issues be addressed by the MMS prior to approval of any application for a permit to drill any exploratory wells in Lease Sale 56 and that these concerns and issues also be included in the Environmental Impact Statement for the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Leasing Plan for 1 992-1997: 1) Identification ofthe on-site fisheries resources, including both pelagic and benthic communities, that inhabit, spawn, or migrate through the lease sites with special focus on those specific lease blocks where industry has expressed specific interest in the pre-lease phases of the leasing process. Particular attention should be given to critical life history stages. Eggs and larvae are most sensitive to oil spills, and seismic exploration has been documented to cause mortality of eggs and larvae in close proximity. 2) Identification of on-site species designated as endangered, threatened, or of special concern, such as shortnose sturgeon, striped bass, blueback herring, American shad, sea turtles, marine mammals, pelagic birds, and all species regulated under federal fishery management plans. 3) Determination of impacts of all exploratory and development activities on the fisheries resources prior to MMS approval ofany applications for permits to drill in the Exploratory Unit area, including effects of seismic survey signals on fish behavior, eggs and larvae; temporary preclusion from fishing grounds by exploratory drilling; and permanent preclusion from fishing grounds by production and transportation. 4) Identification of commercial and recreational fishing activities in the vicinity of the lease or Exploratory Unit area, their season of occurrence and intensity. 5) Determination of the physical oceanography of the area through field studies by MMS or the applicant, including on-site direction and velocity of currents and tides, sea states, temperature, salinity, water quality, wind storms frequencies, and intensities and icing conditions. Such studies must be required prior to approval of any exploration plan submitted in order to have an adequate informational database upon which to base subsequent decision making on-site specific proposed activities.\n365\n\n\f5 .0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\n6) Description of required existing and planned monitoring activities intended to measure environmental conditions, and provide data and information on the impacts of exploration activities in the lease area or the Exploratory Unit area. 7) Identification of the quantity, composition, and method of disposal of solid and liquid wastes and pollutants likely to be generated by offshore, onshore, and transportation operations associated with oil and gas exploration development and transportation. 8) Development of an oil spill contingency plan which includes oil spill trajectory analyses specific to the area ofoperations, dispersant-use plan including a summary oftoxicity data for each dispersant, identification ofresponse equipment and strategies, establishment of procedures for early detection and timely notification of an oil spill including a c.urrent list of persons and regulatory agencies to be notified when an oil spill is discovered, and well defined and specific actions to be taken after discoveiy of an oil spill. 9) Studies should include detailing seasonal surface currents and likely spill trajectories. 10) Mapping of environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., spawning aggregations ofsnappers and groupers); coral resources and other significant benthic habitats (e.g., tilefish mudflats) along the edge of the continental shelf (including the upper slope); the calico scallop, royal red shrimp, and other productive benthic fishing grounds; other special biological resources; and northern right whale calving grounds and migratory routes, and subsequent deletion from inclusion in the respective lease block(s). 11) Planning for oil and gas product transport should be done to detennine methods of transport, pipeline corridors, and onshore facilities. Siting and design of these facilities as well as onshore receiving, holding, and transport facilities could have impacts on wetlands and endangered species habitats if they are not properly located. 12) Develop understanding of community dynamics, pathways, and flows of energy to ascertain accumulation of toxins and impacts on community by first order toxicity. 13) Detennine shelf-edge down-slope dynamics and resource assessments to detennine fates of contaminants due to the critical nature of canyons and steep relief to important fisheries (e.g., swordfish, billfish, and tuna). 14) Discussion of the potential adverse impacts upon fisheries resources ofthe discharges of all drill cuttings that may result from activities in, and all drilling muds that may be approved for use in the lease area or the Exploration Unit area including: physical and chemical effects upon pelagic and benthic species and communities including their spawning behaviors and effects on eggs and larval stages; effects upon sight feeding species of fish; and analysis of methods and assumptions underlying the model used to predict the dispersion and discharged muds and cuttings from exploration activities. 15) Discussion of secondary impacts affecting fishery resources associated with on-shore oil and gas related development such as storage and processing facilities, dredging and dredged material disposal, roads and rail lines, fuel and electrical transmission line routes, waste disposal, and others.\nThe following section addresses the recommendations, concerns and issues expressed by the South Atlantic Council (Source: Memorandum to Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Atlanta, Georgia from Regional Director, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region dated October 27, 1995):\n\"The MM:S, North Carolina, and Mobil entered into an innovative Memorandum of Understanding on July 12, 1990, in which the MMS agreed to prepare an Environmental Report (ER) on proposed drilling offshore North Carolina. The scope of the ER prepared by the MMS was more comprehensive than and EIS would be. The normal scoping process used in\n366\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\npreparation of a NEPA-type document would not only \"identify significant environmental issues deserving of study\" but also \"deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope\" (40 CFR 1500.4) by scoping out issues not ripe for decisions.\nOf particular interest to North Carolina are not the transient effects of exploration, but rather the downstream and potentially broader, long-term effects of production and development. The potential effects associated with production and development would normally be \"scoped out\" of the (EIS-type) document and would be the subject of extensive NEPA analysis only after the exploration phase proves successful, and the submittal of a full-scale production and development program has been received for review and analysis. The ER addressed three alternatives: the proposed Mobil plan to drill a single exploratory well, the no-action alternative; and the alternative that the MMS approve the Mobil plan with specific restrictions (monitoring programs and restrictions on discharges). The ER also analyzes possible future activities, such as development and production, and the long-term environmental and socioeconomic effects associated with such activities. The MMS assured North Carolina that all of the State's comments and concerns would be addressed in the Final ER (MMS, 1 990).\nThe MMS also funded a Literature Synthesis study (USDOI MMS, 1993a) and a Physical Oceanography study (USDOI MMS, 1 994), both recommended by the Physical Oceanography Panel and the Environmental Sciences Review Panel (ESRP). Mobil also submitted a draft report to the MMS titled, Characterization ofCurrents at Manteo Block 467 off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The MMS also had a Cooperative Agreement with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to fund a study titled, Seafloor Survey in the Vicinity of the Manteo Prospect Offshore North Carolina (USDOI MMS, 1993b). The MMS had a Cooperative Agreement with East Carolina University to conduct a study titled, Coastal North Carolina Socioeconomic Study (USDOI MMS, 1993c). The above-mentioned studies were responsive to the ESRP 's recommendations as well as those ofthe SAFMC and the State ofNorth Carolina. Citations : USDOI, MMS. 1990.

Until ocean dumping of these materials ceases, the SAFMC strongly urges state and Federal agencies to control the amount of industrial waste, sludge, and other harmful materials discharged into rivers and the marine environment , and these agencies should increase their monitoring and research of waste discharge. The SAFMC requests that the Environmental Protection Agency continue to implement and enforce all legislation, rules, and regulations with increased emphasis on the best available technology requirements and pretreatment standards. The SAFMC requests that EPA require each permitted ocean dumping vessel (carrying the above described material) to furnish detailed information concerning each trip to the dump site. This might be monitored with transponders, locked Loran C recorder plots of trips to and from dump sites, phone calls to the EPA when a vessel leaves and returns to port, or other appropriate methods. Also the EPA should take legal action to enforce illegal (short or improper ) dumping. The SAFMC requests that fishermen and other members ofthe public report to the EPA, Coast Guard, and the Councils any vessels dumping other than in approved dump sites. The SAFMC supports the phase out of ocean dumping of the above described materials. 5.3 Activity Based Policies 5.3.1 Docks and Piers\nDocks and piers, whether built over or floating on the water, are generally acceptable methods of gaining access to deep water. General considerations include: a. Docks and piers should be constructed so that waterflow restriction and blockage of sunlight on wetland surfaces is avoided or minimized; b. Docks and piers should be of adequate length to reach navigational depths without increasing dredging needs; and c. Docks and piers should be designed and located to avoid areas that support submerged aquatic vegetation, shellfish beds and harvest areas, and other fragile and productive habitats. 5.3.2 Boat Ramps a. Sites should be located along shorelines that do not support wetland vegetation and where adjacent waters have adequate navigational depths. Acceptable sites may include existing marinas; bridge approaches and causeways (with highway agency approval) where construction access channels exist; and natural and previously created deep water habitats; b. Preferably, sites should be restricted to areas that do not require dredging to gain access to navigable waters. When located in the vicinity of seagrass beds, adequate navigation channels must exist and should be clearly marked. Boat ramps should not be located in areas where boats will encroach on sensitive and productive habitats; c. Ramps should not be located in areas where encroachment into wetlands is likely to occur. Sites should contain adequate upland area for parking and for boat launching/removal; and d. Adequate waste collection facilities should be required at public facilities.\n368\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations 5.3.3 Marinas\nAll marinas adversely affect aquatic habitats to some degree. These effects can be minimized through proper location and design. In addition to applicable recommendations for boat ramps, bulkheads, and seawalls, the following apply: a. Marinas should be located in areas where suitable physical conditions exist. For example, potential sites should be located close to navigable waters and in locations where marina-related activities would not affect living marine resource forage, cover, harvest, and/or nursery habitats. Attention also should be given to sediment deposition rates and maintenance dredging requirements; b. Marinas should be located at least 1 ,000 feet from shellfish harvest areas, unless state regulations or other considerations specify differently; c. Dry-stack storage is generally preferable to wet mooring ofboats. Open dockage extending into deep water is generally preferable to basin excavation; d. Mooring basins should be sited in uplands rather than wetlands, and they should be designed so that water quality degradation does not occur. This may require consideration of basin flushing characteristics and incoiporation of other design features such as surface and waste water collection and treatment facilities; e. Turning basins and navigation channels should not create sumps and other slack-water areas that could degrade water quality nor should they be located in areas where circulation is poor. Depths generally should not exceed those of adjoining waters and, where practicable, they should provide for light penetration that is capable of sustaining benthic plant life. Dissolved oxygen levels in channels and basins should be adequate for fish and macroinvertebrate survival; f. Consideration should be given to aligning access channels and configuring marinas to take full advantage of circulation from prevailing summer winds; g. Permanent dredged material disposal sites (for use in initial and maintenance dredging) that do not impact wetland areas should be identified and acquired. Suitable disposal alternatives include placing dredged material on uplands, and using dredged material to create/restore wetlands. Projects that lack permanent disposal sites should not be authorized if maintenance dredging is needed and disposal sites/options are not available; h. Catchment basins for collecting and storing surface runoff should be included as components ofthe site development plan. Marine railways or upland repair facilities should be equipped with hazardous material containment facilities so that biocides such as marine paints, oil and grease, solvents, and related materials are not directly or indirectly discharged into coastal waters and wetlands; I. Consideration should be given to parking and other support facilities when it appears that available uplands are not adequate to support such needs and wetland encroachment is anticipated;\n369\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nj. Marinas with fueling facilities should be designed to include practical measures for reducing oil and gas spillage into the aquatic environment. Spill control plans may be needed when marina facilities are to be located in the vicinity of large, emergent wetland areas, shellfish harvest sites, and other fragile/productive aquatic sites; and k. Facilities for collection of trash and potential marine debris should be required. Where vessels with marine toilets will be moored, pump out facilities and notices regarding prohibition of sewage and other discharges should be provided. 5.3.4 Bulkheads and Seawalls\nBulkheads are used to protect adjacent shorelines from wave and current action and to enhance water access. Applications for bulkheads usually specify construction in open water followed by placing fill material behind the structure. Bulkheads may adversely impact wetlands through direct filling; through isolation; and through exacerbation of wave scour. Adverse impacts may be reduced by applying the following criteria: a. Except in cases of recent and rapid erosion, structures should be aligned at or shoreward of the normal high waterline. Structures should be constructed so that reflective wave energy does not scour or otherwise adversely affect adjacent EFH or wetlands. For example, in areas that support fringing wetlands consideration should be given to the use of breakwaters (with regular openings -- see item c., below) or placement of riprap at the toe of the bulkhead or along the waterward edge of eroding wetlands; b. Where possible, sloping (3 : 1 ) riprap, gabions, or vegetation should be used rather than vertical seawalls; and c. Shoreline protection devices that are located in areas having fringe wetlands should have openings that allow for fish ingress and egress and water circulation. Recommended spacing for structure openings is no less than one linear foot per five linear feet of structure. 5.3.5. Cables, Pipelines, and Transmission Lines\nWetland excavation is sometimes required for installing submerged cables, pipelines, and transmission lines. Construction also may require temporary or permanent wetlands filling. The following recommendations apply: a. Wetland crossings should be aligned along the least environmentally damaging route. Submerged aquatic vegetation, shellfish beds, coral reefs, etc., must be avoided; b. Construction of permanent access channels should be avoided since they disrupt natural drainage patterns and destroy wetlands through direct excavation, filling, and bank erosion. The pushditch method, in which the trench is immediately backfilled, reduces the impact duration; c. Excavated wetlands should be backfilled with either the same material as removed or a comparable material that is capable of supporting suitable replacement wetlands. Original marsh elevations should be restored and, where practicable, excavated vegetation should be stockpiled, kept viable, and returned to the excavated site. After backfilling, erosion protection measures should be implemented where needed to prevent fish habitat degradation and loss;\n370\n\n\f5 .0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nd. Excavated materials should be stored on uplands. If storage in wetlands cannot be avoided, discontinuous stock-piles should be used to allow continuation of sheet flow. Where practicable, stockpiled materials should be stored on construction cloth rather than bare marsh surfaces. Topsoil and organic surface material such as root mats should be stockpiled separately and returned to the surface of the restored site; e. In open-water areas, excavated materials should be deposited in discontinuous piles to preclude significant blockage of water movement. Back-filling is recommended if the excavated material would alter circulation patterns or interfere with fishing; f. U se of existing rights-of-way should be recommended when use of these areas would lessen overall wetland encroachment and disturbance; and g. Directional drilling, a technique that allows horizontal, sub-surface, placement of pipelines should be used in situations where normal trenching and backfill would cause unacceptable levels of habitat loss or alteration. 5.3.6. Transportation\nState and federal highway agencies generally have the capability of conducting advanced planning with road, causeway, and bridge construction To the extent possible, NMFS Branch Office and USFWS personnel should participate in early planning efforts. Since highway projects are generally considered to be in the public interest and frequently require wetland crossings, identification of mitigation needs, and development of suitable mitigation plans should be undertaken early in the planning process. The following criteria should be considered: a. Transportation corridors/facilities should avoid wetlands. Where wetland crossings cannot be avoided, bridging should be used rather than filling, and the least environmentally damaging route, preferably along existing rights-of-way and road beds, should be followed; b. Disrupting or reducing fish and invertebrate migration routes should be avoided. In areas that support or could support anadromous fish migrations, low, narrow, and/or dark passageways such as culverts and small bridges should not be utilized unless aligned and designed so that elimination of or significant reductions in fish migrations do not occur; c. Structures should be designed to prevent shoaling and alteration of natural water circulation. Suitable erosion control and vegetation restoration should be implemented at wetland crossings; and d. Transportation facilities should be designed to accommodate other public utilities, thus avoiding the need for additional wetland alteration. An example would be using bridges to support transmission lines and pipelines. 5.3.7. Navigation Channels and Boat Access Canals\nConstruction and maintenance of navigation channels and boat access canals may cause severe environmental harm. In addition to direct habitat losses associated with wetland and deepwater excavation and filling, these activities may significantly modify salinity and water\n371\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\ncirculation patterns . These changes could greatly modify the distribution and abundance of living marine resources. The following criteria should be followed: a. Where possible, dredging should be minimized through the use of natural and existing channels ; b. Alignments should avoid sensitive habitats such as shellfish beds, fin.fish and invertebrate nurseries, submerged aquatic vegetation, and emergent wetlands; c. Permanent dredged material disposal sites should be located in non-wetland areas. Where long-term maintenance excavation is anticipated, disposal sites should be acquired and maintained for the entire project life; d. Boat access canals should be designed to ensure adequate flushing and should be uniform in depth or made progressively deeper in the direction of receiving waters. Where possible, they should be aligned to take advantage of wind and lunar tides; e. Construction techniques that minimize turbidity and dispersal of dredged materials into sensitive wetland areas (e.g., submerged grasses and shellfish beds) are encouraged. Work should be scheduled to avoid periods of high biological activity such as fish and invertebrate migration and spawning; f. Care should be taken to avoid adverse alteration of tidal circulation patterns, salinity regimes, or other factors that influence local ecological and environmental conditions; g. Channels and access canals should not be constructed in areas known to have high sediment contaminant levels. If construction must occur in these areas, consideration should be given to the use of silt curtains or other techniques needed to contain suspended contaminants; and h. Use of sidecast dredges should be confined to areas such as inlets and open water areas where benthic communities are limited and hopper or pipeline dredging is not possible. 5.3.8. Disposal of Dredged Material\nPrevious and on-going disposal of dredged material is a major contributor to wetland losses in marine and estuarine ecosystems. Recognizing that most navigation channels and access canals require periodic maintenance dredging, it is important that long-range plans be developed and that they provide for mitigation of unavoidable adverse environmental impacts. Implementing the following criteria would minimize adverse impacts associated with most dredged material disposal activities : a. Dredged material should be viewed as a potentially reusable resource and beneficial uses of these materials should be encouraged. Materials that are suitable for beach replenishment, construction, or other useful purposes should be placed in accessible non-wetland disposal areas; b. Disposal sites that are located in unprotected coastal areas and adjacent to wetlands are especially susceptible to wind and water erosion. These forces can carry substantial quantities of\n372\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\ndredged material into aquatic habitats . If located near wetlands, disposal site surfaces should be stabilized using vegetation or other means to eliminate possible erosion or encroachment onto adjacent wetlands ; c. Dredged material should be placed in contained upland sites or approved open-water locations where adverse impacts to living marine resources are minimal. When placed in open water, dredged material should be used to enhance marine fishery resources. For example, materials could be used to renourish eroding wetlands or to fill previous borrow sites; d. The capacity of existing disposal areas should be used to the fullest extent possible. This may necessitate increasing the elevation of embankments to augment the holding capacity of the site and applying techniques that render dredged material suitable for export or for use in reestablishing wetland vegetation; e. Where possible, outfalls should be positioned so that they discharge into the dredged area or other sites that lack biological/ecological significance. When evaluating potential upland disposal sites, the possibility of saltwater intrusion into ground water and surrounding freshwater habitats should be assessed by the construction/regulatory agencies. Groundwater contamination could necessitate redesign of disposal practices, with subsequent harm to living marine resources; and f. Toxic and highly organic materials should be disposed in impervious containment basins located on upland. Effluent should be monitored to ensure compliance with state and federal water quality criteria and measures should be incorporated to ensure that surface runoff and leachate from dredged material disposal sites do not enter aquatic ecosystems. S.3.9. Impoundments and Other Water-Level Controls A. Wetland impoundments:\nThousands of wetland acres are impounded each year in the Southeast for purposes such as waterfowl habitat creation, aquaculture, agriculture, flood control, hurricane protection, mosquito control, and control of marsh subsidence and erosion. Projects range in size from minor, such as repair of existing embankments, to large-scale marsh management projects where constructing dikes and water- control structures may affect thousands of wetland acres.\nProposals to impound or control marsh water levels should contain water management plans with sufficient detail to determine the accessibility of impounded areas to marine organisms and the degree to which detrital and nutrient export into adjacent estuarine areas will be affected. Significant adverse impacts can be avoided or minimized with implementation of the following recommendations : a. Proposals to impound or reimpound previously unimpounded wetlands are unacceptable unless designed to accommodate (1) normal access and wetland use by marine fish and invertebrates and (2) continuation of other biological interaction, such as nutrient exchange, and other similarly important physical and chemical interactions; and b. Proposals to repair or replace water control structures will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n373\n\n\f5 .0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nB. Watershed Impoundments: Water-development agencies sometimes propose impounding rivers, bayous, and\ntributaries for such purposes as flood control or creation of industrial, municipal, and agricultural water supplies. Activities of this type are usually unacceptable because associated alteration of the quality, quantity, and timing of freshwater flow into estuaries may cause large-scale adverse modification or elimination of estuarine and marine habitats. Such actions also may block fish and invertebrate migrations.\n5.3.10. Drainage Canals and Ditches Drainage canals may be important components of upland development. Their potential to\nshunt polluted runoffand fresh water directly into tidal waters requires intermediate connection to retention ponds or wetlands. This allows natural filtration and assimilation ofpollutants and dampening of freshwater surges prior to discharge into tidal waters. Recommendations include: a. Drainage canals that dewater or cause other adverse wetland impacts are unacceptable and should not be built; b. Drainage canals and ditches from upland development generally should not extend or discharge directly into wetlands; c. Constructing upland retention ponds and other water management features such as sheetflow diffusers is encouraged. A retention pond or other pollution elimination/assimilation structure should be required if the effluent contains or may contain materials that are toxic to marsh vegetation or other aquatic life, d. Excavated materials resulting from canal and retention pond construction should be placed on upland or used to restore wetlands; e. Proposed drainage plans should be in accordance with comprehensive flood plain management plan(s) and applicants should be encouraged to consult with the EPA and appropriate state agencies to ensure that federal and state water quality standards are met; f. Locating mosquito control ditches in wetlands should be discouraged. If built, they should be designed so that they do not drain coastal wetlands. They also should be designed to avoid water stagnation, and they should provide access for aquatic organisms that feed on mosquito larvae; and g. Use of innovative techniques such as rotary ditching, spray dispersal of dredged materials, and open-water marsh management should be encouraged where appropriate.\n5.3.1 1 Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Exploration and production of oil and gas resources in wetlands usually have adverse\nimpacts since excavation and filling are generally required to accommodate access and production needs. In open marine waters, dredging and filling is usually not necessary, but special stipulations are required to minimize adverse impacts to living marine resources. In\n374\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\naddition to the above recommendations for navigation channels, access canals, and pipeline installation, the following apply: A. In coastal wetlands: a. Activities should avoid wetland use to the extent practicable. Alternatively, the use of uplands, existing drilling sites and roads, canals, and naturally deep waters should be encouraged. When wetland use is unavoidable, work in unvegetated and disturbed wetlands is generally preferable to work in high quality and undisturbed wetlands; b. Temporary roadbeds (preferably plank roads) generally should be used instead of canals for access to well sites; c. Water crossings should be bridged or culverted to prevent alteration of natural drainage patterns; d. Culverts or similar structures should be installed and maintained at sufficient intervals (never more than 500-feet apart) to prevent blockage of smface drainage or tidal flow; e. Petroleum products, drilling muds, drill cuttings, produced water, and other toxic substances should not be placed in wetlands; f. If the well is productive, the drill pad and levees should be reduced to the minimum size necessary to conduct production activities; and g. Defunct wells and associated equipment should be removed and the area restored to the extent practicable. Upon abandonment of wells in coastal wetlands, the well site, various pits, levees, roads, and work areas should be restored to preproject conditions by restoring natural elevations and planting indigenous vegetation whenever practicable. Abandoned well access canals should generally be plugged at their origin (mouths) to minimize bank erosion and saltwater intrusion, and spoil banks should be graded back into borrow areas or breached at regular intervals to establish hydrological connections. B. In open estuarine waters:\nActivities in estuarine waters should be conducted as follows: a. Existing navigable waters already having sufficient width and depth for access to mineral extraction sites should be used to the extent practicable; b. Petroleum products, drilling muds, drill cuttings, produced water, and other toxic substances should not be placed in wetl ands; and c. Defunct equipment and structures should be removed. C. On the continental shelf:\n375\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nActivities should be conducted so that petroleum-based substances such as drilling mud, oil residues, produced waters, or other toxic substances are not released into the water or onto the sea floor. The following measures may be recommended with exploration and production activities located close to hard banks and banks containing reef building coral: a. Drill cuttings should be shunted through a conduit and discharged near the sea floor, or transported ashore or to less sensitive, NMFS-approved offshore locations. Usually, shunting is effective only when the discharge point is deeper than the site that is to be protected; b. Drilling and production structures, including pipelines, generally should not be located within one mile of the base of a live reef; c. All pipelines placed in waters less than 300 feet-deep should be buried to a minimum of three feet beneath the sea floor, where possible. Where this is not possible and in deeper waters where user-conflicts are likely, pipelines should be marked by lighted buoys and/or lighted ranges on platforms to reduce the risk of damage to fishing gear and the pipelines. Pipeline alignments should be located along routes that minimize damage to marine and estuarine habitat. Buried pipelines should be examined periodically for maintenance of adequate earthen cover. 5.3.12. Other Mineral Mining/Extraction a. Proposals, for mining mineral resources (sand, gravel, shell, phosphate, etc.) from or withln 1 ,500 feet of exposed shell reefs and vegetated wetlands, and within 1 ,500 feet of shorelines are unacceptable except when the material is to be used for oyster cultch; and b. All other proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 5.3.13. Sewage Treatment and Disposal\nUrbanization and high density development of coastal areas has resulted in a substantial increase in proposals to construct sewage treatment and discharge facilities in coastal wetlands. Since many of these facilities utilize gravity flow systems for movement of waste water and materials, wetlands and other low-lying areas are often targeted as sites for placement of pipelines and treatment facilities. Since pipelines and treatment facilities are not water dependent with regard to positioning it is not essential that they be placed in wetlands or other fragile coastal habitats. The guidance provided in Section 5.3.5., \"Cables, Pipelines, and Transmission Lines,\" also applies to sewage collector and discharge pipelines. The following guidance should be considered with other aspects of sewage treatment and discharge: a. Discharges should be treated to the maximum extent practicable, including implementation of up-to-date methodologies for reducing discharges of biocides (e.g., chlorine) and other toxic substances; b. Use of land treatment and upland disposal/storage techniques should be implemented where possible. Use of vegetated wetlands as natural filters and pollutant assimilators for large scale discharges should be limited to those instances where other less damaging alternatives are not available and the overall environmental and ecological suitability of such an action has been demonstrated;\n376\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nc. Discharging into open ocean waters is generally preferable to discharging into estuarine waters since discharging into estuarine waters is more likely to result in living marine resources contamination and nutrient overloading. Discharge points in coastal waters should be located well away from shellfish beds, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and other similar fragile and productive habitats. Proposals to locate outfalls in coastal waters must be accompanied by hydrographic studies that demonstrate year round dispersal characteristics and provide proof that effluents will not reach or a:ffect fragile and productive habitats. 5.3.14. Steam-Electric Plants and Other Facilities Requiring Water for Cooling or Heating\nFacilities that require substantial intake and discharge of water, especially heated and chemically-treated discharge water, are generally not suited for construction and operation in estuarine and near-shore marine environments. Major adverse impacts may be caused by impingement of organisms on intake screens; entrainment of organisms in heat-exchange systems or discharge plumes; and through the discharge of toxic materials in discharge waters. Protected Species Branch personnel should be notified of such projects early in the planning process since the operation of steam-electric plants often affects endangered species such as shortnose sturgeon and West Indian manatee. Projects that must be sited in the coastal zone and utilize estuarine and marine waters are subject to the following recommendations: a. Facilities that rely on surface waters for cooling should not be located in areas such as estuaries, inlets, or small coastal embayments where fishery organisms are concentrated. Discharge points should be located in areas that have low concentrations of living marine resources, or they should incorporate cooling towers that employ sufficient safeguards to ensure against release of blow-down pollutants into the aquatic environment; b. Intakes should be designed to minimize impingement. Velocity caps that produce horizontal intake/discharge currents should be employed and intake velocities across the intake screen should not exceed 0.5 feet per second; c. Discharge temperatures (both heated and cooled effluent) should not exceed the thermal tolerance of the majority of the plant and animal species in the receiving body of water; d. The use of construction materials that may release toxic substances into receiving waters should be minimized. The use ofnbiocides (e.g., chlorine) to prevent fouling should be avoided where possible and least damaging antifouling alternatives should be implemented; and e. Intake screen mesh should be sized to avoid entrainment of most larval and post-larval marine fishery organisms. Acceptable mesh size is generally in the range of 0.5 mm and rarely exceeds 1.0 mm in estuarine waters or waters that support anadromous fish eggs and larvae. 5.3.15. Mariculture/Aquaculture\nThe culture of estuarine and marine species in coastal areas can reduce or degrade habitats used by native stocks of commercially and recreationally important fisheries. The following criteria should be employed to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts:\n377\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\na. Facilities should be located on upland. Tidally influenced wetlands should not be enclosed or impounded for mariculture pwposes. This includes hatchery and grow-out operations; b. Water intakes should be designed to avoid entrainment and impingement of native fauna; c. Water discharge should be treated to avoid contamination of the receiving water, and should be located only in areas having good mixing characteristics; d. Where cage mariculture operations are undertaken, water depths and circulation patterns should be investigated and should be adequate to preclude the buildup of waste products, excess feed, and chemical agents; and e. Mariculture sites should be stocked with hatchery-reared organisms only. Non-native species should be certified to be disease free, and project design features that minimize escape or accidental release of cultured species should be required. The rearing of ecologically undesirable species is unacceptable since escape and accidental release of these species is virtually assured. S.3.16. Mitigation\nSections 5.3. 1 - 5.3. 1 5 provide specific guidance for avoiding and reducing adverse impacts to fishery resources and their habitats. Compensatory mitigation is considered in cases where a resource is not unique and irreplaceable and only after a project has been demonstrated to be water-dependent, has !!Q feasible alternative, is clearly in the public interest, and all significant impacts  found to be unavoidable. In all cases, mitigation shall comply with the definition of mitigation that is provided at 40 CFR 1508.20 of the Council on Environmental Quality Recommendations. Those recommendations define mitigation as a sequential process whereby impacts are avoided, minimized, rectified, reduced over time, or are offset through compensation.\nDespite increasing use of mitigation to offset wetland and other losses, there are situations (e.g., projects affecting seagrass) where the affected habitats are of such enormous value that the anticipated adverse impacts cannot be offset. In instances involving such unique and irreplaceable resources, mitigation is not acceptable. There is also disagreement over the functional equivalency of created and natural wetlands and it should not be assumed they are equivalent in habitat value.\nAs a general rule, mitigation that restores previously existing habitats is more desirable and likely to succeed than that which seeks to create new habitat. The numerous impacted wetlands that exist in the Southeast provide substantial opportunity for wetlands restoration. Restoration may be relatively simple, such as restoring tidal flows to an impounded wetland area, or more complex such as restoring dredged cuts and disposal areas. Restoration of destroyed emergent and, to a lesser degree, submerged vegetation is a feasible and recognized option when implemented with the services of experienced restoration personnel.\nThe creation of new wetland habitat involves conversion of uplands or, in some situations, submerged bottom to vegetated wetlands or another desirable habitat such as oyster reef. Generation of wetland habitat should not involve converting one valuable wetland type to another. For example, building emergent wetlands in shallow water is unacceptable unless it can be demonstrated that the site is insignificant with regard to habitat or water quality function(s) or it previously supported wetland vegetation and restoration is desirable in terms of the ecology of\n378\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nthe overall hydrological wiit (e.g., estuary). Regardless of which option is used (restoration or creation), a ratio of at least two acres of mitigation for each acre of habitat destroyed should be recommended.\nFour basic considerations involved in the planning for habitat generation are type of habitat to be created, and its location, size, and configuration. Each of these considerations must be applied to the specific ecological setting and in accordance with the following recommendations:\n\na. Habitat type - As a general rule the created habitat should be vegetatively, functionally, and ecologically comparable to that which is being replaced. For example, a smooth cordgrass marsh should be created if a smooth cordgrass marsh is eliminated. The principal exception would be those cases where a different habitat is shown to be more desirable based on overall ecological considerations.\n\nb. Location - Except in the case of overriding ecological considerations, the new site should be located as near as possible to the site that would be eliminated. In any event, the new site should be in the same estuarine system as the habitat that is being replaced. The replacement wetland should consider physical implications such as shoaling and existing circulation and drainage patterns.\n\nNMFS and USFWS considers the overall ecological and environmental implications of its recommendations, including upland impacts. Mitigation that may alleviate impacts to aquatic environments, but cause significant adverse impacts to important upland habitats should be carefully evaluated.\n\nc\n\nSize - The habitat to be restored or created should be at least twice the (areal) size of that\n\nwhich would be destroyed. This requirements-is designed to offset differences in productivity and\n\nhabitat functions that may exist between established project site wetlands and newly developed\n\nreplacement wetlands. This size difference is also designed to address the possibility that the\n\noverall, long-term functional and ecological value of replacement habitats may be less than those\n\nof the impacted wetlands at the worksite.\n\nd. Configuration - The configuration of replacement habitats is determined by the ecological setting and physical factors such as existing drainage and circulation patterns. Consideration should be given to maximizing edge habitat and to the needs of desirable biota that may inhabit the site.\n\nInterest in the use of \"mitigation banks\" or created/restored wetlands that are intended for use in offsetting anticipated future wetland losses is increasing nationwide. Because of the complexity of developing and administering mitigation banks, guidance concerning their creation is beyond the scope of this document. NMFS Southeast Region Habitat Conservation Division Branch Office personnel that are participating in such efforts should consult early with other NMFS office personnel that have widertaken or are involved in such efforts since reliance on existing mitigation banking agreements may be beneficial. Habitat Conservation Division Branch Office personnel also should notify other participating agencies that signatory authority for mitigation bank agreements rests with the Regional Director. In all cases, consideration of\n\n379\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nmitigation banks should be guided by the principle that no net-loss of wetlands would be incurred.\n5.3.17 Detailed listing of non-fishing activities that may adversely impact habitat, including EFH, of managed species.

This statement as adopted by state, Federal, and regional bodies concerned over fishery habitat, is presented in Appendix VIl of The Fishery Management Plan for Shrimp (SAFMC 1993a). 5.4.2 Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission Seagrass Policy/ Implementation Plan. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission seagrass policy and implementation plan for the seagrass policy is also presented in Appendix I. 5.5 Federal Habitat Protection Laws, Programs, and Policies. See Appendix J for a listing and brief description of environmental laws directly, or indirectly protecting marine resources and the habitat they depend on.\n5.6 State Habitat Protection Programs 5.6.1 North Carolina\nThe Coastal Area Management Act was passed in 1974 to protect North Carolina's fragile coastal resources through planning and management at the state and local level. The Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources administers the program. Policy direction is provided by the Coastal Resources Commission, a group of citizens appointed by the Governor. The Division of Coastal Management (DCM), under authority from the Coastal Resources Commission (CRC), is responsible for implementing the North Carolina Coastal Management Program for the protection, preservation, orderly development and management of the state's twenty coastal counties. DCM is part of the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources. Present activities of DCM include: Permitting and enforcing regulations in Areas of Environmental Concern; Reviewing consistency of government and larger private activities in the coastal zone for compliance with the Coastal Area Management Act; Planning for the Ocean Resources in North Carolina's jurisdictional waters; Providing for effective disposal of boat sewage; Identifying high priority watersheds; Developing strategies for\n3 82\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\nmanaging secondary and cwnulative impacts; Transferring technology and information to local governments; Identifying wetlands in the coastal area; Assessing the relative significance of wetlands on the landscape; and Identifying and prioritizing wetland restoration sites. 5.6.2 South Carolina\nThe Office of Ocean and Coastal Management implements the Coastal Management Act. The Office has authority to formulate and implement a comprehensive coastal management program and direct control through a pennit program that oversees activities in critical areas that include coastal waters, tidelands, beaches, and primary ocean-front sand dunes. Indirect management authority of coastal resources is granted to the Office in counties containing one or more of the critical areas. In issuing permits, the Coastal Management Act requires that the Office consider the effects of proposed alterations on the production of fish, shrimp, oysters, crab, or any marine life, wildlife, or other natural resources.\n5.6.3 Georgia On April 22, 1 997, Governor Miller signed the Georgia Coastal Management Act into\nlaw which established the Department of Natural Resources Coastal Resource Division as the authority to create the program, receive and dispense funds, and to coordinate with federal and state agencies regarding Coastal Management issues. On January 26, 1998 the Georgia Coastal Management Program received official approval. This approval marks the end of a six year combined effort by state and local government in partnership with private citizens to develop an integrated, networked program. The program uses existing State laws to manage Georgia's critical coastal resources. With the approval of the Georgia Coastal Management Program comes over $1 million in federal funds annually. Most of the funds will be allocated to local communities and organizations through the \"Coastal Incentive Grant\" program. The Coastal Resources Division has completed and submitted the first grant award request and expects to began dispersing the Coastal Incentive Grants in the eleven county 'service area April 1 , 1 998. Incentive grants will be presented to local governments and universities to address critical local issues in coastal Georgia such as water management, local government planning and small scale construction projects.\n5.6.4 Florida The Florida Legislature adopted the Florida Coastal Management Act in 1978. This act\nauthorized the development of a coastal management program and its submittal to the appropriate federal agency. In 1981, the Florida Coastal Management Program (FCMP) was approved by the Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce. Florida's goal in creating the FCMP was not to create a new agency or new statutes concerned with coastal issues, but instead to use existing agencies and laws to address Florida's coastal needs. Florida's rules and laws adequately protected the coast, but were not always effectively implemented because of breakdowns in communication between agencies and administrative shortcomings. The FCMP was created to bridge these gaps and to open the lines of communication among the agencies so that their actions could be coordinated.\nThe FCMP, as it exists today, is a network ofnten state agencies and five water management districts using 23 statutes to protect Florida's coastal interests. The agencies most directly involved in issues that affect Essential Fish Habitat are listed below.\nThe Department of Community Affairs (DCA) is the lead agency for the FCMP, serving as coordinator of coastal issues and as the liaison between the state agencies and the federal\n383\n\n\f5.0 Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations\ngovernment. DCA also houses the State Clearinghouse and serves as the state's land planning agency and emergency management agency.\nThe Department ofEnvironmental Protection( DEP), formed by the merger of the former Department of Environmental Regulation and the former Department ofNatural Resources, serves as the state's chief environmental regulatory agency and the manager and steward of many of its natural resources. Among the natural resources over which the DEP has jurisdiction are submerged lands within state estuarine and marine waters. The Department of Health regulates on-site sewage disposal. The Marine Fisheries Commission exercises jurisdiction over saltwater fisheries and marine mammals. The five water management districts, organized along watershed lines, act in partnership with DEP in regulating activities in wetlands and waters of the state and the use of water resources.\n\n5.7 Threatened and Endangered Species The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1 996 established certain requirements and standards the\nCouncils and the Secretary must meet in managing fisheries under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Implementing the provisions in the SFA will not have any negative impacts on the listed and protected species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammals Protection Act (MMPA) including:\n\nWhales: (1) Northern right whale- Eubalaena glacialis (ENDANGERED) (2) Humpback whale- Magaptera novaeangliae (ENDANGERED) (3) Fin whale- Balaenoptera physalus (ENDANGERED) (4) Sei whale- Balaenoptera borealis (ENDANGERED) (5) Sperm whale\u00b7 Physeter macrocephalus (ENDANGERED) (6) Blue whale- Balaenoptera musculus (ENDANGERED)\n\nDate Listed 1 2/2/70 1 2/2/70 1 2/2/70 1 2/2/70 1 2/2/70\n\nSea Turtles: (1) Kemp's ridley turtle- Lepidochelys kempii (ENDANGERED) (2) Leatherback turtle- Dermochelys coriacea (ENDANGERED) (3) Hawksbill turtle- Eretmochelys imbricata (ENDANGERED) (4) Green turtle- Chelonia mydas (THREATENED/ENDANGERED) (5) Loggerhead turtle- Caretta caretta (THREATENED)\n\nDate Listed 1 2/2/70 6/2/70 6/2/70 7/28/78 7/28/78\n\nOther Species Under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Jurisdiction: (1) West Indian manatee- Trichechus manatus (ENDANGERED)\n(Critical Habitat Designated) (2) American crocodile - Crocodulus acutus (ENDANGERED)\n(Critical Habitat Designated)\n\nDate Listed 3/67 1976 9/75 1 2/79\n\nRecent research efforts identifying use ofSargassum habitat by juvenile sea turtles is summarized in Appendix R.\n\n384\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n6.0 ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT RESEARCH NEEDS 6.1 Essential Fish Habitat Research and Monitoring Program\nThe following constitutes the basic structure of the Council's essential fish habitat (EFH) research and monitoring program. This general structure provides recommendations, for research the Council, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and other habitat partners in the South Atlantic region view as necessary for carrying out the EFH management mandate. This Section will be refined after public hearing to better identify and support South Atlantic habitat partners research efforts to describe, map, and document use of EFH by managed species. In addition, subsequent drafts ofthis document will better efforts of habitat partners to defme non-fishing and fishing threats and their impacts on EFH.\nThe Council has determined that the NMFS, in cooperation with other Federal, State and regional habitat partners in the South Atlantic region, will develop the necessary understanding, using basic and applied research and literature syntheses, to help conserve, protect, and restore EFH of living marine resources managed by the Council. Statutes and international conventions and treaties which authorize the NMFS to conserve and restore marine habitat include but are not limited to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"Superfund\"), and Oil Pollution Act (OPA).\nAdditional research is necessary to insure sufficient information is collected to support a higher level of description and identification ofEFH (see Appendices O and P). In addition, research is needed to identify and evaluate existing and potential adverse effect on EFH, including but not limited to, direct physical alteration; impaired habitat quality or function; cumulative impacts from fishing; or indirect adverse effects such as sea level rise, global warming and climate shifts; and non-gear related fishery impacts.\nThe Council recommends NMFS apply their adopted Habitat Research Plan to direct and conduct research and transfer results to management components within NMFS. The Council coordinates with NMFS management components to provide information on permit and policy activities, fishery and EFH information for fishery management plans. The NMFS plan is designed to develop the necessary expertise to accomplish or oversee the restoration, creation, or acquisition ofhabitat to benefit living marine resources. The plan provides guidance in four areas: ecosystem structure and function, effects of alterations, on habitat development of habitat restoration methods, and development of indicators of impact and recovery of habitat. A fifth area is the need for synthesis and timely transfer of scientific infonnation to managers.\nThe Habitat Research Plan ofthe NMFS (Thayer et al., 1 996) serves as a base from which this Section will be revised. After public hearing this Section using this base structure will be revised to further define needs by individual EFH type or EFH-HAPC, as well as by species or species complex. The Council will work with NMFS and other NOAA programs, including the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, Coastal Ocean Program, Coastal Services Center (Charleston, SC), and National Sea Grant Program, to meet the goals of NOAA. NMFS will work closely with other federal agencies to increase cooperation and partnerships, maximize research information, and reduce potential duplication of research efforts. The Council has adopted the same general structure for the research and monitoring program. In addition, the following draft lists of research needs for habitat or managed species are included for comment.\n385\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n6.1.1 Ecosystem Structure and Function Understanding the structure and function of natural ecosystems, their linkages to one\nanother, and the role they play in supporting and sustaining living marine resources, their abundance, distribution, and health -- is critical. Knowing when and how systems are affected, assessing the cause and degree of impact, and providing the basis for restoring and maintaining these systems are integral to this research area, and must be evaluated in terms of landscape ecology. Research on ecosystem structure and function will provide the necessary foundation for linking all areas to provide the basis for making fundamentally sound management decisions. Thus, assessment of habitat impacts; development of restoration methods and evaluation of restoration effectiveness, development of indicators of impact and recovery, and synthesis and transfer of infonnation for the development of management policy and regulations all are dependent on a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning.\nResearch in this area will include studies on the relationship between habitat and yield of living marine resources including seasonality and annual variabilities and the influence of chemical and physical fluxes on these relationships. These research efforts will be dependent upon knowledge of basic life histories, habitat structural integrity and limiting factors, and must be evaluated within the context of habitat mosaics or habitat heterogeneity. Therefore, data on habitat location are integral to this research area. Information on essential fish habitat, variability in yield of fishery resources as a function of material fluxes, habitat type, location and scale should be generated. This research area provides the foundation for understanding cause and effect relationships and development and evaluation of protection and restoration strategies. 6. 1.2 Effect of Habitat Alterations\nKnowledge of the causes of damage to ecosystems is critical to restoring past losses and preventing future degradation and loss of habitats essential for maintaining and enhancing living marine resources. Therefore, quantification of the response of habitats and living marine resources to natural and anthropogenic alterations is not only a prerequisite to determining the degree of impact, predicting the rate of recovery, and recommending the most effective restoration procedures, but it also is a requisite to establishing effective protective measures.\nThe basis for determining cause and effect relationships depends on an understanding of the natural structure and function of an ecosystem. Individual living marine resource requirements and population characteristics. The Council is interested in both maintaining sustainable living marine resource populations and protecting the essential fish habitat they depend upon. Habitat partners should conduct research to relate non-fishing impacts observed at the individual level to effects at the population level which would link habitat impacts ultimately to living marine resource populations.\nStudies should include cause and effect research designed to evaluate responses of living marine resource and habitats to physical and chemical modifications of coastal and estuarine systems. Research is encouraged that considers downstream responses to upland modification, the role of buffers zones, as well as living marine resource and habitat responses to physical and waterflow alterations and water quality modifications. Information should be generated on responses to both individual and cwnulative impacts so as to provide the basis for policy statements, guidelines, and regulations to protect habitats. These cause and effect databases will furnish information pertinent not only to permit-related activities and other consultations, but also to NMFS mandated responsibilities in restoration planning and implementation.\n386\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n6.1.3 Habitat Restoration Methods While methods for restoring certain habitats (e.g., salt marshes and seagrass meadows)\nexist, most have not been rigorously tested under experimental conditions throughout wide geographic areas and at different scales. Additionally, for other habitats (e.g., coral reefs, intertidal and subtidal substrates, riparian habitat) only limited methodology exists and little emphasis has been placed on rapidly restoring biodiversity and monitoring for success and persistence . (As a consequence, a significant proportion of restoration actions has been viewed with skepticism relative to their success and concerns for rates of habitat recovery or development.) Current methods to cleanup, restore or create productive living marine resource habitats must be improved, and new, innovative techniques must be developed and evaluated using statistically rigorous approaches.\nResearch topics and areas of concern include analyses of the success of contaminant sequestration; assessment of bioremediation techniques; development and evaluation of new habitat restoration techniques; experiments on transplant species culture techniques; and evaluation of the role and size of buffers and the importance of habitat heterogeneity in the restoration process. Research on restoration will lead to scientific information on trajectories of recovery and stability of created and restored systems including physical, chemical and biological components and processes. Assessments of new techniques and evaluation of current techniques over geographic regions and scales will provide bases for success evaluation. Most importantly, guidelines for improved best management practices and improved restoration planning will be generated. 6.1.4 Indicators of Habitat and Living Marine Resources Impacts and Recovery\nIncreasing and extensive exploitation of coastal resources demands that indicators be used to simplify the process of determining whether an ecosystem, habitat, or living marine resource is healthy, degraded, or is recovering. The development of indicators of habitat/living marine resource impacts and recovery is critical for managers judging the status of essential fish habitat or fishery resources, and determining the need for corrective actions.\nThe development of habitat or resource indicators must be based on infonnation derived from comparative research on the structure and function of disturbed, natural, and/or restored habitats of different ages and geographical locations for a suite of biological, chemical, and physical parameters ; time-dependent biotic population analyses ; and contaminant level follow up evaluations for sediment, biota, and water. This type of research will help managers identify essential fish habitat status; standardize indicators for specific habitats through comparisons across geographic gradients and scales; and develop recommendations on chemical \"cleanup\" techniques and most appropriate measures to assess success. The Council encourages NMFS, in cooperation with the other habitat partners in the Southeast, to utilize such guideposts to develop and improve best management practice approaches. 6.1.5 Synthesis and Information Transfer\nThe synthesis and timely transfer of infonnation derived from research findings and the existing literature is a key element of the essential fish habitat research and monitoring program. Decisions on permitting, regulation, enforcement, redirection of research efforts, and development and implementation of restoration plans must be made with the best available infonnation. Scientists must step back from their research long enough to provide timely information syntheses to habitat managers. Likewise, it is imperative that State and Federal\n387\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\nhabitat managers recognize that generic information generated by the scientific community does have powerful application to their site-specific problems.\nTechnology and information transfer will be expedited through the use of all available information sources and the application of \"user-friendly\" information bases. Geographical Information Systems provide the opportunity to amass and array large quantities of complex data, thereby, providing potential for relational observations by decision-makers; such use is strongly encouraged. Many areas of synthesis and transfer have been indicated in the earlier four research areas and will not be repeated here. Additional examples include information syntheses on essential fish habitat and essential fish habitat-habitat areas of particular concern and modes of protection and restoration, and synthesis of available information on landscape approaches to basinwide management including permitting and restoration. Such collations of current and evolving information bases are important to the Council and those charged with the conservation and management of fishery resources as well as to State and Federal habitat managers concerned about developing and implementing policy. These syntheses could be done within NMFS, through partnerships with other agencies, and by contract. It is important, however, that syntheses be provided in a useable format and even published in outlets available to both scientific and management communities. The scientific community must participate in the synthesis and transfer process. 6.1.6 Implementation\nThe five interlinked areas provide a framework for the type of research and continuity needed to effectively manage EFH. In some instances this linkage between research areas may be hierarchical. Research on ecosystem structure and function provides the foundation for linking all areas. For example, knowledge of the structure and function of the ecosystem must be known before one can actually determine the effects of habitat alterations, develop restoration methods, or develop indicators of impact and recovery. Continuity of information from each research area is required to develop a comprehensive data base for making important resource decisions. Research founded on this approach will provide State and Federal habitat managers with a broad information base that is scientifically and ecologically credible, and responsive to management needs. The Council will coordinate with and support NMFS Southeast Regional Office and Fisheries Science Centers in their effort to determine habitat research and management priorities. Research conducted to address the EFH mandate in the southeast region should: address regional management and research needs pertinent to the Council, NMFS or other habitat partner responsible for conservation or management of EFH or species which depend on EFH; be consistent with the Council's, NMFS's and other habitat partner's long-term goals or habitat policies; and provide information about the benefit of protecting EFH or living marine resources.\nCooperative efforts between NMFS research and management staffs and with other federal/state agencies, industry, and academia are encouraged. This approach will create greater and improved partnerships, which will be required ifiwe are to meet the Council's, NOAA's, and NMFS's goal to protect, conserve, and restore essential fish habitat through sound habtat research and management. In addition, the Council will support programmatic EFH research proposals when requested from and developed by NMFS SEFSC.\n388\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n\n6.2 Research Needs Identified in Fishery Management Plans\n\n6.2.1\n\nResearch Needs Identified in SAFMC Fishery Managemen t Plans Habitat and species specific research needs identified in Council fishery managment\n\nplans are presented below for the following species or species complexes - penaeid and\n\ndeepwater shrimp, red drum, spiny lobster, coastal migratory pelagics, coral, coral reefs and live\n\nhard bottom habitat, golden crab, the snapper grouper complex, calico scallops and pelagic\n\nSargassum habitat.\n\nShrimp Research Needs:\n\nRock Shrimp The following\n\nresearch\n\nneeds\n\nare\n\nlisted\n\nin\n\nno\n\nparticular\n\npriority\n\norder:\n\n1 .

The following research needs are summarized from recommendations presented in the bycatch characterization report for the South Atlantic region (SEAMAP 1 996): 1 . Shrimp effort data needs to be collected to provide estimates based on time fished (or number of tows), rather than at the trip level. Future sampling needs to be improved with respect to collection of both shrimp effort and bycatch characterization data. 2. Future characterization effort should be expanded to include important strata for which no observer data is available and strata which have low sample sizes. 3. Bycatch monitoring should be conducted regularly if data are to be used in stock assessments. Conduct characterization for 5 years after implementation of state and federal\n\n389\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\nbycatch reduction regulations to determine the effectiveness of the gears used, and to establish new baseline bycatch estimates for stock assessments. 4. Long-term characterization data sets should be funded. Red Drum Research Needs: Research priorities include the following list from the stock assessment for Atl antic coast red drum: 1 . Direct the improvement in catch, effort and length frequency statistics from the recreational and commercial fisheries. 2. Direct additional effort in intercepting recreational fishermen through the MRFSS who fish nighttime hours. 3. Increased tagging efforts on age 3-5 year old red drum, with directed effort to recapture subadult and adult red drum to determine if disappearance is due in part to offshore emigration. 4. Standardize sampling of the Atlantic coast subadult red drum population to develop a long term index of recruitment. 5. Develop a more reliable maturity schedule for population level analyses. 6. Determine relationships between annual egg production and female length or weight for Atlantic coast red drum. 7.

In addition, the impacts of any type of dredging activity on all life history stages of red drum. Snapper Grouper Research Needs:\nTo understand the causes of fishery declines and better predict the effects of human activities on fishery populations, the following research needs relative to snapper grouper habitat are provided so that state, federal, and private research efforts can focus on those areas that would allow the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council to develop measures to better manage snapper grouper and their habitat: 1 . Identify optimum snapper grouper habitat and environmental and habitat conditions that limit\nsnapper grouperproduction (e.g., what are the critical fisheries habitats for food, cover, spawning, nursery areas, and migration?); 2. Determine the relationship between juvenile snapper grouper and estuarine habitat. If an obligatory relationship is found, determine the distributions, rates of change, and documented causes of loss for estuarine habitat types; 3. Quantify the relationships between snapper grouper production and habitat (e.g., what are the key trophic pathways in the ecosystem, and how does the flux of essential nutrients, carbon compounds, and energy through these systems influence fisheries productivity?); 4.

Golden Crab Research Needs: The following research needs (Items 1-8 taken from Lindberg and Wenner, 1 990) are listed in no particular priority order: 1. Recruitment processes and life history strategy. 2. What are the settlement patterns ofjuveniles with respect to depth? What are the subsequent development and mortality rates, and how do they vary across depths?\n392\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n3. Growth rates. Accurate, detailed molt staging should be incorporated into future sampling regimes, whlle controlled laboratory experiments to test effects of ecological variables are particularly desirable.\n4. Reproductive cycle. Age at first reproduction is poorly known. Comparative studies and experimentation are needed to resolve questions of this basic life history trait.\n5. Seasonal movements, encounter rates among potential mates and competitors, movement by mated pairs, and takeover attempts all need to be documented to test golden crab mating strategies.\n6. Habitat preferences. Basic ecological questions concerning physiological ecology, refuges and foraging habits, trophlc dynamics and community relationshlps remain largely unanswered.\n7. Home ranging versus nomad.ism needs to be examined. 8. Questions of basis physiology of deep-dwelling organisms, biogeography and systematics, or\nparasitology and symbiosis. Additional fishery management related items include: 9. Estimate potential yield. 10. Document economic and social information of fishermen and dealers. 11.

Growth and mortality factors need further quantification to refine the critical size estimates. 2. The size frequency of individual calico scallop beds as they are fished, mature, and die is\nneeded to further refine the minimum size specified. 3. There is a lack of information concerning the percentage of calico scallops that can be\nopened during an at-sea processing operation. The Council supports this research need because it addresses one of the issues and can be completed in a relatively short period of time and at low cost. 4. Survival rate of released calico scallops is required to further evaluate at-sea processing. There is at present only one boat processing at-sea but this could increase in the future. This research need addresses one of the issues and should be undertaken in the very near future given the low cost and short time frame required. 5. Information is needed to address the following areas concerning parasitic nematodes: (1) occurrence of the nematode; (2) survival of the nematode; (3) effect of processing, food handling, reconditioning and associated problems; and (4) consumer perception. Research on the parasitic nematode is aimed at addressing one of the issues and should be supported. Florida Sea Grant and the calico scallop fishing industry have expended some effort in this area. 6. The effect of ocean disposal of at-sea processing waste on the scallop beds should be investigated. Concern has been expressed that this could increase calico scallop losses due to predators. This addresses Issue Number 4 and given the potential increase in at-sea processing more information is needed by the Councils to properly evaluate the situation. 7. The effect of the removal of such a large quantity of hard substrate (shells) that could provide attachment sites for spat settlement should be investigated. This addresses one of the issues and it is recognized that this is a long-term research effort.\n\n6.2.2 Interjurisdictional Prioritized Research Needs The following habitat and select species specific research needs were identified in Special\nReport No. 62 published by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission \"Prioritized Research Needs in Support of lnterjurisdictional Fisheries Management\" (ASMFC 1997).\n\nA\u00b7 mericRanevSiehwadstaunddieRs diveealrinHgewrritinhgt:he effects of acid deposition on anadromous alosids.\n\n\u00b7\n\nConduct turbine mortality studies and downstream passage studies.\n\n\u00b7\n\nDetermine the effects of pollution, passage impediments, and other anthropogenic\n\nimpacts on all other life history stages of shad and river herring.\n\n\u00b7\n\nConduct and evaluate historical characterization of socio-economic development\n\n(potential pollutant sources and habitat modification) of selected shad rivers along the\n\neast coast.\n\n\u00b7\n\nIdentify and quantify potential American shad spawning and rearing habitat not presently\n\nutilized and conduct an analysis of the cost of recovery.\n\n394\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n\nA\u00b7 tlaMntoincitMorefnishhadkeilnls: along the Atlantic coast and use the NMFS Beaufort Laboratory as a repository for these reports.\n\u00b7 Study the ecological role of menhaden ( predator/prey relationship, nutrient enrichment, oxygen depletion, etc.) in major Atlantic coast embayments and estuaries.\n\u00b7 Determine how loss / degradation of critical estuarine and nearshore habitat affects growth, survival and abundance of juvenile Atlantic menhaden.\n\nA\u00b7 tlaEnsttiacbSliesha\n\nHerring: critical spawning\n\nhabitat\n\nareas\n\nor\n\nspecial\n\nmanagement\n\nzones\n\nto\n\nprotect\n\nspawning\n\naggregations of herring and/or demersal egg masses.\n\nA\u00b7 tlaSntatincdSartduirzgeeaonnd: obtain baseline data on habitat for important sturgeon rivers.

States with significant fisheries should be encouraged to collect socio-economic data on red drum fisheries through ad-ons to the f\\1RFSS or by other means so as to determine the economic value of the Atlantic coast recreational red drum fishery. 10. Assess the effects of environmental factors on stock densities. 1 1.

And determine spawning areas in order to increase accuracy and precision of SSBR estimates. Prioritized Research Needs for Spanish Mackerel High Priority: \u00b7 Length, sex, age and CPUE data are needed to improve the stock assessment accuracy. Simulations on CPUE trends should be explored and impacts on VPA and assessment results determined. Data collection is needed for all states, particularly those north of North Carolina. \u00b7 Weight and especially length at age for Spanish mackerel needs to be evaluated. \u00b7 Develop fishery independent methods of monitoring stock size of Atlantic Spanish mackerel ( consider aerial surveys used in south Florida waters). \u00b7 More timely reporting of mid-Atlantic catches is needed for quota monitoring. \u00b7 Provide better estimates of recruitment , natural mortality rates, fishing mortality rates, and standing stock. Specific information should include an estimate of total amount caught and distribution of catch by area , season and type of gear. \u00b7 Methodology for predicting year class strength should be developed, and the relationship between larva abundance and subsequent year class strength should be examined and defined.\n396\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\n\nM\u00b7 edYiuiemld\n\nPriority: per recruit\n\nanalyses\n\nneed\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nconducted\n\nrelative\n\nto\n\nalternative\n\nselective\n\nfishing\n\npatterns. \u00b7 Determine the bycatch of Spanish mackerel in the directed shrimp fishery in the Atlantic\n\ncoastal waters. \u00b7 Evaluate the potential bias of the lack of appropriate stratification of the data used to\u00b7 generate\n\nage-length keys for Atlantic and Gulf Spanish mackerel. \u00b7 Evaluation of CPUE indices related to standardization methods and management history,\n\nwith emphasis on greater temporal and spatial resolution in estimates of CPUE.\n\n\u00b7 Encourage the considerations ofnMRFSS ad-ons or other mechanisms for the collection of\n\n\u00b7\n\nsocioeconomic data for recreational and commercial fisheries.

Most early fisheries management efforts deal with increased yields, gear, and identifying and locating new target species and markets. With the world wide decline of many fish stocks emphasis has shifted, in recent years, to stock management and recovery. This change in management emphasis has gradually led to realization that reductions in the size and quality of fishery habitats have reached critical levels. It has also furthered the view that, in certain situations, fishing itself may be profoundly changing the physical and biological character of fish harvest and life requisite areas.\nTrawling and other fishing activities that involve direct contact between fishing gear and the aquatic environment can alter the structural character of fish habitats. When the change is sufficient enough to preclude or limit use by fishery directed or target species, declines in catch abundance and individual fish size may occur. Although a clear cause and effect relationship is evident, determination of the level of effect inducted by physical change may be complex. Relevant factors, in addition to the magnitude of the direct physical change, may include disturbance frequency and duration, seasonality, and other environmental, ecological, and physiological processes that control recovery and recruitment of requisite species of the community. As noted by Auster and Langton (1 998) \"... mobile fishing gear reduced habitat complexity by (1) directly removing epifauna or damaging epifauna leading to mortality, (2) smoothing sedimentary bedforms and reducing bottom roughness, and (3) removing taxa which produce structure (i.e., taxa which produce burrows and pits).\"\n\n397\n\n\f6.0 Essential Fish Habitat Research Needs\nPrimary information is lacking for us to strategically manage fishing impacts on Essential Fish Habitat without invoking precautionary measures. Priority studies should include a number of areas where primary data are lacking, which would allow better monitoring and improved experimentation, ultimately leading to predictive capabilities including: \u00b7 The spatial extent of fishing induced disturbance. While many observer programs collect\ndata at the scale of single tows or sets, the fisheries reporting systems often lack this level of spatial resolution. The available data makes it difficult to make observations, along a gradient of fishing effort, in order to assess the effects of fishing effort on habitat, community, and ecosystem processes. \u00b7 The effects of specific gear types, along with a gradient of effort on specific habitat types. These data are the first order needs to allow an assessment of how much effort produces a measurable level of ch ange in structural habitat components and the associated communities.\n398\n\n\f7.0 List ofPreparers\n7.0 LIST OF PREPARERS Roger Pugliese, Fishery Biologist, South Atlantic Fishery Management Council\nThe (ollowing individuals assisted by reviewing drafts of this document: Gregg T.
