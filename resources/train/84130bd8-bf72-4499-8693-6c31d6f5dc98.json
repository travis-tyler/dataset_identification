[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It is often argued that one of the major engines of innovation and economic growth comes from advanced degree holders in science and engineering through creation of new ideas and technologies. More and more work on science and technology policy associated with promoting innovation and economic development has found the number of scientists and engineers is significant, both theoretically and statistically, to a wide assortment of relevant indicators of innovation such as patents, trademarks and economic growth (Nelson and Rosenberg 1993, Freeman and Soete 1997, Baumol 2004. While the US is one the world's largest producers of doctorates in the world, the US graduate higher education system is also perceived by much of the rest of the world as the best place for individuals to study and earn their doctorates. Thus over the last 40 years it has increasingly attracted more and more non-US citizens. Today almost 40% of US doctoral degrees go to non-US citizens, more than double the rate from 1970 (Chang and Milan 2012) . Between 2001 and 2007 only 14% of all US doctoral graduates were living abroad but by 2012 that rate jumped to 32.5% were living abroad. This suggests that while the US continues to be the major producer of Ph.D. graduates, more and more of them are non-US citizens who are more likely to leave the US. There is also some early evidence that growing numbers of temporary US visa holders of US doctoral degrees are returning to their countries of national origin (Chang and Milan 2012). Ongoing work by Finn (Finn 2012, Finn 2014 has focused on this question by looking at stay rates for non-US citizens with doctoral degrees. This work tracked individuals from their time of graduation by using voluntarily provided social security numbers matched by the Internal Revenue Service records to tax returns indicating US employment. Therefore, the objectives of this paper is to develop a theoretical explanation of the decision to return and empirically test the viability of that explanation empirically. The next section of the paper reviews the literature and develops a theoretical model for explaining individual decisions to return including some testable hypotheses. This is followed by a section that describes the data sources and operational measured developed for estimation of the model. Next we present the results from the empirical estimation and general findings. Finally we conclude the paper with a discussion of policy implications, and future directions for this research."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review and Explanatory Model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Literature Review:", "text": "Motivated by concerns over so called 'brain drain' impacts, a number of scholars have begun to study why foreign scientists living and working in a host country may decide to return to their countries of origin. Thorn and Holm-Nielsen (Thorn and Holm-Nielsen 2006) provide a useful summary of current proposed theoretical explanations as well as some descriptive data analysis. They identify a number of potential push and pull factors which are then organized under three broad categories. The first is titled 'neoclassical factors' which focuses primarily on economic conditions like wage differentials and market factors. The term 'transnationalism' describes the second category of factors which include connection to home countries, such as family ties, a sense of national identity and commitments to the future developments of their home nations. The last group of forces is labeled 'social network factors' and pick up a number of contextual and institutional considerations including connections to 'invisible colleges' and research networks. Their empirical work focused on OECD countries and was primarily descriptive of trends. Fontes (Fontes 2007) identified several data issues in the context of foreign scientist whose origins are from countries with weaker scientific and technical systems. Using the case of Portugal, Fontes proposed an approach to identifying and studying Portuguese born scientists working in other countries. A test of their approach generated 41 detailed case studies. While the author note the empirical results are not generalizable, they are suggestive. While many of these expatriates expressed some interest in returning home specifically to make a difference, they remained unwilling to return due to awareness of 'difficulties' at home. These difficulties tended to reflect on the quality of the research environments in Portugal. Interestingly many of these respondents were part of networks that had some attachment to Portuguese scientists and/or research institutions. Franzoni, Scellato and Stephan (Franzoni, Scellato et al. 2012) provides a more current statistical review of mobility patterns of foreign born scientists. This work makes use of a sample of over 17,000 respondents from 16 countries and four academic fields. They found significant variation across country by both country of origin and host country. For example Switzerland had almost 57% of respondents currently living in Switzerland self-identify as foreign nationals. India, Italy and Japan had the least foreign scientists. The authors speculate that some of this variation may be the result of post-doctoral opportunities which would in part reflect the overall quality of research environments. Similarly the authors found that India was the country with the highest rate of emigration and that Japan had the smallest. The authors also compared the unconditional estimates of the probability of returning home and found that Spanish nationals were the most likely to return and that Indians were the least likely. The most common reason provided by respondents for returning home was for family and personal reasons."}, {"section_title": "Recent work by", "text": "The paper by Baruffaldia and Landoni (Baruffaldia and Landonib 2012) takes a relatively more analytic perspective and models both the choice to return and the productivity of 497 foreign researchers in Italy and Portugal. The principle finding was that for these foreign scientists both the likelihood of return and their productivity were positively related to maintaining some form of professional linkage to their home countries. These results controlled for a number of other relevant factors including research area, position and personal characteristics of the scientist. Another analytic study conducted by Gaule (Gaule 2011) used over 1900 individual foreign scientists born after 1944 associated with a single US Ph.D. granting department in chemistry, chemical engineering, and biochemistry. This data collection strategy focused on a single institution's graduates over time was applied because of the general lack of data that follows scientist over time. The author used a discrete time hazard model for the decision to return. While the study found that only 9% of foreign faculty returned home, the most successful scientists were the least likely to do so, though they were more likely to move within the US. Interestingly, the author also found that after an adjustment period returning home seemed to have no negative effects on scientific productivity for returnees. Earlier work by Borjas and Bratsberg (Borjas and Bratsberg 1996) also found negative self-selection into return, but negative selection occurred only at the top of the distribution and not for the average scientist. More recent work by Grogger and Hanson (Grogger and Hanson 2015) also suggest positive selection for remaining in the US."}, {"section_title": "Explanatory Model:", "text": "Labor economics and theories from organizational behavior provide a useful starting point for thinking about why individual scientists and engineers make job decisions. Yet in many situations these models provide only a partial explanation for such choices. As noted above, aggregate data analysis (Chang and Milan 2012, Chang and Milan 2014, Finn 2014 of trends for temporary US visa holders with US doctoral degrees suggest decisions to live and work abroad cannot be fully understood by wage rates alone. Certainly other factors like quality of the research environment, potential for job advancement and other work related activity matter in the return decision (Thorn andHolm-Nielsen 2006, Grogger andHanson 2015). Nevertheless, even science and technology workforce; performance and wages are related to how an individual fits within broader institutional and professional networks (Grogger and Hanson 2015). During the training and education process scientists and engineers become part of established networks, often through funded research. Thus it is likely the characteristics of the education process either facilitate or hinder how well connected new scientists and engineers are likely to become to such networks (Dietz, Chompalov et al. 2000, Bozeman, Fay et al. 2013. It is also likely that the degree to which new scientists and engineers are embedded into research networks will influence initial and future job decision making. Therefore, there is a potential linkage between how students are funded during their education, the degree of connection that produces so-called 'invisible colleges', and in turn their initial and future decisions about jobs, particularly their willingness to either stay in the US or return home (Thorn andHolm-Nielsen 2006, Grogger andHanson 2013). Several empirical studies have found significant linkages between those who return home and specific ties to their home countries. Sometimes these ties are personal and familial (Franzoni, Scellato et al. 2012) and sometimes they are of a more professional nature (Baruffaldia and Landonib 2012). It is likely that differences in national cultures affect the likelihood and nature of these linkages. Several empirical studies demonstrate significant variation across nation of origin, strongly suggesting this type of connection (Chang and Milan 2012, Franzoni, Scellato et al. 2012, Chang and Milan 2014). Next we need to consider the role of policy from both the perspective of the US and the foreign country of origin. Policy is likely to influence the individual either through financial and job related incentives or their perceptions of the research environment at the lab, university, and systemic level. In many foreign countries the quality of the system influences the perception of universities and programs. Thus national science and higher education policy is likely to be relevant (Thorn and Holm-Nielsen 2006). At the individual level grants that support a student's education can come from their home country or the US, reflecting different policy influences. Characterizing the research infrastructure of foreign scientists' home countries reflects how that country uses policy to affect perceptions of the quality of the research environment (Zweig and Wang 2013). This could include per capita national research and development expenditures, size of the research and development workforce, whether any of their universities are internationally ranked (and for how long), and the existence and extent of government funds related to merit based research completion. Thus our initial theoretical framework is: "}, {"section_title": "Testable Hypotheses", "text": "Labor market theory suggests that both the wage rate and labor market conditions matter. In the context of this study, US real wage rates for high skilled Ph.D. individuals tends to be above that found in most other countries, particularly developing and middle income countries (Rosenzweig, Irwin et al. 2006, Clemens, Montenegro et al. 2008 This framework accounts for labor market conditions but they are not the only focus of our theory. Instead this model allows us to understand how the quality and nature of the higher education process might affect the decision to return through a process of building professional network linkages. The idea is that higher quality programs provide access to professional networks (Bound, Demirci et al. 2014, Grogger andHanson 2015). This process is likely to be enhanced if the student is funded predominantly through research activities as opposed to teaching activities. Once an individual is embedded in these research networks the decision to leave the US are likely to attenuate their professional relationships and their access to grant money (Black and Stephan 2007). Thus we hypothesize: H3: As the quality of their research training increases the less likely the individual is to return home, all else equal. Some forms of funding promote active research training over for example the teaching function. A large proportion of research funding in US universities and certainly the most prestigious are from national institutes such as NSF and NIH. The level of US research expenditures is thus related direct US government policy and indirectly through R and D tax credits (Bloom, Griffith et al. 2002). Consequently, individuals mostly funded by research grants, fellowships and research assistantships are not only likely to develop better research skills, there are more likely to become embedded in higher quality research network. Thus: H4: Individuals whose primary source of funding for their degree focus on research training and activities are more likely to be embedded in higher quality research networks and less likely to return home, all else equal. Individuals often forego economic benefits for cultural and familial reasons. Thus we expect the extent to which individuals are socially and culturally connect to their home countries it is likely to increase their likelihood of returning home. While simple to state this is very complex. It can include such diverse issues as social constructed gender roles, family demographics (e.g. marital status), and connection to social networks through prior institutional affiliations (e.g. number of prior higher education degrees from their home country). Empirical efforts to deal with these factor are typically done through the use of numerous control variables like gender, marital status, number of higher education degrees from their home country, and country specific effects. It is important to understand in the context of the current study, the vast majority of non-US Next we are interested in how science policy might affect the individual decision to return. Here we suggest several possible mechanisms. The first is direct subsidy programs offered to an individual to study abroad. If a major source of funding for non-US citizens is from foreign sources, which are most likely to be from their home country, this is likely to create either a legal requirement or at the very least increase an individual's sense of duty or loyalty to their home country. Thus: H8: Individuals who have major foreign financing for their higher education are more likely to return home, all else equal. Some countries have, by policy, increased investments in their science infrastructure. Here countries like China have invested in increasing their science and innovation outcomes through increase government expenditures for funding science and technology (Regets 2001, Saxenian 2002, Zweig, Changgui et al. 2004, Grogger and Hanson 2015. Consequently, H9: Countries that have increased expenditures for science and technology relative to the US will increase the likelihood their citizens will return, all else equal. While there have been a couple of attempts to model foreign Ph.D. scientist decisions to return home they are based on very limited and unique data sets applying relatively limited theoretical frameworks. The NSF data described by Milan, 2012, 2014) provides an opportunity to investigate this issue in the US context and apply a more complete theoretical framework."}, {"section_title": "Data and Measurements", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sources:", "text": "The data we used are from the National Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) and the International Survey of Doctoral Recipients (ISDR), which is a panel study sponsored by NSF and conducted every three years on representative cohorts of Ph.D. graduates. These data are augmented with survey data taken at the time each individual graduated with their doctoral degree, the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The SDR targets the population of Ph.D. students who received doctoral degrees in the US and were living in the US on the survey reference date, while the ISDR includes Ph.D. students who were residing outside of the US. There have only been two iterations of the ISDR, 2010 and 2013. Based on the information of citizenship and residence location, we can know whether a respondent has returned to his home country. Our analytic sample is based on the 2013 SDR and ISDR. Since the data on graduates living abroad who received degrees before 2001 is not adequate to characterize returnees due to limitations of sampling, our sample contains only graduates since 2001. The decision to use the 2013 generates the largest possible time frame since graduation, 2001-2011."}, {"section_title": "Dependent variable:", "text": "We define an individual as having returned home if in the 2013 ISDR they indicate they reside and work in their country of origin, as indicated at the time of their graduation from a US institution of higher education. Thus we use their initial declaration of their home country from the SED and their current status from the 2013 ISDR to make this determination. Students may also live in some country that is not their home country except the U.S. We only count a subject as 'returned' if they returned home, and therefore students who are residing in the U.S. or other foreign countries are defined as not returned. We use a binary variable coded 1 for return and 0 for not returned to measure their return status."}, {"section_title": "Independent variables:", "text": "Appendix A provided definitions and coding for all independent variables used in this study. Our main independent variables are the log of salary, R&D infrastructures, primary source of degree funding, undergraduate degree granted location, whether the respondent has a master degree granted from an institution in their home country, gender, marital status, job relevancy to degree, university quality, sector of occupation, and a measure of their intention to return home filled out at the time of graduation on the SED. We also make use of information about their country of origin and their academic area of concentration. Six additional control variables are also considered; whether a subject changed jobs during last two years, number of degrees granted at institutions from their home country, whether they have a degree in a different field than they are currently employed, perspectives on job preference, age at graduation, and years since graduation. Current salary is the first important determinant we are interested in. In our sample, the average annual salary of returnees was approximately $63,000 in 2013, and the average salary of graduates who were residing in the US was about $90,000. We take the natural logarithm for each respondent's current annual salary in USD in 2013. We use the ratios of total research and development (R&D) researchers to the US level by year as a measure of local labor market conditions. The SED asks respondents to identify the major form of financing associated with their degree. The five main funding sources we focus on are; fellowship, grant, teaching assistantships, research assistantships, foreign country source. A sixth source of funding was used as the base case in our models: all other sources which include personal family sources of funding. We created individual binary variables for each of these. In our sample, 66% of respondents' degree funding was primarily from teaching or research assistantships. Funding sources were very different among students from different countries. 92% of Thai Ph.D. students were supported by their home country, but Chinese and Indian Ph.D. students were mostly funded by teaching or research assistantship. There were three possible locations for a respondents' undergraduate degree granting institution: the US, their home country or some other country. We applied a similar approach to coding the location of their Master's degree granting institution. For both of these constructs we coded the US case as the reference class for estimation. Respondent indicate the extent to which their current job is relevant to their degree training as closely related, somewhat related and not related. This was coded as a single variable with corresponding values of 1, .5 and 0. Measuring of the quality of a degree granting institution is complex and problematical. Consequently, we developed two alternative approaches. The first approach is based on faculty research activity. The data on university rank by faculty research activity come from the Data Salary and market conditions vary by sector of employment. Respondents indicated which sector they were currently employed. Four categories were identified; non-profit organization, for-profit company or organization, government, and university or college. We modeled these categories using four binary variables with non-profit sector as the base case for estimation. At the time a student graduates and fills out the SED, they are asked about their future plans. This two-part question identifies the individuals 'expectation' to either stay in the US or move some foreign country and where in the US or which foreign country they expect to go. This information is used to develop two binary variables for three categorical outcomes; leave for home, leave for another country, or remain in the US. Remaining in the U.S. is used as the base case in our model estimation."}, {"section_title": "Control variables:", "text": "NSF categorizes academic areas of concentration into seven broad categories: biological, agricultural & other life science, computer & mathematical science, physical science, psychology, social science, engineering, and health. A series of binary variables are used to model the effects of the area of concentration as a fixed effect in our model. We use a similar strategy associated with the country of origin. Using country of origin is a bit problematic in that many of the cultural connection are likely correlated with this variable. We also consider the year of graduation and use fixed effects dummy variables to model these effects. We also include four more controls in our model. A binary variable indicates if the respondent has changed their job during last two years. A variable also is included which counts how many degrees the respondent holds from institutions in their home country. Finally we include a binary variable to indicate if the respondent holds a degree from multiple fields. Table 1 provides summary statistics on all of our variables. The full sample drawn from the SDR and the ISDR is 6609. Since there was no data on research expenditures and STEM graduates for many of the countries sending small number of students to the US, only 4134 cases were used in estimating various models. Unfortunately this results in a problem of selection in favor of individuals coming from countries with strong levels of scientific infrastructure at home. "}, {"section_title": "Estimation and Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Base Case:", "text": "Since the dependent variable is binary, we apply standard approaches to estimation including linear probability, probit, and logit models, which define the dependent variable as the probability of return. Table 2 presents our basic result for estimation of the linear, probit, and logit probability models. Not surprisingly the results are consistent across all three forms of the model. Each model does a reasonable job of explaining variation in individual decisions with rsquare and pseudo-r-square running around 0.48 with samples over 4100 cases. The higher the wage the less likely one is to return. This is even true when taking into account the country of origin. This is due to the generally higher wage rates in the US. The actual story here is not that higher wage rates work against return but that they promote the decision to stay in the US. We also find that as the labor supply at home increases (more college graduates in STEM) it decreases the likelihood individuals will return home. Overall these results are consistent with economic theory-wages and labor market condition effecting wages matter. That said, returnees are likely to get higher wages by staying in the US than returning home. These results support both hypothesis 1 and 2. is statistically insignificant, marital status and the interaction of marital status with gender are significant. The results support hypothesis 5 that being married decreases the likelihood of return. The main effect for gender suggested in hypothesis 6 is not supported but the interaction effect of gender and marriage does provide some support for hypothesis 7. Married men are more likely than married women to return home. A more significant demographic effect though is found with regard to an individual's association with institutions of higher education in their home countries. Having an undergraduate degree and having a Master's degree from their home country significantly increases their likelihood of return. The final two hypotheses focus on the role of policy, specifically from the perspective of the foreign country. First hypothesis 8 is rejected, foreign funding did not seem to promote return. The final hypothesis considered the role of home country investment in science and technical infrastructure. In each model the relevant estimated coefficients were statistically insignificant leading us to reject hypothesis 9. Several other results from these models are worth noting. There was significant variation in return by country of origin but not by field of study. This is consistent with other work on return migration Milan 2012, Franzoni, Scellato et al. 2012). There was also significant effects associated with year of graduation. There appears to be a trend of growing rates of return starting with 2010 graduates consistently back to 2006. The two highest years were the two earliest years represented, 2001 has 20% return and 2002 had 17.5% return. Another result worth noting is that declared intentions to return home or leave the US at the time of graduation was highly significant. Clearly most individuals who do return home indicate this expectation early on. Since this particular variable is made at the time of graduation and the sample process does not include individuals until at least one year later this variable in not likely to be endogenous but rather acts as a leading indicator of a future decision."}, {"section_title": "Endogeneity of Salary", "text": "One serious concern in our model is the salary variable is likely to be endogenous. There are a number of sources of endogeneity here. First, return and salary are likely co-determined. That is ones decision to return may not be caused by the wage rate offered but the wage rate offered may be effected by the decision to return. Empirically there are systematic differences in wages by country and even within country differences related to inducing high skilled citizens living abroad to return. Another important source of endogeneity is a known missing variable bias problem. Prior empirical work suggest an adverse selection problem related to productivity (Borjas and Bratsberg 1996, Gaule 2011, Grogger and Hanson 2015. Thus, lower performing individuals less able to compete in the US are more likely to return. Since, we lack a good measure of productivity it is an omitted variable likely to be correlated with salary. In order to consider the possible effects of endogeneity and bias in estimation we also applied an instrumental variables approach to estimation. Each respondent was asked a number of questions about how important a variety of job attributes were to them. Each question had respondents indicated on a four point likert scale how important each job characteristic was to them. There were nine characteristics; salary, benefits, job security, job location, opportunities for advancement, intellectual challenge, level of responsibility, degree of independence, and contribution to society. We coded the scale as1 for \"very important\", 0.75 denotes for \"somewhat important\", 0.5 denotes \"somewhat unimportant\", and \"0.25\" denotes \"not important at all\". Two of these attributes were used as instruments, salary and contribution of job to society. Table 3 presents the results of estimating both a linear probability and probit form of the model using one and then two instruments for the log of salary. Estimation results in the first two columns are based on using a single instrument-importance of salary, and the second two columns present results based on two instruments -importance of salary and importance of a job's contribution to society. Test for exogeneity of log of salary are rejected and first-stage Ftest suggest the instruments are strong. Not surprisingly, these models do not fit as well as the base models. Most of the substantive findings from the base model remain the same with four important changes in result. First, two policy related effects now emerge as statistically significant. Funding provided for an individual's degree program by a foreign country increases the probability of return. Growing expenditures for scientific and technical infrastructure in the home country also increases the likelihood of return. The gender effect evident in the base model through its interaction with marriage is no longer statistically significant. Finally, the wage variable is also no longer statistically significant. This last change is of course a little surprising but consistent with the idea that as an endogenous variable the results in the base model would be biased."}, {"section_title": "The Case of China", "text": "We also considered one additional form of sensitivity analysis. The single largest country by far to be represented in our sample is from China. In the full sample of 6609 cases Chinese individuals represent 19.9% of the cases. In the estimation sample Chinese individuals make up 27.2% of the cases. We re-ran the exactly identified endogenous forms of the LPM and the Probit Model for the sample after excluding individuals from China.  "}, {"section_title": "Overall Results", "text": "From a policy perspective these results suggest several key points. First the quality of their educational experience and the funding mechanism for graduate education does not sufficiently embed individuals into research network so as to mitigate the likelihood they will return. In other word the idea that the educations and 'invisible college' networks hold people or reduce the cultural and social connections forged earlier in a person's life does not seem to hold. The one exception is that foreign funding does increase the likelihood of return. It also seems that cultural connections are strong forces in attracting non-US citizens with US Ph.Ds. to return to their home countries. This takes several forms. For example, unmarried individuals are likely drawn home to find more suitable marriage partners. Also, connections to high education institutions in their home country also exerts a force for return. This effect is actually compounded as individuals have more and more degrees from home. Finally, countries can effect individual Ph.Ds. perception of opportunities by enhancing the quality of their science and technical infrastructure. Countries that continue to invest more in those infrastructures improve the probability their citizen with US Ph.Ds. will return, though the evidence suggest that this is primarily applicable to China."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "This paper has developed a theoretical framework for understanding why non-US citizens who earn US Ph.Ds. return home. The framework includes elements from both classical labor economics and transnational cultural connections to one's homeland to explain the decision to return home. It also considers the role of linkages to professional networks and aggregate policies at home associated with enhancing science and technical infrastructure. To understand the overall results it is useful to focus on the single most powerful predictor of return-intention of return given at the time of graduation. This suggests that, in a causal sense, the main forces that effect the decision to return are in place before the student actually returns. Thus it is not surprising that the dominant factors are what we have referred to as the connectedness of individuals to their home countries. Indirect measures of this are having college and graduate degrees from institutions within their home country before coming to the US, marriage status, and country fixed effects. The role of economic forces like wages are more difficult to understand. When viewing wages as exogenous, higher paying jobs in the US clearly work against the decision to return but when treated as endogenous this effect becomes insignificant. This is consistent with the idea that return is motivated by culture and connectedness conditions established before completion of the degree. It is also consistent with other empirical results. For example, we hypothesized that higher quality training could embedded foreign scholar in more prestigious research networks and that would mitigate interest in returning home. Our result did not support that hypothesis suggesting that even high quality training and potential membership in elite research networks do not compensate for these prior connections to their home country. The two policy results found in the model assuming an endogenous effect of wages also provide results consistent with the connectedness model. Foreign funding of ones graduate education clearly strengthens the connection during the education abroad process to one's home country. It also occurs before graduation and can be a factor in forming or at least solidifying their intention to return home. The growing investment at home in science and technical infrastructure has an independent positive effect and along with a growing supply of skilled scientific and technical work force at home having a negative effect fits with rational choice notions. The positive effect of investments only shows up in the endogenous model and based on our sensitivity analysis, and thus is likely is confined to China. This suggests it is likely a secondary force at work in the final decision to return home. There are a number of limitations associated with this work. First the actual measure of return looks at a condition measured from a single iteration of a panel survey. While we know how long it has been since they graduated we do not know exactly when they returned. in that if they were returnees in 2011 they were 90% likely to be returnees in 2013. Nevertheless, timing matter especially with regard to relative wage rates that changed during the time period. As with any field study there are also always potential issues of omitted variable bias and selection. We do try to account for some of this with alternative estimation approaches and the use of a number of control variables but this is only a partial solution. Despite these concerns the main results seems to hold over a number of different model estimations and forms which provides some measure of confidence in the results."}]
