In these cases, tests for statistical significance take both the study design and the number of comparisons into account. NCES publications only discuss differences that are significant at the 95 percent confidence level or higher. Because of variations in study design, differences of roughly the same magnitude can be statistically significant in some cases but not in others. In addition, results from surveys are subject to nonsampling errors. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, and other systematic error. For complete technical details about data and methodology, including sample sizes, response rates, and other indicators of survey quality, we encourage readers to examine the detailed reports referenced in each article. performance and other outcomes, the quality of educational environments, and support for education.

Examples include reports that present new results of major studies with high visibility, such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress or the Program for International Student Assessment. NCES is committed to maintaining this annual release schedule, and our customers tell us that they are pleased with it. We would like to hear what you think about the schedule. Please direct your comments to the Quarterly Editorial Board at the following address: The 2001 edition of the Digest of Education Statistics, produced by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), is the 37th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. (The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86.) Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international education. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. In addition to updating many of the statistics that have appeared in previous years, this edition contains a significant amount of new material, including use of various instructional approaches by kindergarten teachers; pupil/teacher ratio in public schools, by level and size of school; and percentage distribution of elementary and secondary school children, by average grades."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Formal Education", "text": "In the fall of 2001, about 68.5 million persons were enrolled in American schools and colleges (table A).

The fastest public school growth occurred in the elementary grades, where enrollment rose 24 percent over the same period, from 27.0 million to 33.6 million. Private school enrollment grew more slowly than public school enrollment over this period, rising 7 percent, from 5.6 million in 1985 to 5.9 million in 2001 (table B). As a result, the proportion of students enrolled in private schools declined slightly, from 12 percent in 1985 to 11 percent in 2001. Since the enrollment rates of kindergarten and elementary school age children have not changed much in recent years, increases in elementary school enrollment have been driven primarily by increases in the number of children. Public secondary school enrollment declined 8 percent from 1985 to 1990, but then rose 20 percent from 1990 to 2001, for a net increase of 10 percent. NCES forecasts record levels of total elementary and secondary enrollment for the next several years as the 'The 2001 enrollment data are based on projections. school-age population crests. The fall 2001 public school enrollment marks a new record, and new records are expected every year through the early 2000s. Public elementary school enrollment is projected to decline slowly until the later part of the decade and then increase, so that the fall 2011 projection is slightly lower than the 2001 enrollment. In contrast, public secondary school enrollment is expected to increase 3 percent between 2001 and 2011."}, {"section_title": "Teachers", "text": "An estimated 3.6 million elementary and secondary school teachers were engaged in classroom instruction in the fall of 2001 (table B). This number has risen in recent years, up about 29 percent since 1990. The number of public school teachers in 2001 was 3.1 million, and the number of private school teachers was about 0.4 million. The number of public school teachers has risen slightly faster than the number of students over the past 10 years, resulting in small declines in the pupil/teacher ratio. In the fall of 2000, there were an estimated 16.0 public school pupils per teacher, compared with 17.2 public school pupils per teacher 10 years earlier. Over the same period, the pupil/teacher ratio in private schools decreased from 14.7 to 13.9. Data from the end of the 1990s suggest a continuation of the historical trend toward lower public school pupil/teacher ratios, which had been stable during the late 1980s and early 1990s. 1 0"}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS", "text": "The salaries of public school teachers, which lost purchasing power to inflation during the 1970s, rose faster than the inflation rate in the 1980s. Since 1990-91, salaries for teachers have generally maintained pace with inflation. The average salary for teachers in 2000-01 was $42,898, about the same in constant dollars as at the beginning of the decade.\nWhat children know, by child, family, and school characteristics. Differences in children's achievement (as represented by their overall achievement score) by their family's poverty status, race/ethnicity, and school type persist from kindergarten through the spring of first grade. However, children's overall reading and mathematics achievement does not vary by their sex. Differences (or lack of differences) in overall achievement scores only tell part of the story. Another way to think about how certain child and family characteristics relate to firstgraders' spring achievement is in terms of children's acquisition of specific reading and mathematics knowledge and skills. Whether or not certain groups of children acquire certain skills or sets of skills may add meaning to an overall achievement score difference. In terms of specific first-grade reading and mathematics skills and knowledge, females are more likely to recognize words by sight and understand words in context than males. Males and females are equally likely to be adding and subtracting; but, in the spring of first grade, males are more likely than females to solve problems that require multiplication and division. Simply stated, by the spring of first grade, females are more likely to be reading and males are more likely to be successful at advanced mathematical operations (i.e., multiplication and division). When considering the poverty status of children's families from the kindergarten year, first-graders from nonpoor families are more likely to recognize words by sight than first-graders from poor families. The same is true for addition and subtraction. Moreover, about twice as many first-graders from nonpoor families are proficient at understanding words in context and performing multiplication and division as first-graders from poor families. There are also differences by children's race/ethnicity. White children are more likely than Black or Hispanic children to recognize words by sight, understand words in context, solve addition and subtraction problems, and solve multiplication and division problems by the spring of first grade. Asian children are more likely than Black or Hispanic children to recognize words by sight, understand words in context, and solve multiplication and division problems. In the spring of first grade, Hispanic children are more likely than Black children to demonstrate proficiency in these particular reading and mathematics areas.\nOverall, the majority of students (59.0 percent) were enrolled on a full-time basis. Compared to other racial/ ethnic groups, Hispanics were generally more likely to be enrolled on a part-time basis, with nearly half (49.4 percent) of all Hispanic students attending school part time. However, there were some differences from this pattern at the graduate and first-professional levels. For example, at the graduate and first-professional levels, Hispanic students were more likely to enroll on a full-time basis than were Black or White students. Asian/Pacific Islanders were more likely to attend full time than any other racial/ethnic group at all student levels (table C).\n\n\nNationwide, public libraries provided 5.1 materials in electronic format per 1,000 population (e.g., CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, and magnetic disks)."}, {"section_title": "Student performance", "text": "Most of the student performance data in the Digest are drawn from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP assessments have been conducted using three basic designs. The main NAEP reports current information for the nation and specific geographic regions of the country. It includes students drawn from both public and nonpublic schools and reports results for student achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12. The main NAEP assessments follow the frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) and use the latest advances in assessment methodology. Since 1990, NAEP assessments have also been conducted at the state level. A state that chooses to participate receives assessment results on the performance of students in that state. In its content, the state assessment is identical to the assessment conducted nationally. However, because the national NAEP samples were not, and are not currently, designed to support the reporting of accurate and representative state-level results, separate representative samples of students are selected for each participating jurisdiction/ state. NAEP long-term trend assessments are designed to give information on changes in the basic achievement of America's youth since the early 1970s. They are administered nationally and report student performance at ages 9, 13, and 17 and in grades 4, 8, and 11 in writing. Measuring trends of student achievement or change over time requires the precise replication of past procedures. Therefore, the long-term trend instrument does not evolve based on changes in curricula or in educational practices. Reading. Overall achievement scores on the long-term trend reading assessment for the country's 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students are mixed. Reading performance scores for 9-and 13-year-olds were higher in 1999 than they were in 1971. However, the 1999 scores were about the same as the 1984 scores. The reading performance of 17-year-olds was about the same in 1999 as it was in 1971. Black 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds exhibited higher reading performance in 1999 than in 1971. However, performance for all three age groups in 1984 was about the same as in 1999. The performance levels of White 9-and 13-year-olds also rose between 1971 and 1999. Separate data for Hispanics were not gathered in 1971, but changes between 1975 and 1999 indicate an increase in performance among 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. There was no significant difference between the 1984 and 1999 reading performance of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old Hispanics. Mathematics. Results from the long-term trend mathematics assessments indicate that scores of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students were higher in 1999 than in 1973, but have remained unchanged since 1994. This pattern was similar for White, Black, and Hispanic students. A 2000 voluntary assessment of the states found that mathematics proficiency varied widely among eighthgraders in the 44 participating jurisdictions (39 states, American Samoa, Guam, Department of Defense overseas and domestic schools, and the District of Columbia). Overall, 65 percent of these eighth-grade students performed at or above the Basic level in mathematics, and 26 percent performed at or above the Proficient level.' Only four jurisdictions (one state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, and Guam) had significantly fewer than 50 percent of students performing at least at the Basic level in math. Science. Long-term trends in science performance have been mixed, though changes over the past 10 years have been generally positive. In 1999, science performance among 17year -olds was lower than in 1969, but higher than in 1990. The science performance of 13-year-olds in 1999 was about the same as in 1970 and in 1990. The science performance of 9-year-olds increased between 1970 and 1999, but there was no significant difference between 1990 and 1999. International comparisons. The Third International Mathematics and Science StudyRepeat (TIMSSR), which was conducted in 1999 (4 years after the original TIMSS), focuses on the mathematics and science achievement of eighth-graders in 38 countries. In TIMSSR, the international average score of the 38 participating countries was 487 in mathematics and 488 in science. In 1999, U.S. eighth-graders, on average, scored higher in both math-ematics and science than the international average of the 38 countries. In mathematics, the average U.S. score was higher than the score in 17 countries, similar to the score in 6 countries, and lower than the score in 14 countries. In science, the average U.S. score was higher than the score in 18 countries, similar to the score in 5 countries, and lower than the score in 14 countries."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education", "text": "College enrollment Enrollment in degree-granting institutions hit a record level of 14.8 million in the fall of 1999, and another record of 15.3 million is expected for 2001. Enrollment is expected to increase by an additional 16 percent between 2001 and 2011. Despite decreases in the traditional college-age population during the 1980s and early 1990s, total enrollment increased because of the high enrollment rate of older women and recent high school graduates. Between 1990 and 1999, the number of full-time students increased by 12 percent compared to no increase in part-time students. Faculty and staff In the fall of 1999, there were 1,028,000 faculty members in degree-granting institutions. Making up this figure were 591,000 full-time and 437,000 part-time faculty. In 1998, full-time instructional faculty and staff generally taught more hours and more students than did their part-time counterparts, with 21 percent of full-time instructional faculty and staff teaching 15 or more hours per week and 13 percent teaching 150 or more students. About 9 percent of part-time instructional faculty and staff taught 15 or more hours per week, and 4 percent taught 150 or more students. White males constituted a disproportionate share of fulltime college faculty in 1999. Overall, about 54 percent of full-time faculty were White males. However, this distribution varied substantially by rank of faculty. Among full professors, the proportion of White males was 71 percent. The proportion was somewhat lower among the lower ranked faculty, with White males making up 40 percent of the lecturers."}, {"section_title": "Graduates, Degrees, and Attainment", "text": "The estimated number of high school graduates in 2000-01 totaled 2.8 million.

In contrast, the number of General Educational Development (GED) credentials issued rose from 331,000 in 1977 to 501,000 in 2000. The dropout rate also declined over this period, from 14 percent of all 16-to 24-year-olds in 1977 to 11 percent in 2000. Much of the decrease occurred between 1977 and 1990. The number of postsecondary degrees conferred during the 2000-01 school year by degree level has been projected: 562,000 associate's degrees; 1,209,000 bachelor's degrees; 428,000 master's degrees; 81,900 first-professional degrees; and 46,700 doctor's degrees (table C).

He directed us to prepare during the next 6 weeks a \"handbook\" of statistics that would be useful for research, legislative, and general information purposes. He envisioned a publication of some dignity and stature, one that would reflect credit upon the Office as well as provide a useful source of information. One of his suggestions was that the handbook should have a maroon cover. (In this respect he was destined to be disappointed in the outcome: the first Digest came back from the printer with a bright yellow cover.) Work on the new handbook began almost immediately in order to meet Mr. Flynt's timetable. The responsibility was assigned to the Reference, Estimates, and Projections Section, where the project benefited greatly from the able direction of the section chief, Kenneth A. Simon. Dr. Simon provided the excellent leadership needed to keep the work moving smoothly, and it was he who chose the name for the new publication. Staff members assigned to the Digest were relieved of most of their other responsibilities during the developmental phase of the project. The manuscript was completed on schedule: it contained 82 tables, six figures, and a concise introduction to each of its four chapters. The camera-ready copy for the first Digest was prepared \"in house,\" and the report was published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in October 1962. The new Digest summarized the major items that had been collected by the Office of Education through the years. In one convenient source it provided data on the number of schools, students, staff, and graduates, as well as on the revenues and expenditures of educational institutions. The demand for the new publication was so great that the initial supply was soon exhausted. It was reprinted in December 1962 and offered for sale at $1.00 a copy by the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO). (GPO has continued to stock the publication through the years. It has frequently appeared on the GPO list of bestsellers, and a substantial number of copies continue to be sold, at a price of $50.00 a copy for the 2001 edition.) The Digest expanded during the 1960s and 1970s, but at a relatively modest pace. A conscious effort was made to reach out and bring in materials from other agencies that would add to the usefulness of the publication. The U.S. Census Bureau, with its data on the educational attainment of the population, the social and economic characteristics of students, and the education expenditures of state and local governments, was a prime source for additional statistics that found their way into the Digest. Among the other organizations that provided data for the 1980 edition were the U.S. With its six chapters, 200 tables, and 14 figures, the 1980 Digest was still less than half the size of recent editions. Major expansion of the Digest since the late 1980s has turned a good publication into a great one. While it still contains the standard items that users of education statistics continue to find very useful, a great deal of new material has significantly enhanced its value. The Digest now accomplishes much more than merely summarizing the data from other publications. It is also the primary source for a substantial amount of information not found elsewhere. For example, it provides detailed information for each state and a considerable amount of data for individual colleges and universities and for large school districts. The 2001 edition of the Digest, which made its appearance on the World Wide Web on March 1, 2002, contains seven chapters, 430 tables, and 33 figures. It also devotes considerable attention to data sources and definitions of terms, and it provides caveats that guide users in interpreting the data."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics and Uses of the Digest", "text": "Recent editions of the Digest reflect some of the major concerns of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the 21st century. NCES is interested in how students progress through the education system, how many drop out along the way, and how many stay in school and graduate from high school and college. One way NCES measures student persistence is through longitudinal surveys that track representative samples of students through high school and postsecondary education. NCES is also increasingly concerned with qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of American education. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides data over time on how well students in elementary and secondary schools are doing in such subjects as reading, writing, mathematics, and science. International tests of reading, mathematics, and science enable one to compare American students with young people in countries around the world. The Digest serves as a readily accessible resource for these kinds of data. The users of the statistics in the Digest are a diverse group. Members of Congress and their staffs use the data to plan federal education programs and to serve the needs of their constituents. Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the National Science Foundation, look for information on the supply of trained manpower coming out of schools and colleges, and also for data on the courses of study being taught there. Education officials at the state and local levels seek background information to deal with the problems of staffing 16 and financing public schools. Education organizations, such as the American Council on Education, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National Education Association, use the data for planning and research. The news media, including the national television networks, the national news magazines, and some of the nation's leading daily newspapers, use the statistics to inform the public about such matters as trends in NAEP test scores, dropout rates, expenditures per pupil in public schools, and costs of attending college. Business organizations use trend data on enrollments and expenditures to forecast the demand for their products. Members of the general public use the data to become more informed citizens and to make intelligent decisions concerning the education issues of the day. What accounts for the success of the Digest, and why is it so widely used today? Part of the answer, no doubt, is the fact that it reflects a prodigious amount of high-quality work. Putting together the Digest is an awesome responsibility, and when one reviews the manuscript with its hundreds of pages each year, one sometimes wonders how this responsibility is so capably met. Each edition seems to expand and improve upon the one that went before it. Certainly the increased use of computers helps to expedite the process, but much more than computer literacy is involved. For a number of years, the Digest was produced in the old Statistical Information Branch, headed by a peerless and dynamic leader, Dr. Forrest W. Harrison. The Statistical Information Branch had the dual responsibilities of preparing the Digest (along with two other major publications4) and disseminating data to the many users of education statistics. Thus, staff working on the Digest were exposed to the kinds of questions that real people ask about American education. The Digest continues to respond admirably to such questions by emphasizing the kinds of data that users really need. Among the qualities that enhance the usefulness of the Digest are clarity, comparability, and consistency. Recognizing that the Digest is essentially a reference work and that almost no one is going to sit down and read it from cover to cover, the authors construct each "}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS same kinds of data year after year to meet the needs of those users who are looking at trends in American education.

Consistency within each annual report is achieved by clearly delineating the sources of data and by specifying the reasons why the statistics in one "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Children's experiences with school are almost as varied as children themselves. This report is the third in a series based on findings about young children's early experiences with school from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), ECLS-K selected a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the fall of 1998 and is following these children through the spring of fifth grade. The study collects information directly from the children and from their families, teachers, and schools. The full ECLS-K base-year sample is comprised of approximately 22,000 children who attended about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year. The first two reports, America's Kindergartners (West, Denton, and Germino-Hausken 2000) and The Kindergarten Year (West, Denton, and Reaney 2000), provided a national picture of the knowledge and skills of children at kindergar-ten entry and across the kindergarten year. Both reports revealed that while first-time kindergartners are similar in many ways, their knowledge and skills differ in relation to their age at school entry, race/ethnicity, health status, home educational experiences, and child care histories. This report presents a picture of these children as firstgraders.' The first two reports laid the foundation for a basic understanding of children's achievement across the kindergarten year. This report continues the story by providing information about children's knowledge and skills in the first-grade year. The report looks at children's school performance in terms of their reading and mathematical knowledge and skills. To address the multifaceted nature of children's development, this report relates children's reading and mathematical knowledge and skills to child, family, and school characteristics. Whereas a prior report (i.e., The 'First-graders refers to first-time kindergartners who were promoted to first grade in the fall of 1999. BEST COPY AVAILABLE Kindergarten Year) specifically addressed the gains children made in reading and mathematics across the school year, this report focuses more on the status of children's reading and mathematics achievement in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first-grade. Taking a broad view of child development, the report explores how children's literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status at kindergarten entry relate to their spring kindergarten and firstgrade reading and mathematics knowledge and skills. When conceptualizing literacy in young children, since young children's reading and mathematical ability are highly related, it is important to consider not only their reading skills but also their reading environment and their mathematical reasoning skills (West, Denton, and Germino-Hausken 2000;National Research Council 1989;National Institutes of Health 2000). Recognizing numbers (i.e., math skills) and recognizing letters (i.e., reading skills) both represent a child's ability to understand that symbols have meaning. Therefore, this report provides information on multiple aspects of children's early literacy, such as their ability to recognize letters, the frequency with which they are read to, and their ability to recognize numbers and shapes and to understand the relative size of objects.\nThis report presents data on student enrollment in postsecondary education institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia for fall 1998. The data are from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Enrollment data were collected through two IPEDS surveys. The \"Fall Enrollment Survey\" (IPEDS-EF:98) was sent to all institutions that award associate's or higher level degrees or postbaccalaureate or higher level certificates. Postsecondary institutions that award only certificates or diplomas requiring less than 4 years to complete reported enrollment as part of their IPEDS \"Consolidated Survey\" (IPEDS-CN:98). Combining data from these two surveys provides a complete picture of enrollment in postsecondary education institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. This report focuses on institutions that 1 (e.g., Pell Grants and Stafford Loans) for students attending postsecondary institutions. Students attending institutions with a PPA may be eligible either to receive Title IV funds or to defer repayment of their loans.\nThe tables in this report summarize information about public libraries in the 50 states and the District of Columbia for state fiscal year (FY) 1999. (Data from two outlying areas, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, are also included in the tables,' but not in the reference transactions, public service hours, interlibrary loans, circulation, library visits, children's program attendance, and circulation of children's materials. It also includes information about size of collection, staffing, operating income and expenditures, type of geographic service area, type of legal basis, type of administrative structure, and number and type of public library service outlets.3 Data were imputed for nonresponding libraries. Ninety-seven percent4 of the total population of the states and the District of Columbia had access to public library services, and 3 percent did not. Eleven percent of the public libraries served 72 percent of the population of legally served areas in the United States; each of these public libraries had a legal service area population of 50,000 or more. Eighty-one percent of public libraries had one single direct service outlet (an outlet that provides service directly to the public). Nineteen percent had more than one direct service outlet. Types of direct service outlets include central library outlets, branch library outlets, and bookmobile outlets. A total of 1,505 public libraries (17 percent) had one or more branch library outlets, with a total of 7,337 branches. The total number of central library outlets was 8,883. The total number of stationary outlets (central library outlets and branch library outlets) was 16,220. Nine percent of public libraries had one or more bookmobile outlets, with a total of 907 bookmobiles.\nThe Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a new system of international assessments that focus on 15-year-olds' capabilities in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy. PISA also measures general or cross-curricular competencies such as learning strategies. PISA will be implemented on a 3-year cycle that began in 2000. Each PISA assessment cycle focuses on one particular subject, although all three are assessed in each cycle. In this first cycle, PISA 2000, reading literacy is the major focus, occupying roughly two-thirds of assessment time. In 2003, PISA will focus on mathematics literacy, and in 2006, on science literacy (figure 1). PISA will report on performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years, and provide a more detailed look at each domain in the years when it is the major focus. For instance, average scores for specific reading processes, such as retrieving information, interpreting texts, and reflecting on texts, as well as a combined reading literacy average score are available for PISA 2000. Only single measures of mathematics and science literacy are available in PISA 2000, with more specific information to be provided for these domains in subsequent cycles. These cycles will allow countries to compare changes in trends for each of the three content areas over time.  PISA's purpose is to represent the overall yield of learning for 15-year-olds. PISA assumes that by the age of 15, young people have had a series of learning experiences, both in and out of school, that allow them to perform at particular levels in reading, mathematics, and science literacy. Other national and international studies have a strong link to curriculum frameworks and seek to measure students' mastery of specific knowledge, skills, and concepts. PISA is designed to measure \"literacy\" more broadly. The unique contribution of PISA lies in its focus on assessing students' knowledge and skills in reading, mathematics, and science in the context of everyday situations. As 15-year-olds begin to make the transition to adult life, they not only need to know how to read, or understand particular mathematical 60 NATIONAL CENTER formulas or scientific concepts, but they also need to be able to apply knowledge and skills in all of the different situations they will encounter in their lives. By focusing on the age of 15, PISA allows countries to compare outcomes of learning that reflect both societal and educational system influences, as well as students' preparedness for adult life as they near the end of compulsory schooling. The United States has been actively involved in the development of PISA since its inception, believing that PISA's differences from other studies allow it to complement the picture of U.S. performance obtained from other studies and provide a new perspective on U.S. education in an international context. This report, produced by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), focuses on U.S. results from PISA 2000. Following are highlights of the findings presented in the complete report.\nThis report attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of total federal financial support for education since fiscal year (FY) 1980.' In addition to Department of Education programs, the many other federal programs that support education are included. The report also includes other types of federal support that are sometimes overlooked.\nWhile most young people enroll in postsecondary education shortly after graduating from high school, not all choose this path. A minority of high school studentsreferred to as the \"non-college-bound\"go directly into the labor market after obtaining their high school diploma. How these students fare in the world of work is of direct concern for educators. The U.S. economy in the late 1980s has been characterized as a new economyone that demanded high skills of workers and in which ill-prepared persons would not do well. It was also feared that the high school curriculum of the day did not adequately train students for the workplace. Previous research analyzing the relationships between high school experiences and labor market outcomes suggests that while secondary academic and vocational courses provide only small wage benefits in the first few years after graduation, academic achievement and high school work experience are associated with labor market success (U.S. Department of Education 1994; Bishop 1985;Meyer and Wise 1979). To focus on academic coursework by way of example, there appears to be only modest evidence that such coursework is rewarded by employers, despite their claims that it is general skills that they would like young workers to bring into the workplace (SCANS 1991). Rumberger and Daymont (1982) found that taking additional academic courses including mathematics, English, science, social science, and foreign languages significantly reduced the unemployment rates of young men and women who did not go to college and significantly increased the wage rate and number of hours worked for women. On the other hand, Bishop found evidence indicating that taking a greater number of semesters of academic courses negatively affected employment and earnings. This report uses data from the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Sophomores, \"Fourth Followup\" (HS&B-So:80/92), to examine the labor market outcomes of a cohort of non-college-bound students who graduated from high school in 1982. Many of the previous studies of non-college-bound youth cited above have examined the economic returns to education immediately following high school or perhaps 2 or 3 years after gradua-tion. This report uses longitudinal data to examine not only these short-term outcomes, but also the economic returns to high school experiences almost a decade after the cohort graduated from high school."}, {"section_title": "Findings2", "text": "This section presents highlights of the findings.

Because students pursuing a postsecondary credential often take more than 3 years to complete their programs, it is important to consider both completion (i.e., whether a student had earned a postsecondary credential by 1998) as well as persistence (i.e., whether a student was enrolled in a postsecondary institution in 1998). Table 2 indicates the percentage of beginning 1995-96 students who had earned a degree or certificate by spring 1998, the percentage who had not earned a degree or certificate but were enrolled in spring 1998, and the percentage who were not enrolled in spring 1998 and had not earned a degree or certificate.

But employees who study seem to have a more difficult time than other working students in persisting when their expectations are to earn an associate's degree, and a more difficult time than all other students in persisting when their expectations are to earn a bachelor's or higher level degree. This persistence problem has many potential causes. Since employees who study are more likely than other students to be full-time workers, they face greater time constraints that may make it more difficult for them to continue their studies. In addition, because their primary role is as an employee rather than as a student, they may be more likely than other students to forgo schooling for work when time (or other factors) becomes an issue. Finally, employees who study are more likely than their peers to have personal backgrounds that are related to lower postsecondary completion and persistence; these background characteristics may also contribute to Distance education availability, course offerings, and enrollments increased rapidly during the 1990s (Lewis et al. 1999). The proliferation of distance education offerings at the nation's degree-granting institutions has sparked considerable public debate, with vocal proponents (Turoff 1999) and detractors (Young 2000). However, the extent to which instructional faculty and staff are involved in distance education has not been extensively explored (Phipps and Merisotis 1999). This report begins to address some of the questions about the role of faculty in distance education in fall 1998 using the 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:99). In NSOPF:99, instructional faculty and staff at 2-and 4-year degree-granting institutions were asked questions about a wide range of issues. The analysis in this report focuses on whether instructional faculty and staffthat is, respondents who reported teaching one or more classes for credit whether or not they were considered by the institution to have faculty status' indicated teaching at least one distance class. This report uses two items from the NSOPF:99 faculty questionnaire to determine whether respondents taught any distance classes. First, for each of up to five for-credit classes, respondents were asked to indicate whether the class was taught \"through a distance education program.\"' In this report, respondents answering \"yes\" for any of their classes are described as having taught at least one \"distance education class.\" Second, for each of the same for-credit classes, respondents were asked to indicate the primary medium used to teach the class: face-to-face, computer, TV-based, or other. Respondents indicating that any of their classes were taught using any primary medium other than face-to-face communication are described as having taught at least one \"nonface-to-face class.\" Each of these two variables provides a measure of participation in distance education. When results apply to both measures, the term \"distance class\" is used. For brevity, the term \"faculty\"is often used in this report, although it includes staff teaching for-credit classes who do not have faculty status. 'The term\"distance education program\"was not defined for respondents. Although the NSOPF:99 faculty questionnaire lacked detailed questions about modes of technology, training, and instructional practices in individual distance education courses, the data permit description of national patterns of faculty involvement in distance education. The findings also describe the relationship of participation in distance education to other aspects of faculty work, such as workload and student interaction. The results presented here also serve as a baseline for studies of trends in faculty participation in distance education using future data collections. The report first presents the proportion of faculty who taught distance classes and the relationship of faculty and institutional characteristics to teaching distance classes. Then, instructional faculty and staff who taught distance classes are compared with those who did not in terms of workload and compensation, interactions with students, classroom and student practices, and job satisfaction. Most of the analyses for this report were conducted separately for full-and part-time respondents."}, {"section_title": "Instructional Faculty and Staff Teaching For-Credit Distance Classes", "text": "Across the nation, about 6 percent of instructional faculty and staff who reported teaching one or more for-credit classes indicated that they taught at least one distance education class in fall 1998. Nine percent reported teaching at least one class primarily in a nonface-to-face modeusing a computer, TV-based, or other nonface-toface medium. Those who taught distance education classes were considerably more likely than those who did not teach distance education classes to have also indicated that they taught nonface-to-face classes. Nevertheless, among those who did not teach distance education classes, about 6 percent indicated that they taught at least one class using a primarily nonface-to-face medium. Of those who did teach distance education classes, about one-third (36 percent) indicated that they taught only classes that used primarily face-to-face instruction (i.e., identified their distance education classes as using primarily face-to-face instruction). This could occur when most of the students in a given class meet in a traditional classroom, but some students elect to take the same class via distance education. BEST COPY AVAILABLE Few demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race/ ethnicity), conditions of employment (e.g., full-or parttime status, academic rank, tenure status), or aspects of education and experience (e.g., highest degree attained, years in current job) were associated with either dimension of participation in distance education. Only institution type was associated both with teaching distance education classes and with teaching nonface-to-face classes: faculty at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those at private doctoral or liberal arts institutions to teach either type of distance class (figure A). For example, faculty at public 2-year institutions were more likely than their counterparts at private doctoral institutions to teach at least one nonface-to-face class (12 vs. 6 percent). *Includes public liberal arts, private not-for-profit 2-year, and other specialized institutions.

While these data cannot address student-faculty ratio's at the departmental or institutional level, and cannot examine causal relationships, several measures of the teaching load at the faculty level are available to provide a snapshot of the activities of those faculty who do and do not teach distance classes. Overall, the teaching load was somewhat higher for instructional faculty and staff teaching distance classes than for those not doing so. On average, full-time faculty reporting participation in distance education taught at least one class or section more in fall 1998 than those not teaching either distance education classes or nonface-to-face classes (figure B). The difference appeared to be due to their teaching more for-credit classes or sections, rather than more noncredit classes or sections. Faculty teaching distance classes also averaged about 3.1 unique course preparations, compared with about 2.5 preparations for their colleagues not teaching distance classes. These relationships were also found for part-time faculty and when controlling for other characteristics such as institution type, teaching discipline, and level of classroom instruction. However, the average class size for faculty who taught distance classes was comparable to the average class size for those faculty who did not, and the percentage of total work time spent on teaching activities was also similar for faculty who taught distance classes (62 percent) and those who did not (60 percent). Incorporating distance education into faculty schedules as part of regular teaching loads, as overloads, or on a class-byclass basis has implications for the compensation faculty receive for their work (Lynch and Corry 1998). Despite the difference in workload, the basic salary instructional faculty and staff received from their institution for calendar year 1998 was similar regardless of participation in distance education. This analysis also looked at additional income faculty received from the institution, such as money received for summer sessions, overloads, or coaching, for that year. Full-time faculty who taught classes offered through distance education programs earned about $1,700 more in additional institutional income (beyond their basic salary) than those who did not teach such classes; however,  compensation for those who taught nonface-to-face classes was comparable to compensation for their colleagues who taught only face-to-face classes. Part-time faculty who taught either type of distance class were similar in the additional income they received."}, {"section_title": "Student-Faculty Interaction", "text": "Both proponents and critics of distance education stress that personal interaction is crucial to the learning process, but disagree over whether the kind of interaction the distance education student experiences is of comparable educational value to that experienced by the on-campus student (Gladieux and Swail 1999;Sherron and Boettcher 1997). NSOPF:99 included a few indicators of faculty availability to or interaction with students, including both traditional means (office hours and student contact hours) and a more novel one (e-mail communication). Based on the evidence available for these types of contact, those faculty who participated in distance education 40 appeared to interact with students, or be available to them, more than their nondistance counterparts in fall 1998. Fulltime faculty teaching distance classes held slightly more office hours per week than their peers who did not teach distance education classes or nonface-to-face classes (figure C). And because they taught more for-credit classes, while average class size was comparable, faculty teaching distance classes had more student contact hours per week than those not teaching such classes. Furthermore, full-time faculty who taught distance classes were more likely than other faculty to communicate with their students via e-mail. Among those exchanging e-mail with students, distance education faculty reported exchanging e-mail with a higher percentage of their students, and spending more time each week in this activity, than their nondistance colleagues. For example, full-time instructional faculty and staff who taught any distance education classes spent about an hour and a For those who said they communicated with students via e-mail.

Internet access and the quality of institutional computing resources were associated with whether faculty taught any nonface-to-face classes. As described above, those faculty who taught distance classes exchanged more e-mail with their students. They were also more likely to use class-specific Web sites. These results are consistent with the expansion of modes of distance education that take advantage of recent developments in advanced telecommunications. Relatively few differences were found between faculty teaching distance classes and their colleagues not doing so in terms of other factors explored in this study. For example, there were few differences in the use of various assessment practices, and in job satisfaction and opinions about the institutional climate in which faculty members worked. In fact, despite carrying larger teaching loads, faculty who taught any distance classes were just as likely, and in some cases more likely, to indicate that they were very satisfied with their workload, compared with faculty teaching only traditional classes.

In the 1998 Amendments to the Higher Education Act (HEA), Congress directed the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to conduct a new study of higher education costs (expenditures)' paid by institutions and prices paid by students and their families. This report is the final product of Phase I of the study, which relied primarily on existing national data and statistical models. The framework for the study was influenced by the findings of the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education, published in Straight Talk About College Costs and Prices (1998). This study is one follow-up to the Commission's recommendations. Congress directed that the study address a number of specific questions: How have tuition and fees changed over time compared with inflation? How have the major expenditure categories (including capital and technology costs) changed over time?"}, {"section_title": "How are expenditures related to prices?", "text": "To what extent does institutional aid (i.e., financial aid provided by institutions) affect tuition increases?

The study is limited in its ability to provide specific answers to many of Congress's questions for several different reasons, not all of which could be changed in future research. The use of existing data, models, and institutional classification schemes restricted the ability to focus on certain aspects of costs and prices. For instance, institu- In this report, the terms\"costs\"and\"expenditures\"are used interchangeably to mean the amount institutions spend to provide education and related educational services to students. tional differences in types of students served and in program and discipline mix make it difficult for classification schemes to allow generalization across institutions. As a result, the comparison groups are formed of institutions that may not be truly comparable. In addition, currently available national data are not sufficient to address many questions, reflecting the fact that institutions often do not collect the data required to answer questions about the relationships among prices, revenues, and expenditures. These data concerns are further complicated by several factors, including the absence of consistent definitions for terms such as technology, tuition discounting, and merit aid; the lack of uniformity in defining capital costs; and the lack of consistent institutional accounting conventions. There are differences between the accounting standards used for public and private not-for-profit institutions, which are particularly relevant to the measurement of capital costs. Public and private not-for-profit institutions are subject, respectively, to standards from the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Recent changes to both sets of standards may improve the data collected by NCES, but it will take several years until all changes are implemented at the institutional level. Despite these limitations, currently available national data can be used to describe and analyze aggregate trends in costs, prices, and revenues for groups of institutions, as well as to examine the strength of various relationships among these factors. Such analyses can improve and expand upon previous national studies and address some of the issues raised by Congress in the 1998 HEA Amendments."}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Methodology", "text": "Using primarily data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), this study analyzes trends in costs, prices, and revenues at postsecondary institutions from 1988-89 to 1995-96 (to 1997-98 for public institutions) and explores relationships among the variables. The analyses of relationships use existing statistical models, updated and extended over a longer period of time ihan in previous studies. All financial data ...'were adjusted for inflation to constant 1999 dollars using EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY VOLUME 4, ISSUE 1, SPRING 2002 the Consumer Price Index.' A different model was used for the public sector than for the private not-for-profit sector because research has consistently documented that there are fundamental differences in the financing structures, enrollment markets, and tuition decisionmaking processes between the sectors. The study also examines relationships between tuition and financial aid variables. Because neither of the two existing models includes financial aid (except institutional aid) among the independent variables, new models were developed to analyze these relationships. In addition to using data from IPEDS, the analyses use data from the Institutional Prices and Student Financial Aid Survey (IPSFA), a new survey that captures information on both tuition and financial aid. At the time of this report, financial aid data from this survey were only available for 1 year, so an examination of changes over time to allow trends to be identified was not possible. The universe of institutions examined in this study was drawn from the IPEDS universe, although some IPEDS institutions were excluded to increase comparability and to deal with missing data. For example, an attempt was made to include only institutions with primarily undergraduate enrollment, as undergraduate tuition charges were the focus of the study. The institutions in the final universe were grouped by sector; 4-year institutions were then divided into research/doctoral, comprehensive, and bachelor's institutions. All analyses were performed separately on each group of institutions because the groups face different financial pressures and constraints. The number of institutions and proportions of undergraduate enrollment included in the final groups of institutions are provided in figures A and B. Although the groups of institutions comprise less than half of all public and private not-forprofit institutions in the IPEDS universe, they enroll more than three-quarters of undergraduates attending IPEDS institutions in the public and private not-for-profit sectors.

In the United States, parents' education is strongly linked to differences in student performance in reading, mathematics, and science literacy. In the United States, the relationship of socioeconomic status to literacy levels is about the same for each subject. Increases in socioeconomic status are associated with increases in scores for reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy. Most participating countries do not differ significantly from the United States in terms of the strength of the relationship between socioeconomic status and literacy in any subject. In the United States, parents' national origin is linked to performance in reading literacy and mathematics literacy only for those students with two foreign-born parents compared with students with two native-born parents. There is no difference in science literacy achievement between students with native-and foreign-born parents. In the United States, 89 percent of students report that they speak the language of the assessment (English) at home most of the time. In the United States and most other countries, the reading literacy achievement of students who speak the test language at home is higher than that of students not speaking this language at home. The United States and most other countries also show advantages for testlanguage speakers in mathematics and science literacy.

In addition, many federal programs involving education have other primary purposes. In order to account fully for all federal support for education, programs residing in other federal departments and agencies having significant educational components are included, even if they have additional purposes. Off-budget support is federal money that has been excluded from the budget by law. Off-budget support in this report consists of the loan capital that is provided directly by the federal government under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) program. Nonfederal funds generated by federal programs result from federal loan guarantees and interest subsidies to support loan capital raised through various private and public sources.

Grades in high school academic and specific labor market preparation (SLMP) courses also had modest associations with early labor market outcomes for both males and females. However, these associations were short lived and had disappeared by 1991. The number of vocational courses taken was either associated with poorer earnings and unemployment or was not significantly associated with economic outcomes in both 1983 and 1991. The one exception was credits earned in SLMP courses: as the number of SLMP credits earned rose, so did the earnings and weeks employed for females in 1983. Working during high school was prevalent among noncollege-bound 1982 high school graduates, and the findings indicate that the experience was beneficial to new graduates as they made a transition into the labor force (table A). In addition, work experience in high school was positively associated with both early and later labor market success for female graduates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Controlling for personal characteristics, this study found that academic achievement and work experience while in high school were positively related to several measures of short-term labor market success for non-college-bound students, although females appeared to benefit more than males.
