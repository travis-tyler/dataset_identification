Each participant's photo story, consisting of three to five photos, was viewed via PowerPoint, and the participant was invited to talk about his or her story in terms of what messages it portrayed about healthy relationships, as well as any master narratives it countered.\nOther group members were then invited, with the photographer's permission, to share what meanings they connected with the photo story.\nBell's (2010) model, with its theoretical underpinnings in CRT, engages people in creative storytelling for social justice within four types of narratives. The themes that emerged from the Wind River UNITY Photovoice for Healthy Relationships project naturally fit into this schema due to the group process and the CRT focus on master and counter narratives, as follows: 2) Concealed narratives: The Photovoice participants expressed that they rely on storytelling from their elders and multicultural educational opportunities to learn about AI and Tribal history that has been hidden by stock narratives. Knowledge of these stories strengthens their cultural identity and self-esteem. They expressed that the more they learn, the more they are determined to survive.\nOne participant expressed, People think we are incapable. That we are incapable of taking care of ourselves and each other. They think on the rez we are surrounded by negative stuff. They don't even know how the government played a role in the alcoholism of our people. But we are keeping a strong spirit. A lot of us young people live a drug-and alcohol-free life because we know how those things have hurt our people over the years. It has been another way to try to do away with us. But we are still here! We keep a strong spirit and we take care of each other. The powwow helps us come together and celebrate.\nWe are still here. We keep a strong spirit and we tell each other, \"You can do it.\"\n(UNITY Photovoice participant, personal communication, December 30, 2010) And with regard to teen parenting, another expressed,\nWe do have teen pregnancy among our youth. But this isn't about that. To me, this shows something else about healthy relationships in our culture. This shows responsibility, priorities, family. Our key is to honor the children and protect them.\nEven at a young age, the decision of having a child is sacred and a child is a sacred gift. Her child will be in her heart always. This shows the importance of supporting her as she is a mother to this sacred child. They are our responsibility too. We all have to support her and be her family. Even if she is so young--she needs our respect even more for the decision she has made to be the most important person, a mother.\nWe have respect for our moms. 3) Stories of resistance: Through the Photovoice project, the co-researchers expressed that their heroes and sheroes support them in building and maintaining healthy relationships. Historical chiefs, sub-chiefs, current Tribal leaders, youth council advisors, ancestors, parents, elders, siblings, and peers are all a part of one connected family upon whom they rely for strength and wisdom for engaging in healthy relationships. Drumming, singing, and dancing at powwows; listening to the stories of their elders and Tribal leaders; learning their native language; and sharing this knowledge with others are all ways to perpetuate stories of resistance. For example, one participant stated:\nThere's a wealth of knowledge from our elders and chiefs. We carry their spirits within and we honor their struggles and their pride. A way to do this is through teaching our children--they are our first priority. We can all carry the legacy by sharing their wisdom with our children. Their pride, their wisdom--hold it in your heart--we are descendents of Chief Washakie-and his leadership is always within us. It's not about bragging rights to say we're Indians--it is about honor and pride and carrying their And that circle at the powwow is also very important and has meaning about our youth. The ones who are in the circle--drumming, singing, dancing--they are in a safe place with a community around them. They are sacred. We want all of our children to be in that circle. The farther you are from that circle, the more you are subject to those stereotypes of drugs and alcohol and other risks. We want to bring our children and our youth into that circle. So UNITY and powwows are a way to bring them back into the circle. We are setting an example and when people see that, and they feel it, they also want to be in that circle, be a part of the family. Lots of us young people are trying to be fluent speakers of our language. Whenever you speak your own language it brings pride. I want to be able to say I'm a fluent speaker. In boarding school days we died if we spoke our language. We are still here.\nWe are still here! And there's the importance of knowing who we are--we learn our language, follow dances, learn songs, follow prayers. When you pray in your own language it makes our whole world brighter. If we could all be free to pray in our own languages, it could be so powerful and peaceful. Fremont County, including parents, grandparents, Tribal leaders, college counselors, teachers, youth, and community mental health providers attended this event, which entailed an art exhibition featuring the Photovoice project. A community dialogue followed the art reception, during which audience members discussed their reactions to the display and, in turn, discussed community strategies for next steps in addressing HIV, STIs, unintended pregnancy, and related youth risks.\nStrategies developed by the community and the Photovoice co-researchers involved identifying additional community events and group meetings at which to present the project, as well as clarifying a key take-away message of the project. The overall message they identified is that it is vitally important to integrate AI values and historical and contemporary cultural wisdom in a culturally congruent manner when providing sexuality education to young AI populations. Indeed, the Photovoice project and its analysis highlight that AI youth draw heavily on their cultural heritage for wisdom and support in building and sustaining healthy relationships. Having strong adult AI role models who promote this wisdom, in turn, has empowered the Wind River UNITY Photovoice co-researchers to become positive role models for their younger peers. \u2022 Provide opportunities for nonverbal creative expression: Photovoice fits well within AI cultures, as storytelling is a powerful key to cultural survival. The intergenerational stories that are passed on \"are not fairy tales or entertaining stories for children-they are lived values that form the basis for Indigenous governance and regeneration. Experiential knowledge and living histories\u2026comprise part of the core teachings that Indigenous families transmit to future generations\" (Corntassel, Chaw-win-is, & T'lakwadzi, 2009, p. 137) . The visual stories that are told through Photovoice are also a strong fit for facilitating communication among AI youth, caregivers, and elders, as they allow stories to be told without verbally speaking the message. For disenfranchised populations whose voices and language have historically been oppressed and denied, Photovoice can send a powerful visual message.\n\u2022 Integrate cultural heritage into the fabric of the work: Reactions to the Wind River UNITY Photovoice stories tend to be powerful and emotional. An unintended emergent theme of the Wind River UNITY project is that of hope for healing from historical trauma and grief. Community members shared that the display brings them hope and a sense of pride that their ancestors, cultural values, and wisdom about healthy relationships (e.g., respect, peace and harmony) live on in their young people. This finding emphasizes how reducing health disparities may be possible through culturally responsive empowerment and a focus on positive social determinants of health (e.g., cultural heritage) in health promotion and prevention activities. A key pathway to healing, and, potentially, improved health and educational outcomes is the message that the wisdom and strength of AI cultures lives on in the young people. The co-researchers believe this is an important message to maintain within themselves for empowerment and to share with others with whom they have relationships, as well as with community members, educators, and policy makers, through all layers of the socioecological model.\n\u2022 Continue to learn. Future research is needed to determine the efficacy of prevention and education efforts that are based on Photovoice projects, especially in the realms of reducing rates of HIV, STIs, and unintended pregnancy, as well as disparities in health and educational outcomes of marginalized populations. Likewise, more research is needed to learn about the effectiveness of Photovoice projects in bringing attention to social determinants of health, countering master narratives, increasing cultural competency in education and prevention of HIV/STIs and unintended pregnancy, and, in turn, reducing health disparities. Finally, research is needed to examine the benefits of Photovoice projects with additional populations and additional social determinants of health. In the late summer of 2011, the Wind River UNITY Photovoice for Healthy Relationships project will be presented to community leaders of the Wind River Indian Reservation and Fremont County. An art reception will be held in which the photovoice artists will each present their stories, and, in turn, a community dialogue will be facilitated to develop community strategies for next steps in addressing HIV, STIs, unintended pregnancy, and related youth risks.\nGrand entry on a Friday night.
