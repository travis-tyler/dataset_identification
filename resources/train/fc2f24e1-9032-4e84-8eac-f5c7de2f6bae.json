[{"section_title": "", "text": "Recent research in rural economic development has focused on wealth, defined as the stock of all assets net of liabilities that can contribute to the well-being of an individual or group (Pender, Marr\u00e9, and Reeder 2012a; 2012b) . While the concept of wealth is not new, there are renewed efforts to conceptualize and measure wealth, and investigate how wealth generates valued economic, social and environmental outcomes in various rural contexts. One area in need of more research is measurement of the distribution, composition and dynamics of wealth available to rural households. This is critically important since wealth is closely linked to economic well-being.\nA good starting point to better understand household wealth is household net worth: the value of marketable assets, minus liabilities. Marketable assets are convenient to examine when studying household wealth since these assets have market prices that allow for comparisons across households. Also, data on household net worth is readily available, in contrast to intangible household wealth such as social capital, which can be more difficult to measure and compare across geographic contexts.\nThis paper shows how existing data on household net worth may be viewed through a geographic lens by using publicly available data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine the distribution and Alexander Marr\u00e9 (amarre@ers.usda.gov) and John Pender (jpender@ers.usda.gov) are economists with the USDA Economic Research Service.The views expressed here are those of the authors and should not be attributed to the Economic Research Service or the USDA.

The articles in these sessions are not subjected to the journal's standard refereeing process. dynamics of household net worth across and within resource regions for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. This data is also used to investigate linkages between changes in household net worth and the resource base of regions. We find declines in net household worth between 2001 and 2009 across almost all regions and metropolitan categories, except for remote rural areas in the Corn Belt. In these remote rural areas, we find an increasing mean net worth that appears to be due in part to the boom in farmland values that occurred during this period.\nThe linkages between the natural resource base of a region and the net worth of households residing in the region are complex and difficult to trace. In general, the linkages depend on how important the resource in question is to the local economy, and the degree to which households in the region own the resource. For example, the value of farmland in a farming-dependent region is likely to be closely related to the net worth of households in that region. Even nonfarm residents who own or work in businesses that serve farmers are likely to be affected by changes in the economic prosperity of the agricultural sector. By contrast, in a region with natural resources that are owned primarily by non-residents, changes in the value of these assets have little or no direct effect on the net worth of households in the region, although local governments may collect property taxes that are then invested in local assets. Also, the management decisions of non-local owners can have impacts on local wealth. For example, federal government decisions not to harvest timber on federal forestland can create spillover effects on adjacent land by preserving scenic amenities that can increase the value of nearby private property (Chen and Weber 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The PSID was created in 1968 to be a nationally representative, longitudinal data set used for studying poverty in the United States. The survey has attempted to follow the original 5,000 households and their descendants. From time to time, the survey sample has been refreshed to better represent the national population.\nThe PSID is useful for studying the geographic distribution of household net worth since it is the only national survey of tangible household assets and liabilities that publicly reports geographic identifiers for nonmetropolitan areas. Information on the state of residence and a variable identifying the RuralUrban Continuum Code of the county of residence is also provided in the public-use files. These codes allow one to classify each county by level of urban population and adjacency to a metropolitan area, both of which help identify rural areas. We used data on the state of residence to classify each household as living in a particular USDA Farm Production Region (e.g. Delta States), a classification that combines elements of commodity production, soil and climatic conditions. 1 These regions follow state lines and broadly represent differences in resource endowments and land uses. The sample size of the PSID and the lack of county identifiers in the public use data prevent a more precise classification.\nThe PSID wealth supplement consists of ten questions that identify the value of each household's tangible and marketable household assets, net of liabilities. For the purposes of this paper, we created five major categories of household net worth: the net value of financial assets; the net value of any farms and businesses (including farm land); the net value of any land or real estate besides farm land or the household's primary residence; the net value of any vehicles; and the value of home equity. Household total net worth is the sum of these categories. Compared with other surveys, the PSID does not allow data users to probe more deeply than these categories. example, the net value of farms and businesses owned by households is not separable into a farm category and a business category. Nevertheless, the value of the natural resources owned by households is most likely to appear in the value of farmland (included in farm and business assets), or in other real estate assets. The value of other resources may also appear indirectly in other categories. For example, ownership of stocks in corporations that own natural resources are reflected in household financial assets. However, it is impossible to trace such asset data to particular resources using the PSID."}, {"section_title": "The Geographic Distribution of Real Household Net Worth", "text": "We estimated the 25th, 50th or median, and 75th weighted percentiles to examine the geographic distribution of real net household worth in 2001 and 2009 (table 1) .\n2 Overall, the real value of household net worth decreased substantially during this time period, reflecting in part a severe recession beginning in 2007 and a burst in the housing bubble. These results are especially robust for the United States as a whole and for metropolitan areas. For households in nonmetropolitan counties, the results are less strong, as there is significant overlap in the 95% confidence intervals at the 50th and especially the 75th percentiles. The results for nonmetropolitan counties suggest a possible small increase at the upper end of the household net worth distribution, though our statistical confidence in the difference is low.\nA breakdown of nonmetropolitan counties by adjacency to metropolitan areas suggests that the growth in household net worth at the 75th percentile was mainly seen in nonmetropolitan counties not adjacent to metropolitan areas. The impacts of the values of the natural resource base on net household wealth are most likely to be observed in these nonmetropolitan, nonadjacent counties.\nSeveral factors could play a role in these results. First, metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan areas that are adjacent to metropolitan areas may have been more 2 Due to a small sample size and an oversampling of low-income households, the PSID wealth data tends to be less accurate when looking at the upper-end of the wealth distribution (Curtain, Juster, and Morgan 1989) . For this reason, we selected the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles to report in table 1. We examined changes in real household net worth for all USDA-ERS resource regions and found similar patterns of declining household net worth for all quartiles for nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas nationally, and in almost all regions. However, two resource regions stand out as possible exceptions: the Corn Belt and the Delta States. Both regions (as well as Appalachia) have enough household observations to allow for a meaningful look at changes in net household worth among nonmetropolitan adjacent and nonadjacent residents. In Appalachia, there appears to be a decline in net household worth for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, just as in the United States as a whole. For the Corn Belt and Delta States, however, nonmetropolitan nonadjacent counties showed a widening in inequality, with declines in net household worth for the 25th and 50th percentiles, and increases in the net household worth of the 75th percentile, although the overlap in confidence intervals again limits our statistical confidence."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Net Worth in Rural Appalachia, the Corn Belt, and Delta States", "text": "To further explore the changes in rural real household net worth in Appalachia, the Corn Belt and Delta States, and the potential connections to their resource bases, we selected a sample of households that lived in nonmetropolitan nonadjacent counties in 2001 and 2009, and that remained in the same region in both years. This selection was used to focus on changes occurring within these regions, rather than changes in household wealth that may have resulted from changes in the households in the sample due to migration between regions, household formation, or termination. We estimated mean changes as well as the following regression model of change in real household net worth between 2001 and 2009 ( w ih ):\nwhere i indexes the region, h indexes households within a region, Region i is a vector of dummy variables for each region, w ih,2001 is the household's total net worth in 2001, and u ih is the error term. Initial net worth is interacted with the region of residence to examine potential inequality growth by region. Results from the estimation of means and the regression model for Appalachia, the Corn Belt, and the Delta States are shown in table 2. We omit the results for nonmetropolitan nonadjacent areas of other regions due to small sample sizes."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The first column of results in table 2 indicates the mean change in household net worth in each region. Only the mean change in the Corn Belt is statistically significant; households in nonmetropolitan nonadjacent counties in the Corn Belt saw an increase in average real net worth of $155,000 (in 2009 dollars) between 2001 and 2009. The remaining estimates give an indication of changes in net worth inequality for each resource region. Of these, the only statistically significant coefficient was for the Delta States. However, we found that a single outlier was driving the results for the Delta States. Upon removing the outlier, the coefficient for the Delta States also became statistically insignificant.\nTo uncover the components of changes in mean household real net worth in the Corn Belt, we re-estimated equation (1) for changes in the net value of the five major asset categories: financial assets, assets in farms and businesses, assets in other real estate, vehicles and home equity (table 3). These regressions allowed us to decompose the changes in mean net worth among its components.\nThe sources of household net worth most likely to be associated with the resource base in the Corn Belt are the net value of farms and businesses, which includes the value of farm land, and the net value of other real estate, including the value of non-farmland. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, roughly 70% of the land in the Corn Belt is held by was driven primarily by the change in the net value of farms and businesses, though the estimated value of this coefficient is only weakly statistically significant with a p-value of 0.109. The contribution of real estate (farmland and buildings) to the value of farm assets increased from 75% in 2001 to 83% in 2009, so changes in the value of farm assets can be traced back largely to changes in the value of farmland. Among self-identified farmers in the nonmetropolitan nonadjacent counties in the Corn Belt, the mean change in total real net worth was $1,019,513, though this estimate is statistically insignificant. When the top four outliers are removed, the mean change in real net worth among farmers drops to a statistically significant estimate of $164,936. By comparison, non-farmers in the region saw a mean increase in net worth of $23,323, though this was statistically insignificant. Therefore, changes in net worth in farm and business assets are most likely to come from farms rather than other businesses.\nChanges in the value of farmland in the Corn Belt not only affect the net worth of farmers in the region. In 2007, 38% of farmland in the Corn Belt was owned by nonoperator landlords. Additionally, Illinois and Iowa have some of the highest proportions of rented farmland in the United States. Unfortunately, not much is known about non-operator (Nickerson et al. 2012) . In particular, the degree to which these landlords live in the region is unknown. Regardless of ownership, the value of farmland grew rapidly towards the end of the decade (Henderson 2008 (Nickerson et al. 2012) . The rise in farmland values was driven by export demand and high crop prices-factors that contributed to a healthy agricultural sector. The growth in farmland value was quite pronounced in the Corn Belt (figure 1), in part reflecting increases in the price of corn resulting from demand for biofuels and other uses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Using household panel survey data we found that household net worth declined between 2001 and 2009 for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the net worth distribution in most areas of the United States, including in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. This decline is likely due to the effects of the recession. The only regions that appeared to run counter to that trend were the nonmetropolitan counties in the Corn Belt and the Delta States that were not adjacent to metropolitan areas. Of these areas, the only statistically significant increase in mean real household net worth was in the Corn Belt. The gains in household net worth in the Corn Belt appeared to come mainly from increases in the value of farm and business assets, and showed the strongest linkage between resource values and household net worth for nonmetropolitan nonadjacent residents included in the PSID. We provided supporting evidence that this change came primarily from increases in the value of farmland in the Corn Belt during the decade, driven by increases in the value of corn and other agricultural commodities. What is striking is that this is the only region in which we were able to find increases in net household worth in rural areas.\nFuture research in this area will likely encounter data-based constraints. While the public-use PSID provides a rural measure and state identifiers, it does not have large sample sizes for rural areas in many regions of the country, and only provides aggregated sub-categories of household net worth. On the other hand, the Survey of Consumer Finances and the Survey of Income and Program Participation do not offer the level of geographic detail provided by the PSID. Despite these difficulties, research examining the linkages between natural resources and household wealth is critically important, especially for understanding the economics of rural households and regions."}]
