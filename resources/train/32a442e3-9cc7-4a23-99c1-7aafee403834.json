The annual change in CSF (total-tau [t-tau], A\u2424 1-42 ) and MRI (change in ventricular volume) was obtained in 312 subjects (92 CN, 149 aMCI, 71 AD).\nThere was no significant average annual change in either CSF biomarker in any clinical group except t-tau in CN; moreover, the annual change did not differ by clinical group in pairwise comparisons. In contrast, annual increase in ventricular volume increased in the following order, AD \u03fe aMCI \u03fe CN, and differences were significant between all clinical groups in pairwise comparisons. Ventricular volume increase correlated with concurrent worsening on cognitive/functional indices in aMCI and AD whereas evidence of a similar correlation with change in CSF measures was unclear. The annual changes in MRI differed by APOE \u24404 status overall and among aMCI while annual changes in CSF biomarkers did not. Estimated sample sizes for clinical trials are notably less for MRI than the CSF or clinical measures.\nUnlike the CSF biomarkers evaluated, changes in serial structural MRI are correlated with concurrent change on general cognitive and functional indices in impaired subjects, track with clinical disease stage, and are influenced by APOE genotype.

Low CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels reflect deposition of A\u2424 in amyloid plaques. 1 Elevated CSF t-tau levels reflect abnormal tau accumulation in NFTs and NTs as well as active axonal and neuronal damage. 1,2 Atrophy on MRI is the macroscopic manifestation of microscopic neurodegenerative changes and reflects the cumulative loss of neurons, synapses, and dendritic arborization. 3 Crosssectionally, biomarkers serve as in vivo indicators of disease stage. Longitudinal biomarker measures of change over time provide additive diagnostic and prognostic information about the rate of change in disease-related pathology and can serve as outcome measures in therapeutic trials. 4 Although both MRI and CSF biomarkers have been studied extensively cross-sectionally and to a lesser extent longitudinally in small cohorts or single centers, few reports have compared longitudinal change on both CSF and MRI biomarkers in the same subjects examined serially in multicenter studies of large cohorts of cognitively normal (CN) individuals, subjects with amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and patients with AD. Thus, the aims of this study were 4-fold:\n1. To measure the annual change in CSF A\u2424 1-42 , CSF t-tau, and ventricular volume on MRI by clinical group and compare the annual change in biomarkers between clinical groups. METHODS The data used in this study are from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a longitudinal multisite observational study of CN, aMCI, and AD collected from 59 participating institutes. 5 All 312 ADNI subjects with both baseline and 12-month follow-up CSF and usable MRI were considered in this study. The complete details of ADNI can be found at http://www.ADNI-info.org.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in these studies, as approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating center.\nClinical and cognitive assessment. We used MMSE, 6 CDR-SB, 7 and ADAS-Cog 8 as overall indices of general cognitive performance and global functional status. In this study, we used the modified ADAS-Cog scores (ADAS-Cog-13) from ADNI, which has 2 additional components (delayed recall task and a number cancellation task). The clinical and cognitive assessments used were baseline clinical diagnosis of all 3 clinical groups and baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up clinical/ cognitive assessment scores.\nCSF acquisition. CSF was collected at each site, transferred into polypropylene transfer tubes followed by freezing on dry ice within 1 hour after collection, and shipped overnight to the ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center on dry ice. When samples are received in the laboratory, they are thawed and aliquots are stored in bar-coded polypropylene vials at \u03ea80\u00b0C. A standardized protocol was implemented to quantify biomarker concentrations in each of the CSF ADNI baseline aliquots using a multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) with Innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium; for research use only reagents) immunoassay kit-based reagents, which was validated in references 9 and 10. Quality control values obtained during the analyses of ADNI baseline CSF aliquots were interday reproducibilities (%CV) for an AD CSF pool and a routine clinic patient CSF pool of 4.5% and 6.4% for t-tau and 3.3% and 6.9% for A\u2424 1-42 ; r 2 values for comparison of retested samples were 0.98 and 0.90. The CSF measurements obtained at baseline and 12 months were used."}, {"section_title": "MRI. ADNI collects 1.5-T MRI examinations from all subjects", "text": "and only these scans were used for this study. The acquired morphometric T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echos 5 were corrected for gradient nonlinearity and intensity inhomogeneity and checked for geometric fidelity using the phantom scan acquired with each subject. 5 MRI processing steps were performed by a research technician who was blinded to all clinical information. Brain atrophy was assessed by measuring ventricular expansion rates using the boundary shift integral (BSI) technique 11 on spatially registered 3-dimensional image sets. The ventricular atrophy rate was derived by creating a binary ventricular mask for each subject that selectively extracted ventricular change from the BSI. Quality control testing in our laboratory shows that the intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reproducibility of ventricle rate measurements from short interval serial MRI scans with this method is 0.91. 12 We chose ventricular BSI for measuring longitudinal change in MRI because it gives the best performance among the various longitudinal MRI measures, as evaluated in reference 12. If we required a cross-sectional measure at baseline with strong association with disease severity, we would have used hippocampal volumes. The MRI measurements obtained at baseline and 12 months was used. Although MRI scans were acquired at 0, 6, and 12 months, MRI change was measured without reference to the 6-month scans to put MRI on the same footing with CSF, which was sampled at only 0 and 12 months.\nStatistical methods. Baseline patient characteristics and cognitive, CSF, and MRI measurements and annual change in these measurements were summarized as median (interquartile range) for continuous measures and count (%) for categorical measures. Annual change in cognitive measures (CDR-SB, MMSE, ADAS-Cog) was defined by fitting a linear slope of time with each measure within individual subjects using the data available from the baseline and 6-and 12-month cognitive assessments. Annual change in CSF and MRI measures was defined as difference in the 12-month and baseline values divided by time between measurements.\nWhether annual change was significantly different from zero was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The relationship between annual change in cognition and annual percent change in CSF and MRI measures within each clinical diagnosis group was assessed using Spearman correlations. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and corresponding pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test p values were used to assess the differences in annual change in ventricular volume, A\u2424 1-42 , and t-tau across clinical group (CN vs aMCI, CN vs AD, aMCI vs AD) and across APOE genotype (\u24404-positive vs \u24404-negative) within all subjects and within each diagnosis group separately.\nTo compare the suitability of the cognitive, MRI, and CSF change measures as surrogate endpoints for a clinical trial, we estimated the sample sizes needed to detect a 25% slowing of the rate of change in annualized change with 80% power assuming a 2-sided, 2-sample t test and an \u2423 level of 0.05. The sample size estimates in MCI and AD were not adjusted for the rate of change in normal aging (i.e., by subtracting the rate in CN from MCI and AD). The estimates were based on the observed means and standard deviations.\nRESULTS Patient characteristics. The demographics, clinical summary, and biomarker summary of all subjects with MRI and CSF data at baseline and 1-year follow-up are presented in table 1. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or education between the groups except that patients with AD were less educated than patients with MCI (p \u03ed 0.04) and there was a higher proportion of women in the CN than the MCI group (p \u03ed 0.03). As expected, the proportions of \u24404 carriers were ordered as CN \u03fd MCI \u03fd AD. The median annual increase in ventricular volume was greater than 0 for CN, aMCI, and AD (p \u03fd 0.001) and the increase in ventricular volume was ordered by clinical group AD \u03fe aMCI \u03fe CN. The median annual change in t-tau was greater than 0 in CN (p \u03fd 0.001) and there was a trend of increasing t-tau in aMCI (p \u03ed 0.10) but not in AD (p \u03ed 0.25). The median annual change in A\u2424 1-42 was not different than 0 for CN, aMCI, or AD (p \u0546 0.15 for all). Box plots of annual change of MRI and CSF biomarker distributions by group are shown in figure 1.\nComparing annual change across clinical groups. Annual change in CSF and MRI biomarkers was compared across clinical groups and the AUROC and p values for the pairwise discrimination between groups are presented in the left panel of figure 2 . Annual change in ventricular volume separated all clinical groups (p \u03fd 0.001) and annual change in CSF A\u2424 1-42 and t-tau did not separate any of the clinical groups (p \u03fe 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "Correlations between annual change in CSF and MRI and change on continuous measures of cognitive and", "text": "functional performance. Spearman rank order correlations between annual change in cognitive/functional measures and annual change in MRI/CSF biomarker are shown in table 2. Figure e-1 (on the Neurology Web site at www.neurology.org) illustrates the scatterplot of annual change in MRI/CSF biomarkers vs annual change in cognitive/functional measures. In each of the clinical diagnostic groups, there was no significant correlation between the annual change in CSF biomarkers and annual decline in cognitive and functional scores in any of the groups except decrease in MMSE correlated with decrease in CSF A\u2424 1-42 in AD ( p \u03ed 0.01), increase in ADAS-Cog correlated with decrease in CSF A\u2424 1-42 in MCI ( p \u03ed 0.05), and decrease in MMSE correlated with decrease in CSF A\u2424 1-42 in CN ( p \u03ed 0.06). Overall, within each clinical group, the evidence of association between changes in CSF biomarkers with concurrent change in cognition was not clear. However, decrease in ventricular volume measured by MRI uniformly correlated with change in ADAS-Cog, CDR-SB, and MMSE in aMCI and AD groups ( p \u0545 0.01), suggesting that the change in cognitive status in aMCI and AD is more tightly coupled with changes in structural MRI. ers. The annual increase in ventricular volume was greater in \u24404 carriers than noncarriers in aMCI subjects alone ( p \u03ed 0.009) and when all subjects were combined ( p \u03fd 0.001). This latter finding was probably driven by aMCI and CN subjects since there was no significant difference in the increase of the ventricular volume in APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers among patients with AD. DISCUSSION A\u2424 amyloid deposition is increasingly recognized to be an early pathologic event that occurs prior to clinical symptoms. 13, 14 In addition, amyloid burden at autopsy does not correlate with disease duration. 15 These findings have been interpreted to indicate that A\u2424 amyloid deposition itself is not directly responsible for clinical symptoms, but rather initiates a pathologic cascade that later results in clinical symptoms. 16, 17 Both CSF A\u2424 1-42 and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET scans are used as in vivo indicators of A\u2424 amyloid deposition with nearly complete concordance between positive PiB-PET scans and low CSF A\u2424 1-42 . 18 The serial CSF A\u2424 1-42 results found in this article are consistent with earlier CSF A\u2424 1-42 and PiB-PET studies that found little or no increase in amyloid deposition over time as measured by CSF A\u2424 1-42 19, 20 or PiB 16, 21 in subjects (e.g., aMCI and AD) whose cognition declined significantly over the same time period. In an earlier cross-sectional study 22 in this same cohort, baseline CSF A\u2424 1-42 measurements also showed poor correlation with continuous measures of cognitive and functional performance within each clinical group. Our longitudinal data indicating that CSF A\u2424 1-42"}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence intervals for (A) between-group discrimination and (B) between-APOE genotype discrimination within clinical groups based on annual change in ventricular volume, A\u2424 1-42 , and t-tau\nA reference line has been drawn at 0.50, which indicates no discriminative power for the measure. p Values along the right side of each panel are from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

Increased CSF t-tau is a marker of neuronal injury and it correlates well with the severity of NFTs and NTs at autopsy in subjects with AD. 1,23 Given the good cross-sectional correlation between NFT/NT pathology and clinical disease severity and duration of clinical AD, one might expect change in t-tau to correlate with change in clinical measures and t-tau levels to increase over time in subjects with aMCI and AD, with little increase over time in CN. In contrast, we found evidence of increasing t-tau only in CN ( p \u03fd 0.001), a trend toward increasing t-tau in aMCI ( p \u03ed 0.10), and no evidence of increasing t-tau in AD ( p \u03ed 0.25). Moreover, there was no correlation between change in cognition and change in t-tau levels within each clinical group, including aMCI and AD. These results seem counterintuitive. T-tau levels are clearly greater at baseline in aMCI and AD than in CN, and therefore at some point in time, t-tau had to increase measurably with time in these subjects. One possible explanation for the relative stability of t-tau over time in aMCI and AD might be that increases in t-tau reflect a pathologic process (release of tau from injured neurons) that reaches a ceiling when subjects who will ultimately develop clinical symptoms are in the CN and very early MCI phases of the disease. Note that ADNI subjects with MCI were selected to be late in the MCI phase on the basis of impaired performance on delayed memory recall. Alternatively, t-tau levels might have increased over time in measurable amounts had the observation period been longer than 12 months; however, our results are consistent with some longitudinal t-tau studies that have shown stable t-tau measures over extended periods of time up to 3 years. 20, 24 A final possibility is that t-tau did increase in our subjects with aMCI and subjects with AD but the measurement precision was inadequate to detect the increases that were biologically present. This seems unlikely, however, given the analytical performance of the xMAP immunoassay system as described in Methods. 10 Atrophy on structural MRI correlates with Braak NFT stage and NFT load 25, 26 but the most proximate histologic correlate is neurodegenerative shrinkage of the brain; i.e., loss of neurons and synapses. 3, 27 Our results of good correlations between ventricular enlargement and cognitive worsening in aMCI and AD is consistent with the MRI literature, which is nearly unanimous in indicating close correlation between cognitive decline and volume loss on MRI. 12, [28] [29] [30] There was no consistent relationship in our CN subjects since CN on an average do not have disease-related decline on measures of general cognition. The results are also consistent with 2 recent studies that investigated similar questions using ADNI MRI data. 31, 32 Our findings on rates of brain atrophy and APOE \u24404 status are also consistent with some studies in the literature. 33, 34 The most logical explanation for greater rates of atrophy in aMCI \u24404 carriers is simply that carriers more likely have prodromal AD (and thus higher rates of atrophy), while noncarriers are less likely to have prodromal AD and include persons with nonprogressive conditions. This is supported by our recent study which showed higher amyloid load in APOE \u24404 CN and MCI carriers compared to noncarriers at the same level of cognitive performance 35 and the fact that APOE \u24404 status is predictive of time to conversion from aMCI to AD in this cohort ( p \u03ed 0.04). Implications of these data for estimating sample sizes for clinical trials are that if the treatment effect is calculated in a traditional way where the treatment modifies the rate of change that occurs naturally in the disease course then CSF biomarkers would be ineffective. However, if the treatment effect were to reverse the effect of the disease course, i.e., A\u2424 1-42 increase and t-tau decrease due to treatment, then CSF might become an effective biomarker. The sample size estimates in this study for longitudinal MRI are comparable to those in the existing literature for MRI. [36] [37] [38] [39] It should be noted that while CSF and MRI biomarkers have not yet been validated as surrogate endpoints for regulatory purposes and therefore cannot be used as the primary indicators of efficacy, the impact of interventions on these biomarkers may still be useful in capturing pharmacodynamic effect. Also, the observations made in this study, while generalizable to populations with similar characteristics, may not generalize to subject populations that significantly differ from ADNI on major demographic variables.\nBiomarkers for measuring disease progression. The 3 disease markers examined in this article reflect different aspects of AD pathology. A recent dynamic model of biomarkers 16, 40 proposed that there is an ordered onset of biomarker abnormalities beginning with CSF A\u2424 1-42 (amyloid deposition) followed by CSF t-tau (neuronal dysfunction) and last MRI (neurodegeneration) with the main underlying substrate of cognitive impairment being neurodegeneration. While longer periods of follow-up with longitudinal biomarker measurements are required, the results of our study with 12-month change measurements are in agreement with this model. We suggest that the lack of change over time in CSF A\u2424 1-42 and t-tau in subjects with aMCI and subjects with AD may be because both of these biomarkers become abnormal prior to appearance of clinical symptoms. In particular, we suggest that CSF A\u2424 1-42 becomes abnormal while subjects are still cognitively intact, and that both CSF A\u2424 1-42 and t-tau have reached a ceiling by the time subjects are in late MCI phase (i.e., representing the ADNI MCI cohort) of the disease and beyond. MRI, in contrast, becomes abnormal later in the disease progression than either CSF A\u2424 1-42 or tau, but retains a close relationship with clinical symptoms later into disease progression. We suggest that both MRI and CSF biomarkers are needed to fully characterize the different aspects of disease-related pathology. Our results (specifically the sample size estimates) support the use of longitudinal MRI measurements as an outcome measure for detecting highly relevant neurodegenerative changes throughout the clinically evident phases of the disease.
