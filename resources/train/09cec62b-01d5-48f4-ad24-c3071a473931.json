[{"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "This study attempts to quantify the impacts of coastal flooding on land area, population and urban infrastructure that would result from an extreme tropical storm occurring over a range of for future sea level rise scenarios. This case study follows a storm named Xangsane, that occurred in Thua Thien Hue, a central province in Vietnam, in 2006. It compares the impacts caused by different scenarios of storm surges and sea levels simulated on two different datasets, a national one and a global one. A 2-dimentional hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the storm surge and coastal flooding. The numerical simulation is coupled with ArcGIS tools to analyze the level and extent of inundation areas as well as their influences on population and urban infrastructure (transportation system, schools, hospitals, and historical heritage sites). Projection indicates that the sea level rise (SLR) of 1 m and 2 m can cause huge impacts for transportation infrastructure and buildings. The impact increase on transportation infrastructure is considerably significant, from 200% to 400% increase on all types of road across different storm surge scenarios. The impact on railroads is the least, about 32 km to 50 km in SLR of 1 m and 2 m, but its impact percentage is the highest among all other categories. The maximum railroad impact increases nearly 2000% for SLR of 1 m and 3500% for SLR of 2 m with or without storm surge. For land area, building (school and hospital), and special infrastructure, the impacts increase up to 450% in SLR of 1 m and 2 m simulated on both datasets (the national and the global). The risk of flooding is closely related to the SLR more than storm surges. The impact of projected sea levels increases the need for flood control measures in Thua Thien Hue province.

Every year, I witnessed and suffered several storms that came inland and caused flooding. My small, old house was always inundated. Though I had no idea when I was young how much damage and how many deaths a storm or a flood can cause, my brothers and sister and I trembled and were scared whenever my mother told us to hide under the bed to avoid the sweep of the storm or to move up to the roof to escape the flood. These memories are unforgettable and help motivate my research into the risks posed by stormcaused coastal flooding in the region, especially given the high vulnerability of its people and infrastructure. The overall goal of my research is to help mitigate the impacts of climate change, especially by reducing the risks of storm-related disaster and poverty in Vietnam. This study provides a model for flooding caused by storms and sea-level rise, which I hope will aid in the planning and development of the coastal region. I chose Thua Thien Hue province for this study for several reasons. First, Thua Thien Hue province has a relative abundance of available data for analysis. Second, as one of the central provinces in the coastal region, Thua Thien Hue has experienced the most water-related deaths and damage in the country and has the second-highest frequency of water-related disasters in the country. Third, with typical geographical characteristics, Thua Thien Hue can serve as an example of the whole region."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Vietnam is a coastal country located in the tropical region of Southeast Asia with a total population of over 90 million people, of which about 10 million live in the coastal zone and are potentially subjected to the impacts of a rising sea level. Since the political and economic reforms launched in 1986, this developing country has made many remarkable advances: from being one of the poorest countries in the world, it became a lower middle-income country with per capita income of US$2,100 by the end of 2015 (World Bank, 2016); the poverty rate has decreased from 58 percent in 1993 to 14.5 percent in 2008; and population growth rate has slowed from 1.16 in 2002 to 1.04 in 2011 (World Bank, 2010). In addition to improving most welfare indicators, Vietnam has also made good progress towards achieving the ten original Millennium Development Goal targets (UN, 2014). Geographically, Vietnam is divided into three parts: North, Central and South. Central Vietnam, bridging the North and the South, is a long land strip located by the coast. The central part is one of three metro regions of Vietnam, where a large proportion of the population, infrastructure, and economic production including tourism, industry, and irrigated agriculture are tightly packed along the coast. It holds the long-term economic future of Vietnam because of many factors. Firstly, it contains many clusters of historical sightseeing and ancient towns recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Thua Thien Hue and Hoi An. Furthermore, Central Vietnam has a coastal range and numerous lovely beaches allowing cities like Danang, Quy Nhon and Nha Trang to develop a tourist economy. Secondly, Central Vietnam is well identified by the development of agriculture and both light and major heavy industrial clusters. While Danang and Nha Trang are very famous cities for their sandy beaches, Quang Ngai is known for the first major oil refinery in the country, Dak Lak is a place for major coffee planting and processing and bauxite mining, and Binh Dinh known for its major wood furniture industrial area. Moreover, auto parts and IT industries are also discovering Central Vietnam for its potential. Thirdly, it has the most convenient transportation system in the country. It has airports, railroads, and ports in the cities where it takes just few minutes to get there. Indeed, Central Vietnam holds the most promise for new economic growth in Vietnam. Despite its advances, Vietnam is still highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of global warming and climate change. Some studies have reported sea level rise in Vietnam. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP 1993), sea level in Vietnam increased 5 cm from mid-1960 to 1990. The General Department of Meteorology and Hydrology estimated that sea levels were rising with an average speed of 2 mm per year. The forecasts of the extent of sea level rise in the future are very different, including the publication of national reports determining sea level rise increase by 1 meter by 2100 (MONRE, 2003;Hoang, 2005). Weather patterns are changing, with increasingly powerful and more frequent storms along the coast, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and onset of desertification further inland, while sea level rise is driving the intrusion of saline water into the Mekong Delta (Hoang, 2005). Both observed and projected future changes are putting Vietnam's ability to achieve the rest of the MDG targets under enormous constraints. Vietnam has an extensive coastline, two major river deltas, and mountainous areas on its eastern and northeastern borders. This long narrow country covers 329,241 square kilometers of mainland and shares its inland border of approximately 3,730 km with China, Laos, and Cambodia. It also meets the ocean in the east, south and southeast with about 1 million square kilometers of territorial sea and about 3,260 kilometers of coastline. Because of its geographical position, Vietnam is heavily exposed to the risks of weather variability and climate change. Vietnam suffers from many kinds of disasters, such as: floods, tropical depressions and other storms, storm surge, flash floods, hail, drought, landslides, and forest fires. Among these, storms and floods are the most frequent disasters. The table below shows the relative frequency of different kinds of natural disasters occurring in Vietnam.  Table 1 shows that [1986][1987][1988][1989][1990][1991][1992][1993][1994][1995][1996][1997][1998][1999][2000][2001][2002][2003][2004][2005]. The increase depends on the RCP scenarios and climate zones. More particularly, the standard increase in average temperature is from 1.3 to 1.7 o C in the mid-21st century and from 1.7 to 2.4 o C at the end of the century with RCP4.5 scenarios. With RCP8.5 scenarios, the annual average temperature in the middle of the 21st century increases from 2.0 to 2.3 o C in the north and from 1.8 to 1.9 o C in the south. By the end of the century, it increases from 3.3 to 4.0 o C in the north and from 3.0 to 3.5 o C in the south. In general, temperature is higher in the north than in the south (Figure 1).     "}, {"section_title": "Climate change scenarios", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Impacts of Climate Change", "text": "The combination of natural variability and ongoing climatic change has increased the number of disaster events and caused tremendous losses in human lives and properties because of devastating natural disasters in Vietnam. The trend was increasing with major disaster events continuously occurred and badly affecting all regions in the country, especially the coastal provinces in the central region ( Figure 7).   Vietnam directly suffers from the Asian monsoon regime that causes about 6 to 10 storms and tropical depressions annually. Specifically, over the past 50 years, Vietnam has suffered more than 400 storms and tropical depressions. Estimated material loss accounts for 1.5% GDP per year (3 rd AIPA). About 70% of population is presently at risk of typhoons and tropical storms, flooding, landslides and droughts (Hoang, 2012). In 2010, Vietnam was affected by 6 storms (4 at sea and 2 on-land) and 4 historical floods, resulting in the death of 366 persons, 96 persons missing, 493 persons wounded, and over 300 thousand hectares of farming production damaged (3 rd AIPA). Besides, most of the development of industrial, construction and service sectors and urbanization are concentrated in coastal provinces. This could lead to the increased exposure to weather-related risks. Therefore, addressing this increasing complex situation, reduction of disaster risks and climate change impacts has become one of the most important tasks of Vietnam."}, {"section_title": "Dissertation Objectives", "text": "The overall aim of this study is to assess the vulnerability of Thua Thien Hue province due to coastal flooding from storm surges and projected sea level rise.

Higher sea level can bring coastal flooding deeper in-land. The damages and impacts are much more when the powerful storms and flooding inundate the land. It can cause erosion, saltwater intrusion, and many other water-related hazards. Moreover, the coastal lowlands are usually developed areas with dense populations and industrial sites. Therefore, the potential impacts of SLR are very high. In the early 21 st century, the rate of global sea-level rise was found to be increasing more sharply than the relatively stable rates of previous years ( On the other hand, there is a shared agreement that the global sea-level will continue to rise during the 21 st century. Regionally, relative sea level rise at individual areas will vary from the global average. More specifically, the rise is above the average at low latitudes (in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean) and below the average at high latitudes; For instance, the regional variations are up to 20% higher than the mean along the East Asian coast and in the Indian Ocean, and up to 30% lower than the mean in mid-latitude Northern America and Europe (30-50 0 N) (Perrette et al., 2013). Generally, the densely populated regions affected by coastal flooding from tropical storms have experienced a rate of SLR close or greater than the global average (Jonathan et al., 2013). The different regions may experience varied rise rates and the effects of sea level rise also vary greatly among countries, even for countries in a same region. The countries in the region of Southeast Asia would experience the higher end of the projection (Liem, 2008). For Vietnam, the data measured along Vietnam coast shows that sea level rate was 3 mm/year during the period of 1993 and 2008, which is comparable with the global tendency (Le et al., 2011). Sea level at Hon Dau station increased about 20cm over the past 50 years. There have been some other studies reporting sea level rise in Vietnam. Historically, UNEP (1993) found the sea levels around Viet Nam rose by 5cm between the 1960s and 1990s and the Hydro-meteorological General Department estimated the seawater level at an average increased rate of 2 mm per year. Vietnam is ranked as one of the top five countries the most affected under a 1-meter SLR. Vietnam's physical geography makes it more vulnerable to sea-level rise than most countries because of its long coast line (3260 km), threats of coastal hazards such as typhoons and erosion, and its major population located very close to the two main deltas of Vietnam, the Red and Mekong Rivers (Narins et al., 2010). Because of geographical features of deltas in Vietnam and their proximity to high population areas, a 1-meter rise in the sea level along the coast of Southeast Asia would potentially result in a 5% land loss, about 11% population displacement, over 10 % of GDP reduced, about 11% of urban areas and 29% of wetlands affected in Vietnam (Dasgupta, 2007). Also, many other sectors can be impacted or permanently inundated, including infrastructure ( "}, {"section_title": "Tropical Storm/Storm Surge", "text": "At the end of the 21 st century, global warming is projected not to lead to an increase in frequency of tropical cyclones but an increase in stronger storms (Knutson, 2010;Murakami et al., 2011). The projections for changes in the number of tropical cyclones range from \u22126 to \u221234% globally, with increases in mean tropical cyclone global wind speed ranging between 2 to 11% (Knutson, 2010). Worldwide, there are annually about 90 tropical cyclones and they are not distributed equally among the various basins (Frank and Young, 2007). There is a decrease trend for Atlantic hurricanes but an increase trend for tropical cyclone activity over the Western North Pacific (Landsea et al., 1996). According to \"Unisys Weather\", nearly half of worldwide events are occurring in Western Pacific Ocean. While about one-fifth of these tropical cyclones make landfall yearly with the intensity of a hurricane (defined by wind speeds \u2265 33 ms \u22121 ), Vietnam gets from two to six land-falling ones with different categories but huge coastal impacts are caused largely by this significant subcategory of storms (Weinkle et al., 2012). There is a significant increase in the frequency for the strongest tropical cyclones (categories 4 and 5) in the western Pacific over the last three decades noticed (Webster et al., 2005). However, there is significantly greater uncertainty with respect to how tropical cyclone activity will differ among regions. Still, not all ocean basins may experience an increase in tropical cyclone intensity. Uncertainties in model projections of future tropical cyclone activity are inevitable (Brown et al. 2007;Butler et al. 2012). These uncertainties arise due to uncertainties in \"how the large-scale tropical climate will change and uncertainties in the implications of these changes for tropical cyclone activity\" (Knutson, 2010). Besides, the poor knowledge of the hurricane characteristics (track, wind speed, forward speed, etc.) and physical parameters and inputs such as bottom friction and bathymetry are important factors that contribute to the difficulties of an accurate projection (Thomas, 2015). These uncertainties need to be addressed to increase confidence in regional and global tropical cyclone projections The more intense tropical storms are, the more extreme the storm surges they produce. Severe storm surges are becoming a global hazard, affecting low-lying coastlines and their communities all over the world. As huge risks, the tropical storm surges cause coastal inundation which in turns result in a large number of deaths and economic loss for coastal countries. For instance, the Bhola cyclone surge, which made landfall in Bangladesh in November of 1970, caused between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths (Murty et al., 1986 (Clark, 2009). Again, in 2013, the Haiyan Typhoon caused over 6,000 deaths in Philippines (H\u00f6llt et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Land subsidence", "text": "Enhanced land subsidence together with increased rates of SLR will further strengthen tropical cyclone flooding. Rapid subsidence is common along populated deltaic and coastal plain systems, owing to exploitation of groundwater, oil and gas, and reductions in fluvial sediment supply (Woodruff et al., 2013). Human-induced land subsidence rates were recorded exceeding an average of 1 cm yr \u22121 in such megacities as Tokyo, Japan (5 m of subsidence from 1930 to 1995); Osaka, Japan (2.8 m from 1935 to 1995); Tianjin, China and Manila, Philippines (>1 m of subsidence among 1991 and 2003) (Nicholls, 1995& Rodolfo, 2006. It is estimated that by 2100 half of Shanghai being flooded by extreme storm-water levels due to additional land subsidence along the Yangtze River delta plus a 4.3 m projected relative rise in sea level (Rodolfo, 2006 "}, {"section_title": "Coastal Flooding", "text": "Today, coastal flooding due to sea-level rise combined with storm surge and shoreline subsidence is severely influencing coastal communities. In all the regions they affect, tropical storms are usually the primary factor that can cause devastating coastal floods. Once big tropical storms come further in-land, they bring along strong wind, heavy rainfall, and extreme storm surges, which cause a large-scale coastal inundation. Coastal population are becoming more prone to extreme flooding from tropical cyclones (Peduzzi et al., 2012). Coastal flooding related to land-falling tropical cyclones depends mainly on two factors: the likelihood of tropical cyclone occurrence and relative sea level (Woodruff et al., 2013). Therefore, accurate predictions of future flood risk must take two factors together into consideration. Many studies have suggested that coastal water levels are comparable to storms with SLRs. Instead of different SLR rates, storm intensity, and time among studies, the overall agreement is an increase in future flood levels. Besides, regardless of uncertainty in projections of tropical cyclones, future coastal flooding from tropical cyclones is expected to increase because of accelerated sea level rise (Woodruff et al., 2013). Vietnam is becoming more vulnerable to the impact of changing climate and frequent disasters, namely flooding, owing to its geographical location and long densely populated coastline. Every year, Vietnam suffers directly from 6 to 10 storms and tropical depressions often occurring from June to November (Razafindrabe et al., 2014). the country were caused by the 1999 floods, which killed some 750 people (Clark, 2009) and resulted in a damage worth of more than 3,773 billion VND (approx. US $194 million); whereas, typhoons Xangsane and Durian both left at least 70 dead in 2006 (Clark, 2009). Instead, Ketsana 2009 was considered as the worst disaster to hit the central region of Vietnam. It left 163 people dead and 11 people missing and led to an economic loss evaluated at US $785 million. More than 17,000 houses were devastated and about 4,000 classrooms scratched. There were 10 provinces affected and some 200,000 hectares of cropland destroyed (Clark, 2009). As a result, flooding remains one of the major waterrelated disaster risks in Vietnam."}, {"section_title": "Vertical uncertainty in elevation-based SLR assessment", "text": "Over the last three decades, there have been many studies conducted on the effects of sea level rise using the elevation data, most often in the form of digital elevation models (DEMs) (Dasgupta et al., 2009(Dasgupta et al., , 2011Hereher, 2010;Neumann et al., 2010;Lichter et al., 2011;Nicholls et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2011;Curtis and Schneider, 2011). However, elevation data are identified as the main source of uncertainty due to varied measuring techniques, measuring methods and the different technologies. It is much more uncertain for elevation-based sea level rise assessment when it is combined with other variable sources including \"water-level data (from long-term tide gages), the mathematically modeled tidal datum to which water levels are referenced vertically, and sea level trends or projections\" (Gesch, 2013). Despite the fact, insufficient studies have scrutinized the effects of elevation uncertainty on the sea level rise assessment. Usually, it is easy and simple to map the water level on a coastal DEM to identify the vulnerability of land and its consistent resources; however, the reliable findings and the usefulness of the elevationbased assessment will be suspicious due to the uncertainty of the coastal topography mapped (Gesch, 2013). Therefore, some recent studies have emphasized the importance in the qualities of underlying DEMs as well as the understanding and properly applying of those DEMs in impact assessment of climate change (NOAA, 2010;Gesch, 2009;Gesch et al., 2009). There are few ways to deal with the vertical uncertainty on elevation-based sea level rise vulnerability analysis. For different errors, there are different ways. Particularly, \"the uncertainty in sea level trend or projections can be handled by mapping and analyzing a range of increased water levels that result from climate model simulations\" as was done in IPCC assessment report (Gesch, 2013). The error associated with water-level data could be lessened if \"the local water level information can be included\" (Marbaix and Nicholls, 2007;Poulter and Halpin, 2007 as cited in Gesch, 2013). For detailed sea-level rise assessment, Leatherman (2001) suggested, \"DEMs should be referenced to the mean high water (MHW) datum to distinguish the areas occasionally inundated by tides (as cited in Gesch, 2013). Some other studies employ varied high-resolution datasets to compare or calculate the standard errors for accuracy assessment (Gesch, 2014). Besides, it is well known that elevation errors are best controlled using a geospatial model named regressionkriging and sequential Gaussian simulation in ArcGIS. These tools allow the consideration of spatial correlation in elevation errors, \"which has a significant impact on spatialinteraction analyses, such as inundation modelling\" (Leon et al., 2014). In addition to the reliability of the MIKE 21 model, it is considered as the most accessible and applicable because it is spreading and training around the world. Presently, DHI has offices in more than 30 countries, where they are providing training at-site and online locally in the various native languages (DHI, 2016). In addition, they provide updated software and technical support. In Vietnam, MIKE 21 FM is widely used in modeling flooding inundation in the Central Institutions and even by JICA projects. Because of its popularity and reliability, I use MIKE 21 models to simulate the combined effect of a disaster chain of sea level rise and storm surge on a coastal area of Thua Thien Hue province in Central region of Vietnam for this paper."}, {"section_title": "Justification", "text": "The study aims to assess the vulnerability of population and infrastructure along   Thua Thien Hue position is in the monsoon tropical climate and it has distinct dry and wet seasons, with the annual average temperature of about 25 -26 0 C. During the dry season, the lengthy low rainfall causes salinity that badly affects agriculture, lagoon ecology and aquatic resources and interrupts ecosystems upstream. The wet season follows the dry one with very intense rainfall, which usually comes with typhoon, and storms and causes devastating floods. The highest rainfall on record measured in the Huong River Basin is 731 mm daily, 2.4 mm monthly and 5.9 mm annually (Ngu et al., 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Disaster context and their impacts in Thua Thien Hue", "text": "Thua Thien Hue Province has been repeatedly impacted by many types of water    implemented for Malaysia (Mah et al., 2011), or ArcGIS software only employed for coastal inundation due to sea level rise in Indonesia (Marfai & King, 2008). There are not many studies related to this topic for Vietnam. Searching for existing literature, I could find very few related studies done recently and most of them took advantage of ArcGIS software for their study methods. For instance, Isaac Boateng (2012) applied ArcGIS to assess the coastal vulnerability to climate change in Vietnam. Similarly, Nguyen & Woodroffe (2015) also integrated ArcGIS to determine the vulnerability to sea level rise in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Other studies also used ArcGIS to \"map impacts upon agriculture from extreme floods\" in Central Vietnam (Chau et al., 2013), or even ArcGIS raster model to simulate the flood in Perfume River Basin, Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam (Villegas, 2004). One study of storm surge impacts on population for Red River Delta in the North applied the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model used by the National Weather Service (NWS) to define the maximum surges (Neumann et al., 2012). Another study on climate change impact on flood hazard in the Mekong Delta used a 1D hydrodynamic model named MIKE 11 to simulate a flood event (Dinh et al., 2012). For some reason, it is hard to find any related studies in which they could use some applicable numerical models in their research methods. It seems that ArcGIS is more popular for the researchers to conduct their studies in Vietnam.

Spatial data are digital elevation model (DEM), XYZ elevation text files, bathymetry shape files, coastline digitalized shape file, and property shape files with value attributes (transportation infrastructure layers).

Most of the data sets are available in many different sources and they must be edited and preprocessed before they can be used as inputs for the hydrological modeling and for analysis using ArcGIS software. extracted and digitized from the topographic map contours with the scale of 1/10,000 (10K). The data later was calibrated with some observed elevation points by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to serve for a project named \"Building Disaster Resilient Societies in Central Region in Vietnam\". This data is also used to simulate and built flood hazard maps in other JICA projects ( Figure 15) The nearshore topography data ( Figure 15   The study evaluates the impacts of five SLR scenarios combined with or without four storm tracks for the central part of Vietnam. These SLR scenarios are applied in the study based on the range of SLR projected for the country (See Figure 3, 4, and 5 and because they fit in the RCP projections (IPCC, 2014). The fifth scenario is out of the range but still added into the analysis to determine the significant impacts. The net impacts of SLR is compared on the top of the storm surge and the local tidal water surface to estimate significant impacts with and without SLR scenarios. The first step of data collection involves the complex tasks of data researching, professional networking and traveling to Vietnam to obtain data. The data acquired includes different topographical (terrain) data, historical data and resource data. The step also takes in the creation, correction, standardization and formation of data to fit in the hydrodynamic model and study scope. The step employs ArcGIS tools to do the creation, transformation and projection of topographical data and resource data for the study.  Figure 18). The largest mesh is located at the east ocean boundary with a length of 3,427 m, the second larger mesh is the west near-shore area with the length of 960 m, the smaller is for the lagoon at the length of 820 m, and the smallest mesh is for in-land area with a length of 142 m.

The parameters for model calibration comprise the value of wind friction and those of the waves and tides. While testing the model trials, the wind friction value has been adjusted to reach desired results.     (Figure 8). The results show that in both cases the high tide simulation is close, except the peak. The differences between observed and simulated water level at the highest point is about 3 cm higher in the observed and the time when the peak in simulated model appears about three hours before the observed. The time when the maximum water levels appears is three hours separate while the storm's path is valid in every six hours, so there is not enough detail to review it.

The above-mentioned model results are manipulated and then overlaid with inventory ArcGIS layers including land area, hospital, school, and special infrastructure, road, rail road, and population. The simulation result shows that some inland areas are inundated because sea water level rises and spills into lagoon, and overflows onto the low-lying areas, causing flooding. Indeed, theses low-lying areas have relatively low ground level, ranging from 0.5 m to 2 m. Hence, when storm surges appear to be about 1.5 m, that the areas are flooded is reasonable. However, flooded duration is not very long, just a few hours, so the damages it causes are not very significant."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Impacts", "text": "The impacts caused by different SLR scenarios and storm surge scenarios are mapped and analyzed using ArcGIS tools. The result show that the simulated storm flood level in the study area increases significantly due to the rise in sea level that results in the dramatically increasing impact in higher sea level rise scenarios (Figure 34 and 35; Table   6, 7 and 8). There are great differences in total inundated area when the sea levels rise from 0 to 2 m. Although those jumps in the first scenarios of 0.25 m and 0.50 m across the different storm tracks and different datasets are not noticeably, the total inundated area incredibly increases in the 1 m and 2 m SLR scenarios, about 150% and 250% respectively. It seems that when the storm moving along the near-shore coast, it causes more impacts and more land inundated than the storm making land-falling does, but the difference is not very much significant. Comparing between two datasets, national data (10K) and global data (SRTM), the total inundated land area analyzed in 10K data increases from 100% to 150% more. Figure 34 and Table 7 show result of impacts analyzed in different simulated scenarios of coastal storm flooding, including the original Xangsane storm and the assumed land-falling storm in the study area with and without sea levels on the 10K dataset. If we compare the impacts caused by the two scenarios, original Xangsane storm and the one without SLR, we do not see the substantial difference except the railroad and the road inundated. While road effected by the Xangsane storm is about 69% more than the one by No SLR scenario, the railroad inundated is 855% more compared to the one caused No SLR scenario. It is accurate result since the Xangsane made landfalling into the south side of the province where the interstate highway, interstate railroad and train station located. The No SLR assumes the storm making landfalling into the city where there is no railroad at all. With SLR, the impacts on transportation infrastructure are increasing dramatically high. It is the highest increase for the railroad when 1,827% and 3,504% estimated increase in SLR of 1 m and 2 m comparing with the No SLR scenario. Almost 250% of impacted roads increased in SLR of 1 m and 390% increase in SLR of 2 m. Following are the hospital and school categories which also make the high rise reaching close to 300% in SLR of 1 m and 450% in SLR of 2 m. Land inundated and population impacted increase more than twice in SLR of 1 m and more than 3 times in SLR of 2 m.    Figure 35 below illustrate the impacts caused by the storm moving along the provincial near shore coast. The finding also displays that the transportation infrastructure is effected the most. Although the total road inundated is a weighty number (4,391.62 km) comparing to the total railroad impacted (52.12 km), the increase assessed for railroad is 400% in the SLR of 1 m and 700% for the 2 m, comparing to 180% and 270% for the impacted road in the SLR of 1 m and 2 m. In this scenario, school is impacted more in SLR 1 m and 2 m with 300% and 400% increase. The remaining categories have the same increase comparing with the above scenario, almost twice and 3 times in SLR of 1 m and 2 m for hospital, special infrastructure, land area, and population. The result is noticed when the storm's pathway is altered such that instead of making land, it moves along the provincial coast, it seems to affect more people and property even though it is not significant.  among varied SLR scenarios. Similarly, the biggest jump is for railroad impact when about 250% and more than 1,500% increase projected for SLR of 1 m and 2 m for both two storm surge scenarios. The second peak is for the hospital category. Compared with No SLR scenario, the hospital impact rises 150% and 700% in SLR of 1 m and 2 m in the case of storm making landfall and100% and 460% when storm moving along the near shore coast. The impact growth of remaining categories ranges from around 50% to 250% in SLR of 1 m and 2 m for both storm surge scenarios. Unlike the findings shown on national dataset (10K), the impact increase is just one third in SLR of 1 m but almost 5 or 6 times more than the one in No SLR scenario.       Comparing the inundation and the impacts between the two datasets, there are far more impacts and inundation shown on 10K dataset. The level of impact on 10K dataset is at least three times more than the one on SRTM (for population and special infrastructure) and at most 10 times more for railroad category. For other categories, they are almost four times influenced more in 10K dataset than in SRTM dataset (Figure 38). This reveals that there is a big difference of elevation between two datasets. In order to examine which dataset can give a more accurate result, I have to review the literature to see what other researches or studies have found about the global SRTM data. In several publications from United States Geological Survey (USGS) about the vertical accuracy assessment among different datasets, the outcomes show that SRTM dataset is less accurate than some others including the NED and ASTER GDEM (Gesch at all, 2012 and. Since it is extracted from schemes which collect the surface data \"without measuring ground elevations in the presence of buildings and vegetation canopies\", it has \"a positive elevation bias in built-up and forested areas\" (Gesch and others, 2014). Whereas, the national dataset 10K is calibrated with observed elevation points by JICA and is also used popularly to simulate and built flood hazard maps in many different national and international projects. Therefore, we better give more trust to the results analyzed on 10K dataset. The simulations are done again on both datasets without the storm surge to see how the impact increase without the storm surge but with the SLR. The SLR scenarios in this case are just 0.5 m, 1 m, and 2 m (Table 11, 12,and Figure 39,40). For both datasets, the percentage increase in railroad impact is still the highest. Comparing to the SLR of 0.5 m, the railroad impact rise almost 450% and 800% in SLR of 1 m and 2 m on 10K dataset. More significantly, it reaches the peak at 3,500% of impact increase in railroad for SLR of 2 m on 10K dataset. For 10K dataset, the impact increase on other categories is very stable for both SLR of 1 m and 2 m. Its increase ranges around 50% to 100% for SLR of 1 m and around 120% to 200% for SLR of 2 m. Differently, there is a large distance between SLR of 1 m and 2 m on SRTM dataset. Apart from the railroad impact, the other varies from 60% to 400% in SLR of 1 m and from 450% to 1,330% in SLR of 2 m. The impact increase percentage is four to ten times more in SLR of 2 m than 1 m.   In Figure 41 below, the analysis shows that with or without the storm surge the impact increase insignificantly. The impact can only rise dramatically with a certain sea level ( Figure 42).

The analysis displays that the scenario of No Storm Surge with SLR of 1 m can result in double or three times more impacts than the scenarios of No SLR with the two different storm path surges. For railroad impact, it can even cause 20 times more than the one with land-falling storm and five times more than the one with storm moving along the coast (Figure 42). In conclusion, the sea levels are the key factor that leads to flooding devastating impacts. The results comparing impacts caused by No SLR with a SLR of 1 m indicates that there is much greater loss in people and properties in the scenarios with sea level rise. With sea level rise of 1 m, the impact on transportation infrastructure is very significant, from 200% to 400% increase, especially the effect on all types of road, railroad and inundated land area. Roads always are heavily damaged across all scenarios. Since there is only one interstate railroad along the whole country and it is lowland elevation in the study area, the damage is not much for scenarios of low SLR. However, when sea level rises to a certain one, like 1 m or 2 m, the impact percentage increases considerably, even almost 2000% and 3500% for SLR of 1 m and 2 m with or without storm surge. For land area, building (school and hospital), and special infrastructure, the impact increase around 250% to 450% in SLR of 1 m and 2 m for national dataset and about 50% to 400% for SRTM dataset. There are some conclusions drawn from the analysis. While the road impact is highest the railroad impact percentage increases the most across all scenarios. Comparing between the scenarios of No SLR and No Storm Surge with SLR, the latter one really makes the greater impact. The scenarios of different storm surge paths without SLR do not make any significant increase in impact. That means the sea levels really enhance and accelerate the coastal flooding and cause much more impacts. Compared to the No SLR scenario, the impact increase trend is double and three times in SLR of 1 m and 2 m for national dataset but it is just half and even six times for SRTM dataset. So, the increase jump is not very high in SLR of 1 m but then it goes much higher in SLR of 2 m for SRTM dataset. The combined effect of storm surges and SLR certainly gives rise to the high risk of flooding in the research area (particularly in SLR of 1 m and 2 m). Based on the results of this study, we recommend several strategies for Thua Thien Hue area: "}]
