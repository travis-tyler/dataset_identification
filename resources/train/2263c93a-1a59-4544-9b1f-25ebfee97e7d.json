This study aimed to investigate the comparability of two amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) tracers as well as examine how age affects the discriminative properties of amyloid PET imaging. Methods Fifty-one healthy controls (HCs), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a European cohort were scanned with [11C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) and compared with an age-, sex-and disease severity-matched population of 51 HC, 72 MCI and 84 AD patients from a North American cohort who were scanned with [18F]Florbetapir.\nAn additional North American population of 246 HC, 342 MCI and 138 AD patients with a Florbetapir scan was split by age (55-75 vs 76-93 y) into groups matched for gender and disease severity. PET template-based analyses were used to quantify regional tracer uptake. Results The mean regional uptake patterns were similar and strong correlations were found between the two tracers across the regions of interest in HC (\u03c1=0.671, p=0.02), amyloidpositive MCI (\u03c1=0.902, p< 0.001) and AD patients (\u03c1= 0.853, p<0.001). The application of the Florbetapir cut-off point resulted in a higher proportion of amyloid-positive HC and a lower proportion of amyloid-positive AD patients in the older group (28 and 30 %, respectively) than in the younger group (19 and 20 %, respectively).

The use of positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid-specific radiotracers has enabled in vivo imaging of fibrillar A\u03b2 plaques;\n[11C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) was the first generation of these tracers [3] . The short half-life of [11C] (~20 min) led to the development of [18F] derivatives (half-life~110 min) [4] . The longer half-life of [18F] negates the need for on-site cyclotron and radiochemistry facilities, as [18 F ] tracers can be produced centrally and delivered to geographically dispersed sites, thus enabling their clinical use.\n[18F]Florbetapir (Florbetapir) was the first [18 F] radiotracer specific for A\u03b2 to receive approval from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2012) and the European Medicines Agency (2013) for assessing the presence of A\u03b2 pathology in individuals with cognitive decline. These advances in molecular imaging led to a proposed revision of the diagnostic criteria for AD, in which amyloid PET plays an important role [5] .\nAutopsy studies of individuals who were scanned prior to death using PIB or Florbetapir have confirmed that both radiotracers bind selectively to fibrillar A\u03b2 [6] [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, in vivo studies have demonstrated the comparability of these two amyloid radiotracers within the same patient population [10] [11] [12] ; however, it is uncertain how comparable PIB and Florbetapir are between different populations.\nThe ages of individuals who present to a memory clinic with cognitive deficits typically span a wide continuum and it is not yet completely clear what impact age has on the discriminative ability of amyloid imaging. It has been demonstrated that cognitively normal adults aged >60 years can possess pathological brain levels of fibrillar A\u03b2 (i.e. they are amyloid positive) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The number of amyloid-positive, cognitively normal individuals increases with age from~6 % of those aged between 55 and 60 years to >30 % of those aged 80 years or more [17] . It is imperative to understand whether these individuals are in a high-risk pre-AD state or are experiencing normal age-related brain changes. Additionally, much uncertainty still exists about the relative A\u03b2 loads of AD patients in different age groups. Most research arbitrarily splits patients into two subtypes based on a cut-off point at 65 years of age, namely early-onset and late-onset AD (EoAD and LoAD, respectively). Several post mortem studies have demonstrated significantly greater A\u03b2 burden in patients with EoAD than in those with LoAD [20] [21] [22] , but PET studies have failed to give consistent results [23] [24] [25] . It is clear that understanding the impact of age on amyloid PET results is an important issue, regardless of whether individuals present at an asymptomatic or advanced disease state.\nThe purpose of this investigation was, therefore, twofold: 1) to validate cross-radiotracer comparisons (PIB vs Florbetapir) in unrelated but matched patient populations and determine the comparability of amyloid PET data; and 2) to examine the distribution of amyloid-positive brain scans in different age groups, establish how age affects the discriminative power of amyloid PET imaging in those of advanced age (where >30 % of cognitively normal adults can be amyloid positive) and establish whether apolipoprotein \u03b54 (ApoE4) differentially mediates the A\u03b2 load in AD patients at different ages. To achieve these goals, data were used from two well-characterised data sets that have both clinical and amyloid PET data available.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.

The lack of a clear correlation, however, in the MCI amyloid-negative group probably reflects the extensive heterogeneity of the pathology in that specific group.\nDespite the significant correlation, Florbetapir performed less well at discriminating between HC and AD patients than PIB. Florbetapir binds less than PIB to fibrillar A\u03b2 in GM and has relatively more non-specific WM uptake on visual inspection, as previously reported by Wolk et al. [12] . Data from Landau et al. [11] also supports this, in that PIB displayed higher GM uptake than Florbetapir, although the two tracers exhibited comparable WM uptake. Florbetapir is also known, from animal studies, to have lipophilic metabolites that can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase the non-specific background signal in amyloid PET [37] , in comparison to PIB [3] . These factors fit with the current Florbetapir data in our study, since the GM range for Florbetapir uptake was much narrower than that for PIB. Moreover, the difference in the range of the two tracers becomes especially apparent in high SUVR values, where PIB displays a much wider range in comparison to Florbetapir, whereas in low SUVR values the ranges of the two tracers are similar (Fig. 2) . This difference in range has probably led to a steeper slope of the correlation between tracers in the AD and MCI amyloid-positive groups in comparison to the HC and MCI amyloid-negative groups.\nAs discussed above, the relatively higher non-specific WM uptake (and metabolites) of Florbetapir and, therefore, the greater spill over from WM into GM in comparison to PIB could have affected the effect size between HC and AD patients, despite the observed correlation. In the current study, no partial volume correction was applied to either the PIB or Florbetapir data in order to further illustrate the robust comparability between the two tracers regardless of their different characteristics. Nonetheless, in order to account for the spill over of non-specific WM binding to GM with Florbetapir we investigated the use of different reference regions, as the cerebellar GM reference used for the PIB data was sub-optimum for the Florbetapir data. A reference region containing partly WM (whole cerebellum) at least partly cancelled out the spill over from the highly variable non-specific WM binding of Florbetapir, resulting in reduced variability in the HC group and an increase in the effect size between HC and AD patients.\nNeocortical cut-off points for amyloid positivity were defined in order to examine the sensitivity and specificity of each tracer. The CCTXR cut-off point (1.42) and sensitivity/ specificity established here for PIB were comparable to values in the literature [16, 26, 38, 39] . Conversely, the cut-off point for Florbetapir (1.34) was higher than the range of previously published values (1.08-1.30) [17, [40] [41] [42] , although it was very close to the cut-off of the study that used a methodology similar to the current one (1.30) [41] . However, despite the difference in the absolute cut-off value, Florbetapir detected similar percentages of amyloid-positive HC and AD patients in a similar relatively young age group [17] . Moreover, use of the linear correlation between the two tracers in the HC group allowed us to show that the CCTXR cut-off point for PIB (1.42) could be converted to a Florbetapir cut-off point (1.32) with high agreement to the value derived from the independent ROC analysis of the Florbetapir data (1.34). Interestingly, we observed that although the cut-off value did not change significantly, there was a difference in the discriminative abilities of the two Florbetapir cut-off points (89/76 and 85/82, respectively), probably due to the smaller range of the Florbetapir values.\nThe large variance in the published cut-off points poses questions regarding the use of amyloid PET cut-offs in a clinical setting. Cut-off points are known to be sensitive to the specific tracer for which they were generated and the methodology implemented, further limiting the wide use of a single value. However because of the inherent problems with cut-off values, there have been recent efforts to standardise quantitative amyloid imaging measures on a centiloid scale (0-100) for all amyloid tracers ([11C] and [18 F] ). Such standardisation will enable different researchers using different amyloid PET tracers to compare their data more easily [43] , particularly when measuring treatment effects in clinical trials. Nonetheless, the combination of different amyloid PET tracers on the same scale has important caveats that are illustrated in this study. Although the tracers studied are comparable, their different inherent characteristics (non-specific WM binding, range of GM values, discriminative ability of the two tracers) limit their interchangeable use. Moreover, according to the original centiloid paper [43] , calibrating the values of different tracers onto a common scale is not lacking other limitations. As it is illustrated in that study, at least 25 individuals should have been scanned with both PIB as well as the other amyloid-specific tracers in an interval of less than 3 months in order for each centre to convert the values of the latter tracers into centiloids. Very few centres worldwide have such complimentary amyloid PET data. Although one of the goals of the centiloid project is to encourage centres that do have the data to make the scaling conversions possible from Bnon-standard^tracers available for all, the data for the nonstandard scaling conversions are, as yet, unavailable to the wider PET community.\nThe best discrimination between HC and AD patients among the investigated ROIs in our study was observed in the putamen. It is already known from presenilin-1 mutation carriers that A\u03b2 deposition in the striatum is an early phenomenon in the progression of autosomal-dominant AD [44] . However, it is believed that A\u03b2 accumulates in the striatum relatively late in the course of sporadic AD pathology [2, 45] . Our findings are supported by autopsy studies in which the presence of moderately frequent/frequent striatal plaques in the putamen was used to differentiate between the presence and absence of clinicopathological AD with a sensitivity and specificity above 85 % [46] and by a machine-learning amyloid PET study where the voxels with the highest feature weights for classification between HC and AD patients were located in the striatum [47] . Therefore, clinical assessment of subcortical structures for the presence of A\u03b2 pathology could be of great importance in early AD diagnosis.\nThe difference between the two geographically distinct recruitment cohorts (North American and European) in the total years of education exceeded 3 years in every disease group. The average educational attainment of the individuals in the North American cohort (ADNI) was high, equivalent to university graduate, whereas the average participant in the European cohort (DiMI) was equivalent to high-school graduate. It has already been shown that education affects the relationship between cognition and the pathological burden of AD [48] . While the mechanism for this phenomenon is not completely understood the differences in the populations from which participants are recruited should be taken into account as they could create discrepancies in the observed results.\nThe second objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of age on amyloid PET data from within the large ADNI population sample. The younger HCs had significantly less amyloid deposition than the older HCs only in the putamen, independently of their ApoE4 status, whereas no significant differences in deposition were observed in the composite neocortical region in younger or older HCs. The composite cortical uptake values, however, for the younger HCs appeared to be distinctly different for amyloid-positive and amyloidnegative subjects. Conversely, probably due to the agerelated accumulation of amyloid [49] , distribution in the older HCs was more likely to be unimodal, shifted to the amyloidpositive side, without any clear border between amyloidpositive and amyloid-negative individuals.\nAlthough most of the research investigating the role of age in the amyloid load of AD patients has focused on EoAD (onset at age <65 y) and LoAD (onset at age >65 y) [23] [24] [25] , we decided to investigate two groups of older patients in order to explore the effect of age on the amyloid load in a more elderly population. In our study, age had an independent effect on the amyloid load in diffuse cortical and subcortical ROIs; amyloid deposition was lower in the older AD patients than in the younger AD group (i.e., those aged <75 y). Differences between the age groups were also found in the distribution of amyloid in the composite cortical regions in AD patients. The distribution of amyloid in older patients was more likely to be a mixture of two normal distributions, with a clear distinction between amyloid-positive and amyloidnegative patients, whereas the distribution in younger AD patients was unimodal. When we investigated the true AD groups (high amyloid uptake), age related differences between groups were observed only in the putamen, where young AD patients showed significantly lower amyloid deposition in comparison to the older AD patients. This effect was observed in all diagnostic groups (HC, MCI, AD), supporting an important role of the striatum in the age-related accumulation of A\u03b2.\nAlthough a large number of studies have investigated the discriminative ability of amyloid imaging in individual cohorts, no other study to our knowledge has been designed to define and compare the additive value of amyloid imaging in the assessment of patients across different age groups. The results of this study illustrate the diminished sensitivity and specificity of the Florbetapir cut-off point in an advanced elderly population in comparison to that in younger individuals, when the clinical diagnosis was used as the gold standard, and particularly the NINCDS-ARDRA criteria [27] . The high number of amyloid-negative AD patients of advanced age in the ADNI population, however, poses questions regarding the diagnostic assessment of these patients, especially since recent studies have shown that these individuals do not tend to deteriorate neuropsychologically [50] , which probably indicates a population of patients who have been misdiagnosed as having typical AD. The amyloid-negative patients investigated here were more likely to be ApoE4 non-carriers and on the whole had inconclusive FDG-PET scans, due to diffuse non-specific reductions in FDG uptake. Overall, in these patients, two biomarkers and one genetic marker suggest that the cause of their dementia is unlikely to be related to AD pathology and, consequently, they might have been misdiagnosed. Conclusively, the incorporation of amyloid PET into the clinical assessment process could have led to reclassification of the amyloidnegative demented patients, for instance, as suspected nonamyloid-pathology dementia, which would have obvious therapeutic implications. The effect of reclassification of clinically diagnosed AD patients with the use of amyloid PET imaging was found especially evident in the elderly patient population (30 % amyloid negative), where an additional 10 % of demented patients would benefit in comparison to the group aged younger by an average of 10 years (20 % amyloid negative).\nThe independent positive effect of the ApoE4 allele on the amyloid load was significant in both HC and AD patients in every ROI except the hippocampus. This effect of ApoE4 on the amyloid load in healthy individuals is in line with previous publications [16, 51, 52] . Although the results in AD patients differ from those in some published studies [53] [54] [55] , they are consistent with others [56, 57] . The lack of an ApoE4 effect in the hippocampus could be associated with the paucity of neuritic plaques in this area [1, [58] [59] [60] , or the form of A\u03b2 that can be detected with the available PET amyloid tracers.\nIn summary, these results illustrate good correlation between two amyloid-specific radiotracers, Florbetapir and PIB, in detecting A\u03b2 deposition in unrelated, matched patient populations. The results suggest that these tracers are comparable, not only in the same participants but also across different cohorts, where different population characteristics and protocols apply. Nonetheless, the inherent characteristics of the tracers vary substantially (non-specific WM binding, range of GM values, discriminative ability of the two tracers), limiting the interchangeable use of the tracers in multicentre studies. Notwithstanding its limitations, this study also suggests that the role of amyloid PET imaging becomes increasingly important with increasing age in the diagnostic assessment of clinically impaired patients. This finding could lead to a dramatic decrease of the routine false AD diagnoses in very old patients suffering from memory complaints with important therapeutic implications.\nThe grantee organisation is the Northern California Institute for Research and Education, and the study is coordinated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study at the University of California, San Diego.
