[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "M easurements of sea surface temperature (SST) have been made for over 200 years. The first data in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS 1 ) are from the late 1700s. Observations were extremely sparse until the first international maritime meteorological conference in 1853, which began the data collection program we have today. 2,3 By 1855, the number of SST observations had increased from a few tens of reports per month to a few thousands. Seafarers originally made meteorological observations to aid efficient and safe navigation. More recently, observations have been collected and transmitted in real time for numerical weather prediction and storm warnings * Correspondence to: eck@noc.soton.ac.uk 1 National Oceanography Centre, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, UK 2 Met Office, Hadley Centre, FitzRoy Road, Exeter, EX1 3PB, UK DOI: 10.1002/wcc. 55 as part of the Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) Scheme. 4 Alongside the ship observations, moored buoy observations of SST become available in 1971, and measurements from surface drifters in 1978. ICOADS contains SST observations from a variety of other sources, including oceanographic and coastal data. Global gridded datasets of SST are available, the longest starting in 1850. [5][6][7][8][9] Early observations were made by sampling the temperature of water collected in buckets. The recorded SST will vary with the type and size of the bucket and the procedure used to make the measurement. The importance of consistency was recognized and the 1853 conference recommended the use of a common 'abstract log' for recording observations and the use of wooden buckets to measure water temperature. 10 Unfortunately a wide variety of types of bucket, thermometer, and observing practice have been in use. 11,12 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognized the importance of recording methods of measurement and in 1955 introduced their Publication No. 47, a metadata catalogue for ships participating in the VOS Scheme (known as Pub. 47, see Refs 13,14). Methods of SST measurement can also now be transmitted as part of real-time reports. Comparisons are difficult as each of the measurement methods has different characteristics and biases. To homogenize the SST record requires detailed information on measurement methods and platforms, observation practice, and environmental information. This article reviews the progress that has been made toward gathering the metadata required to identify the methods and practices used, the characterization of biases in data of different types, the development of models of biases, and the construction of bias-adjusted SST datasets that include estimates of uncertainty due to the biases."}, {"section_title": "METHODS OF MEASUREMENT", "text": "What is known as SST is loosely understood as referring to measurements made at a variety of depths in typically the top 20 m of the ocean. Observations of SST will contain biases which depend on the measurement method; these are summarized below. In addition, the surface temperature record will contain variability related to real changes in the surface layer of the ocean. Examples include any diurnal variability that occurs as a result of solar heating when wind speeds are too low to mix the surface waters [15][16][17][18] or intense rainfall. 19 Knowledge of the time of day, depth of measurement, and conditions in the preceding hours can therefore help to reconcile temperature observations, although none of the global SST datasets currently available apply such adjustments. The implicit assumption is that the sampling of conditions is regular enough that no regional or time-varying bias is introduced into the datasets by neglecting such effects. Attempts have been made to hone the definition of ocean surface temperatures by stating the depth of the measurement and introducing the concept of 'foundation temperature' as 'the temperature of the water column free of diurnal temperature variability' and is the temperature from which the growth of any diurnal thermocline develops each day. 20 Although a useful concept, it requires calculation from existing in situ and satellite measurements of temperature using mixed layer models, and few systems can actually measure the foundation temperature. 21 "}, {"section_title": "Ships: bucket measurements", "text": "Water samples in buckets are likely to lose heat as the sea surface is typically warmer than the air above it. The exchange of heat between the water sample and the atmosphere will depend on the bucket (e.g., the material it is constructed from, its volume, surface area, and whether it has a lid) and ambient conditions (e.g., the temperature difference between the sample and the surrounding air, relative wind speed over the bucket, atmospheric humidity, and incident solar radiation). The temperature of the final measurement will also depend on how the observation is made (whether the bucket is allowed to equilibrate with the sea temperature-possibly involving taking an initial sample that is discarded-the time taken to haul the bucket, the initial temperature of the bucket, whether the sample is stirred, the time allowed for the thermometer to reach the water temperature, and the type of thermometer used). The depth of the sample may also vary with the size and speed of the ship, sea state, and wind speed. The earliest SST observations derive from wooden, canvas, and metal buckets 11 (Figure 1). Of these types, wooden buckets are relatively well insulated and tend to have larger volumes leading to smaller temperature changes (typically a reduced temperature as heat loss rather than heat gain is more usual). Models of corrections for wooden and uninsulated canvas buckets show the adjustments to be five to six times greater for the canvas buckets. 11 As the amount of heat loss from uninsulated buckets became recognized, national Meteorological Services began to issue insulated buckets to ships. 22 These were made from insulating materials, such as rubber, or used a double skin construction to allow a layer of sea water to surround the sample being measured. Comparisons have helped to identify the size of likely biases in observations made using buckets. A comprehensive study 24 compared 16,000 bucket and intake SSTs of various types. The overall intake-bucket difference was 0.3 \u00b1 1.3 \u2022 C, but larger differences thought to be related to the bucket measurement were found in winter, at high wind speeds, and for both uninsulated and insulated canvas buckets. Most national-type and specially designed buckets showed smaller differences. Buckets were also relatively cooler compared with intakes when there was precipitation and relatively warmer when there was fog. Buckets were more likely to be relatively cooler before midday and warmer after midday although there is no clear diurnal cycle in the differences. Measurements of water sample temperature in buckets in wind tunnels 25,26 and on ships 23,25,27 and comparisons of bucket and other SST observations 24,28 have shown the impact of environmental conditions and observing practice on bucket observations of SST. Attempts have been made to partition the biases by error source. 29,30 Measurements made for the purpose of comparing measurement methods typically show smaller biases than measurements made as part of routine observing schedules. [31][32][33] The evolution of the ocean surface temperature observing system is summarized in Figures 2 and  3, which indicate the platforms and measurement methods contributing to ICOADS over time."}, {"section_title": "Ships: engine room intake measurements", "text": "The earliest steam ships were constructed in the 1830s and by 1914 British steam ships made up well over half of the worlds tonnage. 36 On ships with engines, it was convenient to measure the temperature of the pumped seawater used to cool the engines. Early engine room intake (ERI) measurements may have been taken with a mercury thermometer in a well in the intake pipe or from a dial with temperature intervals of several degrees. The measurement would probably have been taken close to the engines rather than near the inlet. 31,37 Later systems are more likely to use electrical thermometers and some will include a dedicated sensor remote from the engine room giving a measurement closer to the inlet. Biases in ERI measurements are dependent on the details of the system and include fouling, poor exposure of the thermometer in the pipe, air pockets in the thermometer well, flow rate of the pumped system, heat conduction along thermometer and supports, length and insulation of pipe, and the difficulty of reading the scale including parallax errors. 37,38 There are no details of the calibration of ERI thermometers in the literature. The inlet must also be deep enough to be submerged at all loadings and in all weathers. Inlet depth varies by ship type and size: small vessels such as trawlers or research vessels typically measure at 1-3 m, container ships and bulk carriers typically at 7-11 m, and very large ships at even greater depths. 13 Most studies of biases in ERI measurements show that ERI SSTs are warmer than bucket SSTs. 12,24,37,39,40 Warm biases relative to bucket measurements were smallest for precision thermometers and thermistors, shallow intakes, and thermometers located close to the inlet. 24 Large warm biases were shown for mercury and 'other' thermometers, deep inlets, and thermometers positioned far from the inlet. Any cool bias relative to surface measurements that might be expected from measurement at depth is masked by the tendency to see larger warm biases on larger ships with deeper intakes. 24 There are considerable regional variations in measurement depth for those observations in ICOADS between 1995 and 2004 which have Pub. 47 measurement depths. 13 The size of any bias in ERI measurements is therefore dependent on details of the measurement system that are usually unknown and must be estimated from the data themselves."}, {"section_title": "Ships: other methods", "text": "SST measurement method metadata in WMO Pub. 47 includes categories for hull contact and through-hull sensors, trailing thermistor, radiation thermometer, and bait tank thermometer. Of these, only the hull sensors are commonly in use by VOS, and only in recent periods. 13 Hull sensors were found to provide more consistent SST measurements than ERIs and their use was recommended. 28 A further evaluation is now needed as hull sensor measurements now make up nearly a quarter of ship observations. Some underway measurements from research vessels are also incorporated into ICOADS further adding to the diversity of measurement methods. ICOADS also contains observations of SST from oceanographic profiles from profiling instruments of various kinds and from bottle samples. Near-surface observations from the World Ocean Database 41 are sampled and provide an additional 5-10% to the traditional ship-based observations in the period 1940-2005. ICOADS SSTs from oceanographic and non-oceanographic ships do show some differences 10 and further comparisons are needed. "}, {"section_title": "Moored buoys", "text": "The first moored buoy observations of SST become available in ICOADS in 1971. With the exception of the tropical arrays, [42][43][44] the moorings are largely coastal and most are around the US coasts. Comparison of SST sensors on three pairs of nearby buoys deployed by the US National Data Buoy Centre (NDBC) showed offsets and random variations of a few tenths \u2022 C. 45 Recent moored buoy observations show similar random variations. 46 Moored buoy SST data provide a continuous series of observations at a single location and are potentially of higher quality than other components of the in situ observing system because of an annual maintenance and (re-)calibration schedule. However, reliance on data from a single sensor and platform means that identification of any biases or drifts is critical. Changes in buoy hull types, payloads, sensor types, and locations are not currently well documented for the historical record. 47 The availability of such metadata would improve the utility of the moored buoy SST record for climate change detection and research."}, {"section_title": "Surface drifters", "text": "Surface drifter data, first available in 1978, are now the most numerous source of in situ SST. It must be noted that despite the large increase in observation numbers, driven partly by the high rate of observations from drifters, the proportion of 1 \u2022 areas sampled each month is now less than in the period 1965-1995. 4 Drifter design is now standardized, providing a more consistent means of measuring SST in situ, but before the early 1990s, a variety of designs were used. 48 Drifting buoy SST has been found on average to be biased cold relative to ship data by between 0.13 and 0.18 \u2022 C, [49][50][51] although regional differences are large and vary in sign. 51 Comparisons of SST measurements made with platinum temperature probes installed on 16 drifters with those from the normal type of thermistor showed thermistors outside the 0.1 \u2022 target accuracy in several deployments and examples of significant drifts. 52 As for moored buoys, improvements in metadata availability for drifters would be valuable. 47 "}, {"section_title": "Other methods", "text": "ICOADS also contains observations from coastal and island sites and also from fixed platforms such as oil rigs. The coastal SST data are usually excluded from marine datasets (and from Figure 2) as they are not thought to be representative of ocean values."}, {"section_title": "ASSIGNING OBSERVING METADATA TO OBSERVATIONS", "text": "Observations in ICOADS may have a flag indicating the method of SST measurement. The flag is usually reported with the measurements and may be more up-to-date than, e.g., the annually available Pub. 47 metadata. Problems with flags have, however, been found for certain periods and data sources. 53 Availability of such metadata depends on the data source and many data observations have no accompanying measurement method. Lack of metadata is an important contributor to the uncertainty in SST variations over time. Using metadata from a variety of sources (Figure 3) allows this uncertainty to be modeled. 35 In their analysis, metadata from flags in ICOADS is preferred when available. 35 For observations with no flag, the WMO Pub. 47 metadata was searched for a match. This matching is only possible after 1955 and is dependent on the presence of a valid ship callsign in ICOADS as Pub. 47 metadata is indexed by callsign. 13 When no other information was available, metadata was assigned using information about the recruiting country. 35 Each national fleet is issued with instruments and observing instructions by the national meteorological service and which vary from country to country and over time. For example, Pub. 47 indicates that almost all US-recruited ships report SST from ERIs and all Indian-recruited ships use buckets. The fleets of the United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany have all increased their use of ERIs over time. SST data with unknown method but known recruiting country can be assigned a measurement method probability that depends on the reporting preferences of the particular country. 35 Uncertainty in bias adjustments were then calculated from ensembles of realizations where observations with unknown metadata were randomly reassigned allowing for uncertainty in the assignment of metadata (e.g., due to ERI measurements being made when bucket observations were impractical 22,32 ). Varying schedules for switching from uninsulated canvas buckets to rubber buckets after the Second World War were also included in the ensembles. Metadata describing hull types, sensor types, and depths for moored and drifting buoys are presently not well integrated with the observational archive. 47 Assignment of metadata for drifting buoys may be complicated by the reissue of identification numbers after a buoy has ceased reporting."}, {"section_title": "SST BIAS ADJUSTMENT", "text": "Although biases in SST observations are well documented, the development of bias adjustments for gridded SST datasets is hampered by the difficulty in ascribing measurement methods described above. Even when measurement method is known, there are further uncertainties in the details of the instrumentation and measurement methodology. An analytical correction scheme for pre-1941 biases in wooden and uninsulated canvas bucket measurements has been developed. 11 The correction, which adjusts observations to the mix of measurement methods over the period , is based on models of heat and moisture transfers from the different types of bucket. Derivation of a correction from these models requires knowledge of the size of the buckets (inner diameter and initial water depth for the canvas bucket model and bucket wall thickness for the wooden bucket model), the time the bucket was exposed on deck, the relative wind speed (which depends on the ship speed, the true wind speed, and the degree of sheltering of the bucket), and the exposure of the bucket to solar radiation, all of which may vary from ship to ship and with time. A range of models was tested with different assumptions and the most important factors were the speed of the ship, which increases systematically over time, and the relative proportions of each bucket type. Information on the types of bucket used was sparse and a linear change in proportions was therefore estimated by optimizing agreement between corrected SST and night-time marine air temperature (NMAT) in the tropics. This suggested that wooden buckets were prevalent in the 1850s, when 70% of buckets were wooden, and went out of use by 1920. The correction varies over time and also geographically due to variations in air-sea temperature difference, humidity, and wind speed (Figure 4). It was noted that any change of the data mix, for example as more historical data are digitized, 54,55 will necessitate a re-evaluation of the corrections. The methodology 11 has been used in several datasets. 5,6,56 Estimates of bias uncertainty using this methodology have been calculated for the HadSST2-gridded monthly mean dataset. 5 The assumptions made in Ref 11 were reviewed and an ensemble of realizations of bias adjustment covering the likely range of uncertainty in the model assumptions generated. It was concluded that despite the coherence of the bias uncertainties, and the large regional values, the bias adjustments had only a modest effect on the uncertainties in global and hemispheric trends. An alternative methodology for SST bias adjustment for the prewar period is based on the assumption that air-sea interactions on large time-and space-scales were the same over historical periods as for the more recent period 1968-1997. 57 Adjustments were therefore required to account for known biases in NMAT. 56,58 It was assumed that any changes in magnitudes of SST-NMAT differences were due to measurement biases in the SST, and noted that this was an approximation. The average bias adjustments from this scheme are within 0.05  59 This adjustment method 57 has been used in global datasets. 8 The very data-sparse period around the Second World War has been particularly problematic for SST bias adjustment. Modifications to adjustments were required between 1939 and 1941 5 to account for the incorporation of then newly digitized data from the US merchant marine. 9 Global-average SST from HadSST2 filtered to reduce the impact of short-term variability shows a discontinuity in late 1945, which was the apparent result of uncorrected instrumental biases. 60 Before the step, the majority of observations in ICOADS were made by US ships using the relatively warm ERI method. After the step, the majority were made by British ships using relatively cold buckets. As expected, 11 successive releases of ICOADS 1,9,34,53,61,62 have shown different bias characteristics in this poorly sampled period due to the targeted recovery of data from the archives of different countries. 54,55 A wider need for bias adjustment for ship SST observations after 1941 was also recognized. 11,12,57,60 Since the 1950s, the relative number of bucket measurements has decreased, but an increasing number of drifting buoy observations since 1978 has mitigated any warm bias that this might have caused (Figures 2 and 3). The approach of Folland and Parker 11 was therefore extended to develop bias adjustments for the full period from 1850 onward, 35 accounting for biases in modern period ship-derived SST 11,12 and a cool bias in SST from drifters relative to that from ships. 49,52 The uncompensated inclusion of large numbers of drifting buoy data in global analyses is thought to have artificially reduced the observed rate of warming in global-average SST over the past 30 years. 35 "}, {"section_title": "COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA SOURCES", "text": "Anomalies in marine air temperatures (MAT) tend to be correlated with anomalies in SST over long space and time scales. Biases present in MAT measurements are largely independent from those in SST. Adjustments must be made to MAT for changes in ship size as larger ships measure relatively higher 56 and solar heating effects are reduced using analytic corrections 63,64 or by use of NMAT. 56 Although every effort has been made to keep SST and NMAT datasets independent, NMAT has been used to correct SST data and verify SST corrections. Localized problems during the 19th century and Second World War require the use of SST or daytime air temperatures to correct NMAT. 58 After 1900, NMAT and SST are independent to a large extent (and completely after 1941) and global and hemispheric averages exhibit similar behavior in this period. 56,65 Despite the SST measurement problems, the uncertainty in global land temperature exceeds that in SST, especially before the first World War, 66 as marine temperatures show much larger spatial and temporal coherence. This means that fewer observations are required to construct largescale temperature averages. There are indications that since 1980 the land-ocean temperature contrast may be increasing, possibly a consequence of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, changing atmospheric circulations or biases in the data. 66 Observations of SST have also been helpful in understanding and correcting biases in upper ocean temperature measurements resulting from errors in estimating the fall-rate of expendable probes used to measure ocean temperature profiles. 67,68 "}, {"section_title": "THE FUTURE OBSERVING SYSTEM", "text": "Improved methods of measuring SST, combined with a greater understanding of the causes of bias in different observation types, mean that the modern SSTobserving system is now of higher quality. in situ SST measurements are needed to provide calibration and validation for satellite SST retrievals, and the in situ observing system has been designed largely to meet this requirement 69,70 although other requirements such as consistency are also important. 71 The rapid evolution of the observing system, combined with a reduction in numbers of the more traditional shipbased observations 4 (Figure 2), means that improved characterizations of observations from drifting buoys, moored buoys, and ships are needed. 46,51,52 It is expected that more observations of SST will come from expanded use of research vessels, 72 profiling floats, 73 gliders, 74 and marine mammals, 75 which will help reconcile subsurface and near-surface temperature records. Ongoing characterization of observations is necessary to allow the construction of homogeneous datasets. 71 Careful comparisons of satellite and in situ SSTs are also needed to account for in situ biases and sampling differences that affect the validation of satellite retrievals of SST. 76,77 "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Biases in the in situ SST measurement system are increasingly being understood in terms of the methods used and the environmental conditions at the time of the observation. The importance of retaining observational metadata alongside observations is increasingly being recognized, and newly digitized data should include such information wherever possible. Observational biases have been identified in bucket measurements of SST, which depend on the details of the bucket construction, the ambient conditions, and how the observation is made. Biases tend to be toward cooler measurements and are particularly large when there are large air-sea temperature contrasts, dry conditions, or when the bucket is uninsulated and exposed to strong relative wind speeds. Engine intake measurements have a tendency to be warm, especially in the period before reliable remote reading thermometers could be installed near to the seawater inlet. Models of bias used to adjust observations to create more consistent long-term gridded SST datasets are hampered by lack of metadata and coincident information on environmental conditions. Bias adjustments must be re-evaluated when new or digitized data are added to the record. Despite this, gridded SST datasets that include bias adjustments and estimates of bias uncertainty are available starting from 1850, and uncertainties are small enough to allow determination of climate change. Improvements to the in situ SST record will come from digitization of new data and metadata in data-and metadata-sparse periods and regions. New measurements from satellites and drifting buoys have provided an improved understanding of variability in SST, especially diurnal variability and the impetus for improved models of diurnal variability. Datasets including diurnal variations are likely to be developed. Adjustments for these contributions to differences between SST measurements made in different ways and at different times become more important once the biases discussed in this article have been accounted for."}]
