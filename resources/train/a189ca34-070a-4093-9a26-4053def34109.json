Associated hazards vary from coastal erosion to complete destruction of the coastal regions that became highly developed in the 20 th century (Smith 2011). As coastal populations and economies grow in a changing climate, so does their exposure to natural forces. Consequently, coastal environments are becoming higher risk zones and the potential disturbance inflicted on local communities, ecosystems, and economies is a subject of great concern. According to United States Census Bureau 2016 data, in the United States alone, 94 million people live in coastal counties. This includes areas directly adjacent to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast regions account for 59.6 million of the entire United States coastal counties population. The population of coastline counties in the Gulf of Mexico region increased by more than 3 million people, or 24.5 percent between 2000 and 2016, the fastest growth among coastline regions. By comparison, the entire United States grew by 14.8% over the same period (U.S Census Bureau 2018). This is important because in North America, the Gulf Coast region is one of the primary targets for tropical storms and hurricanes, and the hazards related to them affect the regional gross domestic product (GDP) and cause injuries, fatalities, and associated psychological stresses )."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Motivation", "text": "In order to minimize the disruption of coastal communities by tropical cyclones it is of importance to study their complex behavior. Tropical storms can be formed by disturbances in the Trade winds, tropical waves, thunderstorm activity, low shear of horizontal winds, and sea surface temperature above 26.5\u00b0C. Dynamic and statistical weather models have successfully predicted the track and strength of hurricanes within the time scale of weather forecasting; however, uncertainties remain due to model resolution, parameters and the lack of data. While damage from a hurricane may be caused by wind, rain-induced flooding, and mudslides, history shows that storm tides have resulted in the most devastation and greatest number of fatalities (Fitzpatrick 2014). Storm surge being one of the most dangerous natural hazards, it is important to examine the effect of sea-level rise on storm surge induced flooding. The effects of potential sea-level rise on the communities in the Gulf Coast region need to be considered. The combined influence of increase in weather extremes and sea level rise will thus likely impact the local communities in the future."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The main purpose of this study is to perform a geospatial analysis of hurricane flood hazard zones caused by storm-tides along the Texas coast. Overall, this study's objectives are to construct spatial models of local tropical cyclone frequency and intensity and evaluate the impact of sea-level rise and storm surges on local communities by combining a range of sea-level rise scenarios with the potential maximum storm surge levels."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The statement by Stephen Wheeler and Timothy Beatley (2014)          Figure 1-7 displays an increasing trend of hurricanes Category 3 and higher across four basins from 1850's to 2010's. The increasing rate of major hurricanes overtime is only found to be statistically significant for the Atlantic Basin (r 2 = 0.616, p-value < 0.001). For the other three basins the linear model explains less than 14% of the variance in number of hurricanes. Observed upward trend for hurricane events has been attributed to the current change in climate and is addressed in the next section. The increasing rates of tropical storms, however, have been linked to limited historical data. average SST risen 0.41 o C in the Atlantic, 0.65 o C in the Indian and 0.31 o C in the Pacific Ocean (IPCC 2013). Even small changes in sea surface temperature increases the thermodynamic potential for hurricanes and therefore lead to more destructive storm events (Emanual 1987). These findings agree with Elsner et al., who found a 30-year trend of Atlantic tropical cyclone intensification due to warming ocean temperatures (Elsner et al. 2008). As discussed above, negative trend in hurricane frequencies for the United States and Texas derived from HURDAT2 dataset can be explained by recent 15 numerical and statistical simulations that project a poleward shift of the tropical cyclone tracks (Bloemendaal et al. 2020). Increased rainfall by incline in the tropical storm intensity will likely result in severe flooding. Knutson et al. (2019) demonstrate that there is at least medium to high confidence that a 2 o C global warming will increase global tropical cyclone precipitation rates. Another major effect of climate change on tropical storm activity is sea level rise. According to Knutson et al. (2019), the most confident change in impacts of tropical cyclones is the higher storm surge inundation due to global warming induced sea level rise. With all of this in mind, hurricane flood hazards become a great concern. In further chapters we explore the effect of higher sea level on storm surge inundation and assess the potential impacts of storm surge under these conditions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In this chapter, we present a spatial approach for assessing hurricane flood hazards. The first section of this chapter documents data used in this study. The second section describes the development of spatial models for hurricane hazards analysis. Observations for tropical cyclones have been gathered from historical and instrumental records such as satellites, radar, weather buoys, and aircrafts. Historical observations were reported when tropical cyclones were directly encountered by ships or when they made landfall in populated places (Keim and Muller 2009). First reconnaissance aircraft mission was accomplished by Joseph P. Duckworth and Ralph O'Hair on July 27, 1943. Since then hurricane reconnaissance by aircraft has become routine, and today it is one of the most important tools for determining hurricane position and characteristics. However, the most important technological advance in storm monitoring and forecasting did not occur until 1966. This is because it was not until 1966 that the first completely operational weather satellite was launched into orbit. This satellite orbited over the poles at low altitude and took pictures of the Atlantic basin once a day (Elsner and Kara 1999). Remote sensing data and more sophisticated aircraft and marine instruments improved the reliability of the tropical cyclone records since the 1970s. Other advances in tropical storm forecasting included the use of ocean data buoys starting in 1970's and deployment of Doppler radar in the 1990's. Needless to say, the spatial density and accuracy of tropical cyclone observations is steadily increasing today due to technological innovations and the need for more accurate hurricane forecasting. Several meteorological organizations around the world record raw tropical cyclone data which is then carefully analyzed by meteorologists to produce \"best-track\" data. Tropical cyclone data used in this chapter came from several sources described below. In the United States, the storm track data for every six hours is collected and reported by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), a division of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). After the storm moves out of the forecast area or dissipates, the NHC conducts a post storm reanalysis of each tropical storm and produces the \"best-track\" data. In 2000, NHC began a program called Atlantic Hurricane Before a spatial grid can be constructed and distributed with tropical storm parameters, raw hurricane data need to be analyzed and processed. TC-OBS data has cyclone observations 1 hour apart, while IBTrACS track data is 3 hours apart. HURDAT2 \"best-track\" data consists of cyclone observations in 6-hour intervals. These inconsistencies present a challenge for integrating the three datasets into one, and in addition, in their raw format HURDAT2 and IBTrACS track data are not resolved enough for spatial analysis and modeling. In order to address this challenge a piecewise polynomial function was used to interpolate the track observations to 1 hour (Jagger and Elsner 2006). This way the three datasets can easily be integrated to provide high resolution attributes for hurricane tracks. After integration is complete, hurricane attributes can be aggregated for each grid cell. For hazards analysis, maximum wind speed and number of observed cyclones are obtained within each hexagon. The assumption here is that the maximum wind speed within the hexagons will likely depend on the number of cyclones that crossed that region. This hypothesis can be tested by computing Pearson's product-momentum correlation coefficient for the two variables. The result reveals that there is a significant positive association (r = 0.8). More importantly, using this information we can now construct a composite score of the two variables representing an average degree of hurricane hazards for local coastal areas."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The results of this assessment are presented in the Figures 2-1 \nThe rates of sea-level rise in Texas have been higher than in most other coastal states in the US and between 0 in and 0.35 in per year (NOAA 2020). Galveston Pier 21 station (number: 8771450) has 105 years of observations and the longest water level record in the Gulf of Mexico. At this location the relative sea-level trend is 0.26 in/year with a 95% confidence interval of +/-8.7x10 -3 in/year (Figure 3-4a). This is based on monthly mean sea-level data from 1904 to 2018 and is equivalent to a change of 2.14 feet in 100 years.   Storm tides caused by hurricanes pose the greatest risk to life and property. They can reach heights over 20 feet, travel several miles inland, and inundate hundreds of miles of coastline (NOAA 2020). Discussed earlier SLR trends and projections in Galveston, TX have the potential to make Harris County even more vulnerable to flooding by storm tides. Associated with climate change, projected increase in average tropical cyclone intensity could also contribute to elevated risk to storm tides in the future. According to Knutson et al. (2019), out of the various effects on storm surge, estimates of the magnitude and rates of future sea level rise most definitely expected to lead to higher average storm surge inundation in the 21 st century. Therefore, social and economic consequences for low-lying and densely populated region of Harris County can be significant. Several studies explored cumulative effects of sea-level rise and the changes in future tropical cyclone climate on storm surge risk (McInnes et al. 2003;Lin et al. 2012;Little et al. 2015;Garner et al. 2017;McInnes et al. 2014). While the increased storm surge inundation due to rising seas have been confirmed, the effect of the change in tropical cyclone activity remains uncertain and requires more research (Woodruff et al. 2013).  Neumann et al. (2009) states that higher sea level provides storm surges with a higher \"launch point\", which may increase both the real extent and the depth of the surge. There are three prevailing methods for estimating the combined effect of sealevel change and storm surge flooding: numerical simulation that incorporates of SLR into a numerical model; a more linear approach that estimate the surge magnitude by superimposing SLR to storm surge heights; and a third method that considers quasilinear interaction between storm surge and SLR (Zhang et al. 2013). The later approach neglects the strong non-linear interaction between storm surge and sea-level that occurs in shallow waters. In addition, calculation of surge heights adjacent to current inundation area becomes problematic. Because of this, linear addition by expansion has been employed to address these uncertainties. It is a more advanced linear superimposition method that accounts for spatial variability and provides the inundation area next to the current boundaries. Zhang et al. (2013) employs all three methods and compares them. The results show that there is a strong non-linear interaction between sea-level magnitude and storm surge heights in the coastal areas with low continental shelf. Zhang and colleagues also demonstrate that out of the three methods, simple linear addition tends to underestimate the flooded areas by 30% and water heights by 12%. Bilskie and Hagen (2016), developed a dynamic modeling framework to examine the effects of SLR on storm surge. The concept behind this framework is that as global and regional sea-levels continue to rise in the changing climate, they alter coastal morphology, tides and marshes. In turn, these topographic changes alter the path, pattern, and magnitude of storm surge flooding. This innovative approach has resulted in a major paradigm shift from static models such as of Zhang et al. (2013) to dynamic ones. Bilskie and Hagen applied this methodology to the Northern Gulf of Mexico under four SLR scenarios for the year 2100. The result showed that inundated area increased by 87% and peak storm surge heights by as much as 3 ft. In the next chapter we present a geospatial framework for incorporation of SLR into storm surge modeling that provides a high-resolution inundation surface of storm surge under elevated sea-level condition for Harris County by 2100.\n"}, {"section_title": "SEA-LEVEL CHANGE Introduction", "text": "Sea-level is affected by multiple physical processes with different temporal scales (Figure 3-1). On shorter time scales, sea-level changes due to solar, lunar and other planetary tides, wind and internal waves, swell, and storm surges and tides. On longer time scales, the sea level elevation is affected by changes in ocean currents (also referred as dynamic sea level change), calving of glacier and ice shelves, river discharge, thermal expansion or contraction, atmospheric pressure change, salinity contraction or expansion, and wind stress. On geologic time scales, sea-level varies due to tectonic, glacial, sedimentary and eustatic processes (Dolan and Lins 1985). In addition, sea-level is not uniform throughout the continents, and therefore regional and local variations also exist. In all, there are two factors that contribute to regional change in sea-level ( Figure   3-1). The first factor is the global change in sea level that is referred to as eustatic sea level change. Change by tectonic processes (e.g. change in ocean volume by plate tectonics) and climatic process (e.g. melting of glacier, ice sheets, and thermal expansion or contraction). The second factor in addition to the global change considers local tectonic processes and vertical displacement of land by riverine sediment deposits, coastal erosion, and local man-made disturbances by exploration of natural resources and is referred to as relative sea level (Klein and Nicholls 1998). This chapter mostly focuses on sea-level change confined to the study area. According to IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), regional sea-level is likely to experience a large deviation from the global mean in the 21 st century, with some places 26 having significantly higher rates of sea-level rise (Church et al. 2013). In fact, the sealevel rise rates in Texas have been higher than in most other coastal states in the United States. Sea-level changes in Texas are attributed to global sea-level change (due to melting of ice sheets and glaciers, eustatic rebounds and thermal expansion) and regional sea-level change e.g. linked to land subsidence by compaction of sediments and groundwater extraction. Glacial isostatic adjustment and sediment compaction have been estimated to add 7.9 x 10 -3 -7.9 x 10 -2 in/year to relative sea rise in Texas and similar regions (Kopp et al. 2016). Ground water and oil/gas extraction further contribute to cumulative relative sea level rise in this region (Eggleston and Pope 2013). (RCP 8.5) scenario is one of the four trajectories into the future based on which we reach 8.5 W m -2 radiative forcing from greenhouse gases by 2100, hence its name RCP 8.5. By using statistical and numerical analysis scientists have been able to project future sea-level change using the data from these scenarios. Based on RCP8.5, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects the global sea-level to rise from 3 to 4 ft by 2100 (Church et al. 2013). However, IPCC projection is considered to be on the moderate side, as it does not account for acceleration in the melting of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (Zhang et al. 2013). Possible high-end GMSL rise under RCP 8.5 with accelerated ice-melt contributions have been estimated to be between 6 and 8 ft (Jevrejeva et al. 2014;Kopp et al. 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Model Description", "text": "Numerical models based on shallow water equations are employed for estimation of inundation due to storm tide. The SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) is a highly efficient hydrodynamic numerical model for simulating storm surge. It was developed in the early 1980's by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the National Weather Service (NWS) for real time forecasting of hurricane storm surges (Jelesnianski et al. 1992). Although more sophisticated higher resolution storm surge models have been developed since, SLOSH continues to be used for operational forecasting within the NWS. This is mostly due to its extreme efficiency as it takes less than two minutes for a storm simulation while incorporating the essential physics. To ensure its accuracy for real-time surge forecasting, SLOSH model has been validated against historical and synthetic hurricanes with different intensities, sizes, moving speeds, and forward direction (Jelesnianski et al. 1992). The SLOSH was developed as a two-dimensional (2D) finite difference code, which is also significantly reduces the time required for numerical computation. It is based on the 2D integrated shallow water equations and can be expressed using a Cartesian reference frame by The NHC uses SLOSH model for predicting storm surge heights. It has several products that range from forecasting surges for landfalling hurricanes to non-hurricane specific flooding that is used for long term planning and mitigation. For this study, it was most appropriate to use SLOSH data for non-hurricane specific flooding since the objective is to make projections for future sea-level scenarios. For that reason, the maximum of maximums envelopes of water (MOM) simulations were chosen. It is based on thousands of SLOSH simulations and used to produce the worst possible case scenario for a given hurricane category."}, {"section_title": "USGS offers elevation data from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) through their", "text": "National Elevation Dataset (NED). The highest seamless resolution, 1/3 arc-second, DEM was downloaded through USGS's National Map service. Ground spacing for this resolution is approximately 10 meters north/south, but variable east/west due to convergence of meridians with latitude. Sea-level rise data is available through NOAA's Office of Coastal Management. Projected future sea-level data can be obtained for 0 to 6 feet scenarios in 1-foot increments. 2, 4, and 6 feet scenarios were utilized for this study. In an effort to study the effect of future sea level rise on storm surge induced flooding in the Galveston basin, a geospatial model was executed to model four inundation surfaces for 0 (current conditions), 2, 4, and 6 ft sea-level rise scenarios. Highway System (NHS) datasets were added to the modeled storm surge surfaces.    "}, {"section_title": "Modeled", "text": ""}]
