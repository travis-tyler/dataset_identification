The authors reviewed the literature on use of voxel-based morphometry in brain MRI imaging research to examine the capabilities of this method for clearly identifying specific differences in patients with MCI and AD (and compared with healthy subjects). A technique of segmenting human brain MRI image into total gray matter (GM) and total white matter (WM) -Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed using VBM 5.1 toolbox and SPM5 in a Matlab environment. Images from (ADNI database) 15 AD and 15 MCI were used for investigation. The analysis revealed significant gray matter, white matter and CSF volume loss in the AD as compared with MCI patients. Quantitative analysis of %GM and %WM volumes can help in distinguishing atrophy of AD patterns from characteristics of the MCI.\nNeurodegeneration, Dementia diagnosis, brain MRI analysis, volumetric analysis.\nBrain atrophy measurement, volumes of gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid,Matlab,SPM,VBM."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease -Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive dementing disorder, which slowly deteriorates memory and thinking skills [1] . Since the incidence of the AD is strongly linked to the age, the AD is one of the major public health problems in countries with the longer life expectancy. According to recent estimates, as many as 2.4 million to 4.5 million Americans and 1.8 million Japanese have AD [1, 2] . AD is associated with the atrophy of gray matter in the cerebral cortex, which leads to a volume decrease of the cerebral cortex or a volume increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cerebral sulci and lateral ventricles (LVs), which can be measured in magnetic resonance (MR) images. In order to provide appropriate care for AD patients, it is very important to quantitatively evaluate the degree of the atrophy in the early stages of AD. Neuroradiologists attempt to estimate the degree of atrophy by capturing atrophic image features on MR images, but it is very difficult and time consuming in routine clinical practice. Therefore, a number of automated methods have been studied for identification of AD patients among the large number of patients with dementia [3, 4] ."}, {"section_title": "A.R.Yardi", "text": "Department of Electronics, Walchand College Of Engg, Sangli, Maharashtra, India.\nThe concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is thought to be a transitional phase between being cognitively normal and having an AD diagnosis. Patients with MCI have a higher risk of developing AD than elderly with normal cognitive function. The concept of MCI is rather difficult to describe since it is a very heterogeneous group. The diagnostic accuracy of the criteria today is low to moderate [5] . In recent years, a whole-brain unbiased objective technique, known as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), has been developed for characterizing differences in the local composition of brain tissue using MR images, and can objectively map the losses on a voxel-by-voxel basis [6] [7] [8] .Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). We selected subjects from MCI and AD categories.

Modulation refers to the procedure of multiplying the intensities in the spatially-normalised images by the Jacobian determinant of the transformation that map from coordinates in the template space to those in the original image. In the approach used here, subject images are 'backward-mapped' into the template space so as to give a seamless result. This involves considering where each voxel in the warped result in template space should be taken from in the individual source. If a particular structure is larger in the subject than the template, the transformation models the expansion of the template, and hence has |J| > 1. Similarly, the process of spatial normalisation geometrically shrinks the subject's structure down to the size of the template. By multiplying the intensities in the warped result by the determinant, the original structure's volume is preserved. Smoothing is used primarily to compensate for residual misregistration following spatial normalisation methods with limited flexibility. It is also necessary for statistical parametric mapping in order to improve the normality of the data smoothing acts as a matched-filter sensitising the analysis to a particular scale of effect. Result of VBM morphometry for one AD case fig.2 Original images were normalised to the customised template through affine and non-linear transformations, medium regularisation, reslicing 2x2x2 mm, and no masking. The normalised images were segmented into GM, WM, and CSF using the customized prior probability maps. The Xbrain routine, based on erosions and dilatations, was used to remove voxels of nonbrain tissue from the segmented images, thus obtaining a brain mask to clean the GM images. by intersection with the mask. In the modulation step, voxel values of the cleaned GM images were multiplied by the measure of relative volumes of warped and unwarped structures derived from the non-linear step of spatial normalisation (Jacobian determinant). The modulated GM images were smoothed with a 12 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel. The final output is a 3D matrix where the three indices are the spatial x, y, and z coordinates of voxels in the reference space, and each value of the matrix is proportional to the volume of GM within each voxel.

The means of obtained values are presented as in Tab. I. It reveals the fact that AD subjects exhibited the greatest atrophy, when compared to MCI. (Figure 4 , Tab. I).There are many choices available to a researcher for quantitative MRI of the brain. Discussion in the current article was exclusive to volume estimation, and pertained to the software and techniques familiar to the authors. We have provided sufficient information for volume estimation of three brain structures that are of particular interest in cognitive, clinical and comparative neuroscience network. Scatter plots of Fig.4 show statistical mapping results for comparison. Top left plot shows reduction in GM volume of AD patients as compared to MCI; similar are the cases in top left WM volume and bottom right CSF volume. Bottom right plot reveals the fact that whole brain volume of AD patients is reduced (atrophy increased) as compared to MCI patients' volumes. Though VBM has basic limitation of processing time because of large number of MR images series per subject, studies on brain with different MR techniques are important to be applied in the future on even larger database of AD, MCI subjects formed in the limit of possibility to please both, the objectives and the technical factors implicated in the study protocols.
