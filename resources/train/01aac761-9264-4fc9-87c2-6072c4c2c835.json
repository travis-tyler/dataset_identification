[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "\u014chi'a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) is the principle tree species in forests across the Hawaiian Islands and provides critical foraging and nesting habitat for native passerines. Rapid Ohia Death (ROD), caused by the vascular wilt fungus Ceratocystis lukuohia and the canker pathogen C. huliohia, was first detected in the Puna District of Hawaii Island in 2010. It affects all life stages of '\u014dhi'a and as of July 2018 had spread to an estimated 40,469 ha across Hawaii Island. To determine the impact of ROD on the forest bird community we conducted point counts in lowland '\u014dhi'a forest in 2016 and compared them to counts from 2003 to 2004, before the appearance of ROD. We found an increase in species diversity and a significant decrease in the densities of a native Hawaiian honeycreeper, the Hawaii Amakihi (Chlorodrepanus virens), and the nonnative Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus). Yellow-fronted Canary (Crithagra mozambica) and Saffron Finch (Sicalis flaveola), 2 nonnative passerines associated with the shrub layer and more open habitats, were only detected in 2016. Proportion of survey points occupied were comparable between survey periods, but relative abundances were generally lower. Hawaii Amakihi densities declined by 79% and Japanese White-eye densities declined by 33%. Our findings suggest that the loss of '\u014dhi'a canopy due primarily to ROD has adversely affected populations of native Hawaii Amakihi and nonnative Japanese White-eye, 2 of the most abundant species of lowland Hawaiian forests.\nLa mortalidad de \u00e1rboles a gran escala ocasionada por la Muerte R\u00e1pida de Ohia influencia negativamente la avifauna en la Puna baja, Isla de Haw\u00e1i, EEUU RESUMEN '\u014chi'a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) es la principal especie de \u00e1rbol en los bosques de las Islas de Haw\u00e1i y brinda h\u00e1bitat cr\u00edtico de forrajeo y de anidaci\u00f3n para los paserinos nativos. La Muerte R\u00e1pida de Ohia (ROD por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), causada por el hongo descomponedor vascular Ceratocystis lukuohia y el pat\u00f3geno del cancro C. huliohia, fue detectada por primera vez en el Distrito Puna de la Isla de Haw\u00e1i en 2010.

Para determinar el impacto de ROD en la comunidad de aves del bosque realizamos conteos en puntos en el bosque de '\u014dhi'a de tierras bajas en 2016 y los comparamos con conteos realizados entre 2003 y 2004, antes de la aparici\u00f3n de ROD. Encontramos un aumento en la diversidad de especies y una disminuci\u00f3n significativa en las densidades de un mielero hawaiano nativo, Chlorodrepanus virens, y de la especie no nativa Zosterops japonicus.

Within 50 yr, chestnut blight had killed off the once dominant American chestnut tree (Castanea dentata), dramatically changing the composition of eastern hardwood forests, but its impact on avian populations was largely ignored (Smith and Stephen 2005) . Following the decline of American elm (Ulmus americana) from Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), Kendeigh (1982) observed a transient increase in woodpecker species and a long-term trend in increased bird diversity favoring scrub species. In the last few decades, the continuing loss or decline of dominant forest tree species due to introduced pathogens or insect pests has resulted in significant changes in North American forest bird communities (Rabenold et al. 1998 , Stewart et al. 2014 , Buchanan et al. 2016 , Toenies et al. 2018 . Typically, early successional and shrub layer bird species move into impacted forests, temporarily increasing bird diversity while specialized canopy species decline or are extirpated (Toenies et al. 2018) .\n'\u014chi'a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), hereafter '\u014dhi'a, is the principal tree species in the Hawaiian Islands . '\u014chi'a is both a pioneer and foundation species of Hawaiian mesic and wet montane forests. Healthy, mature '\u014dhi'a forests are essential to maintain viable native forest bird populations in lowland to montane forests. Seasonal blooms of '\u014dhi'a flowers are a critical resource for nectarivorous Hawaiian honeycreepers (Carpenter and MacMillen 1976, Hart et al. 2011) , and '\u014dhi'a also provides an abundance of foliage-and barkinhabiting arthropod prey (Gruner 2004 , Peck et al. 2014 as well as cavity and open nesting sites.\nAlong with general habitat loss due to agriculture, residential development, and invasive feral ungulates, 2 main factors that cause large-scale mortality of '\u014dhi'a are '\u014dhi'a dieback (Mueller-Dombois et al. 2013) and Rapid Ohia Death (ROD) (Keith et al. 2015 , Mortenson et al. 2016 . '\u014chi'a dieback is the naturally occurring, successional pattern of large-scale synchronous thinning of the tree crown and defoliation, leading to the death of most mature trees (Mueller-Dombois 1980 , Jacobi 1983 , Mueller-Dombois et al. 2013 (Scott et al. 1986 ). Fortunately, as earlier life stages of the tree are unaffected, '\u014dhi'a forests typically recover to an extent determined by soil nutrient levels and invasive species . Extensive dieback of '\u014dhi'a forest was observed in the 1970s, but pollen records have shown that cycles of dieback and recovery have occurred over the last 10,000 yr. Decades of research have revealed that '\u014dhi'a dieback may be triggered by environmental factors such as soil nutrients, bog formation, and drought-flooding events but is not caused by an introduced biotic agent or disease (Mueller-Dombois et al. 2013) .\nUnlike '\u014dhi'a dieback, ROD is associated with 2 invasive pathogens, a vascular wilt fungus (Ceratocystis lukuohia) and a canker pathogen (C. huliohia), that infect all life stages of '\u014dhi'a (Barnes et al. 2018 ). While C. lukuohia can kill trees within weeks of the first signs of infection, C. huliohia is less virulent but still capable of causing mortality. Infections caused by both are locally described as Rapid Ohia Death because of similarities in symptomology (Keith et al. 2015 , Barnes et al. 2018 . The symptomology of ROD is a rapid and often asymmetrical leaf browning and wilting, followed by tree death within a matter of days or weeks ( Figure 1 ; Mortenson et al. 2016) . Since the earliest observations of ROD in the Puna District of Hawaii Island, these pathogens have spread across most of the island through the movement of contaminated wood, soil, and heavy equipment, bark rubbing by introduced feral ungulates, and possibly through windborne dispersal facilitated by ambrosia beetles that colonize dying trees (Mortenson et al. 2016) . Combined agency surveys conducted in September 2017 estimated that ROD has affected some 40,469 ha ( Figure 2 ), although density of infected and dead trees varies widely across the landscape with highest mortality and greatest canopy losses in the Puna District. In May 2018 ROD was reported on the Island of Kauai at the northwestern end of the archipelago and both pathogens appear to be involved in the outbreak (DLNR 2018a) . Although the ecological impacts of '\u014dhi'a dieback are well understood (Mueller-Dombois et al. 2013) , ROD is a new threat to '\u014dhi'a forests and its ecological impacts, such as consequences for birds, have not been examined.\nEndemic Hawaiian forest birds comprise one of the most endangered avifaunas in the world. In the last 2 centuries, habitat loss and degradation and the introduction of invasive pathogens, predators, and competitors led to the near complete extirpation of native forest birds from the lowlands of Hawaii Scott 2001, Banko and ). Two native passerines, the Hawaii Amakihi and Apapane, remain in the lowlands but occur primarily where '\u014dhi'a forests are still present (Spiegel et al. 2006 , Hart et al. 2011 . Surveys conducted between 1993 and 2004 indicated lowland Hawaii Amakihi populations had increased significantly (Reynolds et al. 2003 , Spiegel et al. 2006 , Hart et al. 2011 ) despite intense transmission of avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), a key limiting factor (Woodworth et al. 2005) . Field observations and laboratory experiments strongly suggested that the rebounding lowland population of Hawaii Amakihi was driven by an evolved physiological tolerance to avian malaria infection (Woodworth et al. 2005 , Foster et al. 2007 , Atkinson et al. 2013 ). Surveys of forest birds in the Puna lowlands have not been conducted since the advent of ROD in 2010 and, as the fate of Hawaiian forest birds is so intimately linked with that of ' \u014dhi'adominated forests , it is expected that the spread of ROD and the subsequent loss of ' \u014dhi'a will adversely affect remaining native bird populations and communities. Here we examine the possible impacts of ROD on forest birds, focusing on the most common native and nonnative species, the Hawaii Amakihi and Japanese White-eye. In 2016, we resurveyed the roadside stations sampled by Spiegel et al. (2006) in 2003-2004, recording standard Hawaiian point-transect bird data ), habitat classification (Jacobi 1989) , and the proportion of dead ' \u014dhi'a. We compared current bird relative abundance (birds per station) and absolute density (density of birds per hectare) to those reported by Spiegel et al. (2006) to determine if bird populations have changed in association with ROD-related ' \u014dhi'a mortality."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Site, Vegetation Measures, and '\u014chi'a Mortality", "text": "In May and June 2016, we surveyed ~26,000 ha in the lower Puna District of Hawaii Island (19.3833\u00b0N, 155.0833\u00b0W) along rural highways, secondary roads, and residential streets ( Figure 3A ). Land cover in the study area consists of coastal (hala [Pandanus tectorius], coconut [Cocos nucifera]) and mesic to wet, native ('\u014dhi'a) and nonnative (common ironwood [Casuarina equisetifolia], albizia [Falcataria moluccana]) dominated lowland forests, scrub and shrub/ grassland, and human dominated habitats. At each roadside station the vegetation within a 50-m radius was described using the Jacobi (1989) rapid assessment. This description included tree crown cover, tree height, tree species composition, and ground cover or understory type (Jacobi 1989) . Crown cover was estimated in the following 4 classes: closed canopy (>60% cover), open canopy (25-60% cover), scattered trees (5-25% cover), and very scattered trees (<5% cover, trees widely spaced). Tree canopy height was estimated in 3 classes: tall stature (>10 m), medium stature (5-10 m), and low stature (2-5 m). When the canopy was distinctly multilayered, the cover, height, and species composition was noted separately for individual scores. The proportion of dead '\u014dhi'a was estimated, in 5% intervals, for each quarter of the station. While it was beyond the scope of this study to confirm the presence of Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia, we assumed the cause of observed '\u014dhi'a mortality was ROD. We based this assumption on a spatially aligned comparison of our mortality findings to those recently reported by the U.S. Forest Service where fungus was confirmed from tree samples (Mortenson et al. 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Bird Surveys", "text": "We conducted bird counts using point-transect distance sampling methods along roads at 223 survey stations from May 23 to June 9, 2016 ( Figure 3A ). Location of the roadside stations was based on 3 different surveys conducted before the advent of ROD in Puna (David 1995 , Reynolds et al. 2003 , Spiegel et al. 2006 . Reynolds et al. (2003) conducted fixed-point counts in January and February 1994 at 11 stations spaced 3.2 km apart along the coastal road. David (1995) conducted point-transect sampling in April and July 1995 at 79 stations spaced 150 m apart along the southern half of the coastal road. Approximately 10 yr later, and also using point-transect distance sampling methods, Spiegel et al. (2006) surveyed 174 new stations spaced 700 m apart along multiple primary and secondary roads below 326 m elevation between February and June 2003 and resurveyed the previously established stations between February and April 2004. We resurveyed 223 sites from the 3 earlier studies excluding 35 stations along the coast and 7 stations that were no longer accessible. All stations were counted only once during the survey.\nWe sampled birds following standard point-transect sampling methodology, a form of distance sampling used in Hawaii to estimate forest bird populations over large areas (Scott et al. 1981a (Scott et al. , 1986 ). Nomenclature follows Chesser et al. (2018) . Observers received pre-survey training to calibrate for distance estimation and their ability to identify bird vocalizations, thereby reducing variability among observers and standardizing for local conditions (Kepler and Scott 1981) . Observers recorded the detection type (heard, seen, or heard then seen [birds that were initially detected aurally where their location was later confirmed visually]) and horizontal distance (exact distance in meters) from the station center point to individual birds detected during an 8-min count. Aurally detected birds were placed in the environment and the horizontal distance estimated to the reference point recorded, a method that improves distance measurements and yields reliable distance estimates (Scott et al. 1981b ). Since traffic can impede aural detection of distant birds and those species with soft songs and calls, we surveyed stations located on the busiest sections of roadways on the weekends. The heaviest traffic ranged from 6-10 vehicles per minute to 11-15 vehicles per minute. We assumed that other background noise such as lawn mowers, barking dogs, and ocean surf was consistent among the surveys.\nObservers also recorded start time, cloud cover, rain, wind and gust speed at each station. Sampling was typically conducted between dawn and 1130 hours and halted when rain, wind, or gust strength exceeded prescribed levels (light rain and wind and gust strength level 3 on the Beaufort scale)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical and Spatial Analysis", "text": "For each species detected during the 2003-2004 and 2016 surveys we computed an index of occurrence (proportion of stations where the species was detected) and relative abundance (total number of detections per station) without accounting for imperfect detection. Differences in occurrence were compared with a 2-proportion z-test using the proportion test function with a Yates continuity correction in R 3.4.1 (R Core Team 2017). Point-transect sampling procedures were applied to correct density estimates for the birds that were present but not detected (Buckland et al. 2015) . We produced detection-corrected, also called absolute, density estimates for 2 forest bird species (Hawaii Amakihi and Japanese White-eye) with sufficient detections to adequately characterize detectability (Buckland et al. 2001:241) . Insufficient numbers of Apapane were detected to reliably estimate densities. Species-specific density estimates were calculated from point-transect data using program DISTANCE 7.1, release 1 (Thomas et al. 2010) . Candidate detection function models were limited to half-normal and hazard-rate detection functions with expansion series of order 2 such that half-normal was paired with cosine and Hermite polynomial adjustments, and hazard rate was paired with cosine and simple polynomial adjustments (Buckland et al. 2001:361, 365 ).\nTo improve model precision, we incorporated sampling covariates in the multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) engine of DISTANCE (Thomas et al. 2010) . Potential covariates included cloud cover, rain, wind, gust strength, detection type (2 combinations: pooled detections of birds that were heard with birds that were heard then seen, and pooled detections of birds that were seen with birds that were heard then seen), time of detection, year of survey, and the presence/absence of '\u014dhi'a. All covariates were treated as a factor, except time of detection, which was treated as a continuous covariate. Each detectability model in the candidate set with and without covariates was fit to data pooled across surveys for each species, and the model selected was that with the lowest second-order Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AIC c ) (Buckland et al. 2001, Burnham and Anderson 2002) . Data were truncated at a distance where detection probability was <10%. For the 2016 dataset, Hawaii Amakihi were not detected within 17 m of station center-points, so 17 m was subtracted (truncated) from the Hawaii Amakihi distances thereby moving all detections closer to station center-points. This left truncation corrects for the lack of detections in the roadway but may result in an overestimate of density (DISTANCE 7.1 User's Manual; Buckland et al. 2001) . Species-and survey-specific densities were estimated from the most parsimonious model, and variances and confidence intervals were derived by bootstrap methods in DISTANCE from 999 iterations (Thomas et al. 2010) .\nDifferences between densities were assessed using 2-sample z-test incorporating equivalency tests to discern stable versus inconclusive results (Camp et al. 2008) . We chose conservative equivalence bounds equal to a 25% change in the population over 25 yr, or a \u22120.0119 and 0.0093 annual rate of change. We defined changes in population density as increasing, decreasing, negligible trend (i.e. stable population), or inconclusive. An ecologically meaningful difference occurred when the rate of change lay outside the equivalence region, whereas a negligible difference occurred when the rate of change lay within the equivalence region. An inconclusive result occurred when the sample size was insufficient to produce precise variation estimates.\nWe computed station-specific mortality by averaging the proportion of dead '\u014dhi'a within the 4 quadrats and assigned a mortality class based on the '\u014dhi'a mortality described in Mortenson et al. (2016) : no '\u014dhi'a mortality, noticeable (0.1-9.9% '\u014dhi'a dead), above expected (10-49.9% '\u014dhi'a dead), and high severity (\u226550% of '\u014dhi'a dead). To determine if bird densities have changed due to changes in habitat between the 2 surveys, we compared bird densities at stations with and without '\u014dhi'a present. Furthermore, to explore the relationship of bird abundance to '\u014dhi'a mortality, we fit a linear regression to the difference of birds counted between the 2 surveys to the proportion of dead '\u014dhi'a using only stations with '\u014dhi'a. Model diagnostics and residual analysis were performed to ensure homogeneity of variance and identify influential outliers.\nWe assessed changes in land cover classes between 2005 and 2010 using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) dataset of land cover change analysis for Hawaii Island (published January 22, 2015; available at https://coast. noaa.gov/ccapftp/). We subset the spatial extent of the C-CAP dataset to our survey area and queried the dataset to determine the amount of area that had been converted from forest and scrub/shrub to land use classes that are not suitable for forest birds. We also tallied the amount of area that had changed back to forest and scrub/shrub land cover classes. To determine if there had been changes in forest land cover classes subsequent to 2010 we visually inspected aerial photographs at 15 cm spatial resolution from January 31, 2012, to September 7, 2015, (Pictometry International, Henrietta, New York, USA) within a 50-m buffer of each survey station. We also report stationlevel change in land cover class from the C-CAP 2010 classification."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "During the 2003-2004 surveys 4,818 individuals of 15 species were detected. In the 2016 survey 3,415 individuals of 16 species were detected (Table 1) . Two nonnative passerines were detected in 2016 that were not detected in 2003-2004, Yellow-fronted Canary (Crithagra mozambica) and Saffron Finch (Sicalis flaveola). Conversely, the nonnative Ring-necked Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) was only detected during the initial survey. Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were present during both surveys but are not considered further. Additionally, a Japanese Bush-Warbler (Horornis diphone) was detected during the 2016 survey but outside the sampling period.\nIn general, the relative percent occurrences by species were comparable between the 2 survey periods, whereas species' relative abundances were generally lower during the subsequent survey than in the initial survey (Table 1) . Both indices for Hawaii Amakihi were lower in 2016 than in the earlier survey by 58% and 30%, respectively, for relative occurrence and abundance. Most noteworthy are the absences of Hawaii Amakihi during the 2016 survey along the coastal and lower-elevation interior roads ( Figure 3A) . Conversely, the relative occurrence and relative abundance of Japanese White-eye increased slightly between the 2 survey periods.\nWe selected species-specific truncation distances of 67.5 m for Hawaii Amakihi and 45.9 m for Japanese White-eye. For both species, a hazard-rate detection function model without adjustment terms was selected. The detection function for Hawaii Amakihi was improved by including a covariate for detection type (seen and heard then seen pooled; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D n = 0.03, P = 0.69; AIC c = 3665.23) while the Japanese White-eye detection function included the covariate year (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D n = 0.04, P < 0.001; AIC c = 19267.90; Appendix Table  3 and Appendix Figure 6 ). Hawaii Amakihi densities were significantly lower in 2016 (z-test = \u22123.47, P < 0.001, Equv H 01 = 3.29, P = 1.00, Equv H 02 = \u22123.62, P < 0.001). Densities declined by 79% from 3.7 birds ha \u22121 (95% CI: 2.3-5.3) to 0.8 birds ha \u22121 (95% CI: 0.4-1.2; Figure 4A ). Japanese Whiteeye densities also declined between the 2 periods from 31.3 birds ha \u22121 (95% CI: 26.2-35.8) to 21.0 birds ha \u22121 (95% CI: 17.9-23.4), a 33% reduction ( Figure 4B ; z-test = \u22123.56, P < 0.001, Equv H 01 = 3.50, P = 1.00, Equv H 02 = \u22123.60, P < 0.001).\nOf the 223 sampling stations surveyed in 2016, 57% (127 stations) had '\u014dhi'a trees present ( Figure 3B ). We observed snags and dead '\u014dhi'a in most quadrants where '\u014dhi'a was present. The proportion of dead '\u014dhi'a trees ranged from 0 to 92.5 (averaged across the 4 quadrants) with a mean of 24.8 (SD 23.6). The prevalence of '\u014dhi'a death, however, was not uniformly distributed across the Puna lowland study area but appeared concentrated near the central southwestern portion and to a lesser extent along the coast in the southwestern portion of the study area. This distribution of '\u014dhi'a death generally followed the distributional pattern of confirmed ROD mortality (compare to Figure 2 ).\nWe detected 76 Hawaii Amakihi at 42 stations ( Figure  3A) . The proportion of stations where Amakihi were observed in 2016 was significantly less (2-sample z-test; \u03c7 2 = 35.12, df = 1, P < 0.001) than in [2003] [2004] (Table 1) . Of those 42 stations at which Hawaii Amakihi were observed, 93% (39 stations) had '\u014dhi'a trees present. During the 2003-2004 survey Hawaii Amakihi had much higher densities at stations with '\u014dhi'a than at stations without '\u014dhi'a ( Table 2 ). The same pattern was observed in 2016, however bird densities had substantially declined, more so at stations with than without '\u014dhi'a. This is in contrast to Japanese White-eye that was observed at almost every station (99% or 220 of 223 stations) with no discernible difference in occurrence (Table 1 ; 2-sample z-test; \u03c7 2 = 1.90, df = 1, P = 0.17) or density between stations with or without '\u014dhi'a trees (125 of 127 stations with and 95 of 96 stations without '\u014dhi'a trees; Table 2 ).\nDiagnostics for species-specific models of bird counts regressed against '\u014dhi'a mortality indicated that there is slightly higher variance for high fitted values, although the residuals vs. fitted and q-q plots revealed no egregious problems with the homogeneity of variance assumption. The residuals vs. leverage plots did not reveal any points that have too large an impact on the regression coefficient. There was a significant decline in Hawaii Amakihi counts at stations with increasing '\u014dhi'a mortality (t-value = \u22123.66, df = 1, P < 0.001, intercept = \u22120.85 \u00b1 0.26, slope = \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.01, adjusted r 2 = 0.09; Figure 5A ). Counts were about 1 bird less at stations without '\u014dhi'a mortality in 2016 than they were in 2003-2004, and there were almost 4 fewer birds at stations with complete '\u014dhi'a mortality. Japanese White-eye abundance also declined with increasing '\u014dhi'a mortality between surveys. However, Japanese White-eye differences were minor and not significant, <1 bird at stations without '\u014dhi'a mortality while at stations with complete '\u014dhi'a mortality there were 2 fewer birds (t-value = \u22121.12, df = 1, P = 0.26, intercept = \u22120.72 \u00b1 0.50, slope = \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.01, adjusted r 2 = 0.01; Figure 5B ).\nThere were few changes between forest and opendeveloped land cover classes between 2005 and 2010 based on the C-CAP change map. Of the 26,000-ha study area, only 456 ha had been converted from forest to habitat that is not suitable for forest birds and 518 ha had converted from unsuitable habitat to shrub and forest land cover classes, <2% in either direction. Furthermore, a comparison of the land cover classes at the survey stations revealed that none of them occurred in areas that were converted from forest to non-forest classes. The land cover class at one station switched from scrub/shrub to impervious surface class while the land cover class at another station switched between cultivation to scrub/shrub, indicating that the habitat at that station was allowed to go fallow. Subsequent to the 2010 C-CAP classification the land cover at 5 stations has been converted from suitable "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We observed changes in the avian community inhabiting '\u014dhi'a forests in the Puna lowlands following the advent of ROD. Species richness of nonnative species increased while the densities of Hawaii Amakihi and Japanese White-eye decreased significantly. It is not surprising that Hawaiian forest bird populations and community composition should change in response to the loss of '\u014dhi'a. Changes in avian communities often follow large-scale mortality of forest canopy species (Canterbury and Blockstein 1997 , Rabenold et al. 1998 , Smith and Stephen 2005 , Toenies et al. 2018 . Elm (Ulmus spp.) mortality following the introduction and spread of Dutch elm disease in the United Kingdom and North America led to significant changes in bird populations and communities (Kendeigh 1982 , Osborne 1983 . Increases in saproxylic insects and tree cavities supported more woodpeckers and, as forest canopies opened up, understory bird species increased in abundance (Kendeigh 1982, Canterbury and Blockstein 1997) . Similar observations have been made in association with the ongoing decline of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) due to hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; Toenies et al. 2018) .\nConsistent with continental studies, the 2 additional species (Saffron Finch and Yellow-fronted Canary) detected after the emergence of ROD are species typically found in scrub or transitional habitats (Scott et al. 1986 , Foster 2009 , Pyle and Pyle 2017 . These species are nonnative and relatively recent arrivals to Puna District, having extended their range from leeward Hawaii (Pyle and Pyle 2017) . Yellow-fronted Canaries and Saffron Finch typically prefer more open habitats where grass seed and insects are abundant. Although not observed at stations during the counts, we detected Japanese Bush-Warblers in the study area in 2016. This species may also favor the thick shrubland or open woodland following a canopy decline. While all 3 species may benefit from large-scale '\u014dhi'a mortality, we are hesitant to attribute these observed community changes to ROD alone. Point counts conducted along roadsides, and not forest interiors, may be biased to these newly arrived edge species. Also, if significant change in the understory had occurred then we should have observed an increase in the relative occurrence and abundance of shrubinhabiting Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Hwamei (Garrulax canorus). We did not, however, observe an increase in these species.\nA clearer signal of the impact of ROD is the significant decrease in the relative abundances and absolute densities of Hawaii Amakihi and Japanese White-eyes, perhaps the 5 . Relationship between differences in counts of Hawaii Amakihi and Japanese White-eye to proportion of dead '\u014dhi'a (see text for regression statistics).\nThe Condor: Ornithological Applications XX:1-16, \u00a9 2019 American Ornithological Society 2 most common birds in lowland '\u014dhi'a forests. While both species can be found in a variety of habitats (Scott et al. 1986 ), we observed that Hawaii Amakihi are strongly associated with '\u014dhi'a forests in the Puna lowlands, with 96% of our detections made at stations where '\u014dhi'a trees were present. The dramatic decline (79%) in Hawaii Amakihi density is at odds with the burgeoning population observed in the early 2000s (Spiegel et al. 2006) . Between 2001 and 2006, Hawaii Amakihi densities were particularly high in the old-growth, closed-canopy '\u014dhi'a forest at Pu'u Kali'u, which lies at the core of our survey transects (Woodworth et al. 2005 , Spiegel et al. 2006 , Hart et al. 2011 . Most of the '\u014dhi'a at Pu'u Kali'u appeared dead at the time of our survey, but we were unable to gain access to conduct point counts. By 2014, 30% of '\u014dhi'a forest area in the Puna lowlands had suffered \u226510% '\u014dhi'a mortality and 11% of the total area had seen \u226550% '\u014dhi'a mortality (Mortenson et al. 2016 ). These higher rates of '\u014dhi'a mortality were concentrated in the southwestern portion of our study area coinciding with survey stations where Hawaii Amakihi density had decreased by more than half. While we observed no significant habitat change in our C-CAP analysis that might account for the decline in Hawaii Amakihi density before the advent of ROD, we did observe a negative relationship between the proportion of '\u014dhi'a mortality and Hawaii Amakihi density. These observations suggest that the catastrophic declines of Hawaii Amakihi are likely the result of the dramatic loss of '\u014dhi'a. Although Hawaii Amakihi are diet generalists that feed on arthropods, nectar, and fruit (Lindsey et al. 1998) , breeding success may depend on the seasonal availability of nectar (van Riper 1984) . '\u014dhi'a is the main producer of floral nectar in Puna lowland forests and the loss of this single resource may have adversely affected the Hawaii Amakihi population. A similar resource-limiting pattern has been observed in subalpine woodland on Mauna Kea where the endemic leguminous tree m\u0101mane (Sophora chrysophylla) regenerated with the removal of feral mammals (Hess et al. 1999) , providing more and better-quality habitat for the m\u0101mane-dependent Palila (Loxioides bailleui; Banko et al. 2013) . Once ungulate removal was relaxed and browsing pressure increased, Palila decreased with the decreasing availability of m\u0101mane food resources (pods, seeds, flowers, flower buds, and moth larvae; Banko et al. 2013 , Camp et al. 2016 .\nUnlike Hawaii Amakihi, the decrease in Japanese Whiteeye numbers was unexpected based on previous results. Following the extensive loss of '\u014dhi'a canopy due to '\u014dhi'a dieback, Japanese White-eye numbers increased in native forests (Scott et al. 1986 ). The reproductive characteristics of this species has allowed for the rapid colonization and population growth observed since its introduction to the island in 1937 (van Riper 2000, Pyle and Pyle 2017) . Japanese White-eyes are habitat generalists and feed on a broad diet of arthropod prey, nectar, and fruit (Scott et al. 1986 , van Riper 2000 . They are the most abundant forest bird in the Hawaiian archipelago, reaching their highest densities (\u2265200 individuals per km 2 ) in mesic woodlands, savanna, and scrub habitats (Scott et al. 1986) . Given these traits, we expected Japanese White-eye numbers to increase as a result of ROD-induced habitat disturbance. In the early stages of forest loss and woody decay, insectivorous birds often benefit from the increase in arthropod prey (Kendeigh 1982 , Tingley et al. 2002 , Smith and Stephen 2005 , Toenies et al. 2018 . For woodpeckers and aerial foragers like flycatchers, abundance increases as foraging substrates and canopy gaps increase (Becker et al. 2008) . But Japanese White-eyes, like Hawaii Amakihi, are primarily foliage gleaners (Lindsey et al. 1998 , van Riper 2000 and therefore less likely to benefit from a transient increase in saproxylic arthropods. Japanese White-eyes might have benefited, however, from an increased availability of fleshy fruits as nonnative trees and shrubs such as strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum), miconia (Miconia calvescens), and blackberry (Rubus argutus) rapidly invade the forest understory. Strawberry guava is a main component of wet '\u014dhi'a forest in the Puna lowlands (Mortenson et al. 2016 ) and our observations indicate that young miconia are present at a number of stations where severe '\u014dhi'a mortality has occurred (DES and RJC personal observation). Like Hawaii Amakihi, nutritional stress from the recent loss of '\u014dhi'a nectar and foliage insects without the compensation of alternative foods may be responsible for the unexpected decline in the Japanese White-eye population. In addition to the loss of foraging and food resources, both species may have been negatively affected by the loss of nesting habitat due to dead and defoliated '\u014dhi'a. In mesic and wet forests, Hawaii Amakihi nest almost exclusively in '\u014dhi'a (Lindsey et al. 1998) .\nUnlike more diverse continental forests, Hawaiian forest canopies are composed largely or solely of '\u014dhi'a. With few native tree species to replace the '\u014dhi'a canopy lost to ROD, invasive plants are likely to expand through the forest understory (Mortenson et al. 2016) . Species like miconia and strawberry guava may provide more fruit to the nutritional benefit of some species but ultimately create impenetrable monotypic stands that crowd out native vegetation and provide less foraging and nesting resources for native Hawaiian birds like Hawaii Amakihi (Meyer and Florence 1996, Medeiros et al. 1997) . For the more nectarivorous Hawaiian honeycreeper species that track '\u014dhi'a blooms (Baldwin 1953 , Carpenter and MacMillen 1976 , Hart et al. 2011 , the continued loss of this foundational forest species will have a more profound effect if ROD spreads to higher elevations. Populations of the common Apapane and Hawaii Amakihi may see drastic declines while the recently The Condor: Ornithological Applications XX:1-16, \u00a9 2019 American Ornithological Society listed Iiwi may face extinction with '\u014dhi'a loss. While state regulations now restrict the interisland movement of potentially infected '\u014dhi'a wood and outreach campaigns continue to actively inform the public, both species of ROD-causing Ceratocystis fungus have been recently detected in '\u014dhi'a forests on Kaua'i, at the far end of the island chain (DLNR 2018a) . Recent surveys on Hawaii Island, however, indicate that the spread of ROD has slowed in the last year, and some '\u014dhi'a populations are resistant to ROD (Pennisi 2018) . This may bode well for the future of '\u014dhi'a forests, but the current catastrophic loss of lowland '\u014dhi'a forest to ROD and the recent eruption of Kilauea Volcano ( Figure 3B and Appendix Figure 7 ; DLNR 2018b , Neal et al. 2018 ) remain as immediate threats to Hawaii Amakihi, a native species whose tolerance to malaria allows it to persist in lowland forest."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We wish to thank Leif Mortenson and Flint Hughes of the USDA Forest Service, Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, Hilo, Hawaii, for the use of their '\u014dhi'a mortality data, Carter Atkinson with USGS-PIERC with help in early conceptual phases of the study, Mike Riney for technical assistance, and comments by reviewers that improved this manuscript.
