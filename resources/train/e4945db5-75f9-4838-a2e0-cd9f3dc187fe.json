[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: animal studies suggest a neuroprotective role for leptin, but human studies have shown mixed results. We examined whether plasma leptin levels in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were related to cognitive function at baseline and whether higher leptin levels were associated with reduced risk of dementia. Methods: we categorised 352 MCI participants into sex-specific tertiles based on log-transformed fasting plasma leptin levels. In sex-stratified analyses, we investigated whether cognitive ability differed by leptin tertile. We also examined whether the risk of dementia over a 3-year follow-up period differed by leptin level. Analyses controlled for numerous potential confounding variables, including body mass index, hypertension and levels of blood insulin and C-reactive protein.\nResults: baseline cognitive ability did not differ as a function of leptin level, nor were higher leptin levels associated with reduced hazard of developing dementia. Controlling for related co-variates did not reveal any significant associations between leptin and dementia risk. Conclusion: in this cohort of older adults with MCI, plasma leptin level was not associated with cognitive function at baseline, nor did it predict risk of dementia. Other biological measures, such as volumetric MRI and cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, have demonstrated robust dementia prediction in this cohort. Thus, the current negative findings suggest that plasma leptin, on its own, is unlikely to become a useful clinical biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Efforts to develop other blood-based biomarkers are needed."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "With the growing realisation that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins to accumulate years prior to the onset of dementia, there is strong interest in developing reliable tests to predict dementia risk. A blood-based test would be ideal for reasons of cost, convenience and availability. One potential serum measure that has received much recent attention is leptin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone involved in appetite regulation [1] , and cognitive function (for review, see Ref. [2] ). In animal models, leptin has been shown to promote synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the hippocampus [3, 4] and to facilitate long-term potentiation-the physiologic basis of memory [5] . Leptin has been shown to be positively associated with memory performance [3] and to reverse cognitive impairment in mouse models of AD [6] . Leptin has also been shown to reduce amyloid and tau pathologies, the key pathologies of AD [7, 8] . Plasma leptin levels have thus been proposed as an early indicator of AD risk and as a potential therapeutic target [7, 9] .\nThe association of leptin with cognitive performance in humans is not clear, however. Higher leptin levels have been associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia in some studies, but not in others [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Some studies have even reported an inverse association, with higher leptin levels associated with greater cognitive decline [15, 16] . Leptin levels have been reported to be lower in individuals with AD than in age-matched healthy controls and to correlate with disease severity in those with severe dementia [17] . However, since weight loss is common in AD [18] , it is not clear whether differences in leptin levels precede or follow the onset of dementia. Few studies have examined the association of leptin with cognitive ability in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who may be in a prodromal stage of the disorder. Here, we examined whether serum leptin levels are associated with cognitive function and dementia risk in a cohort of individuals with MCI in whom neuroimaging and CSF measures have demonstrated robust prediction of dementia risk [19] [20] [21] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

We used analyses of co-variance (ANCOVAs) to examine differences in demographics, clinical measures and neuropsychological task performance across leptin tertile groups. Since leptin levels differ by sex, we analysed data from men and women separately. Since cognitive performance is affected by age and education, we controlled for these effects by including age and education as co-variates. In secondary analyses, we examined whether control for additional factors plausibly related to leptin or cognitive function affected the results by including, in separate ANCOVAs, body mass index (BMI), hypertension as assessed by the use of any antihypertensive medication, CRP and insulin levels as co-variates. To explore whether the association of leptin with cognitive performance differed by obesity [13, 14] , we classified participants into normal weight (BMI < 25) and overweight groups (BMI \u2265 25) and included BMI group as an interaction term in the models.\nWe examined risk of developing dementia over 3 years across leptin tertiles using Cox regression models, with age as a co-variate. Hazard ratios (HRs) of developing dementia were calculated for the two lowest leptin tertiles relative to the highest tertile. In secondary analyses, we examined whether inclusion of any of the co-variates described above (BMI, hypertension, CRP and insulin level) affected the results of the Cox regression analyses.\nTo determine whether results differed when leptin was treated as a continuous rather than categorical variable, analyses were repeated treating leptin as a continuous measure. These analyses used linear regression models and included the same co-variates as described above."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participant characteristics", "text": "In this sample of 222 men and 128 women, leptin levels were higher in women than in men (F(1,347) = 209; P < 0.001; controlling for age and BMI) and strongly correlated with BMI (Pearson's partial r = 0.63; P < 0.001; controlling for sex and age) and insulin levels (Pearson's partial r = 0.43; P < 0.001 controlling for sex and age). More men than women in this study were overweight (\u03c7 2 = 9.15; P = 0.002; 63.8% of men and 47.2% of women had a BMI \u2265 25), and more men than women were taking antihypertensive medications (\u03c7 2 = 16.66; P = 0.001; 54.9% men and 48.4% women). Table 1 shows participant demographics as a function of sex-specific leptin tertiles. Age and education levels did not differ across leptin levels for men or women. As expected, BMI increased with increasing leptin level, as did insulin levels. In men, the proportion of participants being treated for hypertension increased with increasing leptin level. For women, this effect approached significance. In women, CRP level increased with increasing leptin tertile; in men, CRP level did not differ across leptin tertiles.

Men with leptin levels in the highest tertile showed less impairment than men with leptin levels in the two lower tertiles. However, with BMI included as a co-variate, ADASCog score did not differ across leptin levels (P = 0.271).

In men, 35% of those in the lowest leptin tertile, 30% of those in the middle tertile and 38% of those in the highest tertile developed dementia. In women, the corresponding percentages were 60, 40 and 37%. HRs of developing dementia with lower leptin levels were not significant in men or women (Figure 1 ). "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We examined the relation of baseline serum leptin levels to measures of cognitive impairment at baseline and with risk of decline to dementia among individuals with MCI. Leptin levels were weakly associated with general cognitive function at baseline in men, as evidenced by better performance on the ADAS-Cog in men with the highest level of leptin relative to those with lower levels. However, this effect was not independent of BMI. Leptin levels did not predict risk of dementia over the 3-year follow-up period in either men or women. Thus, unlike several other biological measures that have been found to significantly predict dementia in this cohort, such as structural brain atrophy, regional cerebral hypometabolism, amyloid and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid [19, 20, 22, 23] , serum leptin levels do not appear to be a robust measure, on their own, for identifying those individuals with MCI who are at a highest risk of developing dementia. Despite evidence from animal studies that higher leptin levels are associated with better memory task performance [3, 6] , evidence that leptin protects against cognitive decline in humans has been less consistent. Higher plasma leptin levels were associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline over a 4-year period in one study of older adults [11] and with reduced risk of AD over an 8-year period in another study [10] . In two other studies, an association of high leptin level with reduced risk of dementia or cognitive decline was found only among normal weight but not among overweight individuals [13, 14] . A study of middle-aged women found that mid-life leptin levels were not associated with risk of dementia over a 32-year follow-up [12] . A study of middle-aged men and women reported that leptin levels were not associated with cognitive performance in women, but showed an Figure 1 . Survival curves from the Cox regression analysis showing risk of developing dementia over the 3-year follow-up period by sex-specific leptin tertile (T) for men (A) and women (B). Analyses controlled for age and BMI. There were no significant differences in hazard of developing dementia across leptin tertiles.\ninconsistent relation with cognitive performance in men, with high leptin levels associated with better cognitive performance 8 years later in white men but with worse cognitive performance 8 years later in black men [15] . A large study of older adults with Type II diabetes found that higher leptin levels were associated with worse cognitive function in men, but they were not associated with cognitive function in women [16] . Thus, across studies, the association of leptin with cognitive function or risk of dementia varied by age, sex, race and health status.\nSince leptin is secreted in proportion to adipose mass, leptin levels are positively correlated with obesity and with obesity-related health conditions, such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases varies by age, race and sex. Many cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors have themselves been found to relate to cognitive impairment and dementia risk [24] [25] [26] . There is thus strong potential for these risk factors to mask any beneficial effect of leptin on cognition. Although most studies control some of these risk factors, it is not possible to control all potentially related factors. The variability in the co-variates included in the analyses and in the prevalence of these diseases across study samples likely contributes to the inconsistent results across studies and within study subsamples.\nAnother factor that makes it difficult to assess the relation of serum leptin to cognitive function in humans, and that is likely to contribute to discrepancies across studies, is leptin resistance. Leptin is transported into the brain through a saturable mechanism involving triglycerides [27, 28] . In conditions associated with high-circulating leptin levels, such as obesity, leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier is reduced [28] . Within the central nervous system, leptin resistance arises from reduction of leptin receptors and impaired leptin signalling [2] . Obesity, age and oestrogen insufficiency have all been associated with central leptin resistance [29] . Thus, the relation between peripheral leptin levels and central leptin activity likely differs by age, sex and disease states. We found that leptin levels were positively correlated with CRP in women but not in men, a finding that has been reported previously [30] . CRP binds to leptin, potentially contributing to leptin resistance [30] , and this may contribute to the sex difference observed here in the relation of leptin to baseline cognitive function. The phenomenon of leptin resistance poses challenges for the viability of therapies aimed at increasing leptin levels to prevent or treat AD.\nA strength of this study is the use of a cohort that was highly selected to increase the probability that participants are in a prodromal stage of AD, allowing us to examine the predictive ability of leptin in a population at high risk for dementia, and for whom the predictive ability of other biological measures has been assessed. However, the sample size is relatively small compared with larger population-based studies, and the length of follow-up is limited. Given the findings of a weak association of leptin level with baseline cognitive function in men, and an orderly, albeit insignificant, increase in HR of developing dementia with decreasing leptin level in women, it is possible that a study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up would have observed significant effects. It is also possible that the combination of leptin with other blood biochemical measures would show greater association with baseline cognitive impairment and greater ability to predict dementia risk.\nNevertheless, the results of this study, along with the inconsistencies of results across prior studies, suggest that plasma leptin levels are not useful, on their own, for predicting dementia risk in older adults. Further efforts to develop other blood-based tests of AD, potentially involving combinations of measures, are needed."}, {"section_title": "Key points", "text": "\u2022 Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers exist for predicting dementia risk in older adults with MCI.\n\u2022 A blood-based test of dementia risk would be more economical and have greater availability.\n\u2022 Evidence suggests that leptin may facilitate cognitive function and may play a neuroprotective role in AD.\n\u2022 Serum leptin levels in older adults with MCI were weakly associated with cognitive ability at baseline in men but not in women.\n\u2022 High serum leptin levels were not associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with MCI."}]
