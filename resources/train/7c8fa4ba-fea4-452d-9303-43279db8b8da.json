A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference while reading the indicators. To ensure comparability in the indicators across countries, each country restructured its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed in the 1997 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). 1 The following two paragraphs highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs. With the emergence and growth of the global economy, policymakers and educators have turned to international comparisons to assess how well national systems of education are performing. These comparisons shed light on a host of policy issues, from access to education to equity of resources devoted to educational achievement. They provide policymakers with the opportunity to compare different aspects of countries' education systems, assess systems' performances, and identify potential strategies to improve student achievement and system outputs. Since the 1960s, the United States has participated actively in international projects that are designed to provide key information about the performance of the U.S. education system compared to other countries. These projects include the Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), both conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA); and, more recently, the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). This report, Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G8 Countries: 2004, draws on the most current information produced by these projects available at the time of production (fall 2003 to spring 2004) to present a set of education indicators that describes how the U.S. education system compares with those in other economically developed countries. Updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the four international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the primary comparisons in this report are with the Group of Eight, or G8, countries. These are the eight most industrialized countries in the world, whose representatives meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The countries were selected for comparison because they are relatively similar to the United States in their economic development and because they are among our major economic competitors. In indicators from the OECD's Education at a Glance, the United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. In indicators from PISA, the United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, because Wales did not partici-"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of academic or vocational subjects and to prepare them for higher level academic or vocational studies or entry into the labor market. The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. Higher education includes two education levels. 2 The first level contains two types of programs: vocational programs and academic programs. The vocational programs provide a higher level of technical and vocational education that is designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs are between 2 and 4 years in duration. 3 Academic programs at the first level of higher education are intended to provide sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that are less than 5 years in duration and long programs that are 5 to 7 years in duration. The second level of higher education includes doctoral studies and usually requires the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. For a summary of how the ISCED correlates with these levels, please refer to the appendix."}, {"section_title": "Mapping G8 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED", "text": "Differences in the structure of countries' education systems often make international comparisons difficult. To improve the comparability of education indicators, the OECD worked with countries to standardize their education systems into the ISCED, as described above. Using the OECD ISCED classifications as a starting point, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) worked with education professionals in other G8 countries to create a general overview of each country's education system. As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED applies to each of the G8 countries are provided in the appendix, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G8 Countries: 2004 begins with a section that highlights key findings and then presents 23 indicators that compare different aspects of education systems in the United States and the seven other G8 countries.

It contains two indicators on the comparison of countries' financial investments in education, as well as the sources of public funding devoted to education. The section concludes with two indicators that examine the relationship between educational attainment and labor force participation and earnings. The sections on preprimary and primary education and secondary education begin with indicators that pertain to access to education, generally measured by enrollment rates at each education level. The indicators that follow in these sections compare student outcomes, such as test scores on international assessments, and also present demographic profiles of the students by achievement levels. The next set of indicators at these education levels examines home-related and school resources that influence student outcomes, such as student preparedness at the start of school, time spent doing reading homework, home 2 In the international classification, more advanced education is generally referred to as tertiary education. In this report, the term \"higher education\" is used because this term is more familiar to American readers. 3 It should be noted that the international classification includes an education level that straddles the boundary between secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. This program of study-which is primarily vocational in nature-is generally taken after the completion of secondary school, but the subject content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. This level of education is included in indicators of primary and secondary education in all other countries except the United States. In the United States, postsecondary nontertiary education is not included in the enrollment indicators; expenditures for this education level are partially included in indicators of expenditures of higher education. literacy environment, teachers' instructional strategies and teaching time, and students' attitudes toward reading. The higher education section also begins with an indicator on enrollment rates. The other two indicators at this education level explore students' chosen field of study and the percentage of foreign students in higher education. Each indicator is presented in a 2-page format. The first page presents key findings that highlight how the United States compares with other G8 countries (with data available) on the indicator. The key findings are followed by a short section that defines the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce the indicator. The second page presents graphics and tables that support the key findings, sources of data for the indicator, and more detailed notes on interpreting the results. Most of the indicators included in the report present a snapshot of the U.S. education system during the start of this decade in 2000, although earlier data are used for some indicators when these are the most current data available on the topic. Finally, it should be noted that all the indicators related to enrollment in education use 2001 as the reference year. In the United States, this designation applies to the 2000-01 school year; indicators are based on enrollment data collected in October 2000. Finance indicators use 2000 as the reference year. In the United States, this designation applies to the 1999-2000 school year; indicators are based on expenditures for the period from mid-1999 to mid-2000."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "There are three main sources of data for this report.

The percent change in population ages 5 to 29 is calculated by subtracting the total population ages 5 to 29 in 1993 from this population in 2003 and dividing by the 1993 population ages 5 to 29. The share of a population group (e.g., ages 5 to 29) may decline from 1993 to 2003 even though the size of the population group may still have increased between 1993 and 2003. This is due to a higher rate of increase of the total population compared to the rate of increase for the specific population group.   In 2001, close to 100 percent of children ages 3 to 4 were enrolled in preprimary or primary programs in France 4 and Italy (table 2).

However, by age 4 in Japan and the United Kingdom, age 5 in the United States, and age 6 in Canada and Germany, at least 90 percent of the population was enrolled in formal education (figure 2). In the Russian Federation, not until the age of 7 did enrollment rates reach 90 percent for the population. In 2001, the United States and six of the seven other G8 countries had close to universal school participation of children ages 5-14-the age range that generally corresponds with primary and lower secondary education (table 2). The Russian Federation was the only country in which the enrollment rate for this age group was below 90 percent. The United States had an enrollment rate of 78 percent in 2001 for youth ages 15 to 19-the age range that corresponds most closely with upper secondary education in the countries presented. The enrollment rate for the United States for this age group was higher than the corresponding rates for Canada, Italy, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom, but lower than the rates for France and Germany. Compulsory education ends at age 18 in Germany, age 17 in the United States, age 16 in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom,and age 15 in Italy,Japan,and the Russian Federation (figure 2). Participation in formal education tends to be high until the end of compulsory education for all the countries, but in Germany and the United Kingdom, enrollment rates are below 90 percent at the age at which students are still legally required to be enrolled in school. Enrollment rates of 20-to 29-year olds-the age range that corresponds most closely to the typical age of enrollment in higher education-were less than 25 percent among the seven countries reporting data (table 2). The United States had an enrollment rate of 23 percent for adults ages 20 to 29. This rate was lower than the rate in Germany (24 percent), about the same as the rate in the United Kingdom (23 percent), but higher than the rates in Canada (21 percent), France (20 percent), Italy (17 percent) and the Russian Federation (15 percent).\nFormal education enrollment figures include children who attended center-based programs and exclude children in homebased early childhood education. The percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to \"net enrollment rate,\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions, ages 5 to 14, 15 to 19, and 20 to 29, in 2001. Enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age categories due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Reference year is 2001 for population and enrollment data in all countries; however, reference dates may differ within 2001. Ending age of compulsory education is the age at which students below that age are legally obliged to participate in education. The United States, the wealthiest country among those reporting data (in terms of GDP per capita), ranked the highest in amounts spent per student on primary and secondary education in 2000 (table 3). Expenditures per student at the combined primary and secondary level in the United States were higher than expenditures in the other G8 countries reporting data. U.S. expenditures at this level were 23 percent higher than those in France, the country reporting the next highest expenditure per student, and 53 percent higher than those in the United Kingdom, the country reporting the lowest expenditure per student. The United States also ranked the highest in amounts spent per student on higher education in 2000. Expenditures per student at the postsecondary level in the United States were 143 percent higher than expenditures in France, 111 percent higher than expenditures in the United Kingdom, 87 percent higher than expenditures in Germany and Japan, and 36 percent higher than expenditures in Canada. While the United States reported the highest expenditure per student for primary and secondary education among the reporting G8 countries in 2000, it did not devote the highest percentage of its GDP to the cost of education at this level (table 3). In the United States, 3.9 percent of GDP went to the cost of education at the primary and secondary level. The corresponding figures for other countries presented ranged from 3.0 percent in Japan to 4.3 percent in France. For higher education in the United States, 2.7 percent of GDP went to the cost of education, compared to the corresponding figures for other countries presented ranging from 1.0 percent in Germany and the United Kingdom to 2.6 percent in Canada.  1 Per student expenditures are calculated based on public and private full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment figures (adjusted for the 1998-99 school year), and current expenditures and capital outlay from both public and private sources where data are available.\n2 GDP adjusted to national fiscal year. 3 Postsecondary nontertiary data included in higher education for Canada and the United States. 4 Postsecondary nontertiary data included in both primary and secondary and higher education for Japan. 5 Postsecondary nontertiary data included in primary and secondary for the United Kingdom. \nEducational levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Primary education refers to ISCED level 1 and secondary education includes ISCED levels 2 and 3. Higher education refers to ISCED level 5A (academic higher education-first stage) (see ISCED descriptions in the appendix), except in Canada, the United States, and Japan, where ISCED level 4 (postsecondary nontertiary education) is included in higher education. For a complete description of the ISCED levels, see the appendix. The educational expenditures of each level of government are the total educational expenditures of all public authorities at the level in question before transfers between levels of government. The proportion of expenditures made by a particular level of government is calculated as a percentage of the total consolidated expenditures of all three levels. Only expenditures specifically designated for education are taken into account in determining the proportion of expenditures borne by a particular level.    \nCanada, Japan, and the United States are classified as 3A and are designed to provide access to tertiary academic education. Upper secondary programs in France include academic programs (3A), programs that lead to higher vocational-technical education (3B), and those that directly lead to the labor market (3C). In Germany upper secondary includes 3A programs as well as 3B. Italy and the United Kingdom include both 3A and 3C programs in upper secondary education. Academic higher education refers to ISCED level 5A (academic higher education-first stage) and ISCED level 6 (academic higher education-second stage/ doctoral studies) for all countries. For a complete description of the ISCED levels, see the appendix.\nTo conform to the international standard, U.S. enrollment in kindergarten and prekindergarten classes in elementary schools was considered part of preprimary education. This classification of the levels of education is based on the revised International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Preprimary education refers to ISCED level 0 and primary education refers to ISCED level 1. For a complete description of the ISCED levels, see the appendix. The percent of the population at a given age enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to \"net enrollment rate,\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group divided by the population of that same age group. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students ages 3, 4, and 5 in public and private schools in 2001. Enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some coun-tries and some age categories due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Reference year is 2001 for population and enrollment data in all countries; however, reference dates may differ within 2001. Enrollment figures only include children who attended center-based institutions. They exclude children in home-based early childhood education. Unlike Indicator 2, which focuses on universal enrollment and aggregate enrollment rates, this indicator presents the enrollment rate by school level (preprimary and primary programs) and by single year of age for children ages 3 to 5. For further information about the typical age at which universal enrollment and aggregate enrollment rates begin across the G8 countries, please refer to Indicator 2. Indicator 7 Figure 7a. Percentage of children ages 3 to 5 enrolled in center-based preprimary and primary education, by country: 2001 1 Enrollment rates for France exceed 100 percent due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data.  \nPIRLS 2001 scores are reported on a scale of 0 to 1000, and are scaled to have an international average of 500 and an international standard deviation of 100 (for the 35 participating countries). The two subscales of PIRLS, the literary and informational scales, make up the combined reading literacy score. Items from the literary subscale require students to understand language use and to comprehend the plot of a fictional story. Questions in the informational subscale measure students' ability to understand the information presented in a factual text. Indicator 8  1 National Desired Population (all 9-year-olds with some national exclusions) does not cover all of International Desired Population (all 9-year-olds) because coverage falls below 65 percent. 2 Canada is represented by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (O,Q) only. 3 Met guidelines for sample participation rates after replacement schools were included. 4 National Defined Population (actual sample) covers less than 95 percent of National Desired Population (all 9-year-olds). NOTE: PIRLS 2001 assessed students in the upper of the two grades with the most 9-year-olds. In the United States and most other countries, this corresponds with the fourth grade. However, in England and Scotland, this refers to students who have received 5 years of formal schooling. PIRLS 2001 scores are reported on a scale of 0 to 1,000, and are scaled to have an international average of 500 and an international standard deviation of 100 (for the 35 participating countries). PIRLS 2001 consisted of 3 scales: a literary subscale, an informational subscale, and a combined reading literacy scale. The combined literacy scale is based on the distribution of scores on all the test items, while the subscales are based on only the items that belong to each subscale. Hence, the combined reading literacy score is not the statistical average of the scores of the two subscales. . The index was based on students' agreement with a set of statements related to reading such as, \"I enjoy reading\" and \"I would be happy if someone gave me a book as a present.\" Responses to each statement were averaged across each student and used to categorize the students into high, medium, or low categories for the index. The percentage of fourth-graders with high index scores ranged from 42 in the United States to 58 in France (figure 9a). All of the countries reporting data had a greater percentage of fourthgraders in the high category than the United States with the exception of England, whose percentage of fourth-graders was not measurably different from the corresponding percentage in the United States. In 2001, 13 percent of fourth-grade students in the United States had a low index score on the SATR. This was a higher percentage than the percent of students with a low index score in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the Russian Federation. In the United States and all other participating countries, a higher percentage of girls than boys had high index scores on the SATR (figure 9b Within all reporting countries, including the United States, fourthgraders who were in the high category of attitudes toward reading had higher reading literacy achievement scores than fourthgraders in either the medium or low reading attitude categories (data not shown in figures). However, it is not possible to infer causality from these findings, since they do not explain whether attitudes cause achievement differences or vice versa or some other factor influences both. Regardless, these findings suggest an association between reading attitudes and achievement in reading within the eight countries presented.\nThe Students' Attitudes Toward Reading index was based on the following statements: I read only if I have to (reverse coded); I like talking about books with other people; I would be happy if someone gave me a book as a present; I think reading is boring (reverse coded); and I enjoy reading. Responses were computed on a 4-point scale: Disagree a lot=1, Disagree a little=2, Agree a little=3, and Agree a lot=4. Responses were categorized as high, medium, or low and averaged for each student. Students in the high category had an average response of greater than 3; students in the medium category had an average response greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 3; and students in the low category had an average below 2.\nTeachers reported whether or not they had employed the following strategies: waiting to see if student performance improved with maturation; working with students individually; having other students work with students; having students work with a teacher aide; and having students work with remedial or reading specialists. Teachers could endorse multiple strategies and there was no rank ordering of preference for one strategy over another. Teachers were asked if they always, sometimes, or never had a remedial or reading specialist available. Furthermore, they were asked if other specialists were available always, sometimes, or never.\nSchool teachers refers to professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. This classification includes classroom teachers, special education teachers, and department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes teachers' aides and teaching/research assistants. Teachers' salaries in public primary schools are in equivalent U.S. dollars, converted using Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) that equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. PPPs exchange rate data are from the OECD National Accounts 2001. Statutory salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales. The salaries provided are defined as gross salaries (total sum paid by the employer for the labor supplied) excluding the employer's contribution to social security and pension (according to existing salary scales), and are \"before tax.\" Salaries after 15 years' experience refer to the scheduled annual salary of a full-time classroom teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified and with 15 years' experience. \nKey Findings: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States term enrollment rate refers to \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions, ages 16, 17, 18, and 19 in 2001. Enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age categories due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. 13 Figure 13. Percentage of the population ages 16 to 19 enrolled in public and private secondary and higher education, by age and country: 2001 -Not available. Data not available for 18-and 19-year-olds in Japan. \u2020Not applicable. The enrollment estimate does not apply to 16-year-olds in higher education in Italy and Japan. #Rounds to zero. The enrollment estimate rounds to zero for 16-year-olds in higher education in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and for 17-year-olds in higher education in Italy and Japan. 1 The United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. 2 Estimates are provided for enrollment by age in secondary and higher education on the assumption that all students at the same grade are of the same age. A part-time student equals one full-time-equivalent at this level. 3 The secondary enrollment rate in Germany exceeds 100 percent for 16-year-olds due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. This indicator, based on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) conducted in 2000, examines differences in reading literacy between males and females. Particular attention is given to achievement at low and high levels of performance. For PISA 2000, 15-year-olds from 32 countries were tested and their scores were grouped into levels from 1-5, with level 1 or below being the lowest and level 5 being the highest. On average, females outperformed males in every G8 country on the combined reading literacy scale (table 8). In the United States, females scored an average of 29 points higher than males on the combined reading literacy score of PISA 2000. In comparing the United States to the other countries reporting data, no differences were detected in the size of the performance gap by sex. Males in the United States were overrepresented among 15-yearolds scoring at level 1 or below compared to their representation in the overall population: 62 percent of 15-year-olds scoring at level 1 or below were male, while males were 48 percent of the overall population of 15-year-olds ( figure 14). Likewise, females were underrepresented at level 1 or below in the United States as compared to their representation in the overall population. At level 5, males and females were not found to be significantly overrepresented or underrepresented in the United States compared to the overall population. However, at level 5 in the other G8 countries, females were overrepresented while males were underrepresented compared to the overall population.\nIn order to better describe performance in reading literacy, PISA 2000 examined the proportion of students who could accomplish tasks at particular levels. In order to reach a particular level, a student must have been able to answer correctly a majority of test items at that level. Students were classified into six reading levels according to their scores. Students scoring below 335 were classified as below level 1, students scoring 335 to 407 were at level 1, and students scoring 626 and above were classified at Key Findings: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, United States\nFor the two scales on the importance of adult citizenship activities-conventional and social movement-related-students were asked to indicate the importance of several activities. Each activity was prefaced with, \"An adult who is a good citizen . . .\" For each activity (e.g., \"votes in every election,\" \"takes part in activities promoting human rights\"), response choices ranged from 1 (not important) to 4 (very important). For the two scales on the concepts of government responsibilities-society-related and economy-related-students were asked to indicate their level of agreement over whether the government should be responsible for various issues. The 14-year-olds were asked, \"What responsibilities should the government have?\" For each issue (e.g., \"to provide free basic education for all,\" \"to keep prices under control\"), response choices ranged from 1 (should not be the government's responsibility) to 4 (definitely should be the government's responsibility). For the scale on expected participation in political activities, students were asked, \"When you are an adult, what do you expect that you will do?\" For the three activities (e.g., \"join a political party\"), response choices ranged from 1 (I will certainly not do this) to 4 (I will certainly do this). See figure 16a for the complete list of items making up each scale. Items were scaled using the Item Response Theory 'Partial Credit Model' . The resulting person parameters (logits) for the latent dimensions were converted to international scales with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 2 (countries equally weighted). The scale scores are relative to the international mean, and do not reveal any substantial meaning regarding the item response categories.\nPISA 2000 measured students' engagement in reading by asking students for their level of agreement with several statements about their enjoyment of reading and reading-related activities, such as going to the library. See figure 17 for a complete list of items used to create the engagement in reading index. The engagement in reading index was constructed in such a way that the average index score of the 27 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries that participated in PISA 2000 was set to zero. (Overall 31 countries participated in PISA, an assessment run by the OECD, in 2000. The scores of non-OECD countries were not included in the calculation of the average index score). The standard deviation of the index was set to one; therefore, approximately two-thirds of the OECD student population scored between -1 and 1. In order to better describe performance in reading literacy, PISA 2000 examined the proportion of students who could accomplish tasks at particular levels. In order to reach a particular level, a student must have been able to answer correctly a majority of test items at that level. Students were classified into six reading levels according to their scores. Students scoring below 335 were classified as below level 1, students scoring 335 to 407 were at level 1, and students scoring 626 and above were classified at level 5. For the purpose of this report, students scoring at level 1 or below have been combined into a single proficiency level. 1 The United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Wales did not participate in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000.\nPISA 2000 measures students' enrollment in remedial courses in the test language in school and outside of school by asking the students two questions: Over the past 3 years, have you taken remedial courses in school in the test language? Over the past 3 years, have you taken remedial courses out of school in the test language? Students were also asked to report how frequently they attended these remedial courses (regularly, sometimes, or never). In order to better describe performance in reading literacy, PISA 2000 examined the proportion of students who could accomplish tasks at particular levels. In order to reach a particular level, a student must have been able to answer correctly a majority of test items at that level. Students were classified into six reading levels according to their scores. Students scoring below 335 were classified as below level 1, students scoring 335 to 407 were at level 1, and students scoring 626 and above were classified at level 5. For the purpose of this report, students scoring at level 1 or below have been combined into a single proficiency level. A population subgroup is overrepresented in a level if the percentage of the subgroup in that level is statistically higher than the percentage of the population overall in that level. The combined reading literacy scale is made up of 3 subscales: retrieving information, interpreting texts, and reflecting on texts.\nSchool teachers refers to professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. This classification includes classroom teachers, special education teachers, and department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes teachers' aides and teaching/research assistants. \nTeaching staff refers to professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. This classification includes classroom teachers, special education teachers and department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes teachers' aides and teaching/research assistants. Net teaching hours refers to the number of teaching hours per year. This excludes break periods between lessons and days when schools are closed for public holidays and festivities. In primary education, however, short breaks that teachers spend with the class are typically included. Working time in school refers to the working time teachers are supposed to be at school, including teaching time and non-teaching time. It differs from net teaching hours in that it includes nonteaching hours. Statutory working time refers to the normal working hours of a full-time teacher. According to the formal policy in a given country, working time can refer only to the time directly associated with teaching (and other curricular activities for students such as assignments and tests, but excluding annual examinations); or to time directly associated with teaching and to hours devoted to other activities related to teaching, such as lesson preparation, counseling students, correcting assignments and tests, professional development, meetings with parents, staff meetings and general school tasks. Working time does not include paid overtime.\nEducational levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Higher education refers to ISCED level 5A (academic higher education-first stage), 5B (technical and vocational higher education), and 6 (academic higher education-second stage/ doctoral studies). For a complete description of the ISCED levels, see the appendix. The percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to \"net enrollment rate,\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same group. Enrollments include full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions of higher education, ages 18 to 29 in 2001. In Germany and Italy, enrollment data for students enrolled in doctoral studies were not available.\nPrograms that prepare students for advanced research and highly qualified professions are classified as first university degree programs, which corresponds to ISCED level 5A. First university degrees vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, the first university degree corresponds to a bachelor's degree; it excludes associate's degrees. For a complete description of the ISCED levels, see the appendix. The percentage of first university degrees awarded in each of the four fields shown is the share of these degrees awarded in each field relative to all first university degrees awarded in all fields for a given year.\nEducation levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Higher education in this indicator refers to ISCED levels 5A, 5B, and 6. For a complete description of the ISCED levels, see the appendix. Foreign student enrollment is reported as a proportion of the total enrollment in higher education programs in the host country. Total enrollment, used as the denominator, includes all foreign and domestic students in the country and excludes all students from the host country who are studying abroad. 1 The United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

Public funds for education are typically obtained from a combination of central, regional, and local sources. The percentage of funds provided by each source varies across countries and by education level. In Canada, Germany, the Russian Federation, and the United States, all with a federal form of government, the central government provides a small portion of the funds for primary and secondary education. In 2000, the central government provided 8 percent of the revenues at this education level in the United States and Germany, 4 percent in Canada, and 1 percent in the Russian Federation (figure 4a). Regional governments in Canada (i.e., provinces), Germany (i.e., L\u00e4nder), and the United States (i.e., states), play an important role in the financing of primary and secondary education, but local governments also contribute to school funding. In 2000, state governments in the United States provided 51 percent of the funding for primary and secondary education, and local governments provided 41 percent. In comparison to the United States, regional governments in Canada and Germany played a larger role, supplying 70 and 75 percent of the funds, respectively. In contrast, local governments in the Russian Federation (i.e., Republics) financed 84 percent of the funds for primary and secondary education.

In 2000, the central government in Japan provided 25 percent of funds at this education level, while regional governments (i.e. prefectures) provided 57 percent. In the United Kingdom, the central government contributed 26 percent and the local governments provided 74 percent of the funding. However, in the United Kingdom, a substantial portion of local funding consists of a general-purpose grant from the central government, giving the central government a large, albeit indirect, role in the financing of primary and secondary education. Funding for higher education tends to be more centralized than funding for primary and secondary education among the G8 countries (figure 4b). In 2000, the U.S. federal government provided 39 percent of the funds for higher education; local government allocations made up 6 percent; and regional (state) governments funded the balance of 55 percent. Regional governments in Canada, Germany, and the Russian Federation provided 66 percent, 80 percent, and 17 percent of public funds for higher education, respectively. The central government was the largest source of funds at this education level in the Russian Federation (81 percent) and the second largest provider of funds in Canada (34 percent) and Germany (17 percent). In the four other countries presented (i.e., the nonfederal countries), higher education funding is highly centralized.

Women participated in the labor force at a lower rate than men in all these countries. In the United States and the six other G8 countries examined, labor force participation rates increased with educational attainment in 2001. Of adults ages 25 to 64 in the United States who completed upper secondary education (high school or its equivalent), 79 percent participated in the labor force in 2001 (figure 5a). This was 15 percentage points higher than the labor force participation rate of adults who did not complete upper secondary education. Among the three G8 countries that include only academic general programs in upper secondary education (Canada, Japan, and the United States), the gap in labor force participation between completers of upper secondary education relative to those who did not complete upper secondary education was lower in the United States than in Canada (18 percentage points), but higher than the corresponding gap in Japan (6 percentage points). For the four G8 countries where upper secondary education includes academic programs as well as programs that lead to higher vocational-technical education or directly to the labor market, the gap in labor force participation between completers of upper secondary education relative to those with less education ranged from 16 percentage points in Germany to 24 percentage points in the United Kingdom. In 2001, adults ages 25 to 64 in the United States and Canada who completed academic higher education participated in the labor force at a rate of 86 percent. This was 7 percentage points higher than the labor force participation rate of completers of upper secondary education in both countries. For countries that include only academic general programs in upper secondary education, the gap in labor force participation rates of completers of academic higher education relative to those with upper secondary education was lower in the United States and Canada than in Japan (12 percentage points). For countries where upper secondary education includes academic programs as well as programs that lead to higher vocational-technical education, or directly to the labor market, the gap in labor force participation between completers of upper secondary education relative to those with academic higher education ranged from 5 percentage points in France to 12 percentage points in Germany. In all the countries presented, females who completed upper secondary education or academic higher education had lower labor force participation rates than their male counterparts in 2001 (figure 5b). However, the difference between the labor force participation rates of males and females was smaller among those who had completed academic higher education than among those who had completed upper secondary education. Females who completed academic higher education participated in the labor force at a rate of at least 81 percent in all countries except Japan, where 68 percent of women who completed academic higher education participated in the labor force. In the United States, the difference in labor force participation rates of males and females who completed upper secondary education was 13 percentage points; the difference for completers of academic higher education was lower at 11 percentage points.

Examining earnings differentials by educational attainment gives a measure of the potential financial incentive for an individual to invest in further education. The earnings advantage or the premium of attaining higher education can be measured by the ratio of the average annual earnings of those who graduated from higher education with the average annual earnings of upper secondary graduates. In a similar way, the earnings disadvantage of not completing upper secondary education is apparent by comparison with the annual earnings of upper secondary graduates. In 2001, adults ages 25 to 64 in the United States who completed less than upper secondary education earned, on average, 70 percent of the earnings of adults who completed upper secondary education (figure 6 and table 4).

The scores of U.S. fourth-graders, however, were not detectably different from the scores of their peers in other reporting countries. The average scores for reading literacy describe how a country performs overall compared to other nations, but they provide no information about the way scores are distributed within each country. One way to measure the spread of scores is to measure the standard deviation, which gives an indication of how scores are distributed around the average. Canada (72), France (70), Germany (67), Italy (71), and the Russian Federation (66) each had lower standard deviations than the United States (83), which indicates less variation around the mean. Another way to understand the distribution of scores within and between countries is to look at percentiles of performance. Scores falling between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles of the full range of scores represent the middle half of the score distribution. On average, there was a 108-point gap between the cut point scores of the 25 th and the 75 th percentiles in the United States. In the other reporting countries, the gap ranged from 85 (the Russian Federation) to 112 points (England) (figure 8)."}, {"section_title": "Indicator", "text": "1 National Desired Population (all 9-year-olds with some national exclusions) does not cover all of International Desired Population (all 9-year-olds) because coverage falls below 65 percent. 2 Canada is represented by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (O,Q) only. 3 Met guidelines for sample participation rates after replacement schools were included. 4 National Defined Population (weighted sample size) covers less than 95 percent of National Desired Population (all 9-year-olds).

However, it is not clear that fourth-graders are able to report family income accurately, or whether income adequately captures all resources available to a family. Hence, PIRLS 2001 did not ask students to report family income, but rather, asked students to indicate their possession of or access to a number of items that can be related to a family's economic circumstances, including cars, books, dictionaries, computers, calculators, and the like. This indicator presents information about students' access to books at home, which is often used as a proxy for SES (e.g, Williams et al. 2000 6 ), and explores the extent to which reading achievement varies by number of books at home. Twenty-one percent of U.S. fourth-graders reported having more than 200 books in their home, while 9 percent of U.S. fourthgraders reported 0-10 books (table 6). In comparison to the United States, a smaller percentage of fourth-graders reported having more than 200 books in their home in Germany (16 percent), Italy (13 percent) and the Russian Federation (17 percent). A larger percentage of fourth-graders in Italy (14 percent) reported having 0-10 books in their home compared to U.S. fourth-graders, while a smaller percentage did in Canada (6 percent). On one hand, U.S. fourth-graders who reported having 0-10 books in their home had lower average reading achievement scores than did U.S. fourth-graders who reported having 11-25 books, 26-100 books, 101-200 books, or more than 200 books in their home (figure 10 and table 6). On the other hand, U.S. fourthgraders who reported having the most books (more than 200) did not have higher average reading achievement scores than did fourth-graders who reported having 101-200 or 26-100 books. As in the United States, fourth-graders in all the other countries presented who reported having 0-10 books in the home had lower average reading achievement than did fourth-graders who reported having more books (i.e. in each of the other categories). Also, as in the United States, in all of the other participating countries fourth-graders who had more than 200 books did not have detectably different average achievement than did fourthgraders who reported having 101-200 books in their home. However, unlike in the United States, in Canada, England, France, Germany, and Scotland, the fourth-graders with the most books had higher average achievement than did the fourth-graders with 26-100 books.

In 2001, teachers in G8 countries reported using a combination of strategies to varying degrees. The most common strategy reported by teachers was to spend time working individually with students who are falling behind in reading (table 7). The second most common reported strategy in the majority of reporting countries was to have such students work with other students. In the U.S. no difference was detected between the use of these two strategies: 86 percent of fourth-graders were taught by teachers who reported using the first strategy, and 84 percent of fourth-graders were taught by teachers who reported using the second strategy. In the United States, the third most common strategy was to have a remedial or reading specialist work with students falling behind (51 percent). Waiting to see if such students' performance improved with greater maturity and having a teacher aide help such students were the next two most commonly employed strategies in the United States. PIRLS 2001 also asked fourth-grade teachers about their access to remedial or reading specialists and other professionals. In the United States, 26 percent of fourth-graders had teachers who reported having remedial or reading specialists always available, 39 percent had teachers who reported having such specialists sometimes available, and 35 percent had teachers who reported never having any available (figure 11). Teachers in the United States were more likely than teachers in other countries, with the exception of Scotland, to report that a remedial or reading specialist was always available. Thirty-five percent of U.S. fourth-graders had teachers who reported never having any access to a remedial or reading specialist.

($28,681) to public primary school teachers with the minimum qualifications required to be fully qualified. Only Germany reported a higher average starting salary ($38,412) International comparisons of public primary school teachers' salaries can give policymakers an idea of how teacher compensation varies across countries. For this indicator, the average salaries for public primary school teachers with the minimum qualifications were compared to the salaries of those with the minimum qualifications and 15 years of experience. It also compares the ratio of these average salaries to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries in 2001. Of the countries reporting data, the United States paid the second-highest average starting salary ($28,681) to public primary school teachers with the minimum qualifications (figure 12a). Only Germany reported a higher average starting salary ($38,412) for such teachers. Among the seven countries presented, the United States paid the third-highest average salary ($41,595) to public primary school teachers with the minimum qualifications and 15 years of experience. Both Germany and Japan reported higher average public primary salaries for teachers at this level of experience ($46,459 and $43,043, respectively) as compared to the United States. The average salary of teachers in the United States with the minimum qualifications plus 15 years experience was 46 percent higher than the salary of their counterparts in Italy ($28,483), the country reporting the lowest salary for teachers at this level. The salary to GDP per capita ratio provides a proxy measure of teacher earnings relative to the earnings of the country's average salaried employee. In 2001, starting public primary teachers with the minimum qualifications in six of the reporting countries earned less than the average per capita GDP in their respective countries (figure 12b). In the United States, starting public primary teachers with the minimum qualifications earned, on average 82 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. In Germany, however, public primary teachers with minimum qualifications earned 145 percent of the German GDP per capita. But in all the countries reporting data, public primary teachers with the minimum qualifications and 15 years' experience, earned higher than the GDP per capita in their respective countries.\nIn order to reach a particular proficiency level, a student must have been able to answer correctly a majority of items at that level.

Average index scores of 15-year-old students' sense of engagement in reading, by reading proficiency level and country: 2000 The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2000 asked 15-year-old students whether or not they had enrolled in remedial language courses in school and outside school. This indicator examines students' remedial language class attendance in the 3 years preceding the assessment, which includes courses taken in school for the purpose of increasing proficiency in the language of the assessment. In the United States, on average, 7 percent of 15-year-olds reported taking remedial language courses in school regularly in the three years preceding the assessment (figure 18a). The U.S. percentage was higher than the percentage in five of the other G8 countries. France (5 percent), reported a percentage not measurably different from the United States, and the Russian Federation (11 percent) had a higher rate. On average, fewer 15-year-olds in the United States regularly attended remedial language courses in the 3 years preceding the assessment outside of school than in school ( figure 18a and  figure 18b). Whereas 7 percent of U.S. 15-year-olds reported regularly attending remedial language courses in school, 1 percent reported regularly attending remedial language courses outside of school. This percent is lower than the percent of 15-year-olds in France attending remedial language courses outside school (2 percent) but not detectably different from that in any of the other G8 countries reporting data. For PISA 2000, 15-year-olds from 32 countries were tested and their scores on the combined reading literacy scale were grouped into levels from 1-5, with level 1 or below being the lowest and level 5 being the highest. In the United States, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of 15-year-olds who attended remedial language courses in school at level 1 or below compared to the corresponding percentages at level 5 as well as for the overall population (figure 18a). However, 3 percent of U.S. 15-year-olds at level 1 or below reported regularly attending remedial language classes outside of school, which was higher than the 1 percent of students overall reporting the same; level 1 or below 15-year-olds in the United States, therefore, were overrepresented in this category."}, {"section_title": "INDICATORS PART III INDICATORS PART III INDICATORS PART III", "text": "Secondary Education"}, {"section_title": "SCHOOL ENROLLMENT OF 16-TO 19-YEAR-OLDS", "text": "Whereas a large majority of 16-and 17-year-olds in G8 countries were enrolled in secondary education, more 19year-olds were enrolled in higher education than in secondary education in all of the G8 countries shown except for Germany.

For each country, at least 80 percent of its 16-year-old population was enrolled in secondary education, with the United States reporting a secondary enrollment rate of 88 percent. More than 90 percent of 16-yearolds in Canada, France, Germany, and Japan were enrolled in secondary education. Among 17-year-olds, the secondary enrollment rate in the United States was 75 percent, which was higher than only one other country shown, the United Kingdom (72 percent). The secondary enrollment rates of 17-year-olds were above 90 percent in Canada, Germany, and Japan. Only very small percentages of 17-year-olds were enrolled in higher education, with no country reporting more than 4 percent of this population enrolled in higher education. In some G8 countries, the enrollment rate of 18-year-olds in secondary education was much higher than the 18-year-olds' enrollment rate in higher education. For example, Germany and Italy had 80 and 65 percent, respectively, of their 18-year-old population enrolled in secondary school, whereas 3 and 4 percent, respectively, of 18-year-olds were enrolled in higher education. In other countries, however, enrollment in secondary school drops off sharply beginning at age 18. Canada is an example of this: 95 percent of its 17-year-old population was enrolled in secondary education, whereas 1 percent of its 18-year-old population was enrolled in secondary education. In many of the G8 countries, enrollment in higher education becomes more pronounced at the age of 18. For example, the United Kingdom and the United States had 31 and 23 percent, respectively, of their 18-year-old population enrolled in secondary school, and 24 and 39 percent, respectively, of this population enrolled in higher education. The higher education enrollment rate of 18-year-olds in the United States was highest among the countries shown. At the age of 19, more individuals were enrolled in higher education than in secondary education in all of the countries shown except for Germany.

In order to reach a particular level, a student must have been able to answer correctly a majority of items at that level. Students scoring below 335 were classified as below level 1, students scoring 335 to 407 were at level 1, and students scoring 626 and above were classified at level 5.

Only Germany reported a higher average starting salary ($43,100). International comparisons of public secondary school teachers' salaries can give policymakers an idea of how teacher compensation varies across countries. This indicator compares average salaries for both public upper secondary school teachers with the minimum qualifications required and those with the minimum qualification and 15 years of experience in these seven countries in 2001. It also compares the ratio of these average salaries to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for each of these countries in 2001. Among the nations reporting data for 2001, the United States paid the second-highest average starting salary ($28,806) to public upper secondary school teachers with the minimum qualifications required (figure 19a). Only Germany reported a higher average starting salary ($43,100) for public upper secondary school teachers with the minimum qualifications. Among the seven countries reporting, the United States paid the third-highest average salary ($41,708) to public upper secondary school teachers with the minimum qualifications and 15 years of experience in 2001. Germany and Japan reported higher average public upper secondary salaries for teachers at this level of experience ($52,839 and $43,069, respectively). The average salary for such teachers in the United States was 32 percent higher than the salary for public upper secondary teachers at this level in France ($31,507), the G8 country reporting the lowest average salary for teachers at this level. Comparing teacher salaries to GDP per capita is a way to assess the relative value of teachers' salaries among countries. In 2001, starting public upper secondary teachers with the minimum qualifications in six of the countries presented earned less than the average per capita GDP in their respective countries (figure 19b). For example, in the United States, starting public upper secondary teachers with the minimum qualifications earned, on average, 82 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. In Germany, however, public upper secondary teachers with minimum qualifications earned 162 percent of the German GDP. But in all the countries reporting data, public upper secondary school teachers with minimum qualifications and 15 years' experience earned, on average, higher than the GDP per capita in their respective countries."}, {"section_title": "TEACHERS' WORKING TIME", "text": "Primary and secondary school teachers in the United States taught more hours per year than teachers in the other G8 countries. The amount of time teachers spend teaching in a country reflects the working environment of teachers in that country. Teaching hours and the extent of nonteaching duties are also elements of teachers' working conditions. The average number of net teaching hours, the time directly associated with teaching, varies widely across countries. Teachers at both primary and secondary education levels in the United States reported spending more time teaching in 2001 than teachers in the other six countries with data present (figure 20). On average, net teaching hours for primary education ranged from 635 hours in Japan to 1139 hours in the United States. Average teaching hours for lower secondary school teachers followed a similar pattern to that of primary school teachers, ranging from 557 hours in Japan to 1127 hours in the United States. Lower secondary as well as upper secondary school teachers in the United States had higher net teaching hours than in the other reporting countries. In all seven countries with data, primary school teachers taught for more hours than lower and upper secondary teachers, but the degree varied widely between countries. The smallest differential was in the United States, where primary school teachers reported teaching 12 more hours per year than lower secondary school teachers. France had the greatest differential, where primary school teachers had 296 more hours with students on average than upper secondary school teachers. The regulations governing teachers' working time vary across the countries. (Data not shown. Please see OECD (2003), Table D6.1 for more information. 9 ) In England, Scotland, and the United States, the total working time for which teachers are required to be available at school is specified, although in the United States it is typically specified by state and local authorities. Total working time is defined as net teaching hours plus nonteaching time associated directly with teaching, although net teaching hours sometimes includes nonteaching time associated with other activities such as counseling students. Scotland and the United States specify the proportion between net teaching hours and those for nonteaching duties, while England specifies the total number of working hours required at school. Scotland also specifies the total statutory working hours for teachers. For Germany and Japan, only the total statutory working time (net teaching hours plus nonteaching hours devoted to activities like lesson preparation and grading) is specified with no restrictions on working time within school. In Japan, teachers' working time is specified only in the general regulations on civil servants' working time."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "NOTE: Net teaching hours refers to the number of teaching hours per year.

The ages and years listed assume normal progress through the education system."}, {"section_title": "ISCED levels", "text": "ISCED is a classification framework that allows for the alignment of the educational content of programs using multiple classification criteria. The ISCED standards address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. That is, ISCED is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations, for example, but it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. ISCED allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. There are six ISCED levels. ISCED level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED level 0 programs can be either center-or school-based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. ISCED level 1 consists of primary education, which usually lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics. In the United States, elementary school is classified as ISCED level 1. At ISCED level 2, or lower secondary school, students continue to learn the basic subjects taught in level 1, but this level is typically more subject-focused and may be taught by specialized teachers. ISCED level 2 usually lasts between 2 and 6 years, and begins around the age of 11. Middle school and junior high in the United States are classified as level 2. Differences in the structure of countries' education systems often make international comparisons difficult. To improve the comparability of education indicators, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) worked with countries to create an internationally comparable method for describing levels of education across nations called the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). 10 Using the ISCED classifications as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in the G8 countries to create an overview of each country's education system. These charts and their accompanying text are intended to give the reader a general overview of the education systems of each of the G8 countries, from the preprimary level to the doctoral level. The reader is encouraged to seek out additional resources to gain a fuller and deeper understanding of each country's education system. A list of additional Internet resources is provided below."}, {"section_title": "How to read the charts", "text": "Each of the charts on the following pages is a broad representation of the education system of a G8 country. The charts are not intended to show all of the possible pathways that a student can take or the many configurations of grades that may be found within the same building. Rather, it is intended to provide a general description that is useful for comparison across the G8 countries. The colors on each chart correspond to ISCED levels (see below). The ISCED term for each level of education is written within each block. The terms in italics in each block are a country's designation for that particular level (e.g., high school for upper secondary school). The left side of each chart is labeled with the typical ages corresponding to each level of education. The age labels represent the typical age at which a student begins the corresponding year of schooling; often students are 1 year older at the end of the school year. Ages in bold text are the ages at which enrollment is universal, defined as an enrollment rate of over 90 percent. The rectangular box encasing some ages represents the At ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, student coursework is more subject specific and taught by more specialized teachers. Students often enter upper secondary education at the age of 15 or 16 and attend anywhere from 2 to 5 years. ISCED level 3 can prepare students for university, further schooling, or the labor force. Senior high school is considered ISCED level 3 in the United States. ISCED level 4 programs consist of postsecondary nontertiary programs. Postsecondary nontertiary programs are primarily vocational and are taken after the completion of secondary school, though the content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. Although not included in the charts, postsecondary nontertiary programs are described in the text. This level of education is included as part of secondary education in all G8 countries except the United States in enrollment and expenditures indicators. In the United States, postsecondary nontertiary education is not included in the enrollment indicators; expenditures for this education level are included in expenditures for higher education. ISCED level 4 programs in the United States are often in the form of 1-year certificate programs offered at community colleges. Tertiary programs are divided into ISCED levels 5A, 5B, and 6. ISCED level 5A refers to the first stage of academic higher education. Level 5A programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that are less than 5 years in duration and long programs that are 5 to 7 years in duration. U.S. bachelor's and master's degree programs are ISCED level 5A. ISCED level 5B refers to technical and vocational higher education. These programs provide a higher level of technical and vocational education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs are between 2 and 4 years in duration. ISCED level 6 refers to the second, or doctoral, stage of academic higher education.

In some L\u00e4nder, admissions tests determine if a student can take the education tracks of Gymnasium or Realschule. NOTE: There are different types of secondary school, some combining Haupschule and Realschule. The secondary school a student in Germany attends is determined by a combination of factors, depending on the L\u00e4nder: admissions tests, previous grade point average, teacher recommendations, and parents' wishes. The degree of flexibility that a parent has in choosing which educational track their child enters also varies between regions. However, the type of school a student attends is sometimes less important than the chosen track: at the end of lower secondary all students who meet the requirements receive a leaving certificate. At the Hauptschule it is generally the Hauptschulabschluss, but students who excel may receive a Realschulabschluss (called the Mittleren Schulabschluss in some L\u00e4nder). At the Realschule students typically receive the Realschulabschluss, and at the Gesamtschule, both types of degrees are offered. All students attending Gymnasium who advance to the upper secondary level automatically receive the Realschulabschluss. Some L\u00e4nder also have an orientation phase during the first 2 years of lower secondary school, which gives parents and teachers 2 more years to decide a child's educational path. In L\u00e4nder with a 6-year primary school, lower secondary school is 2 years shorter. Upper secondary: \u2022 Common name: \u25d7 Berufsschule: 3-to 4-year vocational school, which often includes an apprenticeship; many students at this school attend part-time while also doing an apprenticeship. Common degree programs: \u2022 Diplom Fachhochschule-FH: 4 year degree program in applied fields such as engineering, administration, social services, and design. Admissions to a Fachhochschule is competitive due to restricted numbers of available spaces. \u2022 Diplom Berufsakademie-BA: 3 year program of academic training combined with work experience. Offered at a Berufsakademie. \u2022 Diplom: Master's degree equivalent usually requiring minimum of 4 years of study. Universit\u00e4t offers this degree in academic fields as well as scientific, technical, and engineering fields. \u2022 Magister: Usually requires 2 years beyond the Diplom, taken at Universit\u00e4t. \u2022 Doktorgrad: Doctoral degree program, focused on research and taken at Universit\u00e4t. Normally requires at least 2 years beyond the Magister, but some students attend after receiving a Diplom. Sources:"}, {"section_title": "THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN ITALY", "text": "Figure A-4.

Reforms currently being considered propose that Istituto tecnico be included in the Liceo system, which would give graduates access to university. However, every student who has completed 5 years of upper secondary school may attend university and other forms of higher education. Students are tracked in academic as well as technical and vocational schools in Italy.\n\u2022 \u2022 Professional'no-technicheskoe uchilische: These schools provide professional education only in a program that usually lasts 2 years. \u2022 Professional'ny Litsei, Technikum, or College: These schools provide combined professional and academic programs that lead to the Attestat o Srednem (Polnom) Obshchem Obrasovanii (Certificate of Secondary Complete General Education). The programs are usually 3 or 4 years. \u2022 Srednee (ponoe) obshchee obrasovanie: Students who wish to continue their academic training enter these upper secondary schools, which last for 2 years and provide students with a Certificate of Secondary Complete General Education. This certificate qualifies students to apply for entrance into higher education. Postsecondary and Tertiary: \u2022 Entrance criteria: There are entrance exams, called Vstupitelnoe ispytanie, to be accepted into university. The number of exams and the subject varies according to the department a student wishes to attend, although all students must take an exam in Russian language and literature. Common degree programs: \u2022 Nonuniversity-level diploma: Obtained from Technikum (technical colleges) and Kolled (colleges). These diplomas are in applied or vocational fields and require 2 years of study. Students may be able to enter university-level institutions after completing this degree and transfer some or all credits toward a Bakalavr. \u2022 Diploma O Nepolnom Vysshem Obrazovanii: (Diploma of Incomplete Higher Education)-If students leave university after at least 2 years of study, they may ask for this diploma, which allows them to work in certain jobs that require some university experience but not a degree. \u2022 Bakalavr: (bachelor's degree)-Program requiring 4 years of university study. \u2022 Magistr: (master's degree)-Competitive 2-year program for students who have completed their Bakalavr's degree. Most require a year of research and a thesis. \u2022 Diplom: This specialized diploma can be obtained either by completing 1 year of study beyond the Bakalavr or by completing 5 to 6 years of continuous study after upper secondary school. \u2022 Kandidat nauk: Students who hold a Diplom or Magistr are eligible to apply for these programs, which typically last for 3 years and require students to carry out independent research and defend a dissertation in public. Equivalent of a doctorate in the United States. \u2022 Doktor nauk: This is the highest possible academic degree in the Russian Federation for which there is no U.S. equivalent. This degree requires that a Kandidat Nauk gain reputation in his or her field of study, publish independent research, and have experience supervising undergraduates. A 3-year sabbatical is often taken to prepare research for the degree, although there is no specified length of time required to obtain it. The Doktor nauk requires a public dissertation defense (in addition to the defense completed to obtain a Kandidat nauk).\n\u2022 \u2022 Compulsory?

In order to obtain the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), students take a series of singlesubject examinations after the first 2 years of upper secondary school.

NOTE: Comprehensive schools, Secondary modern schools and Grammar schools all lead to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), typically at age 16. After the first 2 years of upper secondary school, and after receiving the GCSE, students have the option of continuing school for 2 years, often called the Sixth form. Some schools do not offer the Sixth form, in which case students can transfer to a Sixth form college (which is similar but in a separate school) or go to a Further education college. Sixth forms offer the General Certificate of Education Advanced or Advanced Supplementary, which is usually required for admittance into higher education. Increasingly, however, students are able to enter higher education with a parallel qualification such as the General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ). If students chose not to enter Sixth form, their options are the labor force (often through apprenticeships or youth training courses), or a Further education sector college. Further education sector colleges have traditionally offered vocational courses, but increasingly have academic programs."}, {"section_title": "The Education System in Scotland", "text": "Figure A-8.
