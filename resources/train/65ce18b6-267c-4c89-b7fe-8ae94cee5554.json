[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "In 1974, the American Economics Association (AEA) established the Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP). CSMGEP grew out of discussions between the AEA Executive Committee and members of the Caucus of Black Economists who were extremely concerned about the very small numbers of minority economists (Spratlen, 1970). \"Minority\" was defined to include three under-represented groups in the profession --blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans. i Then, as now, there were at least two reasons for this concern. First, sound economic analysis benefits from a broader range of perspectives and experiences in the profession. Second, a more diverse faculty in institutions of higher education will provide role models for students and faculty of all races and will help to counter biased perceptions. In its 25-year history, CSMGEP has focused on identifying, training and supporting promising minorities who are interested in pursuing economics Ph.D.s and in becoming professional economists. There is some evidence that these activities have been associated with an increase in minority economists --but the absolute numbers remain small. This paper begins by presenting data on the numbers and percentages of minorities at various stages along the educational pipeline, and for doctoral degree holders in the economics profession. It then moves to describing the activities of CSMGEP, focusing on the now 25 year-old Summer Program that seeks to better prepare talented minority undergraduates for doctoral programs and on the Outreach and Mentoring initiatives of the new Pipeline Program. There is a growing body of work on gender inequalities in economics at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as for academic and non-academic employment (Kahn, 1995). In contrast, there is very little systematic literature exploring the reasons for the persistently small numbers of minority economists. ii It is hoped that this discussion will stimulate future analyses of racial and ethnic differences in the economics profession."}, {"section_title": "II.", "text": "Minorities in the Economics Degree Pipeline I begin with information about blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans along the way to receiving Ph.D.'s in economics. In contrast to other studies that tend to distinguish U.S. citizens from all foreigners, the tables below include permanent residents as well as U.S. citizens where possible. This is because blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately represented among permanent residents -a group more likely than other foreigners to remain in the United States. In the late 1970s and mid-1980s, roughly 9 percent of B.A.s in all fields were awarded to minority group members; about 6 percent to blacks, less than 3 percent to Hispanics, and half a percent or less to Native Americans. However, by the mid-1990s, the share of total bachelors degrees received by minorities had risen to 12 percent; about 2 percentage points of the increase was due to a rise in the share going to Hispanics, and the remaining percentage point to the share going to blacks (U.S. Department of Education, 1997, Table 265). iii Table 1 presents the allocation of degrees to minority students by field in 1995, the first year for which such data were available. Economics is similar to the overall average, with 12 percent of economics B.A.'s earned by minorities. This percentage is significantly smaller than the percentage of B.A.s awarded to minorities in political science and sociology, but slightly greater than the share completing degrees in math and engineering.    , andYear, 1977-1996 Affirmative Action table #2: PhDs Awarded to U.S. Citizens by Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Fine Field of Doctorate, andYear, 1976-1996 This is a statistical compilation of data issued by the National Opinion Research Center, Doctorate Data Project. (NSF/NIH/NEH/USED/USDA, Survey of Earned Doctorates) Individuals classified as \"race/ethnicity unknown\" are excluded from these figures.    over time, these groups combined account for just 4 percent of AEA economists who received their degrees since 1988. In the AEA membership data, the increase by year-received-Ph.D. has been much more pronounced for Hispanics than for blacks. The AEA survey also asks about the primary field of members. This information, presented in Table 6, shows that black members are relatively more concentrated than non-minorities in the fields of macroeconomics and labor/demographics. Hispanic members are relatively concentrated in international, development and health/education. A striking feature of the data is just how few minority economists there are in specific fields. Finally, we look at minority representation on economics department faculty. Table 7 summarizes data collected through the 1997 Universal Academic Questionnaire (UAQ  "}, {"section_title": "IV. CSMGEP Activities", "text": "The mission of the Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) is to increase the representation of minority groups in economics. Thus, its main objective has been to increase the number of economics Ph.D.s earned by minorities through various interventions targeted at minority undergraduate and/or graduate students. These interventions are intended to give students access to additional information about economics as a profession and about graduate programs, to strengthen students' preparation for doctoral programs and to enhance students' support networks --including minority peers, role models and mentors. The rationales behind providing students with information and improving their preparation are self-evident. However, there is less consensus about the importance of peer groups xii , role models and mentors xiii on student's success in higher education. Indeed, the existing empirical literature on these topics (much of which focuses on gender, not ethnicity) is small and inconclusive.  are provided on separate lines. Not surprisingly, the data are most complete for participants from the more recent Programs. However, the University of Texas data should be interpreted with caution, since many of these participants are still completing their undergraduate degrees, and others had already already been accepted to graduate programs when they participated in the Summer Program. Source: These data were gathered by CSMGEP and staff on the Summer Program at the University of Texas at Austin. The information is preliminary (as of 4/14/99), and searches are still underway to locate and survey past participants. Note that many participants from recent Summer Programs are still completing their undergraduate degrees, and some are working, but plan to pursue advanced degrees within the next few years. Of the 348 participants for whom we have information, 129 (or 37 percent) enrolled in economics Ph.D. programs, as shown in "}, {"section_title": "The Economics Pipeline Project", "text": "In 1998, CSMGEP secured funding for its Economics Pipeline Project. The objective of the Pipeline is to expand the pool of minority Ph.D. economists by using a series of interventions targeted at critical junctures in their training and professional development. The junctures include interest in economics as a major, preparation for graduate school, successful completion of core theory and field exams as a first-year student, and initiation of dissertation research. Statistical evidence is not available on the proportions of minority groups compared to nonminority groups that are lost at each point along the pipeline from undergraduate school to post-doctoral success. However, the basic conception of the pipeline is not minority-specific; these are critical junctures where many students are likely to have difficulties. The Pipeline Project adds two new programs (the Outreach and Mentor Programs) to the existing Summer Program so as to establish a longer-term support system for minority students interested in pursuing economics Ph.D.'s. The Outreach Program will extend support by seeking to attract students early in their college experience. In the initiation stages at the time of writing, it will begin by developing activities on a target campus. It also intends to maintain a clearing-house of information relevant for those interested in careers as professional economists. The Mentor Program, now underway, extends support beyond the Summer Program's preparation for graduate school. Participating students are matched with a mentor who will be expected to work cooperatively and actively with the student's departmental adviser. They are also linked to minority economists, intended to serve as role models and a peer support network. To evaluate the Mentor program, CSMGEP intends to compare the progress of participants with general norms for completion of educational milestones in the participants' own departments and with outcomes for other comparison groups."}, {"section_title": "V. Concluding Remarks", "text": "The absolute number of economics Ph.D.'s earned by minorities who are either U.S. citizens or permanent residents is small: about three dozen per year. Even a figure this low contains some good news: There have been sustained increases in the absolute numbers of economic Ph.D.s awarded to both black and Hispanic scholars. The percent of economics doctorates earned has risen over the past two decades, and is approaching the average for all fields. However, the very low numbers of minority economists strongly suggest that at key junctures along the pipeline to becoming a professional academic economist, minority individuals seem more prone to exit than do nonminorities. In particular, having received a B.A. in economics, they are less likely to complete a Ph.D. Having received a Ph.D., blacks especially are less likely to be employed at a 4-year college or university. Future work should seek to better understand the differential experiences and outcomes for minorities at various stages in their education and professional development, to fulfull the goal of increasing minority representation in economics. i. The terminology used throughout this paper was chosen in part to be consistent with this history and in part for want of general consensus on which alternatives --like African-American, Latino, and so on --are preferable. ii. There is, of course, a more general literature on minorities and higher education. For example, see Fleming (1985) as well as the papers in Elam (1989) and in Altbach and Lomotey (1991). Holzer and Neumark (1999) provide a comprehensive survey of the theory and evidence on affirmative action in both employment and education. iii. Individuals for whom race is classified as \"unknown\" are excluded from minority and overall totals. This especially effects the 1976-81 period, reducing the totals by 6.5% on average. iv. Some recent papers contain additional detail about U.S. economics Ph.D.s. Siegfried and Stock (1999) provide a profile of graduate training in economics, focusing on the labor market experience for new Ph.D.s. Hansen (1991) and Krueger et al. (1991) present the major findings and recommendations from an AEA commissioned study of graduate education in economics in U.S. universities. Aslanbeigui and Montecinos (1998)  viii. A survey of NEA members is in process, but was unavailable at the time this paper was prepared. ix. The last column in Table 5 shows all 1997 AEA members who were U.S. citizens and had a Ph.D. The second to last column shows the subset of 8877 members who also provided the year in which they received their Ph.D. For those members with multiple Ph.D.s, this is the year in which the first Ph.D. was received. x. The AEA sponsored Universal Academic Questionnaire is a survey of economic departments taken each Fall and administered by Charles E. Scott and John J. Siegfried. Information from the UAQ is available from the AEA. Summary tables will be published in the Papers and Proceedings of the American Economic Review starting in 1999. xi. An alternative source of data on minority status of professors is the annual survey conducted by the AEA Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP). In 1997, CSWEP received responses from 95 of 118 departments surveyed, all of which are Ph.D.-granting. This survey did ask about Native American faculty, but none were identified by respondents. The CSWEP survey results are broadly comparable to the UAQ results discussed in the text; however, the CSWEP data show more black faculty (especially full professors) than the UAQ data, while the UAQ data show more Hispanic faculty. The CSWEP survey also includes questions about Ph.D. students and about students receiving Bachelors degrees in economics. xii. Work on the role of peer groups is difficult to interpret. Case and Katz (1991) find that (neighborhood) peer effects have an important influence on behavior and outcomes for disadvantaged youth. But peer groups are likely to be endogenous. (See Evans, Oates and Schwab, 1992, which also contains a brief literature summary.) More fundamentally, researchers do not know how individuals form their reference groups (Mansky 1993). Finally, returning to the focus of this paper, analyses that define peers based on neighborhood and classmate characteristics may give little insight into the potential role of external peer networks --minorities studying economics at other institutions --for college and graduate students who are one of very few minority individuals in their own departments. xiii. Recent studies about the importance of role-models also reached mixed conclusions (Ehrenberg, 1995 andHolzer andNeumark, 1999). In particular, Rothstein (1995) concludes that the share of female faculty at a college or university is positively associated with the percent of female students who earn an advanced degree. Other studies find little or no evidence that female role-models affect school performance or choice of major by female students. (Canes and Rosen, 1995;Neumark and Gardecki, 1998). However, Evans (1992) does find a positive role-model effect for black high school students --even though he finds no such effect for female students. Frierson et. Al. (1994) find that black college students' attitudes towards research are positively affected by the race (and gender) of their mentor in a summer research program. Work on implications for black students of attending historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) is relevant for both peer group and role model effects. Ehrenberg and Rothstein (1994) conclude that attending an HBCU increases the probability black students will graduate within seven years, but has no effect on subsequent earnings or probability of enrolling in graduate school. In contrast, Constantine (1995) does find a positive earnings effect for black students attending an HBCU. xiv. Other fields also maintain programs to increase diversity of their Ph.D. recipients. For example, The American Sociological Association (ASA) runs a minority fellowship program that provides financial assistance, mentoring and research training. It funded roughly 20 percent of the sociology Ph.D.s earned by minorities during 1978-96. In 1994, ASA launched the 5-year MOST Program (Minority Opportunities through School Transformation. It is working with 18 departments (4-year and university) to improve minority recruitment, retention and training by focusing on issues such as climate and curricula. The American Political Science Association (APSA) maintains the Minority Identification Project, which provides career and graduate school information to minority undergraduates who can then be recruited by (the more than 40) participating graduate programs. It also runs the annual 5-week Ralph Bunche Summer Institute for advanced undergraduates interested in a Ph.D., as well as a minority fellowship program for doctoral students in political science. Additional information about these activities can be obtained from the ASA and the APSA. xv. Alexis (1975) describes the history and first year of the Summer Program. See also the annual minutes"}]
