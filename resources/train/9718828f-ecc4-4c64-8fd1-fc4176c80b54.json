Although raising the level of state's student performance standards may be touted as a move for enhancing statewide curriculum expectations for all students, its ultimate impact depends on the initial achievement level of students as well as the capacity of schools and teachers that have to provide appropriate interventions for newly identified students who fail to meet the higher standards (Brown & Clift, 2010; Lee, Shin, & Amo, in press ). It may also influence the scale and implementation of state interventions under NCLB by increasing the number of failing schools and districts identified as in need of improvement. Previous studies revealed largely inconsistent results on the effects of states' student performance standards on academic achievement under NCLB (Lee & Reeves, 2012; Wong, Cook & Steiner, 2009) .\nIn light of these concerns, it is critical to know whether and how states' external standards have had any measurable impact on student achievement directly or indirectly by influencing internal standards set by teachers in their own classrooms. The goals of this study are to understand the distribution and impact of teachers' (internal, de facto) standards vis-\u00e0-vis states' (external, de jure) performance standards and to understand student-related and teacher/ school-related factors that might facilitate or constrain the impact of those standards on reading and math achievement. The key research questions are as follows: (1) Which type of standards, statewide common standards or teacher standards, have more solid linkage with students' academic performance? (2) Do teacher standards mediate the linkage between state standard and student achievement? (3) Do teacher standards vary among different groups of students to influence their achievement differently? between multiple (and sometimes conflicting) sources of influences, for example between external and internal or formal and informal standards. Sociological studies based on institutionalism theory acknowledge the gap between policy and practice in loosely coupled school organizations where teachers often translate external standards in their own terms or replace them by their own expectations (Elmore, 2005; Meyer & Rowan, 1978; Rowan & Miskel, 1999) .\n2 During the dynamic reciprocal process of instruction, teacher expectations or standards influence student achievement, but at the same time student achievement also shapes teacher expectations or standards.\nPrevious studies revealed powerful roles of student or family background characteristics and prior achievement in determining the directionality of mutual relationship between performance and expectations; student performance tends to drive teacher expectations more for disadvantaged minority students (Crano & Mellon, 1978; Ferguson, 2007; Goldenberg, Gallimore, Reese, & Garnier, 2001; Guskey, 1982; Jussim & Eccles, 1992; Mckown & Weinstein, 2008; Wong, 1980) . Previous studies also suggested unconditional or conditional inequalities in the distribution of teacher standards by student/family characteristics such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Specifically, teachers often held lower expectations for children from certain minority groups (Ferguson, 1998 (Ferguson, , 2007 Mckown & Weinstein, 2002; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007; Wiggan, 2007; Wong, 1980; Van Matre, Valentine & Cooper, 2000) . Beyond inequalities at the classroom or school level, however, there was a lack of research on national or statewide gaps in the rigor of performance standards. While a recent study showed some linkage between statewide student performance standards and racial/ethnic composition of students at the state level (Reed, 2010) , it is unknown whether and how unequal distributions of state standards affect teacher standards and student achievement.\nBuilding upon prior research, we explored and compared two different models, namely the external versus internal standards-based education models, in an effort to understand how educational standards (student performance standards, in particular) work in multilayered school systems. Figure 1 illustrates an \"external\" standards-based education policy approach by which the state's top-down mandate dictates common standards regardless of school and student characteristics. In this model, it is hypothesized that gains in state standards have an indirect impact on gains in student achievement: Teachers are expected to align their own student performance standards with externally imposed standards used for high-stakes testing so that teacher standards mediate the impact of state standards on student achievement.\n3 Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the ultimate impact of gains in state standards on student achievement gains depends on gains in teacher standards as a mediator. This mediation analysis involves two steps: (1) Determining whether statewide common standards for student performance have had any impact on teachers' own standards for individual student performance (testing the theory of action for policy implementation) and (2) determining whether teacher standards for student performance influence students' academic achievement (testing the conceptual theory of underlying policy mechanism).\nIn contrast, Figure 2 illustrates an alternative \"internal\" standards-based education model in which changes in external standards hardly permeate classroom practices but instead teachers set and modify their own standards for students, based on prior student achievement, to influence students' current achievement. In this model, gains in teacher standards and student achievement are expected to influence each other largely independent of the influences of external state standards. Elaborating on hypothetical reciprocal relationships between gains in teacher standards and student achievement gains as shown by bidirectional arrows in the internal standardsbased education model, we compared the relative strength of two paths: a performance-driven path (i.e., stronger influence of student performance on teacher standards) versus a standard-driven path (i.e., stronger influence of teacher standards on student performance). Further, we tested the hypothesis that key student background characteristics such as gender, race, and SES influence the rigor of teacher standards directly or indirectly through their influences on student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Our method for estimating the effects of state standards on student achievement capitalized on the fact that we had multiple observations of state performance standards and corresponding student achievement outcomes for each state (Grade 4 and Grade 8). Likewise, we utilized multiple observations of teacher standards and achievement outcomes for each student (Grade 5 and Grade 8) in order to identify the effects of teachers' performance standards for students. We employed difference-in-differences approach to address potential endogeneity problems and obtain an unbiased estimate of the effects of standards on achievement. First, we measured the rigor of state or teacher standards at each of the two grades and then compute differences (gains) in standardized measures of the rigor between those two grades. Unlike the cross-sectional variation in the rigor of standards that are likely influenced by many factors including background characteristics (correlated with both standards and achievement outcomes at particular grade level), we assumed that the differences in the rigor of state performance standards between different grades in the same state or differences in the rigor of teacher standards between different grades for the same student are more likely to vary randomly among the units and are thus independent from the influences of potential extraneous variables. Second, we also computed differences (gains) in student achievement results between two grades and then regressed those test score gains on corresponding gains in the rigor of state standards as well as gains in the rigor of teacher standards. Since such variations in longitudinal changes were subject to regression to the mean threat, we controlled for the baseline status of rigor measured at the lower grade. The key question was whether such between-state or between-student variations in between-grade differences in the rigor of their standards are systematically related to corresponding variations in student achievement gains. Our analytical approach would enable us to examine value-added contributions of raising statelevel or classroom-level performance standards to students' achievement trajectories."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Our primary source of data for teacher standards and student achievement was Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) with Grades 5 to 8 reading and math achievement measures. We restricted the data analysis to Grades 5 and 8 because those grades were subject to the NCLB mandate of annual state reading and math assessments and thus teachers in those grades were expected to be aware of their state's student performance standards for students. More importantly, Grades 5 and 8 from ECLS-K data could be matched to state performance standards that were measured at Grade 4 and Grade 8 only. The year of assessments for Grades 5 and 8 were 2004 and 2007, respectively, which correspond to the initial period of NCLB implementation. Unlike previous research that has focused on learning gaps during early elementary school years using ECLS-K data (Lee & Burkam, 2002; Palardy & Rumburger, 2008) , this study focused on learning trajectories at the middle grade level. A closer look into the relationship between standards and achievement during middle school grades might help give new insight into potential weaknesses in this critical transition period; American students started to fall behind their peers in other developed nations with more rigorous academic standards, particularly in math (Lee & Fish, 2010) . We also limited the analytical sample to students who remained in the same state throughout Grades 5 to 8 periods, and who had data on teacher standards and related variables (see the descriptions of variables below). The final analytic sample for reading included 3,764 students from 775 schools in 40 states, whereas the final analytic sample for math included 1,874 students from 615 schools in 40 states. 4 The sample size for math was smaller than for reading, because of differences in teacher sampling by subject; all children were assigned to have an English teacher complete a questionnaire across grades, whereas only half of the children were randomly assigned to have a mathematics teacher complete a questionnaire. There was no indication of bias in this subsample selection as a result of random assignment for math portion; we compared excluded student sample with the final analytic sample and did not find any significant differences between them in terms of student achievement and background characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "Appendix summarizes information and descriptive statistics of all variables by subject (reading and math) and level (student, school, state). The key outcome variables were based on reading and math achievement scale scores generated by Item Response Theory (IRT) methods, and teacher ratings of student achievement:\nStudent achievement scores. Examination of achievement gains uses the IRT scale scores (i.e., estimated number of right answers) from standardized reading and mathematics assessments in the ECLS-K. The ECLS-K reading assessment tested basic reading skills (i.e., familiarity with print, recognition of letters and phonemes, decoding), vocabulary, and reading comprehension skills. The reliability of scores for the reading assessments ranged from .93 to .97 (Pollack, Najarian, Rock, & Atkins-Burnett, 2005) . The ECLS-K mathematics assessment measured number sense; knowledge of properties, operations and measurement; geometry and spatial sense; and skills related to data analysis, statistics and probability, patterns, algebra, and functions. The reliability of scores for the ECLS-K mathematics assessments ranged from .92 to .95 (Pollack et al., 2005) . While these ECLS-K assessments were not directly aligned to either NAEP or state standards in general, NAEP content and process frameworks for reading and math were used as the basis of eighth grade assessment design (Najarian, Pollack, & Sorongon, 2009 ). The ECLS-K assessments would provide independent, unbiased measures of student learning in typical school settings, and unlike high-stakes state tests, there are no consequences attached to test results for students and their teachers.\nTeacher ratings of student proficiency. Examination of teacher ratings relies on an indirect cognitive assessment, the Academic Rating Scale (ARS).\nTeachers rated each child's skills, knowledge and behaviors on a 5-point scale of \"Not Yet (1),\" \"Beginning (2),\" \"In progress (3),\" \"Intermediate (4),\" \"Proficient (5).\" Proficient means that the child demonstrates skills, knowledge, or behavior competently and consistently. The reliability of rating scales administered were very high, ranging from .91 to .94 for language/ literacy and .94 for mathematical thinking (Rock & Pollack, 2002) . The areas measured in the ARS overlap and augment what is measured in the direct cognitive assessment. The items were designed to ascertain the current skill levels, knowledge, and behaviors of the child in each grade based on the teacher's past observations of the child with the selected content. There was a change in the rating scale for 8th grade, when teachers rated each child's skills, knowledge, and behaviors as \"Outstanding (5),\" \"Very Good (4),\" \"Good (3),\" \"Fair (2),\" or \"Poor (1).\" English teachers were asked about children's skills in written and oral expression. Mathematics teachers were asked about children's skills in mathematics, such as problem solving and demonstrating mathematical reasoning. A high degree of reliability (above .9) was also reported for the ARS in Grade 8 (Najarian et al., 2009) .\nRigor of teacher standards. The rigor of teacher standards concerns how high are teachers' grading or evaluation standards for student achievement in reading and math. The gap between aforementioned ARS teacher ratings and IRT scale scores was used as an indicator of the rigor of teacher standards for student performance in reading and math. Specifically, both variables were converted into standard scores (i.e., z-scores with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) and then difference in scores was computed: the rigor of teacher standards = (z-scores of standardized test scores)-(z-scores of teacher ratings for each individual student). Since the rigor of teacher standard may vary among students within the same classroom, this variable was treated as a student-level variable. Change in rigor in teacher standards was calculated by subtracting rigor of teacher standards in Grade 5 (standardized) from rigor of teacher standards in Grade 8 (also standardized).\nRigor of state standards. The rigor of state standards concerns how high are states' proficiency standards for student achievement in reading and math. The gap in proficiency rate between the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) state assessment and states' own assessment was used to measure the rigor of state-level standards in matched years, subjects, and grades. Specifically, this study measured the rigor of state reading and math proficiency standards by computing the average differences between NAEPbased proficiency and state assessment-based proficiency for Grades 4 and 8 in reading and math during 2003, 2005 and 2007. 5 After both variables were converted into standard z-scores, the rigor of the Grade 4 state standard was subtracted from the rigor of Grade 8 state standard to compute the change in rigor of state standards.\nWhat accounts for interstate variations in the rigor of performance standards? One possible extraneous factor is the high-stakes accountability policy that generates pressure for gaming the rules (Lee, 2010) . The states that have a stronger accountability system with high-stakes testing might choose to adopt relatively lower standards for the sake of inflating proficiency results. This tendency may have persisted under NCLB when all states were subject to the same federal requirement of high-stakes accountability. To address this potential confounder, the study controlled for the fidelity of state NCLB policy implementation. A composite index of NCLB state implementation was constructed from the Education Commission of the States (ECS) database which tracks state laws, departmental regulations, board rules, directives and practices related to requirements across seven major sections of the NCLB legislation: (1) NCLB Standards and Assessments, (2) NCLB Accountability (AYP), (3) NCLB School Improvement, (4) NCLB Safe Schools, (5) NCLB Supplemental Services, (6) NCLB Report Card, (7) NCLB Teacher Quality. This study combined the 3-point scale ratings of state policy implementation status among 38 items in the seven areas (3 = on target, 2 = partially on target, 1 = not on target) as updated as of September 2007. This state-level variable was referred to as NCLB Implementation.\nThe study also included, for another state-level policy covariate, the availability of school and teacher resources that might confound the impact of standards-based education policy. The effects of key school and teacher resources on academic achievement have been well demonstrated (see Greenwald, Hedges, & Laine, 1996; Grissmer, Flanagan, Kawata, & Williamson, 2000) . Previous study suggests that state activism in educational accountability policy did not necessarily bring about systemic changes in school/teacher resource allocations (Lee & Wong, 2004) . A composite index of states' educational resources was constructed based on principal component analysis of six state-level aggregate variables: In-field teaching rate in math, in-field teaching rate in reading; class size (Grades 7-12) in math; class size (Grades 7-12) in reading; student-teacher ratio (elementary level); per pupil expenditures. This variable was referred to as Educational Capacity.\nIn addition to the above state-level covariates, this study considered variables related to student, teacher, and school characteristics. Student characteristics that were originally considered include not only student demographic information (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, and SES) but also students' efforts towards learning, such as the frequency of work at best, average daily attendance, tardiness in classroom, and whether students engaged with more reading/math related activities, and so forth. Classroom or teacher level variables included teaching experiences, teaching certification, instructional time in reading/math related activities, and classroom behavior. School-level contextual variables that tap into school resources and school climate were considered in addition to school location and school type. For parsimonious modeling, final analysis retained only variables at the student and school levels that were associated with both teacher standards and student achievement."}, {"section_title": "HLM Models", "text": "Building on the results of preliminary analyses, we employed hierarchical linear models (HLM) to address nested data structure in ECLS-K (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) . We ran sequential three-level HLM analyses (Level 1 as student, Level 2 as school, Level 3 as state) to test hypotheses based on the two aforementioned models (i.e., Figures 1 and 2) . Specifically, HLM Level-1 models retained significant predictors including student's family SES, gender, race/ethnicities, and past achievement test scores because of the relationships between these variables and with teacher standards and their unique contribution to achievement gains. Since we performed grand-mean centering for all Level-1 and Level-2 predictors to adjust for between-state differences in student and school background characteristics, the state-level standard gain was used as the key predictor for the Level-3 model after controlling for state-level policy-related variables including state accountability and capacity. First, we tested the mediation effect as proposed in the model of external standards-based education (Paths A, B and C in Figure 1 ). For an investigation of path A, we examined the effect of gain in state standards on gain in teacher standards. For an investigation of Paths B and C, a three-level HLM model was used to examine the effect of gain in teacher standards on student achievement gains along with the direct effect of gain in state standards on student achievement gains. Second, we examined the reciprocation effect (Path B\u0384 in Figure 2 ) illustrated in the internal standards-based education model.\nIn addition to the main analysis, sensitivity analyses were performed in order to draw more robust causal estimates of the bidirectional relationship between standards and achievement and to address possible model specification errors. We used fixed effects and instrumental variable methods together to further address endogeneity problems (see Schneider, Carnoy, Kilpatrick, Schmidt, & Shavelson, 2007) . Specifically, we used school dummy variables as fixed effects to account for nonrandom between-school student sorting/ assignment processes. At the same time, we used within-school grade average values of teacher standards as an instrument for individual teacher standard variable to correct for possible omission of unobserved confounders in the model. 6 We also expanded our model with the addition of Level-1 interactions between background variables and key predictors. These analyses provided a check for robustness of the causal effect estimates and offered a closer look at how gender, SES, or race/ethnicity moderate the impact of teacher standards on student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Assumptions and Limitations", "text": "We made certain assumptions about the measurement and analysis of state standards. It was assumed that NAEP is an appropriate tool with common criterion for comparing results from the states' own assessments and determining the rigor of state performance standards in matched subjects and grades. While there are debates about the content of NAEP as a gold standard to judge the validity of state assessments, NAEP remains the only tool for cross-checking different states' test results (see Koretz & Hamilton, 2006; Lee, 2007; Resnick, 1999) . NAEP cut scores for \"Proficient\" grow from 238 in fourth grade to 281 in eighth grade (43 point gain) in reading, and the cutscores grow from 249 in fourth grade to 299 in eighth grade (50 point gain) in math. If we treat those cutscore gains as change in national performance standards between Grades 4 and 8, how do individual states' standards change relative to the NAEP standards? Prior research suggested that there are inconsistencies and variations between different grade levels in terms of the rigor of state performance standards (Cronin, Dahlin, Adkins, & Kingsury, 2007) . This study exploits the fact that the correlations of standards between different grade levels are not perfect due to uneven rigor, and that there are substantial variations in the size of gains in rigor of both state and teacher standards.\nIt was also assumed that teachers make informed and thus reliable judgments of their students' academic performance. The assumption may be reasonable in the context of ECLS-K teacher survey that asks teachers to provide ratings close to the end of school year. The gap between teacher ratings and test scores may arise from many reasons including the inaccuracy of teacher assessment relative to standardized test score as a criterion. However, the gap does not imply that one type of measure is more valid than the other, and we chose to use standardized test scores as a common yardstick of academic achievement for the sake of comparing teacher ratings across different schools and classrooms. Prior research suggested that teacher perceptions and evaluations of student ability or achievement may be influenced by several factors related to tasks, students, and teachers (Coladarci, 1986; Ready & Wright, 2010) . Investigation of those factors that explain variations among teacher ratings was beyond the scope of this study.\nFurther, it was assumed that the teacher standards have been communicated to students formally or informally through instructional and other classroom processes. Previous studies suggested that teacher expectations and standards influence their classroom teaching behaviors (Good & Brophy, 1972; Good, 1987; Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1992; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007) . It was beyond the scope of this study to examine specific mechanisms by which teacher standards are communicated and translated to influence academic achievement for different groups of students and vice versa. When teacher standards reflect more of local standards or norms (e.g., school average proficiency rate) rather than national standards or norms, curricula and instructional practices are more likely to be sensitive to internal demands in their own schools (e.g., school principals' policy, student needs) than external demands outside schools (e.g., state curriculum policy, NCTM math teaching standards).\nThis study was designed to test two different models of standards-based education policy impact by employing multiple causal effects estimation methods: Multilevel longitudinal analysis and instrumental variable with fixed effects analysis. Subsequent investigations need to further address potential selection biases by considering unobserved extraneous variables that might confound the relationship between standards and achievement. To generalize the findings to grade levels other than that of middle grades, we also need to conduct a subsequent study with other datasets. A case study of selected states would be desirable in order to better understand the circumstances under which external standards-based education policy did or did not work effectively to influence both teacher standards and student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Analysis of State Standards", "text": "When forty states were classified into three groups by the rigor of standards into three groups (high 25%, middle 50%, low 25%), it turned out that most states belong to the same group across subjects and grades. The group of states with consistently high standards includes California, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Wyoming, whereas the group of states with consistently low standards includes Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. Figure 3 illustrates the discrepancy between NAEP and state assessment results in terms of math proficiency rates, which were used to measure the rigor of state performance standards. Correlation analysis showed hardly any evidence of systematic relationship between student demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, SES) and state standards. For example, the correlations between students' race being Black and their states' rigor of standards were slightly negative, but were very weak (r = -.23 for Grade 4 reading; r = -.19 for Grade 4 math; r = -.10 for Grade 8 reading; r = -.16 for Grade 8 math). Slightly positive but extremely weak relationships were also found between student SES and state rigor of standards (r = .11 for Grade 4 reading; r = .06 for Grade 4 math; r = .04 for Grade 8 reading; r = .06 for Grade 8 math). This indicates the absence of apparent demographic bias in setting the rigor of standards at the state level.\nGains in the rigor of state performance standards between Grade 4 and Grade 8 were examined next. Figure 4 shows the distribution of Grade 4 and Grade 8 math performance standards in z-score units among all forty states. A similar pattern is found for reading. While the rigor of Grade 4 state standards was strongly associated with the rigor of Grade 8 state standards (r = .75 for reading; r = .87 for math), not all states had consistently high or low level of standards across grades and those differences in the rigor of standards between Grades 4 and 8 varied to some extent among states. As shown in Figure 4, than at Grade 4, whereas states that are above the same line have relatively higher standards, thus increasing the relative rigor of standards from Grade 4 to Grade 8. Some high rigor states such as Massachusetts have relatively lower standards at Grade 8, whereas some states with lower rigor in Grade 4 such as Texas have relatively higher standards at Grade 8. States like North Carolina and Maine maintain the same relative level of standards between Grades 4 and 8. Regardless of the gain in rigor of state standards, students made varied amount of academic progress with differential achievement gains between Grade 5 and Grade 8; the correlations between gain the rigor of state standards and achievement gains were close to zero (r = -.06 in reading and .06 in math)."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Analysis of Teacher Standards", "text": "The correlations between ARS teacher ratings and IRT test scores in ECLS-K were moderately positive across subjects and grades: r = .54 for reading and .55 for math in Grade 5; and r = .54 for reading and .53 for math in Grade 8. Moderate correlations between the two variables may be attributable to scale-related factors including restricted range of ARS scales resulting in possible floor or ceiling effects. Although the wording of ARS ratings scale is more akin to criterion-referenced scale (curriculum-based criteria) rather than norm-referenced scale (comparison to class or school average), it remains unknown what specific frame of references teachers actually used when rating the proficiency level of their students' knowledge and skills. The gap in students' relative performance between ARS ratings and IRT scores may be more severe when teachers lack common standards or frame of references for student assessment/evaluation. In this study, we converted both ARS and IRT scores in standard z-scores (based on the national sample norms) before computing the difference between them and using it as a proxy indicator of teacher standards; the higher IRT z-scores relative to ARS z-scores (i.e., relatively higher rank ordered by test scores than by teacher ratings), the more rigorous performance standards teachers apply to their students.\nWhen all students were classified into three groups based on the rigor of their teachers' performance standards at each grade (high 25%, middle 50%, low 25%), it turned out that less than half of the students (44% in reading and 40% in math) stay in the same group across Grades 4 and 8. This suggests that performance standards for the same students may vary from grade to grade as they change their teachers. There were significant differences in achievement gains according to whether the rigor of standards increased or decreased over time. Simple correlation analyses showed that student achievement gains between Grades 5 and 8 were significantly positively related to corresponding gains in the rigor of teacher standards (r = .55 in reading; r = .28 in math). In contrast, there were no systematic associations between gain in the rigor of teacher standards and gain in the rigor of state standards (r = -.02 in reading; r =.06 in math)."}, {"section_title": "Multilevel Analysis of State and Teacher Standards and Student Achievement", "text": "In order to take into account nested data structure and disentangle the relationships between performance standards and academic achievement at multiple levels of the school system, HLM analyses were conducted to examine the effects of student, teacher/school, and state characteristics simultaneously. Both unconditional and conditional HLM model results are reported in Tables 1-2 . Path diagrams with standardized regression coefficients (beta weights) based on HLM conditional model results are shown in Figure 5 . The path coefficients were computed to assess the practical significance of relations between key predictors and outcomes.\nFor the external standards model, the results indicate that the linkage between gain in state standards and gain in teacher standards was weak (Path A is insignificant). By and large, students who attended schools in states with increasingly rigorous student performance standards did not experience relatively higher teacher standards from Grade 5 to Grade 8 than their peers in states with decreasingly rigorous or stagnant standards. Similarly, the linkage between gain in state standards and student achievement gains was inconsistent and broken as well. Gains in state-level standards had insignificant effects on students' reading and math gains in achievement. This broken linkage indicates that the students' academic achievement gains were not directly influenced by changes in the rigor of state standards. A supplementary analysis of the relationship using fixed effects regression model with control for state dummy variables also supported the results, showing that variations in the rigor of standards between Grades 4 and 8 were not systematically associated with student achievement gains between the two grades in the same states.\nFor the internal standards model, the linkage between gains in teacher standards and student achievement gains, on the other hand, was congruent and relatively tight; Paths B and B\u0384 were significantly positive with the effect size (beta weights) ranging from .07, p < .01, to .55, p < .001. This bidirectional relationship suggests that the effect runs in both directions, showing both significant effects of teacher standards on student achievement (Path B) and effects of student achievement on teacher standards (Path B\u0384). The arrow from student performance gains to gain in teacher standards shows similar magnitude of effect (despite being slightly weaker) compared to the arrow from gain in teacher standards to student performance gains. Therefore, higher teacher standards may not only lead to student achievement gains but also reflect progress in student achievement Tables 1 and 2 ).\nfor both math and reading. The greater the increase in the rigor of teacher standards, the greater the achievement gains and vice versa. For performance-driven standards paths under the internal model, we expected to see significant paths of influences from student achievement gains to gains in teacher standards, as denoted by arrows B\u0384 in Figure 5 . In fact, there were strong effects of student achievement gains on gain in teacher standard, after controlling for 5th grade teacher standard. These standardized regression coefficients were .07, p < .01 (math) and .40, p < .001 (reading), suggesting that student achievement gains might bring gains in the rigor of teacher standards. In addition, the relationship between previous standards and gains in teacher standards was significantly negative and moderate, with the path coefficients ranging from -.50, p < .001, to -.68, p < .001. This suggests that higher initial standards were associated with significantly lower gains in standards, possibly due to ceiling effects and regression to the mean.\nSimilar to performance-driven paths, the results also supported the standarddriven performance paths under the internal model, as depicted by arrows B in Figures 5. There were significantly positive and moderate effects of teacher standards on student achievement after controlling for student achievement in 5th grade and other covariates: the path coefficients are .19, p < .001 (math) and .55, p < .001 (reading). This suggests that increases in the rigor of teacher standards would lead to greater gains in student achievement. A supplementary analysis of the effects of teacher standards, using two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model with the inclusion of school fixed effects and the use of grade average teacher standards as an instrumental variable, gave similar results with slightly smaller effect estimates for the teacher standards (b= .28, p <.001 in reading; b= .13, p < .001 in math); variations in the rigor of teacher standards between Grades 4 and 8 were systematically associated with student achievement gains for both subjects in the same schools.\nThe effects of gender, SES, and race/ethnicity were not congruent between performance-driven and standard-driven paths. For the performancedriven standards path, there were statistically insignificant or inconsistently significant effects of gender, race/ethnicity, and SES on teacher standards after controlling for student achievement gains. This suggests no conditional racial and socioeconomic inequality in terms of teachers raising or lowering the rigor of standards after considering students' academic progress (i.e., conditional on academic achievement gains as measured by standardized tests) in the middle grades. In contrast, there was evidence of conditional gender inequality in relation to teachers' reading standards, since the effects of being female remained significant after controlling for achievement gains in the performance-driven path. Different patterns emerged for the standard-driven performance path in which some significant effects of student and family background characteristics such as SES and race/ethnicity were found in certain subjects. Specifically, there was a significantly positive effect of SES on both reading and math achievement gains and a significantly negative effect of being Black on reading achievement gains implying that, independent of teacher standards, academic growth may occur more among the students who come from higher SES background and less for Black students.\nIn terms of the school level variables, school climate variable showed a positive influence in both models. Gains in math teacher standards were greater for the 8th grade students who came from schools with more positive school climates. At the same time, the effects of school climate on reading achievement gains were significant. The effects of school location and school type variables were inconsistent across subjects and across models; teachers in rural districts demonstrated greater gains in math standards but not reading standards, and students in Catholic or other private schools experienced greater gains in reading achievement but not math achievement."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "We examined the linkage between state standards and teacher standards as well as the linkage between teacher standards and student achievement under NCLB. The findings provide strong support for education models driven by the internal standards as opposed to the external standards in American school systems. The study finds that the linkage between state standards and teacher standards is broken or tenuous. Other things being equal, states that adopted increasingly more rigorous student performance standards from elementary to middle school grades do not show consistently higher teacher standards than states with relatively less rigorous of standards. On the other hand, the linkage between teacher standards and student achievement is tight. The evidence of reverse causation suggests that the effect runs in both directions, showing both the effect of gain in the rigor of teacher standards on student achievement gains and the effect of student achievement gains on gains in the rigor teacher standards. This gives support for the standarddriven as well as the performance-driven paths, implying that student performance drives teacher standards as much as (or more than) teacher standards drive student performance.\nRegardless of the significance of effects on student achievement, we are much more likely to observe consistent levels of performance standards for students across grades at the state level than at the school or classroom level. In fact, it turns out that the correlations between Grade 4 and 8 standards are strong for the state standards but weak for the teacher standards. State standards are also less likely to be influenced by student demographics than by teacher standards. The volatility and vulnerability of teacher standards may be attributable to the fact that teachers directly interact with students in everyday classroom life and they adapt standards to time-varying student needs and achievement outcomes. The observed gender, race, and SES gaps in achievement gains suggests that male students, Black students, and socioeconomically disadvantaged students make less academic gains than their counterparts during middle grades. Since student achievement gains affect gains in teacher standards, those student background characteristics would have indirect negative effects on teacher standards. What if we partial out the influence of achievement to examine conditional inequality of teacher standards? Then the analysis did not reveal negative effects of being male, Black, socioeconomically disadvantaged on teacher standards, conditional on achievement gains. For gender, the conditional gain in reading standards was even smaller for females than males, implying counteracting teacher effect. This suggests that although teacher standards are strongly influenced by students' achievement gaps and reproduce the inequalities, there is no indication of explicit teacher bias in setting standards for students at risk of lower gains in achievement. The conditional equality of teacher standards may be a more practical approach to implementation of academic standards. However, this approach conflicts with NCLB recommendations for universal or \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to standard setting.\nFindings from our study challenge policymakers' presumption of tight linkage between state standards and teacher standards, and raise questions about potential efficacy of the current policy movement towards common national standards under the Race to the Top Program. How can we break the current negative downward cycle (low achievement \u2192 low standards \u2192 lower achievement \u2192 lower standards) for low-income minority students at the classroom and student levels? Simply raising external state or national standards will not help break the inner cycle, particularly for disadvantaged minority students and their schools that already perform way below those external standards and cannot narrow the gap. In order to turn the vicious cycle into virtuous cycle (high achievement \u2192 high standards \u2192 higher achievement \u2192 higher standards), it is crucial to build individual school and teacher capacity, along with external assistance and incentives, to improve student achievement, which in turn can help raise teachers' internal standards and narrow student achievement gaps at the same time. More democratic procedures such as mobilization of active teacher participation and feedback in setting or implementing state or national performance standards might help narrow the discrepancy between internal and external standards. However, the alignment of external and internal standards, without improving the school capacity and climate for policy implementation, may not produce better results. It is ultimately the quality of school learning environment and the readiness of and interactions between teachers and students that will determine the effects of newly adopted common core standards.\nLastly, the limitations of this study need to be understood with caveats about the tenability of its underlying assumptions. The key assumptions were made about (1) using the gap between NAEP and state's own assessment results as the basis of measuring the rigor of state standards and (2) about using the gap between ECLS-K student test scores and teacher's ratings as the basis of measuring the rigor of teacher standards for student performance. While both NAEP and ECLS-K assessments were treated as providing valid and reliable yardsticks of student achievement based on common national curriculum frameworks, their relevance to all individual states and schools remains questionable in our decentralized American school system; it may threaten the validity of comparisons if any particular states or schools choose to opt out of existing national standards and provide very different curriculum to students for which NAEP and/or ECLS-K assessments do not adequately measure their achievement. Although our study did not directly collect evidence, other available source of evidence suggests national curricular convergence contrary to the popular belief. According to TIMSS 2007 8th grade math report on the match between intended and implemented curriculum, there was a high degree of uniformity in terms of content coverage across the United States (Mullis et al., 2008) : With a few exceptions of particular subtopic areas, math teachers reported teaching most of common topics to more than 90% of students. We acknowledge that such evidence only implies homogeneity in terms of curricular breadth, but not in depth. Variability in curricular depth may be associated with our observed variations in the level of student performance standards; this study focused on the latter only, reporting substantial variability among states, schools and classrooms. This topic on the relationship between curriculum and performance standards requires further study.
