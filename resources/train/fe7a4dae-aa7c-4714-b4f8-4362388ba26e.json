The association between PiB retention and cognition was modified by the APOE status on linear regression analysis even after controlling for the differences in the distribution of PiB values among APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers (p \u03ed 0.02). Cognitive performance was associated with the A\u2424 deposition in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe association cortices in APOE \u24404 carriers on SPM analysis (p \u03fd 0.001).\nThere is a modest association between PiB retention and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults and this relationship between A\u2424 load and cognitive function is modified by APOE status. Whereas A\u2424 load is associated with greater cognitive impairment in APOE \u24404 carriers, the cognitive function in APOE \u24404 noncarriers is influenced less by the A\u2424 load, suggesting that APOE isoforms modulate the harmful effects of A\u2424 on cognitive function.

We further investigated the effects of APOE isoforms on the association between A\u2424 load and cognitive performance. Finally, we performed voxel-based analysis to determine the regional pattern of A\u2424 deposition that is associated with cognitive performance in cognitively normal older adults.\nMETHODS Participants. We studied 408 cognitively normal older adults who participated in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) from January 2009 through March 2011. MCSA is a prospective population-based study of older adults without dementia. 13 Individuals participating in the MCSA undergo clinical examinations, APOE genotyping, a battery of neuropsychological tests, and MRI examinations every 15 months. After completion of each evaluation, a consensus committee meeting is held involving the behavioral neurologists, neuropsychologists, and nurses who evaluated the subjects to assign a clinical diagnosis to the participant. PET studies have been offered to all MCSA participants since January 2009 and are performed within 6 months of MRI and cognitive testing (figure e-1 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at www.neurology.org).\nInclusion criterion was normal cognitive function which was judged according to the published criteria from normative data. 14 Subjects who had a contraindication for MRI such as a pacemaker, or who were unable to participate in imaging studies because of severe illness, were excluded. Subjects were not excluded due to neurologic, psychiatric, or systemic illnesses to preserve the representativeness of the study sample as much as possible.\nParticipants with APOE genotype 2/2, 2/3 were labeled \u24402 carriers, genotype 3/3 was labeled \u24403 homozygote, genotypes 3/4 and 4/4 were labeled \u24404 carriers. Since the impact of \u24402/4 on AD risk remains unclear, data for this genotype were treated as a separate group.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and informed consent for participation was obtained from every participant. Neuropsychological testing. Memory was evaluated by free recall retention scores computed after a 30-minute delay for the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory and Visual Reproduction subtests and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Language tests measured naming to confrontation (i.e., the Boston Naming Test) and category fluency (i.e., naming animals, fruits, and vegetables). The attention/executive measures included the Trail Making Test part B, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol subtest. Visual-spatial processing was examined by the WAIS-R Picture Completion and Block Design subtests. All tests were administered by experienced psychometrists and supervised by a clinical neuropsychologist (R.J.I.). All raw neuropsychological test scores were standardized in the entire MCSA sample. 14 We obtained individual domain standard (Z) scores by averaging the z scores of the individual tests included in each domain. A global cognitive function Z score was derived by averaging the 4 standardized cognitive domain scores.\nMRI and PET acquisition. MRIs were performed at 3 Tesla using an 8-channel phased array coil (GE, Milwaukee, WI). A 3-dimensional high-resolution magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) acquisition was performed for anatomic segmentation and labeling of PiB PET scans. PET images were acquired using a PET/CT scanner (DRX; GE Healthcare) operating in 3-dimensional mode. The subjects were injected with 292-729 MBq [ 11 C] PiB. After a 40-minute uptake period, a 20-minute PiB scan was obtained. The PiB-PET acquisition consisted of 4 5-minute dynamic frames, acquired from 40 to 60 minutes after injection. The pixel size for PET images was 1.0 mm and the slice thickness was 3.3 mm."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of PiB PET images.", "text": "PiB-PET quantitative image analysis was performed using the fully automated image processing pipeline which has previously been described in detail. 15 Briefly, the method includes registering PET images to 3-dimensional MPRAGE for gray matter (GM) sharpening on SPM5. PiB-PET cortical ratio images are calculated by dividing each PiB-PET GM voxel value by the median value in the cerebellar GM region in the subject's MRI space. The global cortical PiB retention was determined by calculating the median value of the PiB-PET GM ratio from all voxels in the bilateral parietal, posterior cingulate, precuneus, temporal, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate GM regions as defined in the in-house modified anatomic labeling atlas where the average is weighted by region of interest size. 15 Voxel-based analysis was performed in order to determine the topographic pattern of correlations between PiB retention and global cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults. To do so, each subject's MRI scan was spatially normalized to a custom template 16 using the unified segmentation model of SPM5. The resulting deformation was applied to the PiB retention ratio images in native space in order to warp the segmented native PiB retention ratio images to the customized template. Voxel-based correlations between PiB retention ratio and global cognitive performance were assessed in SPM5. Statistical maps were displayed at a significance value of p \u03fd 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis.", "text": "For our primary analysis, we summarize associations between cognition and PiB using Spearman partial rank-order correlations which we denote by \"partial r s .\" 17 This statistic can be thought of as a nonparametric correlation between 2 variables (e.g., PiB retention and cognitive performance) after \"partialling out,\" or controlling for, possible confounders. We report partial Spearman rank-order correlations adjusting for age, sex, and education among all subjects. Because the PiB distributions were highly skewed, we used partial r s to quantify associations since this method does not assume normally distributed data. 17 The non-normal distribution of PiB also motivated our use of the Kruskal-Wallis test to perform nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for differences by APOE status.\nNext, the effect of APOE genotype on the association between PiB retention and cognitive function was evaluated using linear regression models in which we included an interaction between APOE genotype and the natural log of PiB and adjust linearly for age, sex, and education. We test for associations using so-called sequential ANOVA in which we report 3 p values: 1) the significance of the log-transformed PiB variable given that age, sex, and education are in the model; 2) whether adding APOE to this model is significant; and 3) whether adding an interaction between log-transformed PiB and APOE adds significantly to the model.\nAs a secondary analysis intended to isolate the effect of carrying an APOE \u24404 allele, we performed 1:1 matching of APOE \u24404 carriers to noncarriers matching on global cortical PiB, age, sex, and education. We then performed the regression analysis and sequential ANOVA as described above. We chose APOE \u24404 carriers as the reference group for the matched analysis because they manifest the full dynamic range of PiB retention in cognitively normal older adults and it is widely accepted that APOE \u24404 carriers are at a higher risk for AD. We grouped the APOE \u24402 carriers and \u24403 homozygotes for this analysis because APOE \u24402 carriers did not represent the full dynamic range of PiB retention in cognitively normal older adults; therefore matching APOE \u24402 carriers to \u24404 carriers was not possible. By performing the matched analysis we isolate the effect of having an APOE \u24404 allele for a given level of global cortical PiB."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS Study sample.", "text": "Characteristics of the study sample are described in table 1. The demographic features of the study sample (participants) were on average similar to the MCSA subjects who were evaluated from January 2009 through March 2011 but did not participate in the MRI and PET studies or did not undergo genetic testing (nonparticipants). The only exception was that the fraction of women participants was less than the fraction of women non-participants. The cognitive performance of the participants was slightly better than the nonparticipants specifically in memory, visual-spatial processing, and language function."}, {"section_title": "Correlations between A\u2424 load and cognitive function", "text": "within the entire cohort. In this population-based sample of cognitively normal older adults, the median (interquartile range) of the global cortical PiB retention ratio was 1.39 (1.32 to 1.67). According to the typically used cutoff of 1.50, 18 139 out of 408 (34%; 95% confidence interval \u03ed 29%-39%) of the subjects were classified as PiB positive. We did not dichotomize the subjects into high or low PiB retention groups and treated cortical PiB retention ratio as a continuous variable in all analysis. Higher global cortical PiB retention ratio was associated with worse overall cognitive performance (partial r s \u03ed \u03ea0.18; p \u03fd 0.01) specifically in the memory (partial r s \u03ed \u03ea0.14; p \u03fd 0.01), attention/executive (partial r s \u03ed \u03ea0.12; p \u03ed 0.02), language (partial r s \u03ed \u03ea0.13; p \u03ed 0.01), and visual-spatial processing (partial r s \u03ed 0.13; p \u03fd 0.01) functions after adjusting for age, sex, and education.\nEffect of APOE \u24404 allele on the association between A\u2424 load and cognitive function. Global cortical PiB retention ratio increased from APOE \u24402 carriers to APOE \u24403 homozygotes to \u24402/4 genotype, with APOE \u24404 carriers having the highest levels of PiB retention ( p \u03fd 0.001) (figure 1). APOE \u24402/4 genotype was excluded from the 3-level linear regression analysis. In the linear regression analysis, there was an interaction with APOE status for the associations between global cortical PiB retention and global cognition ( p \u03ed 0.05), memory ( p \u03ed 0.05), and visualspatial processing ( p \u03ed 0.02). The association between higher PiB retention and lower cognitive performance was strongest in the APOE \u24404 carriers and weakest in APOE \u24402 carriers with APOE \u24403 homozygotes being in-between the 2 groups (figure 2). We found no relationship between APOE status and cognitive function after adjusting for age, sex, and education ( p \u03fe 0.09) (table e-1).\nIn our secondary analysis, we matched 97 \u24404 carriers to \u24404 noncarriers using global cortical PiB, age, sex, and education as matching criteria in order to isolate the APOE effect. A significant interaction with APOE \u24404 carrier status was found for the associations between global cortical PiB retention and global cognition ( p \u03ed 0.01), language ( p \u03ed 0.04), visual-spatial processing ( p \u03fd 0.01), and a trend with memory function ( p \u03ed 0.08), but not with attention/executive function ( p \u03ed 0.74) ( figure 3) . Overall, the linear regression analysis both in the whole group and in the matched group on PiB retention showed that APOE genotype modified the relationship between cortical PiB retention and global cognition. Voxel-based analysis in APOE \u24404 carriers demonstrated that lower global cognitive performance was associated with higher PiB retention in the frontal, temporal, and parietal association cortices ( p \u03fd 0.001) ( figure 4 ). When we correlated PiB retention in specific cortical atlas regions and cognitive Z scores, we found correlations between frontal, temporal, parietal, and posterior cingulate/precuneus PiB retention ratio and global cognition, memory, language, and visual-spatial processing ( p \u03fd 0.01) in APOE \u24404 carriers. A weaker correlation between higher cingulate/precuneus PiB retention and lower memory function ( p \u03ed 0.05) and global cognition ( p \u03ed 0.03) was present in APOE \u24404 noncarriers."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The current study showed that greater PiB retention on PET is associated with worse cognitive function in a population-based sample of cognitively normal older adults. The decline in cognition was observed to be steepest in APOE \u24404 carriers and least steep in APOE \u24402 carriers. When we stratified the cognitively normal group into APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers, it was apparent that the association between PiB retention and cognitive function was primarily driven by the APOE \u24404 carriers on matched analysis in which the dynamic range of PiB retention ratio was similar by design.\nWe found modest but significant associations between higher cortical PiB retention and cognitive domain functions in the whole group of participants. Similar trends of associations between A\u2424 load and cognitive function specifically in the memory and visual-spatial domains have been observed in smaller samples of cognitively normal older adults 19, 20 or older adults without dementia. 21 A\u2424 load was treated as a continuous variable in these studies. Others that dichotomized the cognitively normal subjects into high and low PiB retention groups did not find any differences in cognitive function between the 2 groups. 15, 18, 22, 23 However, we note that even with high levels of PiB retention typically seen in subjects with AD, there was relatively little cognitive disturbance, suggesting the influence of additional mediators such as cognitive reserve, which was previously investigated, 24, 25 and the APOE genotype that we investigated in the current study. To our knowledge the current study demonstrated for the first time that the associations between A\u2424 load and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults is modified by the APOE status. The associations between cognition and PiB retention found in cognitively normal older adults appeared to be primarily driven by the 25% of the participants who were APOE \u24404 carriers. Conversely, we did not find any relationship between cognitive function and APOE status most likely due to the older age of our sample. AD risk in APOE \u24404 carriers decreases after roughly age 80, 26 and the influence of APOE genotype on cognitive performance dissipates after age 80. 27 Hence, absence of a relationship between APOE genotype and cognition may be expected in this sample with a median age of 79.\nThe effects of APOE isoforms on AD pathology appear to be multifactorial. There is evidence that APOE \u24404 may influence AD pathology by interacting with A\u2424 clearance thereby increasing the concentrations of toxic oligomeric A\u2424, 6,7,28 enhancing hyperphosphorylation of tau protein 29 and reducing choline acetyltransferase activity. 30 Cognitively normal young-adult APOE \u24404 carriers show glucose metabolic reductions in regions similar to the metabolic reductions typically observed in AD, 31 even in the absence of neurofibrillary tangles and A\u2424 plaques. 32 Furthermore, the resting state fMRI connectivity is reduced in PiB-negative cognitively normal APOE \u24404 carriers in regions that show reduced connectivity in AD. 33 Overall, these data suggest that APOE \u24404 genotype not only increases the risk for A\u2424 deposition but also influences AD pathology by modulating the harmful effects of A\u2424 on cognitive function through synergistic mechanisms. 34 On voxel-based analysis we found that lower global cognitive function (derived from the 4 cogni- tive domain scores) correlated with greater PiB retention in the frontal, temporal, and parietal unimodal and heteromodal association cortices but not the primary visual and sensory-motor cortices and the medial temporal limbic cortex. The absence of an association between medial temporal cortex A\u2424 load and memory function argues against a direct functional-anatomic relationship between localized cognitive function and localized A\u2424 load. Associations were present in regions where there was significant A\u2424 deposition but not in regions with lower A\u2424 load. In fact, the voxel-based map of the correlation between PiB retention and cognitive performance revealed the topography of A\u2424 deposition that is confined to the association cortices early in the disease process in AD, as described by Braak and Braak. 35 A strength of the current study is its sample. Participants were randomly selected from the Olmsted County population, in contrast to the previously studied cohorts of cognitively normal volunteers consecutively recruited from the community through advertisements or memory clinics, thereby increasing the potential for selection or volunteer bias. 3, 15, 21, 22 A high level of PiB retention (\u03fe1.5 global cortical re-tention ratio) was observed in 34% of the cognitively normal individuals in the current study. This is slightly higher than the 20%-30% rate of high cortical PiB retention ratio that we and others have reported in the literature, possibly because of the older age range of our sample compared to the others, 3, 15, 21, 22 but lower than the 47% rate reported in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cognitively normal cohort. This was unexpected given that the ADNI cognitively normal cohort is relatively younger than the MCSA sample. 36 The differences are most likely associated with the ascertainment of participants as we did not exclude subjects due to neurologic, psychiatric, or systemic illnesses in order to study a representative sample of the population. However, it is possible that people with poor general health would be less likely to participate in imaging studies. The participants performed slightly better in memory, visual-spatial function, and attention/executive function, suggesting minimal nonparticipation bias.\nAlthough PiB retention is modestly associated with cognitive function, the presence of an APOE \u24404 allele significantly increases A\u2424 load and influences the relationship between A\u2424 load and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults. Conversely, A\u2424 load decreases with the presence of an APOE \u24402 allele and PiB retention does not appear to influence cognitive function in APOE \u24402 carriers. 37 Whereas high A\u2424 load pushes APOE \u24404 carriers closer to cognitive impairment, the cognitive function in APOE \u24403 homozygotes and APOE \u24402 carriers are incrementally influenced less by the A\u2424 load. This finding agrees with the hypothesis that APOE \u24404 shifts the \"AD biomarker cascade model\" 38 toward younger age, which results in an earlier onset of AD and more severe AD pathology at a given age in APOE \u24404 carriers compared to noncarriers. 3,10 A limitation of our study is the insufficient follow-up on the cohort we scanned during the last 2 years, precluding our ability to assess longitudinal associations. PiB predicted future cognitive decline in visual-spatial performance, semantic and episodic memory function in 2 independent cohorts of cognitively normal older adults or older adults without dementia 12, 39 and progression to AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment, indicating that PiB retention in a patient with no dementia is associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction in the future. 40 The effects of APOE status on A\u2424-associated cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults is subject to future investigations."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Dr. Kantarci: drafting/revising the manuscript, study concept or design, analysis or interpretation of data, acquisition of data, statistical analysis,"}, {"section_title": "Figure 4", "text": "Correlations between cortical Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention and global cognitive performance score in APOE \u24404 carriers Voxelwise analysis demonstrates that global cognitive performance is associated with PiB retention in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe association cortices (p \u03fd 0.001).\nstudy supervision, obtaining funding.
