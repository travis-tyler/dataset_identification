Today, tidal flooding in the Norfolk area affects low-lying areas nine times per year on average. But in the intermediate scenario, such areas in and around the station flood about 280 times per year and spend 10 percent of the year underwater by 2050. \u2022 The reach of flooding during extreme high tides will expand. In the intermediate scenario, extra-high tides would expose roughly 10 percent of the station's land area to flooding by 2100; in the highest scenario, exposure reaches nearly 60 percent. \u2022 Land loss at NS Norfolk is possible. In the highest scenario, roughly 20 percent of NS Norfolk's land floods daily, becoming part of the tidal zone, by 2100.\nAs seas rise, the frequency of extreme tides and the reach of daily high tides grow. In the intermediate scenario, low-lying locations in and around NS Norfolk experience roughly 280 tidal floods per year by 2050; in the highest scenario, they experience 540. With such regular flooding, these areas could become unusable land within the next 35 years. Though daily operations at NS Norfolk itself may not be compromised, the station depends on the surrounding communities and infrastructure, which will be heavily affected. In the intermediate scenario, flood-prone areas throughout the region experience flooding twice daily on average and are underwater 40 percent of the time by 2070. In the highest scenario, portions of NS Norfolk not currently prone to flood, particularly on the northern and eastern shores, flood with extra-high tides. In the highest scenario, nearly 60 percent of the station's land area, including roadways, is exposed to tidal flooding by 2100. As sea level rises, the flooding that occurs during daily high tides lasts longer. During the last quarter of this century, floods in the NS Norfolk area will begin to span many high tide cycles. As a result, the number of individual flood events will decrease but the duration of flood conditions will increase until flooding is essentially constant and the affected land permanently inundated. By the end of the century, floodprone areas in and around NS Norfolk are underwater nearly constantly in both scenarios. But it is not only today's flood-prone areas that are affected by sea level rise. Indeed, with the nearly seven feet of sea level rise projected for the end of the century by the highest scenario, roughly 20 percent of NS Norfolk's currently utilized land area would flood daily, becoming part of the tidal zone."}, {"section_title": "STORM SURGE", "text": "\u2022 Sea level rise exposes previously unaffected areas of NS Norfolk to storm surge flooding. In the intermediate scenario, the area exposed to flooding resulting from a Category 1 storm more than triples by 2070. \u2022 Higher sea levels allow lower-intensity storms to produce greater surge. In the intermediate scenario, storm surge flooding resulting from a Category 1 storm hitting in 2100 affects a greater area than does surge flooding resulting from Category 2 storms today. \u2022 Sea level rise exposes NS Norfolk to deeper, more severe flooding. Today, a Category 4 storm exposes about 80 percent of the station to flooding, and that flooding is less than 10 feet deep. In the highest scenario, a Category 4 storm hitting in 2100 exposes 95 percent of the base to flooding more than 10 feet deep."}, {"section_title": "Base Information", "text": "NS Norfolk is located in the city of Norfolk and within the Hampton Roads metropolitan area-a sea level rise hot spot, where natural subsidence, low-lying topography, and changing ocean circulation patterns contribute to above-average rise (Sallenger, Doran, and Howd 2012). NS Norfolk lies directly on the water, with the Elizabeth River to the west and Willoughby Bay to the north. Much of NS Norfolk lies less than 10 feet above sea level (Connolly 2015). NS Norfolk is the largest naval installation in the world (DOD 2016). It is the home of the US Fleet Forces Command, which trains naval forces and defends a massive area including the Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Pacific Global Security.org 2011. More than 22,000 military personnel live in the city of Norfolk; they make up 11 percent of the population. An additional 28,000 veterans live in Norfolk (US Census Bureau 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Historic Exposure to Storm Surge and Flood Hazards", "text": "Since 1857, 65 hurricanes have passed within 150 nautical miles of the Hampton Roads area (NOAA n.d.). In 2003, Hurricane Isabel, a Category 2 storm, flooded about 6 percent of NS Norfolk (Li, Lihwa, and Burks-Copes 2013). In 2011, Hurricane Irene, a Category 1 storm, brought a 7.5-foot storm surge to NS Norfolk (NOAA et al. 2013). The seawall and bulkhead at NS Norfolk provide some protection from storm surge, as does a floodgate that prevents flooding of the east end of the station (HRHP n.d.; Quality Enterprises n.d.). However, Category 2 hurricanes can raise water levels enough to seriously affect the station's four harbor installations (Gilmore and Brand 1999). In addition, the persistent and growing problem of flooding in the city of Norfolk has affected real estate values, necessitated elevating roads, and transformed former parks into wetlands (Applegate 2014;Brangham 2012;Fears 2012). Access roads leading to the base are sometimes affected by flooding (VIMS 2013). The intermediate scenario projects that the Hampton Roads area will experience 4.5 feet of sea level rise and the highest scenario projects nearly seven feet of rise by 2100. With the highest scenario, portions of NS Norfolk would be inundated with each high tide."}, {"section_title": "NS Norfolk", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "THE CHANGING THREAT OF HURRICANES 4", "text": "A Category 1 hurricane is the most likely type to affect this area. Today, such a storm exposes roughly 10 percent of NS Norfolk to storm surge flooding. In the intermediate scenario, local sea level is projected to rise by just over two feet by 2070; a Category 1 storm then exposes 35 percent of the station to flooding. The exposed area more than doubles between 2070 and 2100 to roughly 75 percent. In the intermediate scenario, the area inundated by a Category 1 storm hitting in 2100 is substantially larger (about 15 percent) than the area inundated by a Category 2 storm today. In addition, the area under water five or more feet deep increases from less than 10 percent today to about 15 percent. For the mid-Atlantic region, the worst-case scenario considered in this analysis is a Category 4 storm occurring in the highest sea level rise scenario. Even without sea level rise, 100 percent of NS Norfolk is exposed to flooding from Category 3 and Category 4 hurricanes today. While sea level rise will not increase the extent of inundation from Category 3 or 4 storms at the installation, it will affect flood depth. Today, most of the station (roughly 80 percent) is exposed to flooding less than 10 feet deep in a Category 4 storm. In the highest scenario, 55 percent of the station is exposed to flooding more than 10 feet deep by 2070. By 2100, 95 percent of the station experiences this depth of flooding.

It is incorporating sea level rise projections into its development and infrastructure planning and into its project requirements and project design (Rios n.d). In response to rising seas and persistent tidal flooding, NS Norfolk has been raising some of its piers-at a cost of $60 million each-and restoring others (Fears 2011). The station is planning a $250 million restoration project that includes demolishing two of its 100-year-old piers and rebuilding one new pier (Faithful+Gould n.d.) at NS Norfolk. The DOD, along with other federal agencies and local stakeholders (Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach), is participating in an innovative study in Hampton Roads to address recurrent flooding and sea level rise (Connolly 2015). But here and across coastal US installations there is still far to go: the gap between the military's current sea level rise preparedness and the threats outlined by this analysis is large and growing. Low-lying federal land inundated by rising seas, daily high-tide flooding of more elevated land and infrastructure, and destructive storm surges-most of the installations analyzed, including NS Norfolk, face all of these risks. This analysis provides snapshots of potential future exposure to flooding at NS Norfolk. For the Navy to take additional action on the front line of sea level rise, however, it will need more detailed analysis and resources to implement solutions. Congress and the DOD should, for example, support the development and distribution of high-resolution hurricane and coastal flooding models; adequately fund data monitoring systems such as our nation's tide gauge network; allocate human, financial, and data resources to planning efforts and to detailed mapping that includes future conditions; support planning partnerships with surrounding communities; and allocate resources for preparedness projects, on-and off-site, many of which will stretch over decades."}, {"section_title": "Mobilizing on the Front Lines of Sea Level Rise", "text": "A vital trait of our nation's military is its ability to adapt in response to external threats. Climate change and sea level rise have emerged as key threats of the 21st century, and our military is beginning to respond (Hall et al. 2016;USACE 2015;DOD 2014).  Military bases and personnel protect the country from external threats. With rising seas, they find themselves on an unanticipated front line.

The latter scenario is particularly useful for decisions involving an especially low tolerance for risk. These results are a small subset of the full analysis. For more information, the technical appendix, and downloadable maps, see www. ucsusa.org/MilitarySeasRising. 2 UCS analyzed storm surge depth and exposure extent for each base using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model, developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for storm events ranging in severity from Category 1 to Category 4, in addition to tidal floods. Both storm surge and flooding during extra-high tides can be significantly exacerbated by rainfall and wave action, neither of which we included in this study. 3 This analysis involved consultation with NS Norfolk. However, preventive measures may be planned or in place that are not reflected in the analysis; these could affect the degree of current and future flooding. 4 Nor'easters are common in the region and known to generate damaging storm surge. As SLOSH models only hurricanes, we did not include lesser storms such as nor'easters in this analysis. Increases in surge extent and depth should be expected with these storms as well."}]
