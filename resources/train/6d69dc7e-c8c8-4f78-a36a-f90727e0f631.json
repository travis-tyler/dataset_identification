[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background-The perception of cognitive decline by individuals and those who know them well (\"informants\") has been inconsistently associated with objective cognitive performance, but strongly associated with depressive symptoms."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Individuals in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) often self-perceive decline in their cognition more than a decade prior to a subsequent diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to AD [1] . This self-perception of decline often plateaus or reverses as the illness progresses to dementia [2, 3] . The term subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been used to describe this self-perceived decline in cognition over time [2] . Longitudinal studies have shown that cognitively normal individuals with SCD are at a higher risk to progress to MCI or dementia [4] [5] [6] .\nThere is evidence that SCD is associated with increased likelihood of biomarker abnormalities consistent with AD, including findings from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and visual contrast sensitivity [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, the associations between SCD and concurrent performance on objective cognitive tests have been inconsistent across studies. Since it is acknowledged that depression, anxiety, and personality factors may affect the perception of cognitive decline and objective cognitive performance [2, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , these variables might contribute to the inconsistent results regarding the relationship between SCD and objective cognitive performance. Confirmation of cognitive decline by an informant was not considered necessary for the classification of SCD in the initial consensus definition [2] . However, there is increasing evidence that report of one's cognitive decline by family members or any other close observer correlates better with objective cognitive performance than self-report [22, 23] and may be a better predictor of subsequent conversion to MCI or dementia [24] [25] [26] . Additionally, compared to informant-only or self-only report of cognitive decline, using mutual report by both subjects and informants has been found to give an even better prediction of cognitive decline, with report of decline by both self and informant shown to be associated with an additive degree of risk for dementia [27, 28] .\ninformant. Limited data has been published to date examining the discrepancy between self and informant reports of cognitive decline and their relationship to objective cognitive performance. Edmonds et al. examined this relationship by using the discrepancy score obtained from self-minus informant-report of the measurement of Everyday Cognition (ECog) questionnaire in a cohort that included cognitively normal and MCI participants, and demonstrated that amnestic MCI subjects who underestimate their decline relative to their informants on ECog memory items show worse performance on an objective recall memory test [29] . Moreover, they also demonstrated that underestimation of cognitive problems was associated with CSF AD biomarkers and progression to dementia. So, instead of using reports of cognitive decline from self-only or informant-only, difference scores from these two reports may show a better relationship to objective cognitive performance or predict the risk of cognitive decline.\nThe Cognitive Change Index (CCI) is a tool used to assess the perception of cognitive decline in memory, executive function, and language domains from both self and informant perspectives. The present 20 item version of the CCI was adapted from a larger item pool used in previous research on cognitive complaints in older adults by Saykin et al. [8] with item selection based primarily on considerations regarding targeted content within and across the three included domains (episodic memory, executive function, and language) as well as analyses (unpublished data) on associations with neuroimaging, cognitive and outcome variables in an independent sample. The CCI Self and Informant questionnaires are available on request from the authors (contact Dr. Saykin at asaykin@iupui.edu). The memory items from the self-report of the CCI are also used in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort study as a criterion to identify subjects with significant memory concern [10] (also see http://www.adni-info.org). The current study aims to examine the association of CCI scores, obtained from participants and their informants, with objective cognitive performance measures, as well as study their association with subjectively rated depression, in a mixed sample of individuals with normal cognition, MCI, and mild dementia. In addition to using the CCI scores reported by self-only or informantonly in our analyses, we also used the difference score obtained from self-minus informantreports as a proxy measure for the subjects' insight into their cognitive deficits (excessive worry/overestimation versus lack of insight/underestimation) and examined its relationship with cognition, which has received limited attention in prior studies. Finally, we investigated the effect of depressive symptoms on the association between CCI scores and objective cognitive performance."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Setting and participants", "text": "The study was approved by the Indiana University (IU) Institutional Review Board before data access and analysis. We collected data from participants with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) \u226518 from the local National Institute on Aging-Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center (IADC) cohort and the Memory Clinic (MC) of the IU Health Neuroscience Center between January 2013 and November 2014. Individuals who are enrolled in the IADC are volunteer participants recruited via a variety of mechanisms, including community outreach and advertisements, clinical referral, and participation in studies of familial genetic disorders. Patients seen in the MC are initially evaluated due to clinical memory concerns and may present with problems in other domains as well. After excluding subjects with incomplete CCI data, 267 adults and their informants were included. Demographic, family history, medical history, and neuropsychological assessment data were collected.\nClinical diagnoses of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia were determined by consensus between two or more clinicians. Cognitively normal participants (CN) were defined as having no deficit in instrumental activities of daily living and no evidence of objective cognitive impairment. Diagnosis of MCI was based upon the Petersen criteria [30] and defined as having a report of cognitive change by the participant, informant, and/or clinician with objective cognitive impairment greater than 1.5 standard deviations outside the ageadjusted normative mean in at least one cognitive domain and intact instrumental activities of daily living. Diagnosis of dementia was based upon standard criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer's type or for other non-Alzheimer's dementing disorders including DSM-IV [31] , NINCDS-ADRDA [32] for diagnosis of AD, NINDS-AIREN criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia [33] , Neary consensus on clinical diagnosis criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration [34] and McKeith's criteria for the clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies [35] ."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive and behavioral assessments", "text": "Participants underwent detailed neuropsychological evaluation, including measures of general cognition, memory, language, attention, executive function, and visuospatial ability. Only cognitive tests results obtained within three months of the CCI were included in the analysis. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) battery of neuropsychological tests [36] was used in the MC, while another extensive battery of tests including those from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set was used in the IADC cohort. The test batteries shared the MMSE [37] , Animal Fluency [38] , Constructional Praxis [39] and Trail Making Test (Parts A and B) [40] . The CERAD incorporates a shorter 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT) [36] while the full 60-item BNT [41] was used in the IADC cohort. Notably, the two study subject sources used different verbal learning tests: The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) [42] was used in the IADC cohort while the CERAD's word list memory, recall, and recognition test was used in the MC. The CERAD's word list memory test was also used in some IADC participants in addition to the RAVLT. While the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used in both settings, the shorter 15-item GDS [43] was used in the IADC cohort, while the longer 30-item GDS [44] was used in the MC. As all items in the short 15-item scale were included in the 30-item scale, we transformed the 30-item GDS score into 15-item GDS score using each response in individual items and used only the 15-item GDS score in the present analysis."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive change index", "text": "The CCI consists of two parallel sets of 20 items asking participants and their informants to rate the participant's cognitive function compared to the previous five years. Participants and informants were asked to complete the CCI by responding to each item on a 1 to 5 Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater decline (1 = no change or normal ability, 2 = minimal change or slight/occasional problem, 3 = some change or mild problem, 4 = clearly noticeable change or moderate problem, 5 = much worse or severe problem). 12 of the 20 CCI items focus on memory performance (e.g., \"recalling information when I really try\", \"remembering things that have happened recently\"), 5 of the 20 items evaluate one's executive function (e.g., \"focusing on goals and carrying out a plan\"), and 3 of the 20 items evaluate language (e.g., \"understanding conversations\"). In the informant-report, there are also questions asking about the informant's relationship to the participant, including average number of hours per week spent with participant, number of years he/she has known the participant, and confidence in the accuracy of his/her rating. All but one participant and 240 out of 267 informants completed the CCI during in-person visits. The remaining subject/ informants completed the questionnaire elsewhere and mailed it in.\nThe sum of all 20 items of the CCI self-report (CCI-S, range 20 to 100) and the CCI informant-report (CCI-I, range 20 to 100) were used in this study. The difference score between self and informant reports (CCI-D, range \u221280 to 80) was calculated as CCI-S minus CCI-I to demonstrate the discrepancy between self-and informant-reports. A positive value on the CCI-D indicates that the participant reported more severe cognitive impairment than his or her informant, while a negative value indicates that the informant reported greater cognitive impairment than the participant did."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Descriptive statistics of baseline clinical characteristics were calculated for all participants, including frequency and percentage for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Clinical characteristics, including age, gender, race, years of education, family history of dementia, diagnosis, CCI scores, and neuropsychological performance scores were compared between recruitment sites (IADC versus MC) using ttests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. CCI scores and cognitive test scores were also compared between recruitment sites and diagnostic groups using analysis of covariance models (ANCOVA) adjusted for age, education, gender, and diagnosis. Following a significant overall effect, pair-wise comparisons were similarly made and p-values were adjusted using Sidak's multiple comparison method. Associations between CCI-S, CCI-I, and CCI-D scores and objective cognitive tests scores and GDS scores were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Partial correlation coefficients derived from ANCOVA models adjusted for various combinations of age, gender, education, GDS, and family history of dementia were also calculated to show the association after eliminating the influence of these covariates. Because of differences in the cognitive assessment by cohort, we calculated Z-scores for the different BNTs and verbal learning tests to combine participants from different cohorts in the analysis. The data used to standardize the 60-item BNT and the RAVLT came from the first exposure to the test of CN participants from the entire population of the IADC. The data used to standardize the 15-item BNT and the CERAD learning and delayed recall came from the control subjects in Morris et al [36] .

Participant and informant ratings of cognitive impairment on the CCI showed good internal consistency and were related to objective cognitive test scores even after adjusting for demographics and depressive symptoms. Construct validity in the context of the CCI addresses the coherence of the overall cognitive change concept based on self or informantperceived changes in cognition. One relevant type of external validity can be demonstrated by the correlation of each subscale score with objective tests in the same cognitive domain. We found that subscales of the CCI are highly correlated with objective tests in the same domain, but also correlate with objective tests in other domains. This finding may suggest that a given cognitive complaint may stem from impairment in more than one domain, highlighting the challenge of developing cognitive tests or questionnaires that are \"pure\" measures of a function.\nAs expected, participant CCI scores were lowest in the cognitively normal group and elevated in the MCI and dementia groups, which did not differ from each other. Also as expected, informant report of cognitive impairment progressively increased across diagnostic groups with the lowest scores reported for cognitively normal participants and highest scores for demented participants. Lastly, the CCI discrepancy score (CCI-D) showed a clear trend for increasing distance between informant and participant ratings (informant > participant) with increasing cognitive impairment, likely reflecting a progressive deterioration in insight or awareness among participants.\nSimilar to previous studies, our study demonstrated that self-perceived cognitive decline was highly correlated with psychological symptoms [16, 19, 21, [45] [46] [47] , and informant-report of subject's cognitive decline correlated better than self-report to objective cognitive tests [22, 23] . We used the GDS to assess depressive symptoms in our study. Although the GDS may be not an accurate test for depression in patients with dementia [48] , evidence has shown that the validity of the GDS depends on the degree of cognitive impairment, such that more severe cognitive impairment may reduce the sensitivity of the GDS in detection of depression [49, 50] . In our study, the mean MMSE is quite high (mean MMSE was 28.2 \u00b1 1.9). Even in our demented participants, who were mostly at a mild level, the mean MMSE was 25.5 \u00b1 3.1. It is very likely that the GDS is valid for this specific application in our study.\nThe CCI-D had the weakest association with cognitive test scores but it was the only score that was not associated with the GDS. As the CCI-I showed the strongest relationship to objective cognitive performance among the various CCI metrics examined, it may be the most valid score to use in assessing an individual's perceived cognitive decline, especially in later symptomatic stages of disease. However, there is evidence that level of awareness in subjects with different levels of cognitive impairment (controls, MCI, AD) varies among studies within and between clinical or research-based settings [51] . As our MCI participants had average negative value for CCI-D scores (indicating CCI-I was worse than CCI-S), this could reflect reduced awareness in our MCI sample and attenuate the association of CCIS and objective cognitive tests. Future studies in other populations may show different results for the correlation between self-and informant-report of cognitive decline and cognitive tests, and such differences may be informative with regard to the role of sample characteristics such as insight and awareness. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that GDS scores can slightly weaken the relationship of the CCI with objective cognitive performance, suggesting that CCI-I scores adjusted for GDS score may be preferred to minimize the influence of depressive symptoms. Alternatively, if GDS or similar data is unavailable, the CCI-D might be preferable to use in analyses, as it was not significantly associated with the GDS. The use of discrepancy scores appears promising and warrants further study. CCI-S and CCI-I scores were higher in participants from the MC even after adjusting for several potentially important covariates. It is possible that there is a higher level of concern in participants from the MC, which is a medical help-seeking setting, compared to the IADC, which is a clinical research-based setting, resulting in higher CCI ratings for MC participants. Unfortunately, no specific independent data was available from subjects or informants regarding level of memory concern that would permit us to investigate this question further.\nA high proportion of our participants had a family history of dementia in at least one parent, which was highest in participants from the IADC. This is likely attributable to greater motivation of individuals with family history of dementia to volunteer for dementia-related research relative to those without such a history. There is limited evidence regarding whether genetic variation affects the concurrent perception of cognitive decline or objective cognitive performance. Risacher et al. examined the effect of APOE \u03b54 genotype on cognitive complaints, objective cognitive performance, and various AD imaging and CSF biomarkers in participants with normal cognition, SCD and early MCI [10] . They found that APOE \u03b54 status was not associated with cognitive complaints, but did associate significantly with selected measures of memory and executive performance across diagnostic groups. To investigate the effect of family history of dementia, we used it as a covariate in a multivariate model (also adjusted for age, gender, and education), and found that none of the relationships of CCI scores and objective cognitive performance were significantly altered (Supplementary Table 2 ).\nAmong various objective cognitive associations included in our study, only performance on the BNT was significantly superior in participants from the IADC relative to patients from the MC after accounting for the influence of age, gender, education, and diagnosis. However, there is evidence that BNT scores are significantly correlated with estimated verbal intelligence as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale-Revised (1981) Vocabulary subtest score or the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Vocabulary Test [52, 53] . As we did not include these tests in our sample, we cannot rule out verbal ability as a factor accounting for the BNT difference between participants from IADC and the MC. However, regarding the significant difference of BNT Z-scores between the two sources of our participants, we investigated the effect of sample (IADC versus MC) by adding it as a covariate in multivariable models, and found that all associations between the CCI and Zscore of BNT were still significant (all p < 0.01) (Supplementary Table 3 ).\nThere are some limitations to our study. First, this is a cross-sectional study so we could not determine whether CCI scores predict actual decline or disease progression. Future studies of the CCI are needed to address test-retest reliability of each form, the relationships to AD biomarkers, rate of clinical progression, and longitudinal outcomes. These data are needed to establish the utility for risk determination and other clinical applications. It should be also noted that self-and informant measures of perceived cognitive decline may be differentially associated with AD biomarkers and cognitive outcomes in a stage-specific manner, i.e., the pattern of associations may change over the course of progression from normal cognition to MCI or dementia. Secondly, even though our statistical analyses demonstrated that age did not influence our results, on average our participants were relatively young, so these findings may not be generalizable to studies of older individuals. Third, apart from depressive symptoms, we did not have information regarding other psychological or personality variables. Evidence suggests that a subject's anxiety, long-standing personality traits, and/or meaning-in-life also influence SCD [2, 19-21, 45, 54] . Further, it should be noted that informant-reported CCI may be affected by psychological conditions or personality traits of informants as well. Future studies that include more extensive psychological and personality measures in both subjects and informants are warranted.\nIn conclusion, the CCI shows good internal consistency and moderately strong relationships with objective cognitive performance, and as such appears to be a valid cross-sectional marker of self and informant perception of cognitive decline across the continuum of cognitive function. Future research is needed to determine the relationship of subjective and informant report of cognitive function to longitudinal outcome. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies including the CCI along with AD biomarker measurement in individuals at risk for MCI and dementia would likely provide valuable mechanistic data regarding stagespecific sensitivity and specificity."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
