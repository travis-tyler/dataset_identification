[{"section_title": "", "text": "southern, and some western states. 5, 7 Although annual rates of opioid analgesic prescriptions per 100 persons declined 13.1% nationwide from 81.2 in 2012 to 70.6 in 2015, this decrease was observed in only 46 .5% of counties rather than in all counties, with large declines in some areas and not in others. 8 Multiple factors might contribute to the observed differences in opioid prescribing across the US. 5, 7 One possible explanation is that opioid prescribing is higher in areas where access to alternative, nonopioid treatments for chronic noncancer pain is limited, and this may be especially true for rural areas. [9] [10] [11] Furthermore, rural areas in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, Maine, and Alabama were among the first geographical areas to be targeted by Purdue Pharma in the 1990s for promotion and marketing of OxyContin R , 12 a leading opioid analgesic of abuse in the US. 13 The geographical areas first affected by high OxyContin R prescribing also experienced increased abuse, diversion, and addiction. 12 In addition, increased prescription opioid misuse in rural areas has been associated with increased social and family stressors, unemployment, and health disparities. [9] [10] [11] Kentucky is located in the Southeast region of the US with 71% of its counties classified as rural.\n14 In 2012, Kentucky had the fourth highest prescribing rate of opioid pain relievers (excluding buprenorphine products) with 128 prescriptions dispensed per 100 residents, 5 and it had the second highest age-adjusted drug overdose mortality rate in the US (25/100,000). 15 Besides the aggressive marketing of OxyContin R in eastern Kentucky (the Kentucky Appalachian region), the opioid epidemic in Kentucky may be attributed to a diversity of factors including: high prevalence of cancer and injury, inadequate access to health care services and substance use disorder treatment, and cultural and environmental stressors. [16] [17] [18] In 2012, in response to the opioid crisis, Kentucky enacted comprehensive legislation in an attempt to reduce the abuse and diversion of prescription opioid analgesics (Kentucky House Bill 1, 2012 Special Session) 19 ; subsequent licensure board regulations in 2013 (201 KAR 8:540, 9:260, 20:057) codified clinical guidelines to controlled substance prescribers by providing guidance regarding the frequency and usage of the state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), urine drug screenings, and patient follow-up protocols. [20] [21] [22] In this study we investigated the trend in opioid analgesic (excluding buprenorphine) prescribing in Kentucky from 2012 to 2015, and we identified rural-urban as well as geographic region differences in these prescribing trends. We hypothesized a decline in the opioid prescribing rate, especially in Kentucky counties with historically high prescribing rates. Specifically, our research questions were:\n(1) Have the rates of residents with opioid prescriptions significantly changed over time? (2) Did changes in opioid prescribing over this 4-year period in Kentucky vary by rural-urban county residency classification, after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, availability of primary health care providers, opioid use disorder treatment with buprenorphine/ naloxone, and rates of major health conditions commonly treated with opioid analgesics (eg, invasive cancer)? (3) Were there significant changes in opioid prescribing in the Kentucky Appalachian counties, a predominantly rural region in economic distress with historically high opioid prescribing? (4) What county-level factors were associated with the opioid prescribing rate?"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "We obtained 45,059,360 individual-level records of controlled substance prescriptions dispensed in Kentucky from 2012 to 2015 and reported to the Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) program, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The Schedule II to IV opioid prescriptions, including methadone for pain treatment and excluding buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone combinations, were used for the calculations of opioid prescribing measures. 23 Buprenorphine/naloxone combination transmucosal (ie, sublingual or buccal products) prescriptions were used as an indicator for medication treatment for opioid use disorders, their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication. 24 The Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure has a regulation on buprenorphine prescribing which stipulates that buprenorphine products FDA-approved for opioid use disorder treatment are not allowed to be prescribed off-label. 25 Methadone dispensed at opioid treatment programs is not reported to the KASPER system.\nMultiple data sources were used for the calculation of covariate measures, including (1) "}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "In this ecological study with longitudinal data, measures were calculated at the county level and repeated quarterly. In total, there were 1,920 county-quarter observations for the 120 Kentucky counties over the study period.\nThe outcome of interest was the number of residents with at least one dispensed opioid analgesic prescription within each county-quarter. For persons with multiple prescriptions within a quarter reported under different resident addresses, the county of residence was identified as the most frequently reported county in that quarter. The most recent county reported was selected for a person with tied frequency of resident counties reported within a quarter.\nOur exposures of interest were: (1) rural/urban status of the county (Rurality) and (2) geographical region of Kentucky (Region). Rurality of a county was measured by the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) 2013. 29 We categorized these codes based on adjacency to a metro area, which may be a proxy for availability of nonopioid pain management treatment options, opioid addiction treatment, or access to heroin. A study by Brown et al, for example, showed that mean distances to nearest opioid addiction treatment centers for pregnant women residing in Kentucky rural/micro and Appalachian areas were significantly higher than for those in metropolitan and non-Appalachian regions. 30 Three groups of rurality/urbanization were defined: (1) metropolitan (metro) counties (RUCC 1 to 3); (2) nonmetro adjacent to metro (NMAM) counties (RUCC 4, 6, 8) ; and (3) nonmetro not adjacent to metro (NMNAM) counties (RUCC 5, 7, 9) . Three regions of Kentucky were studied (Appendices [available online only], Figure 3 ): (1) Delta region that includes 21 far-western Kentucky counties, 31 (2) Appalachian region that includes 54 eastern counties in the Appalachian Mountains, 32 and (3) Central Kentucky region constituting the remaining 45 counties in the Bluegrass and Pennyroyal areas. The Delta and Appalachian regions are federally designated areas of economic distress. 33 Through review of the literature, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [34] [35] [36] county-level attributes such as race, educational level, poverty, unemployment rate, health insurance coverage, availability of prescribers (surgeon, psychiatrist, primary care physician, and dentist density), or the prevalence of painful conditions including diabetes and arthritis were found to be significantly associated with high OAP. In our analyses, we took into account the following county-level timevarying covariate measures that may explain differences in OAP outcome measures among Kentucky counties and regions: (1) socioeconomic factors, including percentage of population aged 55 or older, 37 percentage of white residents (excluding multiracial residents), median annual income, percentage of population aged 25 or older with a high school diploma, unemployment rate; (2) proxy indicators for access to opioid prescribers, namely rate of primary care physicians per 1,000 residents, and percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with health insurance coverage; (3) proxy indicators for medical need for analgesic opioids, entailing rates of inpatient hospitalizations and ED visits involving noncancer chronic pain (any principal or secondary diagnosis of 338.21, 338.22, 338.28, or 338.29 for ICD-9-CM-coded data, or any principal or secondary diagnosis of G89.21, G89.22, G89.28, or G89.29 for ICD-10-CM-coded data), rate of ED visits due to acute traumatic injuries (excluding all poisonings), age-adjusted incidence rates of invasive cancer averaged over the 2 years prior to the year of modeled opioid prescribing, and percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with any disability; (4) a proxy for availability of medication treatment for opioid use disorders that is rate of residents with buprenorphine/naloxone combination prescriptions per 1,000 residents with any opioid analgesic prescription; and (5) a proxy for heroin availability in a county-rate of ED visits for treatment of heroin-related overdoses per 1,000 residents. Assessment of collinearity between the covariates indicated that there was no significant effect of multicollinearity as the Spearman correlation coefficients of the factors were less than 0.70, and the variance inflation factors were all less than 10. Data sources for the listed measures are presented in the Appendices, Table 3 (available online only)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Analyses", "text": "Quarterly averages for the defined outcome measure were compared by geographic region and by rural-urban county classification. The cross-sectional measures presented in Table 1 describe the geographical regions as well as the rural-urban classification groups in terms of SES, prevalence of painful conditions, and other relevant measures introduced in Section 1.2.\nWe visualized the spatial distribution of the OAP county-level outcome measures using ArcGIS 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA) with referent geographical data of county boundary polygons of Kentucky, downloaded from the Kentucky Geography Network.\n38 SAS R 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses and modeling. Significant differences in at least one pair of the rural-urban classification groups (Rurality).\nNMAM: Nonmetropolitan, adjacent to a metro area. NMNAM: Nonmetropolitan, not adjacent to a metro area.\nDuring the study period, there were 21,096,420 opioid analgesic prescriptions, excluding buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone combinations. In 2015, more than 90% of these prescriptions were paid by some type of health insurance (eg, commercial insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Workers' compensation; Table 1 ). Data on payer source for previous years were not available. On average, 161 per 1,000 residents had at least one opioid analgesic prescription dispensed each quarter in NMNAM counties (Table 1) , a significantly higher rate compared with 104 per 1,000 for residents of the Metro counties. Residents of the Kentucky Appalachian region were prescribed opioid analgesics significantly more often than residents of Central Kentucky (156/1,000 vs 108/1,000, respectively). (Figure 1 ) demonstrate a visual decrease in the prescribing rate in the majority of the counties within the 3 geographical regions. In 2012Q1, the highest rates were observed in a group/cluster of counties in the southeastern part of the Kentucky Appalachian region. While this cluster shrank by 2015Q4, a distinct group of neighboring counties in the core of the Appalachian region retained the highest rates (above 186/1,000). The tables next to each map provide comparison of the unadjusted rates in the 3 geographical regions (Appalachia, Delta, and Central) as well as the 3 rural-urban classification groups (Metro, NMAM, and NMNAM counties). The metropolitan counties had the lowest rates of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions at baseline (113/1,000) and at the end of the study period (102/1,000) compared with the other rural-urban classification groups. Figure 2 (by Region) shows parallel decreasing lines of the estimated adjusted rates of residents with dispensed opioid analgesic prescriptions for the 3 geographical regions. The parallel lines indicate no significant variations in the magnitude of decrease in the rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions from one quarter to the next among the 3 regions (nonsignificant by-time interaction with Region). The Appalachian region had a significantly higher baseline rate and despite the significant decline over time, it retained a significantly higher rate in 2015Q4 as evident by the confidence limit band (Figure 2 , by Region). Due to the lack of significant bytime interaction, in any given quarter, the adjusted rate ratio (ARR) of OAP between the Appalachian region rate and the Central Kentucky region rate was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20-1.42), meaning the rate of Appalachian residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions was 30% higher than the rate for Central Kentucky residents in any given quarter of the study period. The ARR between the Appalachian and the Delta regions was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.06-1.33). There was not enough evidence that the rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions in the Delta region was significantly different from the Central Kentucky rate during any given quarter of the study period (ARR of 1.10 [95% CI: 1.00-1.21]). When looking at rural-urban county classification groups, the adjusted rate of OAP for the NMNAM counties was significantly higher at baseline (2012Q1) and remained significantly higher by the end of the study period ( Figure 2 , by Rurality). On average, in any given quarter, the rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions in NMNAM counties was 33% higher than in Metro counties "}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Trends", "text": "We used repeated measures log-linear models to evaluate trends over time and differences among the regions on the number of residents with dispensed opioid analgesic prescriptions. As the outcome data were calculated as counts, the Poisson regression framework was initially used with adjustment terms for exposed population, ie, an offset by the natural logarithm of the population size. Thus, the repeated measures analysis estimated rate ratios among exposed groups, and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to evidence for over-dispersion in the Poisson model fit, the final regression models were conducted as generalized estimating equations (GEE) using the log link function and negative binomial distribution (PROC GENMOD, DIST = NEGBIN, LINK = LOG, REPEATED SUBJECT, TYPE = AR). We employed the autoregressive assumption for the working covariance structure, meaning that intra-subject measurements are correlated but as measurements get farther apart the strength of the correlation diminishes.\nTo further investigate variations in the OAP measure, 2 models were compared: a model with a main exposure variable Region, and a model with a main exposure variable Rurality. The unadjusted models included only the main effect for Time and main exposure (Region or Rurality, respectively). To determine if OAP trends changed at different rates over time among the exposed groups, a by-time interaction with the main exposure variable was included in each adjusted model. The adjusted models controlled for (1) the rate of ED visits for injury, (2) the percentage of population aged 55 or older, (3) the percentage of population aged 25 or older with a high school diploma, (4) the percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with health insurance, and (5) the rate of residents with buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions. These 5 covariates were selected from the full models including all 13 covariates described in Section 1.2 by a backward selection strategy with a significance level of 5%. The interaction terms \"Time \u00d7 Region\" and \"Time \u00d7 Rurality\" were not significant and were dropped from the corresponding final adjusted models. The estimated quarterly OAP rates adjusted for the covariates in the final models with their 95% confidence limit bands were plotted by Region and by Rurality separately.\nIn addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the implementation of 2 main policies during the study period: (1) the licensure board regulations providing clinical guidelines for controlled substance prescribing, effective as of the third quarter of 2013 (201 KAR 8:540, 9:260, 20:057), [20] [21] [22] and (2) the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) rescheduling of hydrocodone combination products as Schedule II controlled substances, effective as of the last quarter of 2014. 39 The results from the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the estimated effects for Time and Region/Rurality designations did not change in significance and direction. Table 1 provides descriptions of our study population characteristics for each of the exposure groups (Region or Rurality). On average from 2012 to 2015, the Appalachian region counties as well as the NMNAM counties were more likely to have a significantly lower percentage of the population with a high school diploma, average median income, and percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with health insurance, and significantly higher rates of unemployment, ED visits due to acute injuries, ED visits and inpatient hospitalizations involving noncancer chronic pain, and percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with disability compared to the rest of the corresponding exposure groups of counties. The Appalachian region had a significantly higher rate of residents with buprenorphine/naloxone combination prescriptions (58 per 1,000 residents with opioid prescriptions) than the Delta region (12/1,000; P < .0001) and the Central Kentucky region (19/1,000; P < .0001). The Appalachian region also had significantly higher ageadjusted incidence rates of invasive cancer in comparison to the Delta and Central Kentucky regions.\n"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Factors Associated With High Rates of OAP", "text": "The results from the adjusted models presented in Table 2 indicated potential risk or protective factors associated with the rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions. The rate of ED visit due to acute injuries, the percentage of population aged 55 or older, and the percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with health insurance were significantly and positively correlated with the modeled outcome. For every one-per thousand increase in the rate of ED visits due to acute injuries, the adjusted rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions was estimated to increase multiplicatively by 1.0034 (increase by 3.4/1,000). The rate of residents with buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions and the percentage of population with a high school diploma were negatively associated with the outcome indicator. For instance, an average quarterly increase of one resident with buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions per 1,000 residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions was associated with a 0.1% reduction in the rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions. Our data did not support significant associations between the rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions and percentage of white residents, median income, unemployment rate, rates of primary care physicians, rates of ED visits for treatment of heroin-related overdoses, rates of ED visits and inpatient hospitalizations involving noncancer chronic pain, age-adjusted incidence rates of invasive cancer, or percentage of noninstitutionalized civilians with disability."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results from the longitudinal data analysis indicated a statistically significant declining trend in rates of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions from 2012 to 2015. This finding agreed with our hypothesis and was anticipated based on the national-level decrease in the rates of opioid analgesic prescriptions per capita, and the comprehensive efforts of Kentucky stakeholders to curtail the prescription opioid misuse and potentially inappropriate OAP in the state. However, direct comparison of these results with previous studies cannot be made as this is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to measure the number of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions rather than the number of opioid prescriptions. Because individual residents may have multiple opioid analgesic prescriptions simultaneously, measuring the number of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions reflects more accurately the extent of prescription opioid analgesic use in the population. The changes in the number of residents with dispensed opioid analgesic prescriptions per capita over the study period were comparable (parallel) across geographical regions and across rural-urban classification groups. One interpretation of this finding is that the changes over time were driven by state and national policies and interventions 8 that had a similar effect in different areas of the state. The rate of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions in NMNAM counties was significantly higher at the beginning of the study and remained significantly higher at the end of the study period, regardless of the significant decline over time, and after controlling for health conditions justifying OAP. This finding is not surprising in that residents of remote rural counties do not have easy access to alternative nonopioid pain treatment options (eg, interventional pain management, physical therapy) 10 and, to the best of our knowledge, no significant progress has been made in the state to address these disparities. Additionally, the rate of medical conditions associated with pain (eg, rate of acute injuries, percentage of population with disabilities; Table 1 ) remained more prevalent in the NMNAM counties. The Delta and the Appalachian region are both predominantly rural, consisting mostly of NMNAM counties. The Kentucky Appalachian region was considered heterogeneous 40 and the small grouping of counties adjacent to metropolitan areas were not typical for the Appalachian Mountains' features. Residents living in the counties adjacent to metropolitan areas may not have limitations in accessibility to nonopioid pain treatment options. Meanwhile, the large grouping of NMNAM counties in Kentucky Appalachia may make it very difficult for residents residing in the core of the Kentucky Appalachian region to access nonopioid pain treatment options usually available in large urban or metro centers. The hot spot of counties with a high number of residents on opioid analgesic prescriptions per capita in the center of the Appalachian region (Figure 1, 2015Q4) suggests that the geography and travel time/distance to medical centers could be important covariates that require further research to inform strategic development of specific interventions for these areas. Further research is needed to evaluate the options for nonopioid pain treatment in the Appalachian region (eg, availability and accessibility of interventional pain management and physical therapy) as well as accessibility of and retention in medication treatment for opioid use disorder. In an effort to further improve OAP practices, the Attorneys General of Kentucky and West Virginia recently urged health insurers to modify their policies for pain management treatment to support use of nonopioid alternatives. 41 Our study results suggest that increased buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing could be a significant factor for reducing OAP rates. The significant rise in the rate of residents with buprenorphine/naloxone combination prescriptions in Kentucky over the study period might be explained by several factors. First, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000), which permitted qualified physicians to apply for a waiver to treat opioid use disorders with Schedule III-V medications specifically approved by the FDA for this indication, including transmucosal buprenorphine products, has increased access to outpatient treatment of opioid use disorder. 42 Recent federal legislation now allows for physicians to treat up to 275 patients concurrently (previous limit was 100 patients) 43 with buprenorphine for opioid addiction treatment and also now allows qualified nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat up to 30 patients in the first year of their waiver and 100 thereafter. 44 Second, Kentucky was an Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion state which has been associated with increases in the supply of buprenorphine-waivered physicians in the US. 45 Finally, the Kentucky Appalachian region (compared to the Central and Delta regions) historically has been noted to have high rates of residents with opioid use disorders and drug overdoses, indicating high demand for treatment. 46 Limiting prescription opioid analgesic supply to patients who have developed an opioid use disorder without providing evidence-based medical treatment for opioid addiction may result in shifting the demand for prescription opioids to heroin. 47 A transition to heroin use cannot be ruled out as a possible factor for the declining rates of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions in Kentucky based on the increasing number of heroin seizures reported by Kentucky State Police Crime Labs in recent years. 48 However, the rate of ED visits for treatment of heroin-related overdoses per 1,000 residents as a proxy for heroin availability in a county was not significantly associated with the rate of residents with dispensed opioid analgesic prescriptions in our study.\nAnother salient finding of this study was that counties with higher rates of ED visits due to acute injuries had higher rates of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions. Injury prevention efforts and limiting the initial number of days' supply for pain due to acute injury may have a positive effect on reducing exposure to opioids. Kentucky legislators took a step in this direction in 2017, 49 requiring state professional licensing boards to promulgate regulations limiting prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances for acute pain to a 3-day supply, with certain exceptions.\nConsistent with a recent US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, 8 we found positive associations between rates of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions and health insurance coverage. This result was understandable as our data indicated more than 90% of the opioid analgesic prescriptions in 2015 were paid by some type of health insurance. In addition, counties with higher percentages of population aged 55 or older would be expected to experience higher rates of residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions because older people may need more frequent treatments with opioids for health conditions due to painful terminal illness. Lastly, our results should be interpreted in the context of residents with dispensed prescriptions for opioid analgesics rather than residents who used prescription opioids. Inferences cannot be made at the individual level due to limitations of the PDMP data which collects data on dispensed prescriptions but does not provide evidence that individuals receiving dispensed opioid analgesic prescriptions actually take the dispensed medication. Additionally, using proxy variables to measure medical needs for pain treatment, availability of medication treatment for opioid use disorders, and availability of heroin may not reflect comprehensively these situations in practice.\nIn conclusion, our study examined changes in the rate of residents with dispensed opioid analgesic prescriptions in Kentucky from 2012 to 2015 and identified no regional or rural/urban differences in the degree of decline over time. A significantly higher proportion of residents residing in the Kentucky Appalachian region or in NMNAM counties received prescriptions for opioid analgesics during the study period. These findings may be useful for modifying and tailoring local interventions, prescriber education, medical treatment capacity, and state policies to reduce potentially inappropriate OAP in Kentucky. The study also identified risk and protective factors for high rates of residents receiving opioid analgesic prescriptions, which may help prioritize and allocate resources and support to targeted groups in order to mitigate the opioid crisis in Kentucky."}]
