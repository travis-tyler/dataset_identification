It is well known that hypertension is associated with cerebrovascular disease and vascular dementia on the basis of vascular remodeling. However, the mechanisms linking hypertension and AD remain unclear. Methods: We studied 197 patients with AD (86 male; mean age AE SD: 75.8 AE 7.4 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with (n = 97) and without (n = 100) hypertension. We explored associations between hypertension and clinical, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and imaging markers of AD pathology in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that may link AD and hypertension. Results: We found that patients with AD with hypertension had worse cognitive function (Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, P = 0.038) and higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, P = 0.016) compared with those without hypertension. Patients with AD with hypertension showed reduced glucose hypometabolism in the right (P < 0.001) and left (P = 0.007) hippocampus. No differences were found in magnetic resonance imaging volumetric measurements, [ 18 F]florbetapir uptakes, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid between patients with AD with and without hypertension. Conclusions: Although hypertension is associated with worse cognitive function, behavioural symptoms and hippocampal glucose hypometabolism, it is not associated with evidence of increased amyloid or tau pathology.

The cardinal pathology in AD includes accumulation of extracellular amyloid-b (Ab) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau, as well as synaptic loss [2] . Over the last few years, several large phase III clinical trials of putative diseasemodifying treatments using antiamyloid approaches have failed [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, identifying potential modifiable risk factors of AD is crucial for primary prevention and might lead to a reduction in AD incidence.\nSeveral studies suggest that cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as type two diabetes, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome and hypertension, could be linked to sporadic AD [9] [10] [11] . Among these risk factors, hypertension may be the most detrimental [12] . It is well known that hypertension is the most significant contributing factor in cerebrovascular disease, as it can cause microvascular dysfunction and narrowing, which can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, microhaemorrhages and encourage cerebral small vessel disease [12] . Small vessel disease can consequently lead to lacunar infarcts and leukoaraiosis, changes that are closely associated with cognitive decline and vascular dementia [12] .\nIn contrast to the mechanisms that link hypertension and cerebrovascular disease, the pathophysiological links between hypertension and AD are more complex and may involve inflammatory processes, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, as well as cerebral hypoperfusion [13] [14] [15] . Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, there is strong evidence to support the hypothesis that hypertension in mid-life leads to cognitive impairment and contributes to the development of AD in later life [16] . It is also possible that hypertension may exacerbate AD symptoms and pathology.\nHere, we investigated whether hypertension is associated with clinical, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarkers of AD pathology in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that may link AD and hypertension."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Participants with a systolic BP reading of \u2265140 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP reading of \u226590 mmHg were classed as hypertensive, whereas subjects with a systolic BP value of \u2264139 mmHg as well as a diastolic BP value of \u226489 mmHg were deemed to be normotensive. Medical history was examined thoroughly in the database for evidence of hypertension for each participant using 'hypertension' as a key word and its synonyms, such as 'HTN', 'high blood pressure', 'high BP', 'elevated blood pressure', 'elevated BP' and 'increased blood pressure'. Additionally, obvious spelling mistakes such as 'hpertension' and 'hyoertension' were included. Patients with AD were subdivided into two groups according to the presence/absence of hypertension: AD with hypertension (n = 97, 49.2%; 45 male) and AD without hypertension (n = 100, 50.8%; 41 male; Table 1 ). Fifty-one patients with AD (55.3%) had both a history of hypertension and BP readings suggestive of hypertension, 38 patients with AD (36.9%) had only a history of hypertension with normal BP readings, and the remaining eight patients with AD (7.8%) were classified as hypertensive based only on BP readings."}, {"section_title": "Clinical assessments", "text": "Cognitive function was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADASCog 11) and MMSE.

Data are given as mean AE SD.\npatients with AD with and without hypertension were also observed in specific items of the ADAS-Cog 11.\nHypertensive patients had worse results on items testing word recognition and the ability to follow commands. Impaired verbal learning and difficulties in performing simple tasks are considered early signs of AD [22, 23] , thus it is possible that hypertension might be one of the earlier factors leading to the development of AD. Investigating these findings in hypertensive individuals without AD and in patients with mild cognitive impairment may shed light on this intriguing hypothesis. Previous studies have shown that hypertension in healthy elderly individuals is associated with cognitive decline and white matter lesions [24, 25] . By contrast, studies examining the impact of hypertension on cognitive decline in patients with AD are limited. However, one case-control study has found that cognitive decline is accelerated by hypertension in patients with AD under the age of 65 years over a 6-month period [26] . Other studies have found that both mid-life and late-life hypertension increase the risk of AD [9, [27] [28] [29] . In both cerebrovascular disease and AD, hypertension may irreversibly affect the functions of the 'neurovascular unit', a complex multicellular functional unit involved in accomplishing the processes of cerebral autoregulation and functional BSI, boundary shift integral; FDG, fluorodeoxyglucose; NS, non-significant; SUVR, standardized uptake values ratio. *All P values are Benjamini-Hochberg corrected. Data are given as mean AE SD. Bold indicates significant value (P < 0.05).\nhyperaemia [30] . Loss of autoregulation and reduced cerebral blood flow in response to regional brain activity may cause cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Research has suggested that, whereas mild reductions in cerebral blood flow can affect protein synthesis [13] , which is essential for the synaptic plasticity involved in learning and memory, chronic hypoperfusion can increase hyperphosphorylated tau levels in the hippocampus and cortex [14] , as well as cause progressive accumulation of Ab peptides [15] . In addition to regulating cerebral blood flow, the neurovascular unit forms the basis of the blood-brain barrier. Hypertension has been found to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, an alteration that can lead to the accumulation of neurotoxic molecules in the brain such as Ab and thrombin [13] . We found that hypertensive patients with AD had an increased neuropsychiatric symptom burden compared with normotensive patients with AD. One study has found that a history of hypertension increases the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation/ aggression, anxiety and delusions in patients with AD [31] . A more recent study in a large cohort of 457 patients with AD also showed that a history of hypertension was associated with worse behavioural symptoms as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire at the time of AD diagnosis [32] . One possible explanation for the link seen between hypertension and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delusions is that there may be a reduction in cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal and temporal cortices [33] .\nImaging analyses revealed decreased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus of patients with AD with hypertension. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory. Reduced glucose metabolism in this region of the brain may reflect underlying neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, and could explain the greater cognitive impairment observed in patients with AD with hypertension compared with those without hypertension. Glucose hypometabolism in the hippocampus and temporo-parietal areas has been extensively described in patients with AD [34] and mild cognitive impairment [35, 36] . Hypertension compromises the integrity of blood vessel walls in the brain leading to hypoperfusion and decreased glucose metabolism, which can promote AD neuropathogenesis [37] . Functional failure in brain microvasculature may affect the drainage of pathological misfolded proteins [38] . It should be noted that no other regions of the brain showed changes in glucose metabolism, perhaps suggesting that the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to changes in cerebral blood flow.\nAlthough previous studies propose that the cerebrovascular damage could contribute to AD pathology, we found no significant differences in [ 18 F] florbetapir standardized uptake value ratios or plasma and CSF amyloid and tau levels between patients with AD with and without hypertension. It is possible that the mechanisms of action of hypertension in lowering cognitive and neuropsychiatric performance are different from those promoting AD pathology. We also found no differences in brain and hippocampal MRI volumetric measurements between patients with AD with and without hypertension. Although research on volumetric imaging changes in patients with AD with hypertension is limited, it has been found that healthy hypertensive individuals have significantly larger ventricular volumes and brain atrophy [39] . The fact that we did not find these changes in our AD population perhaps suggests that, whereas hypertension may lead to functional brain changes such as reduced hippocampal glucose metabolism, it may have a small effect on structural volumetric brain changes for the stage of AD studied here. We also found no differences in ApoE genotype between patients with AD with and without hypertension. It is known that ApoE4 is associated with reduced lipid metabolism and vascular function, and that high cholesterol and plaque buildup lead to hypertension [40] . However, the allele is associated with younger onset AD and increases AD risk in a dose-dependent manner [30] . This may explain why no differences were detected in our sample of patients. Furthermore, ApoE4 is thought to have varying modulating influence on BP [30] .\nThere are several important limitations of this study that need to be mentioned. In terms of methodology, there was insufficient control of antihypertensive therapy and vascular comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity. With several patients in our sample potentially on BP-lowering medication, the full negative impact of hypertension on AD symptoms and hippocampal glucose metabolism is likely to be masked and may actually be greater. Furthermore, other cardiovascular disease risk factors may independently influence AD pathology. Another point to note is that the ADNI study cohort represents a clinical trial population. As a result, our findings may have limited generalizability. Additionally, the ADNI study only recruits patients with AD with a CDR score of 0.5 or 1 and an MMSE score between 20 and 26. This means that the results obtained here are solely based on a population of patients with early to moderate AD. It is possible that hypertension may not have such an impact on AD biomarkers in later stages of the disease. The ADNI cohort also only includes subjects aged 55-90 years and AD may start developing before the age of 55 years.\nIn conclusion, hypertension appears to negatively affect cognitive and neuropsychiatric function and regional brain metabolism. Our findings highlight the urgent need to treat hypertension in a vulnerable age group. Effective management of hypertension may potentially have a therapeutic role in the alleviation of symptoms in AD."}]
