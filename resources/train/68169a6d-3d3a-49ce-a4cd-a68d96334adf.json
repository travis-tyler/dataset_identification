[{"section_title": "", "text": ". In one approach, sometimes called the additive factors or multiple predictor approach, individual risk factors are used as predictors of children's development in a multivariate analysis to explore the unique effects of each risk factor. The benefits of this approach are that it retains the full predictive power of each risk in the original variable set and it allows for the evaluation of the relative importance of each risk factor. The drawback to this approach is the loss of statistical power to detect significant relationships, especially when sample sizes are small and the number of individual risk factors under consideration is large. An additional disadvantage of this approach is the potential for overlap or correlation among predictors, which can obscure meaningful relationships of individual risk factors with outcomes due to deflated parameter estimates. A second approach, sometimes called the composite or cumulative risk index approach, involves the creation of a single, multiple risk index based on a series of dichotomous risk ratings, which is then used as a predictor of children's social or academic development. The benefits of this approach are that it enables researchers to simultaneously consider multiple risks with a single predictor. This feature is especially attractive when analyzing data sets with relatively small samples. The drawback to this approach is that it does not allow for identification of specific relations between risk factors, alone or in combination, and child outcomes.\nMany of the studies that compare approaches to examining the relationship between risk factors and child outcomes have been based on relatively small sample sizes and have included large numbers of contextual risk factors as predictor variables. Furthermore, in many instances the samples were not representative of the U.S. population of children; rather, they tended to focus on minority children or those who had certain risk factors present (e.g., large proportion of families in poverty, overrepresentation of parental psychopathology). With such samples, researchers noted that the composite or cumulative risk index approach tended to provide the greater statistical power for examining the relationships between risk factors and child outcomes than the multiple predictor approach (Burchinal et al. 2000; Gutman, Sameroff, and Cole 2003) . However, exploring the unique effects of risk factors allows for the isolation of qualitatively distinct sources of contextual risk (Ackerman et al. 1999) .\nUsing data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), this paper extends the findings from prior research. First, it explores whether kindergartners' reading and mathematics gains over the first 4 years of school are more strongly associated with particular risk factors alone or in combination, as opposed to the cumulative number of family risk factors a child experiences. Second, the analysis makes use of the reading and mathematics data collected at 4 time points (i.e., fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, spring first grade, and spring third grade) to describe achievement growth over time, rather than using scores from two time points (fall kindergarten and spring third grade) as a measure of academic gain."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The ECLS-K, sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), within the U.S.\nDepartment of Education's Institute of Education Sciences, has followed a nationally representative sample of kindergartners from the fall of 1998 through the spring of 2004, when most of the children were enrolled in fifth grade. 1 The study collects information directly from the children and their families, teachers, and schools.

Below is a brief description of the key measures and characteristics used from these information sources. The variables created for the analyses come from the ECLS-K Longitudinal Kindergarten-Third Grade public-use data file (NCES 2004-089) . Variable names from the ECLS-K database are included in the descriptions using the kindergarten names and are indicated in all capital letters. 4 Initially the analyses included the sample of students who were not able to be assessed in English in the early rounds of the study due to limited English proficiency since many of these children had valid assessment scores in later rounds. However, because the missing assessment data for these children were not randomly distributed, the level-1 data violated assumptions of HLM and led to incorrect level-2 coefficients of children's achievement. In an earlier report (Denton and West 2002) , analyses were conducted to explore how including children who initially could not take the battery in English but were tested by spring of first grade would impact achievement estimates. Significant reading tscore differences overall and by specific racial/ethnic group were not detected between the sample assessed in English at all time points and the total sample, including those who were able to be tested with the English assessment at a later time. In third grade, the reading t-scores for children whose home language was non-English did not differ based on whether they had sufficient English skills to take the ECLS-K battery at kindergarten entry or at later rounds (t-scores of 49.2 and 48.2, respectively, t-test value = 0.465). Elapsed time between assessments. The date of assessment was recorded at each data collection period (e.g., in the kindergarten year, C1ASMTMM (month), C1ASMTDD (day), C1ASMTYY(year)). The elapsed time, in months, was calculated between the initial assessment (in fall kindergarten) and each later assessment (i.e., spring kindergarten, spring first grade, spring 5 The federal poverty level status composite variable is derived from household income and the total number of household members. Federal poverty thresholds are used to define households below the poverty level. For instance, in 1998 if a household contained 4 members, and the household income was lower than $16,655, then the household was considered to be in poverty. 6 This paper refers to data collected in the spring of 2002 as third-grade data and the sampled children as third-graders, although not all children in the sample used for this paper were enrolled in third grade. In the spring of 2002, about 89 percent of the sample children were in third grade, 10 percent were in second grade, and about 1 percent were enrolled in other grades (e.g., first or fourth grade)."}, {"section_title": "Presence of family risk factors in the kindergarten year (4 variables", "text": "third grade). The elapsed time variable is used in the analyses to describe the amount of reading and mathematics gains children demonstrated each month since the fall kindergarten assessment."}, {"section_title": "Control variables.", "text": "Children's sex and race/ethnicity are included as control variables in the analyses given that previous research has found relationships between these characteristics and children's achievement in reading and mathematics (Downey, von Hippel, and Broh 2004; Rathbun and West 2004; West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000; Zill and West 2001) .\nFurthermore, although race/ethnicity is related to the number of family risk factors a child may experience (Zill and West 2001) , each of the two characteristics is also independently related to children's achievement gains over the first 4 years of school (Rathbun and West 2004 ).\n\u2022 Child's sex: Male or female (GENDER).\n\u2022 Child's race/ethnicity: White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic, Asian/Pacific\nIslander; and Other, non-Hispanic (which includes American Indians, Alaska Natives, and non-Hispanic multiracial children). (RACE, collapsed). Zill and West (2001) found that 46 percent of all first-time kindergartners had at least one risk factor present. Twenty-three percent came from single-parent households, 14 percent of children's mothers had not completed high school, 18 percent of children's families were on welfare or received food stamps, and 9 percent of children lived in a household where English was not the primary language. Of those first-time kindergartners who were administered the ECLS-K assessments beginning in the fall of kindergarten (i.e., the sample used for this paper), 39 percent had at least one family risk factor in their first year of school. Twenty-five percent came from single-parent households, 11 percent of children's mothers had not completed high school, 18 percent lived below the federal poverty threshold, and 5 percent of children lived in a household where English was not the primary language. Twenty-three percent of kindergartners had exactly one of the four risk factors, 12 percent had two risk factors, 4 percent had three risk factors, and less than 1 percent had all four risk factors in kindergarten. The percentages of children with different numbers and types of risk factors in this paper are in some cases lower than the percents reported by Zill and West (2001) because the analytic sample for their report did not exclude kindergartners who were unable to take the assessments due to limited English proficiency. For example, the percent of children from homes with non-English primary language who also lived in poverty was larger for the population of first-time kindergartners than it was for the sample of children who were fluent enough in English to take the assessments when they began kindergarten (44 percent vs. 31 percent, respectively) (data not in table)."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "Certain patterns of family risks were more prevalent than others (table 2) .

Also, children whose primary home language was not English were more likely than those whose mothers did not complete high school to have only one risk factor (45 percent vs. 32 percent, respectively). Thus, it is important to look specifically at the associations of particular combinations of risk factors that children experience with their achievement growth to explore whether certain types of risk factors are more strongly associated than others with children's initial achievement and their growth in reading and mathematics in the first four years of school."}, {"section_title": "HLM Analyses", "text": "Two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to describe the achievement growth of children with different types and numbers of family risk factors. Analyses were conducted separately for reading and mathematics. At level 1, children's individual growth trajectories were modeled based on their assessment scores from multiple occasions (fall K, spring K, spring 1 st and spring 3 rd ). Thus, the level 1 model is:\nWhere Y ij is the child's subject-area score at a given time point, a ti is the elapsed time (i.e., number of months) since the initial (fall K) assessment, \u03c0 0i is the child's initial (fall K) achievement score (i.e., at 0 months), and \u03c0 1i is the growth rate over the first 4 years of school, which represents the child's expected change in achievement each month. This model assumes that errors (e ti ) are independent and normally distributed, with a common variance (Bryk and Raudenbush 1992) . 7 Standard error for full sample estimate = 1.9; standard error for analysis sample = 2.3.\nThe level 2 model incorporated child-level characteristics (i.e., child's sex, race/ethnicity, and the 4 family risk factors). 8 These variables are included as predictors in the second-level equations of both the intercept and growth-rate parameters. The level 2 models are: The estimates of the \u03b2 0j and \u03b2 1j coefficients describe the amount of initial differences (i.e., in fall kindergarten) and differences in growth over time, respectively, that can be associated with each of the child-level predictors.\nA series of HLM analyses were conducted to compare findings for the relationship between children's achievement and 1) a cumulative risk factor index; 2) the four individual risk factor variables; and 3) unique combinations of the four risk factors, as represented by a series of dummy-coded variables. 9 The first analysis included a single level-2 risk predictor (i.e., cumulative number of risk factors for a child) and the second analysis included four level-2 risk predictors (i.e., dummy codes for whether the child lived below the poverty threshold, lived in a single-parent household, had a mother who did not complete high school, and had a primary home language that was not English). For the third analysis, 11 dummy-coded combinations of risk factors were created:\nChildren with only 1 risk factor:\n1. Living below the poverty threshold 2. Living in a single-parent household 3. Having a mother who did not complete high school 4. Having a primary home language that is not English\nChildren with two risk factors:\n5. Living below the poverty threshold and in a single-parent household 6. Living below the poverty threshold and having a mother who did not complete high school 7. Living below the poverty threshold and having a primary home language that is not English 8. Living in a single-parent household and having a mother who did not complete high school 9. Living in a single-parent household and having a primary home language that is not English 10. Having a mother who did not complete high school and having a primary home language that is not English\nChildren with three or four risk factors:\n11. Three or four of the four risk factors present Although children with three or four risk factors could also be separated into unique combinations of multiple risk factors (e.g., living below the poverty threshold, living in a single-parent household, and having a mother who did not complete high school; having all four risk factors present), most of the combinations yielded small sample sizes, as noted in table 1. Since the small sample size precluded reporting estimates for some of these multiple risk categories, children with three or four risk factors were grouped together into a single dummy-coded variable of three or four risk factors.\nThe risk factor variables for each of the three analyses were entered as level-2 predictors of children's initial (fall kindergarten) achievement and as predictors of children's achievement growth from fall kindergarten to spring of third grade. In addition, children's sex and race/ethnicity were included as control variables.\nThe regression coefficients reported in the text and tables of this paper are unstandardized coefficients, representing the change in mean score points for a child with a given risk factor. For example, if the reported regression coefficient for being in poverty was -1.2, this would indicated that a child living below the poverty threshold would score, on average, 1.2 points lower than a child living at or above the poverty threshold. The coefficients for each of the predictor variables were checked for significance, indicating that a child with a particular risk or combination of risk factors had different achievement status or growth than a child with no risk factors. Post-hoc t-test comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment 10 were also conducted in the third set of analyses to compare the coefficients for children with various combinations of risk factors to determine 10 The Bonferroni adjusted critical t-value for the second set of analyses is set at 2.87 for 12 comparisons and is set for the third analysis at 3.50 for 110 comparisons (2-tailed tests).\nwhether certain combinations of risk factors were associated with differential achievement status and/or growth.\nIt is important to note that these analyses do not imply a causal relationship between family risk factors and children's achievement. Other potentially important variables (e.g., preschool experiences, home environment, and school resources) may be related to children's achievement but are not represented in the analysis. The analyses in this paper are intended to provide a description of the differences associated with the presence of particular family risk factors and children's achievement and to stimulate others to further explore the differences found here.\nAs a preliminary step in the 2-level HLM analysis, unconditional models were run for both subject areas, in which no level 2 (child-level) predictors were included. The mean intercept and growth rate coefficients from the unconditional models were all significant, indicating that both parameters were appropriate to include when describing children's mean growth trajectory in reading and mathematics (Bryk and Raudenbush 1992) .\nResults from the reading and mathematics analyses indicated that the presence of family risk factors was associated with children's achievement status at kindergarten entry as well as their growth in each subject area over the first 4 years of school (tables 3 through 5). Below is a discussion of findings for each of the three sets of HLM analyses that examined: 1) cumulative risk factor index (1 predictor variable); 2) individual risk factors (4 predictor variables); and 3) unique combinations of risk factors (11 predictor variables)."}, {"section_title": "Cumulative Risk Index Analysis", "text": "The first set of HLM analyses described the relationships between children's initial status and growth in reading and mathematics over the first 4 years of school and the total number of risk factors they experienced in the kindergarten year ( In addition, boys' initial reading scores were 1.8 points lower than girls' (ES = 0.19 SD), and\nBlack, Hispanic, and other, non-Hispanic kindergartners had lower initial reading scores than White kindergartners after taking into account other factors (1.8, 1.8, and 1.7 points lower, "}, {"section_title": "Individual Risk Factor Analysis", "text": "For the second set of analyses, each individual risk factor variable was included as a predictor of children's initial achievement and growth (table 4). In both reading and mathematics, all of the risk factors explored in this paper were associated with children's initial achievement and their growth over the first 4 years of school. For instance, children whose mothers did not complete high school scored 4.7 points lower in reading and 4.1 points lower in mathematics at the start of school than children whose mothers held at least a high school diploma (ES = 0.49 SD and 0.47 SD, respectively). Kindergartners in poverty scored 3.8 points lower in reading and 3.0 points lower in mathematics than those at or above the poverty threshold (ES = 0.40 SD and 0.34 SD, respectively). Children in single-parent households had scores that were 2.3 points lower in reading and 1.9 points lower in mathematics than those in two-parent homes (ES = 0.24 SD and 0.22 SD, respectively). Also, children whose primary home language was non-English scored 1.2 points lower in reading and 1.1 points lower in mathematics in fall of kindergarten than those whose primary home language was English (ES = 0.13 SD for both subjects).\nThe four family risk factors were also associated with children's reading and mathematics growth rates over the first 4 years of school. Children whose mothers did not complete high school gained 0.17 points less each month in reading and 0.12 points less in mathematics than those whose mothers had completed high school (ES = 0.44 SD and , 0.0.38 SD, respectively).\nKindergartners in poverty gained about 0.14 points less each month in reading and 0.09 points less in mathematics than children not in poverty (ES = 0.36 SD and 0.28 SD, respectively).\nChildren in single-parent households gained about 0.04 points less per month in reading and 0.02 points less in mathematics than those in other households (ES = 0.10 SD and 0.06 SD, respectively).\nOn the other hand, children who lived in households where the primary home language was not English made greater growth in both subject areas than children whose primary home language was English (0.06 more points/month in reading and 0.07 more points/month in mathematics) (ES = 0.15 SD and 0.22 SD, respectively). However, it is important to recall that while these children lived in households where English was not the primary home language, their own English skills were sufficient in the fall of kindergarten to enable them to participate in the ECLS-K assessments.\nIn addition to most of the individual risk factors being negatively related with children's initial achievement and growth in reading and mathematics, t-test comparisons of the regression coefficients for the individual risk factors indicated that individual risks were differentially related to achievement status and growth. For instance, the relative contributions of living in poverty and coming from a single-parent household on children's initial reading achievement were compared by using the regression coefficients for each risk factor and their respective standard errors from the full regression model (table 4) to calculate the t-value of the difference between the two estimates."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Living in poverty or having a mother who did not complete high school were related to larger mean differences in children's initial achievement and their growth in reading and mathematics than living in a household with only one parent or having a primary home language that was nonEnglish.

For children whose mothers did not complete high school, initial achievement status and growth in reading and mathematics over the first 4 years of school did not differ depending on whether additional risk factors were present. Within this group, there were no differences in achievement between children who had two, three, or four risk factors present.\nLiving below the poverty threshold. For the most part, poor children with additional risk factors did not have lower initial scores or slower growth in reading or mathematics than poor children with no other risk factors. Initial reading achievement and growth were both lower among poor children whose mothers did not complete high school than among children for whom poverty was the only risk factor identified in this study. A poor child whose mother did not complete high school scored about 3.3 points lower 16 (ES = 0.34 SD) in reading at the start of kindergarten and gained about 0.18 points less per month (ES = 0.46 SD) over the first 4 years of school than a poor child with no other risk factors present.\n14 The coefficients for the few combinations of risk factors that were not associated with achievement growth (i.e., poverty and non-English household, single-parent and non-English household) may not be significant due to small sample sizes or due to the fact that non-English language was positively associated with achievement growth, while other risk factors were all negatively associated with achievement growth. 15 For example, to examine whether children whose only risk factor was living in a single-parent household had differential growth in reading than children from single-parent households who also were in poverty, the t-test comparison would be t = [ (-0.06 ) -(-0.17) / ( Square root of (0.014 2 +0.020 2 )] = 4.60. 16 Differences in initial achievement scores and gains reported in this section were calculated by subtracting the individual risk factor coefficient from the multiple risk factors coefficient. For example, -8.98 (coefficient for living in poverty and having a mother who did not complete high school) --5.67 (coefficient for living in poverty as only risk factor) = -3.31.\nLiving in a single-parent household. Children from single-parent households had lower initial reading and mathematics achievement scores if they also lived in poverty or if they had three or four risk factors present, compared to having the single risk factor. For instance, children from single-parent households who also lived in poverty scored about 3.3 points lower in mathematics in the fall of kindergarten than children whose only risk factor was living in poverty (ES = 0.29 SD). Those in single-parent households had lower initial reading scores if their mother did not complete high school than if they had no other risk factors present. Children in single-parent households had slower reading growth if they lived in poverty or had three or four risk factors compared to having the single risk factor.\nNon-English primary home language. Compared to children whose only risk factor was living in a home where English was not the primary language, those who also had mothers who did not complete high school, lived in poverty, or had 3 or more risk factors scored lower in initial reading achievement. For instance, children from non-English homes who also lived in poverty scored about 5.0 points lower in reading in fall of kindergarten than children whose only risk factor was living in a non-English home (ES = 0.52 SD). Children whose primary home language was non-English had lower initial mathematics scores and made slower growth in reading and mathematics if they had a total of three or four risk factors than if they had no other risk factors.\nIn addition, if children whose primary home language was non-English had a mother who did not complete high school, their mathematics growth was negative (b = -0.11 points/month), whereas their growth was positive if their mother had completed high school (b = 0.07 points/month) (ES = 0.56 SD)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of findings on additional risk factors", "text": "These results indicate first that different risk factors have differential associations with children's achievement.

Also, children in poverty made slower mathematics growth than those in single-parent or non-English households. Furthermore, children coming from a household where English was not the primary language made greater growth in mathematics than children in single-parent households.\nFor children with two risk factors, initial reading achievement was lower for poor children whose mothers did not complete high school compared to poor children in single-parent households (9.0 points vs. 6.4 points, ES = 0.27 SD). No differences across 2-risk factor combinations were detected for initial mathematics achievement.

Over 39 percent of firsttime kindergartners had one or more family risk factors, and 16 percent had multiple family risks when they began school. Certain patterns of risk factors were more prevalent than others. Since this was the case, the associations between particular combinations of risk factors that children experience and their achievement growth were examined to explore whether certain types of risk factors leave children more vulnerable to beginning school with lower reading and mathematics achievement and falling further behind their classmates over the first 4 years of school.\nEarlier research examining the relationships between family risks and early development indicated that using individual risk factors as predictors of achievement would provide more information on the relative importance of individual risks than a cumulative risk index (Ackerman et al. 1999; Burchinal et al. 2000; Gutman, Sameroff, and Cole 2003; Sameroff et al. 1993 ). However, the cumulative risk index approach was often used in these studies and was more powerful for detecting significant relationships given their small sample sizes, focus on high risk children, and the relatively large number of risk factors being considered. The large, nationally representative sample in the ECLS-K presents an opportunity to compare the alternative methods discussed in prior studies for examining the relationships between family risks and achievement.\nIn this paper, three approaches to examining the relationship between family risks and achievement growth were used. First, children's reading and mathematics initial achievement status and growth were regressed on the cumulative number of risk factors present when they were in kindergarten. This approach, commonly used in other research, indicated that children with more risk factors had lower initial status and growth in both subjects than did children with fewer risk factors. The second approach included each of the four family risk variables as predictors of achievement. Findings from this set of analyses showed that the individual risks varied in terms of their association with children's initial achievement status and growth.\nThe final set of analyses, which included dummy-coded variables for 11 combinations of family risk factors, yielded more specific information on the relationship between particular combinations of risk factors and achievement. Compared to children with no family risks, children in single-parent households and those from homes where English was not the primary language demonstrated lower achievement, but if they had no other family risks they tended to have higher initial scores and made greater growth over the first 4 years of school than children in poverty or those whose mothers did not complete high school. Results from the third set also indicate that increases in the number of family risk factors are not always associated with greater differences in achievement. For example, children with any combination of two family risks did not differ in their achievement from children with three or four risks. Furthermore, in some cases, having three or four risk factors was not more detrimental than having the single risk of living below the poverty threshold or having a mother who did not complete high school.\nFindings from the third analyses also indicated that children whose only risk was living in a home where English was not the primary language tended to begin school with lower mathematics achievement, but over the course of the first 4 years they made greater growth, on average, than other children, in essence narrowing the mathematics achievement gap. This advantage only occurred, however, if the child had no other family risks. Also, this finding is limited to children who were fluent enough in English to take the reading and mathematics assessments when they began kindergarten.\nIn summary, the findings from this analysis support earlier research indicating that children's reading and mathematics achievement in the fall of kindergarten and their growth in both subjects over the first few years of school vary in relation to the number of family risk factors present at school entry (Downey, von Hippel, and Broh 2004; Rathbun and West 2004; West, Denton and Reaney 2001) . Results from this study build on earlier findings by demonstrating that particular combinations of risk factors are differentially associated with children's initial achievement and their growth from the start of kindergarten to the end of third grade.\nThe ECLS-K is designed to provide information on children's development from kindergarten through fifth grade across multiple contexts, including the home, classroom, school, and community. Future research using the ECLS-K could incorporate findings from this paper and other recent studies to further explore the achievement gaps observed between disadvantaged and more advantaged children. For instance, Fryer and Levitt (2004) were able to substantially reduce the Black-White achievement gap observed in the beginning of kindergarten by controlling for other child and family risk factors, including birth weight, mother's age at child's birth, and the number of children's books in the home. Downey, von Hippel, and Broh (2004) incorporated measures of in-school/out-of-school time into their research to describe patterns of growth over different time periods. While this paper used a static measure of family risks from the kindergarten year, future research could also take into account changes in children's family risk status by incorporating data on family structure, income, and mother's education across time.\nOther variables in the ECLS-K, such as home experiences, teacher characteristics and instructional practices, and school quality could also be used to explore achievement gaps.
