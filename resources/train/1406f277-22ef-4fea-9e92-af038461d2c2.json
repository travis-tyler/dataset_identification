The First Followup, conducted in 1994, provides information on the activities of these bachelor's degree recipients in the year after graduation. For longitudinal analysis of postbaccalaureate outcomes, the B&B survey design offers several advantages over previous surveys that have tracked the activities of a high school age cohort. First, B&B begins with a nationally representative sample of bachelor's degree recipients, regardless of graduates' age at degree completion. With the proliferation of part-time attendance and the increasing number of college students who are older than the traditional 18-to 22-year-old college-going population, this affords a more representative cross-section of bachelor's degree completers than would be possible with a sample based on an age cohort. Second, by sampling at degree completion, B&B avoids the problem of sample attenuation that occurs with high school cohorts (since not all members of a high school cohort attend college; those who attend differ in timing, intensity, and continuity of enrollment; and not all who attend complete a bachelor's degree). This report presents selected findings from the B&B:93/94 First Followup survey. The first section presents a brief profile of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. The second section presents an analysis of the amount of time taken to complete the degree. Finally, the compendium provides detailed tables that supplement the information presented in the first two sections, and also describes the employment and enrollment experiences of this population in the year after graduation.

This report uses those data to provide a detailed profile of the population of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, with particular attention to the amount of time taken to complete the degree, an issue of intense interest to students, parents, policymakers, and administrators. In recent years, the amount of time required to complete a bachelor's degree has attracted considerable attention as rising costs have increased the financial burden of undergraduate education on families and taxpayers (through their support of public institutions and state and federal financial aid programs). Delays in degree completion can be problematic for the individual, the institution, and society. For instance, individual costs involve additional tuition, foregone income while enrolled, and reduced long-term earning potential; institutional costs involve reduced ability to forecast future enrollment and to meet new enrollment demand, because of fewer spaces for new students; and social costs involve reduced efficiency of public investment in higher education, since it takes longer to realize returns on public dollars invested in support of undergraduate education."}, {"section_title": "A Profile of 1992-93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "This section presents a brief sketch of the characteristics of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, including tables and figures describing the population according to a number of key characteristics: gender, race-ethnicity, age at degree receipt, and types of institutions attended. This profile is included to provide the reader with a basic description of the population on which this and subsequent B&B reports will be based.   Age at degree receipt About half of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were age 22 or younger when they received their degree, and about one-quarter were age 23 or 24. One graduate out of six graduated at age 30 or older (table 3). Older students were more represented among those with high grades: graduates with cumulative GPAs of 3.5 or above were more likely to be in their 30s or older than were students with lower GPAs (17 percent were in their 30s, compared with 7 to 8 percent of those with lower grades; 11 percent were 40 or older, compared with 2 to 5 percent of those with lower grades).6 6A similar pattern is evident when overall grades are examined by age at entry: students in each category of age at entry had higher average cumulative GPAs than younger entrants (the only exception being that those who began at age 30 or older did not have significantly higher GPAs than those who began at 25-29 years old) (table   2). "}, {"section_title": "Degree-granting institution", "text": "Sixty-five percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients graduated from public institutions; 42 percent graduated from public doctorate-granting institutions (table 4). Graduates who scored in the bottom quartile of the SAT or ACT were more likely than others for whom a score was available to have received their degree from public nondoctoral institutions (32 percent versus 12 to 20 percent of others), while those scoring in the top quartile were more likely to have graduated from private, doctorate-granting institutions (23 percent versus 9 to 14 percent of others with scores reported). The rest of this section pertains to entry into postsecondary education and progress toward the bachelor's degree. A small number of 1992-93 graduates already held a bachelor's degree or higher level degree (6.5 percent) (compendium table 1.11). Since it would not be appropriate to include such students in the discussion of entry and progress, graduates who held a prior bachelor's degree or higher were excluded from the tables and figures that follow. "}, {"section_title": "Point of entry into postsecondary education", "text": "Half of all 1992-93 first-time bachelor's degree recipients (53 percent) attended more than one institution before completing their degree.' This includes students who changed institutions before earning the degree, and students who temporarily enrolled elsewhere but received the degree from the first institution attended. Table 5 presents information on how first-time bachelor's degree recipients began their postsecondary education. About half of first-time bachelor's degree recipients began their postsecondary education at a public 4-year institution (54 percent); another quarter started at a private, notfor profit 4-year institution (28 percent); 16 percent began at a public 2-year college; and the remainder began at other institutions (table 5).8 Of those who began at a public 2-year college, 30 percent completed an associate's degree before earning a bachelor's degree (table 6). Older entrants into postsecondary education were more likely than other bachelor's degree recipients to have begun in a public 2-year college. Graduates who began postsecondary education at age 20 or older were twice as likely as their younger counterparts to have begun at such institutions (36 to 42 percent of those who began postsecondary education at age 20 or older, compared with 14 percent of graduates who began at age 19 or younger) (table 5). Institution of origin was also related to prior preparation. For example, graduates who reported that they had taken remedial instruction in college were more likely than those with no remedial coursework to have begun their postsecondary education in a public 2-year institution (23 versus 16 percent). Similarly, students who scored in the bottom quartile on entrance examinations were more likely than those scoring in the middle or upper quartiles to have begun in a public 2-year institution, while those who scored in the top quartile were more likely to have begun at a private, not-for-profit 4-year institution. Despite the relationship between graduates' prior preparation and whether they began postsecondary education at a public 2-year institution, there was no systematic relationship between their grades at the degree-granting institution and whether they began at a public 2year institution.9 Among students who began postsecondary education at a 4-year institution, however, there was a relationship between college grades and whether they began at a public or at a private, not-for-profit institution: students whose cumulative GPA was 3.5 or higher were less likely than those with lower grades to have begun at a public institution, while those with GPAs below 3.0 were less likely than others to have begun at a private, not-forprofit institution. Students who majored in the arts and sciences were more likely than those in other majors to have begun postsecondary education at a private, not-for-profit 4-year institution (34 percent versus about 24 percent of other majors), and were less likely than other majors to have begun in a public 2-year institution (13 percent versus 18 percent of other majors). 'These figures change little when one excludes institutions attended only during the summer after high school and those attended only briefly (less than 3 months). For example, after implementing such a restriction, the number who began at public 2-year institutions drops to 15 percent, and the number who began at public 4-year institutions increases to 55 percent (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study First Followup (B&B:93/94), Data Analysis System). This remains true after controlling for major: cumulative and major GPAs did not differ significantly for those who began postsecondary education in a public 2-year institution versus those who began in a 4-year institution. The one exception was for those who majored in public affairs/social servicesin which case 2-year college entrants had higher cumulative GPAs (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study First Followup (B&B:93/94), Data Analysis System). "}, {"section_title": "Time to Degree Completion", "text": "The average number of years between high school graduation and completion of the bachelor's degree (an indirect measure of time to degree) has been increasing. The proportion of bachelor's degree completers graduating within 4 years after high school declined from 45 percent to 31 percent between 1977 and 1990, and the proportion completing their degrees more than 6 years after high school increased from 25 percent to 32 percent.1\u00b0I ncreases in the time to complete a bachelor's degree have been attributed to a number of factors. Between 1977 and 1990, the proportion of undergraduates attending part time grew from 37 percent to 42 percent.\" This change in the composition of the student body has directly increased the average time to degree. Furthermore, as older students return to college and complete degrees in greater numbers, time to degree as measured from high '\u00b0The Condition of Education, 1993 (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1993): 26. Since this measure includes nonenrolled time between high school and entry into postsecondary education, at least some of the change is due to increased participation and completion by nontraditional students. In the early 1980s, in response to falling numbers of high school graduates, many colleges bolstered sagging enrollments by recruiting more adult students. Thus, it is possible that increases in the time between high school and college graduation do not signify increases in the amount of time actually required to complete the bachelor's degree. \"A. McCormick, S. Geis, and R. Vergun, Profile of Part-Time Students in U.S. Postsecondary Education: 1989-90 (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1994). school graduation necessarily increases.' A recent analysis of two high school cohorts a decade apart suggests that increased time to degree is not solely due to more part-time or older studentsit also reflects increased course taking. In analyzing postsecondary transcripts from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 and the High School and Beyond Sophomore Cohort (most of whom completed high school in 1982), Adelman found the average number of credits earned by bachelor's degree completers rose from 126 to 139 credits between the two cohorts.' Other factors that have been cited as increasing time to degree include difficulty enrolling in required courses, as institutions have reduced course offerings in response to budget cuts; growing numbers of students who work while enrolled; increased rates of course withdrawal and noncredit repetition; and increased participation in remedial and developmental courses.\""}, {"section_title": "Outcome measures and sample definition", "text": "Time to degree is measured in two ways in this report: time elapsed between high school graduation and bachelor's degree completion, and time elapsed between entry into postsecondary education and bachelor's degree completion. As measures of elapsed time, both may include periods of nonenrollment and should not be interpreted as direct measures of time in school. The first measure includes two types of nonenrolled periods: those occurring between high school graduation and entry into postsecondary education, and those occurring between postsecondary entry and college graduation (i.e., vacations and stopout periods). This measure is useful primarily because it affords comparisons to time series data from the Recent College Graduates surveys. The second measure includes only enrollment gaps occurring after entry into postsecondary education, and will be the focus for most of the analysis of time to degree.' For the following analysis of time to degree, the sample was restricted to first-time bachelor's degree recipients: those graduates who did not hold any prior bachelor's or higher level degree. This restriction excluded about 6.6 percent of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. For analyses examining time between entry into postsecondary education and degree receipt, the sample was further restricted to exclude students with substantial periods between institutions when they were not enrolled. This restriction is explained in detail in the section \"Interruptions in enrollment.\""}, {"section_title": "Timing of entry into postsecondary education", "text": "Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, 9 out of 10 began postsecondary education within 1 year of high school graduation. The remaining 10 percent were distributed roughly evenly over the following intervals between high school graduation and postsecondary enrollment: 1 to 2 years (3 percent), 2 to 5 years (3 percent), and 5 or more years (4 percent) (table 7). Although public 2-year colleges serve a less traditional student population than 4-year institutions, the population of bachelor's degree recipients who began at such institutions included a large number of traditional students with respect to timing of entry into postsecondary education-79 percent entered college in the first year after high school.' This finding highlights the difference between the overall population of 2-year college students and the select group of 2-year college beginners who transfer to a 4-year institution and complete a bachelor's degree. Nontraditional students (including older students who may have delayed their entry into postsecondary education, as well as students who return to college after an extended period out of school) are less likely to be represented among bachelor's degree completers for two reasons. First, they are less likely to be working toward a bachelor's degree at all. Second, among those intending to complete a bachelor's degree, nontraditional students are at greater risk for attrition, and thus are less represented among completers.\" Nevertheless, those graduates who began at, public 2-year colleges were less likely than others to have entered postsecondary education in the first year after high school: the comparable figure for 4-year institutions is 93 percent. In addition to institution of origin, there were also differences in timing of postsecondary entry according to the institutions where bachelor's degree recipients received their degrees: those from doctorate-granting institutions were more likely than others to have begun postsecondary education within 1 year of high school (92 percent of graduates from doctoral institutions versus 86 to 88 percent of those from nondoctoral institutions). Students with highly educated parents were more likely to enroll within 1 year of high school graduation than were students whose parents had less education. This reflects not only socioeconomic differences but also two other factors: graduates whose parents had, lower educational attainment were more likely to be older, and older graduates were more likely to have delayed entry.\" 16By contrast, 48 percent of all students attending public 2-year institutions in 1992-93 began postsecondary education within a year of high school.

Table 8 presents comparable B&B data for 1992-93 graduates, and a time series using both RCG and B&B data is presented in figure 4. Thirty-one percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients earned the degree within 4 years of their high school graduation, and another 28 percent graduated between 4 and 5 years after finishing high school (figure 4). At the other extreme, 30 percent received, their degree more than 6 years after finishing high school. These data are very similar to RCG figures from 1990, the last year for which comparable data are available. As would be expected from the findings on delayed entry, time from high school graduation to degree receipt varied substantially according to students' point of entry into postsecondary education. Those who started at a private, not-for-profit 4-year institution were twice as likely as others to complete their degree within 4 years of high school graduation (57 percent versus not more than 27 percent of those who started at other types of institutions). By contrast, students who began in public 2-year institutions were more likely than those who began at 4-year institutions to complete their degree more than 10 years after high school. This reflects several factors that are especially common among 2-year college entrants: delayed entry, part-time attendance, and discontinuity of enrollment.'

By focusing the analysis on time from postsecondary entry to degree completion, the confounding effect of gaps between secondary and postsecondary education can be eliminated. Since the B&B data set includes starting and ending dates for each undergraduate institution attended, gaps in enrollment occurring between institutions can also be identified.' 19L. Berkner, S.

McCormick, Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students: Five Years Later (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1996). 2\u00b0Gaps in enrollment followed by a return to the same institutions cannot be identified because term-by-term attendance data for each institution attended are not available.  1977, 1986, 1990, and 1993 197719861990199327 27 1977198619901993 (1977, 1986, and 1990  For this analysis, transitions between institutions that included at least 4 consecutive months without enrollment were identified as periods of stopout between institutions. The total number of months of between-institution stopout was then calculated, allowing students with substantial gaps in enrollment between institutions to be identified.' Between-institution stopout is only possible for students who attended more than one institution (53 percent of all first-time bachelor's degree recipients). Students who began postsecondary education at a less-than-4-year institution necessarily attended more than one institution before completing the bachelor's degree. Among students who began at a 4-year institution, 37 percent attended more than one institution before receiving their degree (table   9). Among all first-time bachelor's degree recipients, three-quarters had no gaps of 4 months or longer between institutions, and an additional 8 percent had one gap of 4 or 5 months (about 1 semester) between institutions (table 10). Among the more restricted group for whom between-institution stopout is possible (i.e., those who attended more than one institution), 52 percent had no gaps between institutions, and another 16 percent had a gap of 4 or 5 months (figure 5). At the other extreme, 19 percent of students who attended more than one institution had at least 2 years' worth of enrollment gaps between institutions (table  10).\" Students who delayed their initial entry into postsecondary education by 1 year or more were almost three times as likely to experience substantial interruptions in enrollment between institutions as well: 22 percent of delayed entrants had 2 years' worth of enrollment gaps between institutions, compared with 8 percent of those who began postsecondary education within 1 year of high school graduation. 'Students with no between-institution stopout may nevertheless have gaps in enrollment that were followed by a return to an institution previously attended. This could be a single gap of at least 2 years' duration, or a combination of shorter gaps between institutions. Students who began postsecondary education at a 4-year institution were more likely than others to have progressed toward the degree without any periods of stopout between institutions (about 85 percent, versus 39 to 51 percent of others). This can partially be explained by the fact that many of those who began at a 4-year institution received their degree from the same institution, while others necessarily made a transition between institutions. Parallel to the findings for age at entry, students who began postsecondary education at a public 2-year institution were nearly three times as likely as those who began at a 4-year institution to have had at least 2 years' worth of enrollment interruption between institutions (19 percent versus 5 to 7 percent).  The influence of between-institution stopout on elapsed time to degree can be seen in table 11. In particular, note the proportions of students completing their degrees more than 6 years after beginning postsecondary education. Overall, about one-quarter of bachelor's degree recipients took more than 6 years to complete their degree (26 percent). This is strongly\" related to between-institution stopout, however: about one out of eight students who had no substantial between-institution stopout took more than 6 years to complete their degree, compared with three-quarters of those whose between-institution stopout was 6 months or more. Clearly, a large number of those who stopped out for a total of 6 months or more interrupted their enrollment for an extended period. Because between-institution stopout so strongly affects elapsed time to degree, the remainder of the analysis of time to degree will be restricted to first-time bachelor's degree recipients who had less than 6 months of stopout between institutions (about 85. percent of the total). "}, {"section_title": "Time between entry into postsecondary education and bachelor's degree completion", "text": "This section examines time from postsecondary entry to degree completion for those 1992-93 first-time bachelor's degree recipients who had less than 6 months of stopout between institutionsthat is, those for whom elapsed time to degree does not include large gaps between institutions. For simplicity, this group will hereafter be identified as \"steadyprogress graduates\" or \"steady-progress bachelor's degree recipients.\" Since this restriction pertains only to gaps between institutions, however, the reader should bear in mind that the steady-progress group may include students who had within-institution stopout periods (i.e., interruptions in enrollment followed by a return to the same institution). Table 12 reports time to degree as a percentage distribution, while table 13 reports the average number of years to degree completion. This discussion is organized around the percentage distribution figures, with occasional reference to the averages. Overall, about 43 percent of steady-progress graduates completed their degree within 4 years of beginning postsecondary education. Another 32 percent took between 4 and 5 years to graduate, and 11 percent took from 5 to 6 years. The remaining 14 percent received their degree more than 6 years after they began postsecondary education.

There was no gender difference with respect to completion after 6 years or average time to degree, however.' The only racial-ethnic differences in 4-year completion rates among steady-progress graduates were between white, non-Hispanic graduates (45 percent) and both black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic graduates (32 percent and 28 percent, respectively).' With respect to completion in more than 6 years, the only difference was between white, non-Hispanic and Hispanic graduates (13 percent versus 23 percent).\" Timing of entry and preparation for college Time to degree was related to both students' preparation for college and to when they began their postsecondary education. Steady-progress graduates who began their postsecondary education more than 1 year after high school were less likely than others to complete their degree within 4 years, and were almost three times as likely to take at least 6 years to do so (17 percent of delayed entrants graduated within 4 years, compared with 45 percent of those who did not delay; 43 percent of delayed entrants took more than 6 years to graduate, compared with 12 percent of those who did not delay). On average, delayed entrants took 7.7 years to complete their degree, compared with 5 years for those who did not delay entry into postsecondary education (table 13). This probably reflects both increases in part-time enrollment and in enrollment at less-than-4-year institutions among delayed entrants. (The relationship between institutions attended and time to degree is explored in the following section.) Students who scored in the top quartile on college entrance examinations were much more likely than others to complete their degree in 4 years (61 percent who scored in the top quartile graduated in 4 years, compared with 35 to 48 percent of those who scored in the bottom and middle quartiles, respectively). A similar relationship existed with respect to college grades: students with higher GPAs were more likely than other students to graduate within 4 years. Participation in remedial instruction was also related to time to degree: 23 percent of those who took remedial courses took more than 6 years to graduate, compared with 13 percent of those with no remedial coursework. As one might expect, an inverse pattern holds with respect to completion within 4 years: 44 percent of those with no remediation graduated within 4 years, compared with 27 percent of those who had done remedial or developmental work. On average, students who had taken remedial instruction took about 1 year longer than other students to complete their degree (6.1 versus 5.2 years) (table 13). It is likely that this reflects a number of factors: that a large number of students in need of remediation began their postsecondary education at institutions where part-time study is more common, such as public 2-year institutions; that some students in need of remediation may have interrupted their enrollment and later returned to the same institution; and that remedial courses may have been noncredit courses."}, {"section_title": "Institutions attended", "text": "Steady-progress bachelor's degree recipients who began postsecondary education at a private, not-for-profit 4-year institution were much more likely than those who began at a public 2-or 4-year institution to complete their degree within 4 years (67 percent compared with 24 percent of public 2-year entrants and 35 percent of public 4-year entrants) (table 12). At the other extreme, steady-progress graduates who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those who started at 4-year institutions to take 6 or more years to complete their degree (27 percent of community college starters versus 10 to 13 percent of 4-year starters). Matching the findings for institution of entry, steady-progress graduates of private, not-for-profit institutions were far more likely than graduates of public institutions to have received their degree within 4 years of starting postsecondary 'education (65 percent versus 34 percent) (table 12 and figure 6). This difference was also reflected with respect to longer completion times: graduation after more than 6 years was more common among steadyprogress graduates of public institutions than among their counterparts from private, not-forprofit institutions. On average, steady-progress graduates of public institutions took 5.3 years to complete their degree, about 1. semester longer than graduates of private, not-for-profit institutions (table 13). A more direct estimate of time to degree at public and private, notfor-profit 4-year institutions is possible by comparing the average time to degree for graduates of each type of institution who attended only one institution. For this group, it took students in both types of institutions about 5 years to complete their degree.' As noted earlier, half of all 1992-93 first-time bachelor's degree recipients attended more than one institution before completing their degree. Those who attended more than one institution include two groups of students: those who began at one institution and later entered the institution where they earned their degree (with or without a transfer of credits) and those who began at the institution where they earned a degree, but at some time enrolled elsewhere to participate in a special program or to complete needed credits.' While the average time to degree appears larger at public institutions, there is insufficient evidence that this reflects systematic differences in time to degree at the two types of institutions. 'See \"Double Dippers,\" The Chronicle of Higher Education (August 4, 1995): A27. Three-quarters of those who attended more than one institution began their postsecondary education somewhere other than the sample institution (compendium table 1.12).  One-third of those who attended more than one institution completed a subbaccalaureate credential (16 percent completed an undergraduate certificate, and 17 percent completed an associate's degree) (table 6). Attendance at more than one institution was strongly related to time to degree. Those who attended more than one institution were far less likely than those who attended a single institution to graduate within 4 years of postsecondary entry (31 percent versus 51 percent), and were more likely to take over 6 years to complete their degree (table 12). Moreover, this relationship persists after taking transfer of credit into account. Transcript data were used to identify the amount of credits transferred by students who began postsecondary education at some institution other than the one where they received their bachelor's degree. Even among steady-progress graduates, students who changed institutions and transferred credits were less likely than others to graduate within 4 years of beginning their postsecondary education.' Major field of study There were also differences in time to degree according to major field of study. For example, steady-progress graduates receiving degrees in the biological sciences were more likely than business, education, engineering, health professions, or public affairs/social services majors to complete their degree within 4 years (57 percent of biological science majors, compared with 28 to 41 percent of the other majors listed) (table 12). Majors in the health professions and in engineering were less likely than arts and sciences majors to complete within 4 years (28 percent of engineering and 29 percent of health professions majors, versus 51 percent of arts and sciences majors). Shorter completion times for biological science majors may reflect the presence of premedical students who may be especially motivated to advance to their professional training, while longer times for engineering majors may reflect the presence of students in 5-year programs.29"}, {"section_title": "Debt", "text": "Time to degree may also be related to whether students borrowed to finance their undergraduate education. For example, students with unmet financial need who are unwilling to incur additional debt may enroll part time or interrupt their enrollment so they can work longer hours to increase their earnings. Steady-progress graduates who accumulated between $1,000 and $20,000 of debt were less likely than those with no debt to graduate within 4 years (35 to 40 percent versus 48 percent among those who did not borrow) (table 12). At the other extreme, those who borrowed between $1,000 and $10,000 were more likely than nonborrowers to take more than 6 years to complete their degree. Nonborrowers and those with lighter (less than $1,000) or heavier (more than $20,000) debt burdens did not differ The comparison group includes all students who began postsecondary education at the sample institution (regardless of whether they transferred any credits), plus any students who began at a different institution but did not transfer any credits. \"The B&B data do not identify students who are enrolled in 5-year programs. with respect to time to degree, nor were there differences among borrowers with different amounts of debt.\" Among steady-progress graduates of private, not-for-profit institutions (where costs and student debt burdens are highest), those who borrowed at least $10,000 averaged 4.4 years from postsecondary entry to degree completion, compared with 5.7 years for those who borrowed between $1,000 and $10,000 (table 13). Again, those with lower debt may have chosen to stop out or to attend part time to increase their earnings rather than take more loans to control their costs, lengthening the time required to complete their degree.31"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The traditional notion of a bachelor's degree as a 4-year degree no longer matches the experience of the majority of bachelor's degree completers. Only 36 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients completed their degree within 4 years of beginning postsecondary education. Even when one excludes students who .took time out between institutions, less than half (45 percent) completed their degree within 4 years (table 11). A number of factors are clearly related to time to degree. Students who delayed their entry into postsecondary education took longer to complete their degree, as did those who began postsecondary education at a less-than-4-year institution. Attendance at more than one institution was also associated with increased time to degree, even after controlling for the proportion of total credits that were transferred. These findings may reflect part-time attendance and difficulties in sustaining continuous enrollment for students who have significant responsibilities that may conflict with their student role (e.g., family and career responsibilities).32 'Although there appears to be a difference in time to degree between nonborrowers and those who borrowed less than $1,000, the latter is a very small group, and there is insufficient evidence that this reflects a systematic difference between the two groups. 31Recall that the steady-progress group can include students who interrupted their enrollment but returned to the same institution. 32The effect of part-time attendance could not be examined directly, since B&B data do not include data on enrollment status over the duration of postsecondary enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Table Compendium", "text": "Introduction to the Table Compendium This table compendium contains four parts.

Since most statistical software packages compute standard errors for regression coefficients based on an assumption of simple random sampling, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take the complex sample design into account.

The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.  "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Since the estimates in this report are based on a sample, observed differences between two estimates can reflect either of two possibilities: differences that exist in the population which are reflected in the sample, or differences due solely to the composition of the sample that do not reflect underlying population differences. To minimize the risk of erroneously interpreting differences due to sampling alone (a Type I error), the statistical significance of differences between estimates was tested using Student's t statistic. Differences between estimates were tested using the following formula: t E1 E2 2 Vsel2 + se 2 where El and E2 are the estimates (either proportions or means to be compared and set and see are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates were not independent, (for example, when making comparisons within a percentage distribution), a covariance term was added to the denominator. Differences were judged to be statistically significant when the value of t was sufficiently large that the probability of a Type I error was no more than 5 percent (a significance level of .05). This procedure involved calculating Student's t for the difference between the means or proportions of interest, then comparing this value with published tables of critical values of t corresponding to a two-tailed hypothesis test with a significance level of .05. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, however, because the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the categories under comparison. Hence, a small difference between two large groups would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of a single variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for any single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p .05.44 The standard that p 5_ .05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum top 5..05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p 5.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56: 52-64. For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k= 1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racial-ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k= 10 and the significance level of each test must be p_.5_ .05/10, or p 5_ .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race-ethnicity, there are five racial-ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 2, 5x (5 -1) -10 2 The t-value therefore, for finding significance at p .05 between any two racial-ethnic groups based on K=10, would be 2.81."}]
