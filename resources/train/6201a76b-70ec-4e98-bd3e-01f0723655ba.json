Here, we present a study that elucidates the interplay between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses' and host's miRNAs, an epigenetic regulator, as a mode of pathogenesis; and we explored how the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections differ in terms of their miRNA-mediated interactions with the host and the implications this has in terms of disease complexity. We have utilized computational approaches to predict potential host and viral miRNAs and their possible roles in different important functional pathways. We have identified several putative host antiviral miRNAs that can target the SARS viruses and also predicted SARS viruses-encoded miRNAs targeting host genes. In silico predicted targets were also integrated with SARS-infected human cell microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data. A comparison between the host miRNA binding profiles on 67 different SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 different countries with respective country's normalized death count surprisingly uncovered some miRNA clusters, which are associated with increased death rates. We have found that induced cellular miRNAs can be both a boon and a bane to the host immunity, as they have possible roles in neutralizing the viral threat; conversely, they can also function as proviral factors. On the other hand, from over representation analysis, our study revealed that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral miRNAs could target broad immunesignaling pathways; only some of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to uniquely target some immune-signaling pathways, such as autophagy, IFN-I signaling, etc., which might"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Coronavirus outbreaks have been reported over the past three decades, but the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reached more than 200 countries, has been the causative agent for the death of 58,392 people around the globe, and 1,087,374 coronavirus cases have been filed as of the date of writing this article (Worldometer, 2020) . Among closed cases of SARS-CoV-2, 20% of the patients have died, and 5% of patients within active cases are in critical situations (Worldometer, 2020) . The initial estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 death rate of 3.4%, as declared by the WHO (2020), requires refreshing, as the global casualty is on the rise. This novel virus requires novel and in-depth studies to promote new strategies for the management of this pandemic.\nThe coronavirus subfamily is a single-stranded positive-sense (+ssRNA) virus with a genome size of around 30 kb (Lu et al., 2020) . The family is categorized into four subgenera as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronavirus (Cheng and Shan, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus with a genome size of 29.9 kb (Accession no. NC_045512.2), 11 genes being reported in NCBI-Gene (2020) . Phylogenetic analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV showed \u223c79% similarity. Meanwhile, the distance is much greater for MERS-CoV (\u223c50% similarity), but the closest relative to the SARS-CoV-2 is bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus (\u223c90% similarity) (Jiang et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020) . Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has shown substitution of 380 amino acids and deletion of ORF8a, elongation of ORF8b (84 vs. 121 amino acid residues) and truncation of ORF3b (154aa in SARS-CoV whereas 22aa in SARS-CoV-2) (Lu et al., 2020) .\nMicroRNAs are small ncRNA molecules that regulate posttranscriptional-level gene expression; it has already been established that viruses use host machinery to produce miRNAs (Ambros, 2001) . Although miRNA can be an important antiviral tool (Trobaugh and Klimstra, 2017 ) that can stimulate the innate and adaptive immune system (Ambros, 2001; Trobaugh and Klimstra, 2017) but that can also be a back door for viral propagation; it is non-antigenic, thereby modulating cellular pathways without triggering the host immune response (Cullen, 2013; G\u0142obinska et al., 2014) . For example, nucleocapsid protein of coronavirus OC43 binds miR-9 and activates NF-\u03baB (Lai et al., 2014) . Although host microRNAs are either utilized or regulated by viruses, viral miRNAs are another side of the coin; they regulate host gene expression, cellular proliferation, stressrelated genes, and even viral gene expression (Cullen, 2010; Haasnoot and Berkhout, 2011; Lai et al., 2014) . A summary explored how a number of DNA and RNA viruses produce miRNAs known as viral miRNAs (v-miRNAs) to evade the host immune response (Mishra et al., 2020) . Novel viral miRNAs have been predicted to play an important role in neurological disorders as well (Islam et al., 2019) . Among RNA viruses, HIV-1-encoded miR-H1, for example, can cause mononuclear cells apoptosis; H5N1 influenza virus-encoded miR-HA-3p targets host PCBP2 and contributes to the \"cytokine storm\" and mortality; and KUN-miR-1 of the West Nile virus targets the host's GATA4, which facilitates virus replication (Li and Zou, 2019) . The interactions of host miRNAs with the SARS-CoV genome and viral proteins have been elucidated to suppress viral growth and immune evasion (Mallick et al., 2009) . Novel classes of ncRNAs have been also observed by studies as possibly playing a definitive role in pathogenesis and survival (Liu et al., 2018) . Respiratory viral infections caused by influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, RSV, and coronaviruses can be related to aberrant host miRNA expression, and their effect on the host can results in cell apoptosis, inhibition of immunologic pathways, downregulation of host antiviral responses, etc. (Mallick et al., 2009; Bondanese et al., 2014; Islam et al., 2019; Li and Zou, 2019; Mishra et al., 2020) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), though it induces significant IFN-I production after infection by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER), can evade antiviral effect of IFN-I by downregulating miR-30a-5p, which normally enhances IFN-I antiviral activity (Ma et al., 2018) .\nOn the other hand, host miRNA expression plays a major role in controlling viral pathogenesis by mediating T cells and antiviral effector functions (Dickey et al., 2016) . The firstreported example of a cellular miRNA that targets a viral RNA genome is miR-32, which targets the retrovirus PFV-1 transcripts and results in reduced virus replication (Lecellier et al., 2005) . Similarly, miR-24, miR-93 can target VSV virus L and P proteins (Otsuka et al., 2007) ; miR-29a targets HIV Nef proteins (Ahluwalia et al., 2008) to inhibit replication; and miR-1, to inhibit translation/replication by inducing IFN signaling (Pedersen et al., 2007) . miRNAs can therefore provide a different perspective in explaining the pathogenesis and infectivity of the novel SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV is distantly related to SARS-CoV-2, there are some similarities in their signs and symptoms, and they might be similar in pathogenesis, but there are crucial differences between the two diseases too . SARS-CoV-2 has infected many countries, and this has resulted in a stable mutation rate and some degree of variation . There is evidence that viral pathogens can have a novel immune evasion role by utilizing host miRNAs (Islam et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2020) .\nThe detailed miRNA-mediated epigenetic interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and its host is yet to be elucidated. It is not known what probable miRNAs produced by SARS-CoV-2 are affecting which human processes. Additionally, we do not know which antiviral miRNAs are taking part in host immunity. The genomic difference that, as a result, controls the host miRNA target sites and viral miRNAs might explain the difference between SARS-CoV and various isolated of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of pathogenesis and infectivity. Here in this study, we hypothesize on three potential effects of host and viral miRNA:\n(1) genomic differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can lead to variations in host miRNA binding and differences in hence pathogenicity, signs and symptoms of these diseases and might explain the relatively longer incubation period of SARS-CoV-2; (2) on the other hand, there might be differences in viral miRNAs that can regulate expressions of different sets of host genes, which can in turn be advantageous to the virus or the host; and (3), due to a rapid mutation rate, observed variations among SARS-CoV-2 isolates in different regions of the world might result in variation in host capacities to target the virus with its miRNAs. This, in turn, might play a significant role in varying degrees of disease severity, symptoms, and mortality rate in different regions. In this study, we have carried out comparative analyses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with respect to host miRNA-viral genome interaction as well their differences based on region-specific isolates of SARS-CoV-2 and viral miRNA-host mRNA interactions to delineate the exclusive features of COVID-19 and their roles in viral survival and pathogenicity with respect to SARS-CoV (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Obtaining SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences", "text": "The reference genomes of SARS-CoV (RefSeq Accession no.

To identify possible host miRNAs that can get induced during the SARS-CoV (R) and SARS-CoV-2 (R) infections, we have utilized a bioinformatics approach. From our rigorous analysis pipeline, which covers three different well-established algorithms (IntaRNA, miRanda, and psRNATarget) to predict RNA-RNA interactions, we have identified 122 and 106 host antiviral miRNAs against SARS-CoV (R) and SARS-CoV-2 (R), respectively (Figures 2A,B, Supplementary File 2) . Amongst these, 27 miRNAs were found to be targeting both viruses (Figure 2A) . Whilst comparing these miRNAs with the antiviral miRNAs from VIRmiRNA (Qureshi et al., 2014) , we have found four (hsa-miR-654-5p, hsa-miR-198, hsa-miR-622, and hsa-miR-323a-5p) and three (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-20b-5p, and hsa-miR-323a-5p) host miRNAs against SARS-CoV (R) and SARS-CoV-2 (R), respectively, to exhibit experimental evidence of having antiviral roles during infections (Figures 2A-C) .\nMoreover, we compared the miRNAs targeting the two reference genomes of SARS-CoV (R) and SARS-CoV-2 (R), and we found most of the host miRNAs can target the ORF1ab region, followed by the S region as the second-most targeted (Figures 3A,B) . Additionally, the M, N, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 (ORF8a, ORF8b for SARS-CoV), 5 \u2032 UTR, and 3 \u2032 UTR regions of both viruses were targeted by host miRNAs. The significant variance was observed in the targeting positions of the host miRNAs between these two viruses (Figures 3A,B) .\nSince the RNA virus mutates fast, it is conceivable that mutations in crucial genomic locations would lead to differences in host miRNA binding patterns. Therefore, the ability of the host miRNAs in targeting genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 isolates covering 24 different countries was also seen. Although, as expected, most of the identified host miRNAs' binding profiles across these isolates remained somewhat similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence; interestingly, we have identified 24 host miRNAs that bind differentially across the isolates (Figure 4A) , which might have occurred due to the genomic variations between these isolates. Complete linkage agglomerative hierarchal cluster (HCL) analysis with Manhattan distance of these miRNAs (binary mode, bind or not bind) revealed two major clusters with a side cluster for one South Korean and two Singaporean isolates ( Figure 4B) . As miRNA is crucial in both host defense and viral pathogenesis, to understand the significance of this cluster, we have also compared the host miRNA clusters with the death rate (normalized by per million population) from different countries. Surprisingly, relatively higher deaths are found to be more prominent in the European major clusters (right side cluster) compared to the other major cluster (left side), and we also found much lower deaths in side clusters ( Figure 4B) .

We have found that several such pathways might be deregulated by the host miRNAs to suppress the entry of the virus, prevent the spread of the virions, and to minimize the systemic symptoms resulting from the infection (Figure 5A) .\nHost miRNAs might have a probable role in blocking the entry of the virus, as they are found to be targeting the pathways needed for viral entry-PDGF receptor-like signaling (Soroceanu et al., 2008) , Arf-6 signaling (Garc\u00eda-Exp\u00f3sito et al., 2011), PI3K-Akt signaling (Diehl and Schaal, 2013) , EGFR signaling (Zheng They can also block some machinery like-p38 MAPK signaling (Hirasawa et al., 2003) , FAK signaling (Elbahesh et al., 2014) , PI3K-Akt signaling (Diehl and Schaal, 2013) , etc., which can be hijacked by viruses for their efficient replication, pre-mRNA processing, and translation ( Figure 5A) .

COVID-19 has become a serious public health issue, though the complete molecular mechanism of pathogenesis is not fully understood yet. In this context, we have carried out this whole study to investigate the miRNA-mediated interactions between the host and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which might shed some light on the tug-of-war between host's immune responses and virus's circumvention strategies. Though the disease conditions caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are more or less similar, several unique features [i.e., long incubation, enhanced latency, asymptomatic infection, intense pain, severe lung damage, etc. (Ceccarelli et al., 2020) ] of SARS-CoV-2 make it more challenging to manage compared to SARS-CoV. We also sought to find out if there are any existing differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of miRNA-mediated regulation of host responses.\nAs host miRNAs are one of the key sources of immune protection against viral infections, we have tried to find out which cellular miRNAs can target SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genes. Due to differences in the genome sequences between these two viruses, there was a significant difference between cellular miRNAs and their targeting viral genes. Likewise, some of the commonly found cellular miRNAs were showing differential binding preferences for these viral genes (Figure 2A) . Previous study by Mallick et al. showed that cellular miRNAs can boost up host's immune response as well as they can assist in viral immune evasion mechanisms (Mallick et al., 2009) . Another study by Morales et al. suggested that SARS-CoV can encode small non-coding RNAs that can play a role in inflammatory lung pathology (Morales et al., 2017) . We identified that some of our predicted miRNAs have partial sequence similarities with the SARS-CoV svRNAs reported by Morales et al. (2017) (Supplementary File 6) . We also compared the induced host miRNAs' profiles of 67 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from 24 different countries across the globe. From this analysis, we have identified several clusters and associated miRNAs, and our correlation study between these clusters with the death counts all over the world shed some light on the burning question and suggests why Europeans are more prone to COVID-19 ( Figure 3B) .\nWe found several miRNAs with experimentally validated antiviral roles; among those, hsa-miR-323a-5p and hsa-miR-654-5p (predicted for SARS-CoV) were found to inhibit viral replication in H1N1 Influenza virus infection (Song et al., 2010) , while hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-20b-5p (predicted for SARS-CoV-2) were found to be upregulated in H7N9 Influenza virus infection (Zhu et al., 2014) .\nApart from the basic role of cellular miRNAs in eliminating the transcripts of viruses, they can also modulate some host pathways which supposedly can be utilized by the infecting virus to avoid host's immune response. We also identified several such pathways involved in viral entry, replication, translation mechanisms, etc. These can be targeted by the cellular miRNAs induced by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, several immune-response pathways, such as TLR signaling, interleukin signaling, TRAF6 signaling, etc., were exclusively found to be targeted by SARS-CoV-2-induced host miRNAs (Figure 5B) , and SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNAs can target pathways, such as autophagy, IFN-I signaling, wnt signaling, mTOR signaling, etc. SARS-CoV-encoded miRNAs targets were, however, not found to be enriched in these pathways (Figures 7A-E) . Target genes downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to be involved in the Ca 2+ signaling pathway, and these are considered important activators of many signaling pathways (Zhou et al., 2009) (Figure 8B) . All of these suggest why SARS-CoV-2 infections might be fatal for those who are immunosuppressed (D'Antiga, 2020).\nInterestingly, our findings have enlightened several poorly understood mechanisms behind many of the unique clinical and pathological features of SARS-CoV-2, which has made it significantly different from SARS-CoV. We predicted both cellular miRNAs and viral encoded miRNAs, induced during SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, were found to target cytokine-signaling pathways involved in immune responses leading to the improved viral pathogenesis. Also, we found that SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs can target different important organ-specific cellular functions and pathways. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNAs can target the insulinsignaling pathway (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure 1) , and aberration of this pathway might overcomplicate the whole disease condition for COVID-19 patients with existing diabetic problems (Shimizu et al., 1980; del Campo et al., 2012) . Our data also suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs can target heart development-related pathways ( Figure 7A,  Supplementary Figure 1) , which might lead to similar consequences like viral myocarditis (Dennert et al., 2008) , making the disease more fatal for the patients with existing cardiovascular complications. These SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNAs might also target genes associated with brain development (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure 1) , which might provide a clue about the neurological signs like headaches, vomiting, and nausea. SARS-CoV-2-induced host miRNAs can also downregulate kidney development and regulation of cellular ketone metabolic processes, etc. (Figure 5C ), increasing the burden upon the kidneys (Kanikarla-Marie and Jain, 2016), which might be fatal for patients who have diabetes and kidney complications. HIF-1 signaling was also found to be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs ( Figure 7E, Supplementary Figure 1) . This pathway is found to be associated with many viral infections, as HIF-1 plays an important role in cellular survival during hypoxic conditions (Santos and Andrade, 2017) ; COVID-19 patients suffer from the lack of oxygens due to breathing complications. This pathway might therefore play a crucial role in mitigating the condition, but viral miRNA-mediated deregulation of this pathway might result in severe consequences.\nOur findings can explain that the interplay between host miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 can promote viral pathogenesis by deregulating major antiviral immunesignaling pathways; furthermore, the resulting abnormal regulation of several host pathways might lead to an increased complications in the infected patients. Our study, which was conducted using machine learning and knowledgebase approaches, alongside further experiments, has the full potential to provide a more detailed understanding of the disease progression, and, based on these results, novel therapeutic interventions using RNA interference (RNAi) can be designed."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT", "text": "Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
