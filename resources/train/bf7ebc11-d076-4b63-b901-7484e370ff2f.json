We hypothesized that structural measures would correlate with 18 F-AV-1451 in a spatially local manner and that this correlation would be stronger for longitudinal compared to cross-sectional measures of cortical thickness and in those with cerebral amyloid versus those without. Crosssectional and longitudinal estimates of voxelwise atrophy were made from whole brain maps of cortical thickness and rates of thickness change. In amyloid-bepositive individuals, the correlation of voxelwise atrophy across the whole brain with a summary measure of medial temporal lobe (MTL) 18 F-AV-1451 uptake demonstrated strong local correlations in the MTL with longitudinal atrophy that was weaker in cross-sectional analysis. Similar effects were seen in correlations between 31 bilateral cortical regions of interest. In addition, several nonlocal correlations between atrophy and 18 F-AV-1451 uptake were observed, including association between MTL atrophy and 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in parietal lobe regions of interest such as the precuneus. Amyloid-benegative individuals only showed weaker correlations in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons. While these data replicate previous reports of associations between 18 F-AV-1451 uptake and cross-sectional structural measures, the current results demonstrate a strong relationship with longitudinal measures of atrophy. These data support the notion that in vivo measures of tau pathology are tightly linked to the rate of neurodegenerative change. \u00d3 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ex vivo studies have shown clear associations between NFT burden and antemortem patterns of gray matter atrophy measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in AD (Whitwell et al., 2008 (Whitwell et al., , 2012 . Recent advances in molecular imaging have made it possible to quantify regional tau burden in vivo (Saint-Aubert et al., 2017) . 18 F-AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer that has been used to measure tau deposition due to its selective binding to certain insoluble forms of tau in paired helical filaments (Marqui\u00e9 et al., 2015) .\n18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake has been reported to broadly replicate patterns of NFT deposition based on widely used neuropathological stages (i.e., Braak stages) of AD defined by autopsy studies Braak, 1991, 1996) dbeginning in medial temporal lobe (MTL), advancing to lateral temporal lobe, inferior frontal, midline and inferior parietal regions, and finally to primary sensorimotor cortices in the latter stages (Cho et al., 2016a; Johnson et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016) . To the extent that NFT pathology is responsible for downstream neurodegeneration across the disease spectrum and that 18 F-AV-1451 binds to AD-related species of tau, structural MRI, an established measure of AD-related neurodegeneration, should be correlated with tracer uptake. Indeed, there are a few reports in which quantitative structural measures have been found to be associated with specific spatial patterns of tau deposition measured using 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake, similar to those observed in pathology studies Xia et al., 2017) . While there is emerging data with regard to the spatial correlation of 18 F-AV-1451 uptake with both local and distant cross-sectional structural measures (Dronse et al., 2017; Golla et al., 2017; Iaccarino et al., 2018; Lockhart et al., 2017; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Rafii et al., 2017; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016; Sepulcre et al., 2016; Vemuri et al., 2017) , the extent of these relationships remains far from clearly delineated. Furthermore, longitudinal atrophy rates, a more direct measure of the dynamic process of neurodegeneration, have not been studied in the context of tau accumulation across the AD continuum, although 1 study reported local and distant correlations of tau burden and retrospective longitudinal atrophy in a cohort consisting of only cognitively normal individuals (LaPoint et al., 2017) . Finally, the significance and association of 18 F-AV-1451 PET with atrophy in Ab-negative control subjects is uncertain. In this study, we aimed to extend work on relationships between 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and atrophy by investigating longitudinal measures of atrophy. We hypothesized that in a cohort of Ab-positive individuals that includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects (both mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and AD), the association of local tau deposition in MTL will be stronger with a longitudinal than cross-sectional measure of atrophy, as this would better reflect an active neurodegenerative process specific to tau pathology. If 18 F-AV-1451 PET is sensitive to the NFT pathology associated with aging in the absence of cerebral amyloid, so-called primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and this pathology has downstream neurodegenerative effects, we would also expect correlation of 18 F-AV-1451 uptake with structural measures in Ab-negative individuals, but likely circumscribed to early Braak regions.\nWe studied structural MRI and 18 F-AV-1451 PET imaging data in 63 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We correlated a summary measure of 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake in the MTL with cortical thicknessebased measures of both cross-sectional and longitudinal atrophies at each voxel in the cortical gray matter. We chose to focus on MTL tracer uptake in a region encompassing perirhinal (including transentorhinal cortex) and entorhinal cortices as these are the earliest regions of NFT deposition, given the significant proportion of individuals who were cognitively normal in this cohort and, thus, likely at early disease stage. More broadly, we conducted a cross-modality pairwise correlation analysis in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data between 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and atrophy across 31 bilateral regions of interest (ROIs) in the cortex. We performed these analyses separately in Ab-positive and Ab-negative groups, as determined by their amyloid PET scans."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database.

The cross-sectional scan was chosen to be the closest in time to and acquired within 75 days on average of the tau PET scan, and an antecedent MRI was acquired 638 days on average before the cross-sectional scan to measure longitudinal atrophy (see Table 2 ). Tau PET imaging consisted of a continuous 30-minute brain scan (6 frames of 5-minute duration) 75 minutes following approximately 10 mCi of 18 F-AV-1451 injection. Amyloid PET florbetapir protocol used an injection of 10 mCi of tracer and a 20-minute brain scan (4 frames of 5-minute duration) after a 50-minute uptake phase. The florbetapir scan acquired closest in time to the 18 F-AV-1451 scan was analyzed (see Table 2 ). Note that 2 scans in amyloid-positive individuals were obtained >2 years before the 18 F-AV-1451 PET. As one would not expect a positive scan to become negative over time, we included these individuals despite this delay. PET images were downloaded from the ADNI data archive in the most fully preprocessed format with the image description \"Coreg, Avg, Std Img and Vox Siz, Uniform Resolution.\" "}, {"section_title": "Image processing", "text": "The preprocessed PET images were aligned with the anatomical MRI via rigid body registration using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) normalization software (Avants et al., 2008 ) with a mutual information metric. Each anatomical MRI was segmented into cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar ROIs using a multiatlas segmentation method (Wang et al., 2013) . The parcellation scheme is described in (Landman and Warfield, 2012) (https://www. amazon.com/MICCAI-2012-Workshop-Multi-Atlas-Labeling/dp/ 1479126187). Mean tracer uptake in the cerebellar gray matter ( 18 F-AV-1451) or cerebellar gray and white matters (florbetapir) was computed and used as reference to generate a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) map for the entire brain. A composite ROI consisting of middle frontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, precuneus, supra marginal, middle temporal, and superior temporal cortices was used to compute a global SUVR for florbetapir. A threshold of SUVR ! 1.11 (Landau et al., 2013) was then used to determine Ab status.\nCortical thickness was estimated using the DiReCT method (Das et al., 2009) implemented in the ANTs longitudinal measurement pipeline (Tustison et al., , 2017 . This method uses diffeomorphic mapping between the white matter-gray matter boundary and gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid boundary derived from tissue segmentation to estimate cortical thickness and produces a volumetric map of local thickness at every voxel in the cortex. An evaluation of DiReCT in relation to other cortical thickness measurement methods can be found in the studies by Klein et al., 2009 and Tustison et al., 2014 . Longitudinal estimation used an unbiased method that treats each scan in similar fashion such that the measurements at each time point do not depend on their temporal ordering (Avants et al., 2010) . The resulting maps of thickness and thickness change were mapped to an unbiased population template (Avants and Gee, 2004) for voxelwise analysis. A summary measure of MTL 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake was computed over a combined ROI of entorhinal cortex and BA35 and BA36 regions of perirhinal cortex using a multiatlas segmentation algorithm specific for these regions (Xie et al., 2016; Yushkevich et al., 2015) . The entire brain for both structural scans in each subject was parcellated into 31 bilateral ROIs based on a previously published volumetric version of the FreeSurfer Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas (Klein and Tourville, 2012) , using a multiatlas segmentation method (Wang et al., 2013) . These ROIs were used to generate mean cortical thickness estimates averaged across bilateral regions. Average longitudinal thickness change for each ROI was entered in analysis as an annualized rate of change in mm. Similarly, mean SUVR for 18 F-AV-1451 uptake was also calculated for each bilateral ROI."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Partial correlation was used for assessing relationships between the 2 imaging measurements in Ab-positive and Ab-negative groups separately. Covariates used were as follows: (1) age and (2) time between cross-sectional MRI and tau PET (cross-sectional analysis) or time between antecedent MRI and tau PET (longitudinal analysis). Note that use of gender as a covariate did not appreciably influence results of these analyses. We performed voxelwise correlation of a summary measure of average 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake in bilateral MTL with cross-sectional cortical thickness as well as with rate of cortical thickness change in the preceding time period. Multiple comparisons correction was done using the threshold-free cluster enhancement method (Smith and Nichols, 2009) . We then performed a cross-modality ROI-based correlation analysis across the entire brain where 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake was correlated with both cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of cortical thickness between each pair of the 31 ROIs. Permutation-based pvalues were computed and subsequently corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (Yekutieli and Benjamini, 1999) . As a supplementary analysis, we directly compared the cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations using the correlation comparison test described by Diehl and Arbinger, 1992. 3.

These maps show that spatial extent of significant tau accumulation is limited and is primarily confined to the temporal lobe in the Abpositive individuals. In those without cerebral amyloid, it is even more restricted largely just to MTL. However, even within the MTL, uptake is significantly higher in the Ab-positive individuals. Fig. 1 bottom panel shows statistical maps of group difference in cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of atrophy. Group effects are much weaker for atrophy than for tracer uptake. No voxels survived multiple comparisons correction. The effects in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons are more localized, with the longitudinal effects being generally stronger, especially in medial regions such as the MTL."}, {"section_title": "Voxelwise correlations", "text": "Figs. 2 and 3 show patterns of correlation of voxelwise cortical thickness and longitudinal rate of thickness change with a summary measure of MTL 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake. Longitudinal rate of thickness change in the MTL, particularly in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, had a strong and statistically significant relationship with 18 F-AV-1451 uptake bilaterally in Ab-positive individuals. Cross-sectional thickness measurements showed a similar pattern in this group, but fewer voxels survived correction for multiple comparisons. More diffuse effects were observed only in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons (Fig. 2B,D) , which also show an extensive pattern of remote correlations of thickness with MTL 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, with the former showing more widespread effects with the more liberal threshold. Scatterplots of some significant clusters are shown as insets. As can be observed, 1 participant in the Ab-positive group who had a diagnosis of probable AD had very high longitudinal atrophy rates in the MTL as well as the highest 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in this region. We visually checked for imaging and processing-related artifacts in the data and did not find any anomalies. Excluding this data point would still maintain a strong and significant correlation for this cluster (r \u00bc \u00c00.76, p < 10e \u00c07 with and r \u00bc \u00c00.67, p < 10e \u00c05 without).

Similar to the voxelwise analysis, longitudinal rates of MTL cortical thinning (left panel) and cross-sectional measures of thickness (right panel) were significantly correlated with 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in MTL ROIs in Ab-positive individuals (Fig. 4) . In addition to local MTL effects, lateral temporal lobe ROIs showed significant local cross-modality correlations in Ab-positive individuals. Moreover, both cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of atrophy in multiple temporal ROIs correlated with 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in a wide swath of brain regions in the lobes outside of occipital, including parietal lobe regions such as inferior parietal, precuneus and posterior cingulate regions, and several ROIs in the frontal lobe, including orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. These nonlocal correlations of 18 F-AV-1451 uptake the in parietal and frontal lobes with temporal lobe atrophy were stronger and more restricted to MTL ROIs, such as the entorhinal cortex, in the longitudinal data. Alternatively, the cross-sectional effects were more diffuse across the temporal lobe and strongest in the inferior temporal and fusiform ROIs. While there were modest local correlations outside of the temporal lobe, longitudinal data also showed strong correlation of atrophy rates in some frontal lobe regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex with 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in largely the same set of regions that had strong correlations with temporal lobe atrophy.\nSupplementary analysis showing direct comparison of the ROIbased cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations is presented in Supplementary Figure S1 . Some MTL regions such as the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices and orbitofrontal cortex showed stronger correlations in the longitudinal data, whereas other areas showed the opposite trend (fusiform and insular cortices). However, none of these effects reached statistical significance when corrected for multiple comparisons.\nAs noted previously, 1 participant in the Ab-positive group had very high atrophy rates in the MTL and the highest 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in some temporal lobe regions (see scatter plot in Fig. 2 ). Permutation testing for the ROI analysis was done to account for such outliers and, additionally, the results were qualitatively similar with weaker effects in the correlation of 18F-AV-1451 uptake in frontal ROIs with temporal atrophy when this participant was excluded from the analysis. Excluding the time difference between MRI and PET scans as a covariate also did not notably alter the results. We did not find any significant correlation effects after multiple comparisons correction in the Ab-negative individuals (Fig. 5) . However, data uncorrected for multiple comparisons showed a significant correlation of precuneus atrophy with 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in a number of ROIs."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Local MTL effects in Ab-positive individuals", "text": "We found that a summary measure of MTL 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in Ab-positive individuals was most significantly associated with longitudinal cortical thinning, and this effect was restricted to the greater tau burden is associated with an increased rate of neurodegeneration in the preceding years. In other words, those with higher tracer uptake in the MTL would be expected to have experienced more significant neuronal injury commensurate with this greater burden. The local correlational effect within MTL in the cross-sectional analysis was less robust in the MTL and fewer voxels were significant using the FWER-corrected statistical threshold. However, when pairwise correlations in the ROI analysis were directly compared (Supplementary Figure S1) , although some MTL effects were stronger in longitudinal data, the differences were not statistically significant after multiple comparisons correction. Nonetheless, the finding that longitudinal structural measures appear to be more tightly linked with a measure of NFT burden in MTL than cross-sectional structural measures is intuitive. One would expect that a longitudinal measure would reflect the active neurodegeneration in a region over the restricted temporal window of the imaging data acquisitions, which should reflect temporally proximate local pathologies, such as NFT. Alternatively, crosssectional cortical thickness reflects the sum total of factors influencing the measure of brain structure in that region across the lifespan. These include developmental differences, as well as alterations in neuronal or synaptic density associated with other processes, such as normal aging or cerebrovascular disease, that likely occur over a different timescale than neurodegeneration due to NFTs. Thus, assuming similar measurement accuracy, a longitudinal measure may more accurately reflect the specific neurodegeneration associated with local tau accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between MTL tau tracer uptake and atrophy outside of MTL in Ab-positive individuals", "text": "While the local relationship between MTL tau tracer uptake and atrophy measures is intuitive, it is worth noting that when using a more liberal threshold, there was more spatially widespread association with atrophy in Ab-positive individuals, particularly in the orbitofrontal region in the longitudinal data and lateral temporal regions in the cross-sectional data (Fig. 2) . Strong distant correlation between tau in the temporal lobe and cross-sectional cortical thinning in the orbitofrontal cortex was also reported by Sepulcre et al. . Furthermore, LaPoint et al. examined retrospective longitudinal atrophy as here and similarly reported local and remote correlations between 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in inferior temporal lobe; however, their study was limited to cognitively normal adults and did not dichotomize groups based on amyloid status (LaPoint et al., 2017) . The distant effects in ours and these prior studies are likely due in part to the fact that MTL and/or inferior temporal tau tracer uptake, reflecting early NFT pathology, may also serve as a summary measure more broadly for disease progression. Indeed, other work has suggested that 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in this region does not plateau across the AD continuum through at least mild AD (Tosun et al., 2017) . As such, it is possible that MTL tau serves as a surrogate for local tau burden in these connected regions, which may then locally drive neurodegeneration. In fact, in the ROI analysis (Fig. 4) several, but not all, of the ROIs, where atrophy is correlated with MTL or other temporal region 18 F-AV-1451 uptake, also had significant correlation with local uptake (i.e., significant correlation along the diagonal), particularly in the longitudinal data."}, {"section_title": "Lack of local effects outside of MTL in Ab-positive individuals", "text": "While as noted previously, there were some local effects observed, such as in orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate regions, particularly in the longitudinal data in Ab-positive individuals ( Fig. 4, left) , many extratemporal regions typically associated with AD-related atrophy did not display local (or distant) correlation with tracer uptake. The fact that there were not always strong local correlations of atrophy and 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in regions outside of the temporal lobe might be explained simply by the lack of significant tau pathology outside of this region in this cohort, as reflected by relatively low 18 F-AV-1451 uptake (Fig. 1) . While significant 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake in parietal ROIs have been reported in several studies in Ab-positive individuals Xia et al., 2017) , with concomitant thinning in these regions observed (Xia et al., 2017) , this subset of the ADNI cohort has revealed more restricted uptake to temporal regions (also see Maas et al. [Maass et al., 2017] ). Finally, in the case of the longitudinal data, limited local correlations might also be a reflection of a potential nonlinear trajectory of cortical thinning, which may depend on baseline thickness.\nWhile not displaying widespread local correlation in nontemporal regions, we did observe significant correlation of MTL inferomedial temporal cortical atrophy with 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in a wide swath of ROIs outside of the temporal lobe (Fig. 4 bottom  rows) , in a number of isocortical regions, particularly parietal and frontal. This suggests that even at low levels of tau, accumulation of tau into extratemporal regions may be a surrogate for disease progression, reflecting spread of tau pathology outside the temporal lobe. To the extent that MTL atrophy reflects disease stage, we might, therefore, expect to observe a relationship with extratemporal tau. Alternatively, these more distant relationships of 18 F-AV-1451 uptake with temporal regions may be mediated by propagation of tau pathology across connected regions, providing support for the synaptic transmission hypothesis (Frost et al., 2009; Lewis and Dickson, 2016) . Some ROIs showing these effects indeed constitute nodes of the same functional network (e.g., MTL and posterior cingulate are considered parts of the default mode network, and orbitofrontal cortex is part of an anterior temporal lobe network )."}, {"section_title": "Lack of effects in Ab-negative individuals", "text": "We did not find strong correlations between 18 F-AV-1451 and cross-sectional or longitudinal measures in Ab-negative individuals. The only significant correlation of MTL 18 F-AV-1451 uptake with atrophy observed in the Ab-negative individuals was in the precuneus region (Fig. 3 ), but only in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons. While this effect was weak, it is interesting to note that 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in multiple other ROIs also appeared to correlate with precuneus atrophy (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, in this group, cross-sectional data appeared to have a stronger effect, which may be a result of any association between 18 F-AV-1451 and atrophy occurring on a slower timescale in this group than in Ab-positive individuals and, thus, not well captured within the 2-year timeframe of the longitudinal analysis.\nThe Ab-negative group contained a mixture of cognitively normal adults (n \u00bc 19) and patients with MCI (n \u00bc 12). While other studies, such as the study by Sepulcre et al., 2016 , reported significant local and remote associations between gray matter atrophy and 18 F-AV-1451 uptake in a cognitively normal elderly cohort, these studies have not examined such effects in Ab-negative individuals alone. As seen in Fig. 1 Compared to the Abpositive group, they were also relatively younger and had a higher proportion of cognitively normal participants. These might further influence correlation of tracer uptake with atrophy. Given this low tau burden in the MTL, as well as the fact that at these low levels effects of \"noise\" in this region, for example, from off-target choroid plexus binding (Lowe et al., 2016; Pontecorvo et al., 2017) may be more prominent, other factors may be more likely to drive differences in cortical thickness and rate of atrophy in these individuals than MTL 18 F-AV-1451 uptake. The current result is consistent with another recent report from Mormino et al. in which Ab-negative individuals, with versus without evidence of neurodegeneration, measured by hippocampal volume or cortical glucose metabolism, did not differ in 18 F-AV-1451 uptake. The authors suggested that PART (Crary et al., 2014) , a common feature of early aging defined by the presence of NFTs of Braak stage IV or less (usually stages IeIII) in the absence of amyloid, was not the driver of the neurodegeneration observed in that cohort.\nThe current finding also could be interpreted as supporting the notion that the presence of PART is not tightly linked to atrophy, including within the MTL. However, a recent study did find correlation of antemortem anterior hippocampal atrophy and Braak NFT stage in PART individuals (Josephs et al., 2017 ). While we did not measure hippocampal volume, that cohort was considerably older (mean age of 90 years at death) than the current amyloid-negative group, which may have influenced our finding evidence of similar MTL atrophy, particularly given the link between PART severity and age. An alternative hypothesis is that the 18 F-AV-1451 ligand may not bind avidly to the specific conformation of tau associated with PART. Indeed, recent autoradiography findings suggest that 18 F-AV-1451 binding to the generally more immature tangles of PART was relatively weak (Lowe et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "18 F-AV-1451 as a marker linking tau pathology to AD-related neurodegeneration", "text": "Prior studies have shown that 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake patterns reflect clinical phenotypes and associated neuroanatomical variability in AD (Cho et al., 2016a; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016) . The relationship between 18 F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and structural atrophy has also been reported in a number of cross-sectional analyses Xia et al., 2017) . The strong association between 18 F-AV-1451 uptake and longitudinal atrophy rates in an Ab-positive cohort presented here, particularly within the MTL, lends support to the notion that the 18 F-AV-1451 tracer links AD-related pathology to the accelerated neurodegeneration associated with NFT pathology. Not surprisingly, given this relationship, increased 18 F-AV-1451 uptake is associated with increased cognitive impairment in Ab-positive individuals (Cho et al., 2016b; Johnson et al., 2016; Pontecorvo et al., 2017) . Consonant with the structural MRI findings here, Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016 found that 18 F-AV-1451 uptake was correlated with both cross-sectional and antecedent longitudinal cognitive measures, particularly episodic memory.

Continued collection of follow-up structural imaging data in ADNI will allow us to look at prospective neurodegenerative changes.
