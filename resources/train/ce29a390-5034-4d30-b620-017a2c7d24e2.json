The best way to Order Form It is difficult to establish a completely consistent series of degree data over a long period of time because of changes in definitions, instructions, and field classifications, including the introduction of new specialties. The data for earlier years are presented as consistently as possible with the classifications used in the current Classification of Instructional Programs (Washington, DC, Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office). See the Technical Notes for further information on the field classifications used. The focus of this publication is on degrees in science and engineering fields, and, where appropriate, the data have been reclassified according to NSF field categories. This report supersedes previous editions, not only because it includes later data, but because fields classified as science and engineering differ slightly, especially in the social sciences at the doctorate level, from those of past editions. It should be noted that data on engineering technology degrees and degrees in the healthlmedical sciences are not included in the science and engineering totals here. The time series for this report begins in 1966. For more information, please contact the NSF project officer Outlying Areas. The survey forms are filled out by institution administrative personnel. The data are collected according to sex of recipient and field of study. In 1993 the final universe of institutions granting bachelor's or higher level degrees was 2,792. Each year between 1966 and 1993, institutional responses to these surveys exceeded 85 percent. Imputations for nonresponse were based on the previous year's response for an institution, if available. Because the data in this report include those for institutions in the U.S. territories, they may differ from numbers published by NCES that relate only to the 50 States and the District of Columbia and their field groupings. Data on degrees by field of study were collected according to the Classification of Instructional Programs, developed by NCES. Four field classification systems were used during the 1966-93 period. (See section 4, \"Fie'd Classification Schemes.\") DOCTORAL DEGREE DATA In the Survey of Earned Doctorates, information is collected during the period of July 19f one year to June 30 of the next from all persons who have fulfilled the requirements for a research doctorate. The survey is funded jointly by NSF and four other agencies: the U.S. Department of Education, the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Research Council sends the survey forms to all accredited doctorate-granting institutions for distribution by the graduate deans to all research doctorate recipients as they complete degree requirements. Information collected in the survey comprises demographic data, such as the student's sex, citizenship, and racial/ethnic group; education history, including field of degrees; sources of graduate student support; employment status during the year preceding receipt of the doctorate; postgraduat ion plans: and background on parents' education. Approximately 95 percent of the doctorate recipients complete and return the survey forms. For nonrespondents, commencement programs constituted a source of skeletal information that was added to the file. These variables were sex, field of study, institution, year of doctorate, and educational background. Consequently, for the variables used in this report, there is complete coverage. Data are updated annually from completed survey forms submitted belatedly by previous nonrespondents; and the U.S. Territories and Outlying Areas. These estimates do not make any allowances for the undercount of U.S. residents in the decennial censuses. The completeness of coverage is estimated to be 97.3 percent for 22-year-olds, 97.8 percent for 24-yearolds, and 99.8 percent for 30-year-olds."}, {"section_title": "FIELD CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES", "text": "It is difficult to establish a completely consistent series of degree data over a long period of time, given changes in field classifications and evolving fields of study. Data for the earlier years are presented as consistently as possible with the current classification schemes of fields of study, which show the Completions and the Earned Doctorates Surveys field codes used in this report. In the first listing (beginning on page 5), the current classification schemes for both the Completions and the Earned Doctorates Surveys are compared. The second listing (page 12) shows historical changes in the Department of Education's previous classification systems for the Earned Degrees and the Completions Surveys as they affect the taxonomy for bachelor's-degree and master's-degree data used in this report.
