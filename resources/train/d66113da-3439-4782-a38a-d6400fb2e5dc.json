R3.0 therefore includes changes designed to enable effective exchange of information describing data quality between ICOADS, reanalysis centres, data set developers, scientists and the public. These user-driven innovations include the assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each marine report -to enable tracing of observations, linking with reports and improved data sharing. Other revisions and extensions of the ICOADS' International Maritime Meteorological Archive common data format incorporate new near-surface oceanographic data elements and cloud parameters. Many new input data sources have been assembled, and updates and improvements to existing data sources, or removal of erroneous data, made. Coupled with enhanced 'preliminary' monthly data and product extensions past 2014, R3.0 provides improved support of climate assessment and monitoring, reanalyses and near-real-time applications."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) is the most extensive freely available archive of global surface marine data, with over 455 million individual marine reports -each containing the observations and metadata reported from a given ship, buoy, coastal platform, or oceanographic instrument. ICOADS provides a common access point for these marine reports and established the open access and version control now recognized as essential attributes to the production of verifiable climate products (Thorne et al., 2011) .\nICOADS spans the period from the late 17th Century to near present with near-real-time (NRT) updates. The overall objectives are to:\n1. collect and preserve as much original surface marine data as possible; 2. treat each observation systematically, converting units and coding schemes to a uniform set; 3. preserve data source identification and measurement metadata with each record; 4. provide data in a common format, identify duplicate reports, and apply basic quality control (QC); 5. freely distribute the data and products.\nRelease 1 in 1985 of the Comprehensive OceanAtmosphere Data Set (COADS; Slutz et al., 1985) provided individual reports and basic gridded monthly summary products covering the period 1854 -1979 (Woodruff et al., 1987 . Recognizing international contributions over the years, the name was changed in 2002 to ICOADS (WMO, 2002) . ICOADS is now formally managed via an international partnership with eight Woodruff et al., 2011 Slutz et al., 1985; Woodruff et al., 1987 Woodruff et al., 1854 Woodruff et al., -1979 Woodruff et al., 1980 Woodruff et al., -1991 Release 1a 1993 Woodruff et al., 1993 1980 -1992 1992 -1993 1990 -1995 1980 -1997 Release 1b 1996 1950 -1979 1970 Release 1c 2001 1784 -1949 (none) Release 2.0 2002 Woodruff et al., 1998; Woodruff et al., 2003 Woodruff et al., 1784 Woodruff et al., -1997 Release 2.1 2003 Worley et al., 2005; Woodruff et al., 2005 Woodruff et al., 1784 Woodruff et al., -1997 Woodruff et al., 1998 Woodruff et al., -2002 Release signatories from the United States, United Kingdom (UK), and Germany. Release 2.1 was notable for the introduction of NRT extensions, and Release 2.5 (R2.5) achieved substantial increases in historical coverage through inclusion of many newly recovered and digitized data sources . Table 1 summarizes the release history. ICOADS contains a wide range of near-surface meteorological and oceanographic parameters stored uniformly in the International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) data format (currently version 1; Smith et al., 2016) . IMMA allows observations to be described by metadata fields and also provides for archiving of the observations in their original (input) format. Preservation of original format data allows for later improvements, e.g. extracting additional variables when the IMMA format is extended, or allowing for correction of any translation errors. ICOADS contains observations of many Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) for both atmospheric and oceanic domains (GCOS, 2010; Bojinski et al., 2014) . Available ECVs include air temperature (AT), sea-surface temperature (SST), wind speed and direction, humidity, sea-level pressure (SLP), cloud cover, sea state, and sea ice. ICOADS also contains descriptive information, such as coded weather information, and types and amounts of cloud at different levels in the atmosphere.\nThe data and products from ICOADS have been used by thousands of users, including universities and government agencies, research institutes, and the general public. Data set developers form a key user group who typically derive gridded data products from the ICOADS observations, vastly increasing its impact. Derived gridded products cover SST (e.g. Berry and Kent, 2011; Kennedy et al., 2011a Kennedy et al., , 2011b Hirahara et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015) , wind speed Tokinaga and Xie, 2011) , humidity , AT Kent et al., 2013) , SLP (Kaplan et al., 2000; Allan and Ansell, 2006) , cloud types and amounts (Hahn and Warren, 2009) , waves (Gulev et al., 2003; Gulev and Grigorieva, 2006) , and air-sea fluxes (da Silva et al., 1994; Josey et al., 1999; Kent, 2009, 2011; Smith et al., 2011) . Such products are vital for climate monitoring and assessment studies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessments (e.g. Hartmann et al., 2013; Rhein et al., 2013) and the annual State of the Climate report (e.g. Blunden, 2014) .\nICOADS observations are assimilated into reanalysis models (e.g. Saha et al., 2010; Compo et al., 2011; Dee et al., 2011; Rienecker et al., 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2015) and ICOADS-derived gridded SST products are used as a boundary condition for atmosphere-only reanalyses. Further applications include calibration and validation of satellite data (e.g. Jackson and Wick, 2010; Roberts et al., 2010; Bentamy et al., 2013; Kinzel et al., 2016) and assessment of climate model output (Flato et al., 2013) .\nAlongside the IMMA observations, ICOADS regularly updates a suite of basic gridded monthly summary products, in which ten statistics (such as the mean and median) are calculated for each of 22 observed and derived variables, using 2 \u2218 latitude \u00d7 2 \u2218 longitude boxes back to 1800, and 1 \u2218 \u00d7 1 \u2218 boxes since 1960 . These products are valuable for monitoring research (e.g. Wolter and Timlin, 2011) and ecosystem studies (e.g. Martinho et al., 2013; Villegas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015) . ICOADS summary products provide a 'quick look' resource based on unadjusted data without interpolation and statistical gap-filling.\nTwo international workshops series have promoted continuity and coordination for ICOADS: (JCOMM, 2011) . These meetings have guided development and maintained links with the international user community. In 2014, the ICOADS program was expanded into international partnership to include research and operational organizations in the UK and Germany (http://icoads.noaa.gov/partners.html, accessed 1 January 2016), to leverage expertise and resources to complete Release 3.0 (R3.0) and enhance future ICOADS releases.\nIn this paper, we highlight improvements to ICOADS in R3.0. Section 2 provides a description of the data management within ICOADS. Section 3 describes data sources new to R3.0 made available through digitization activities, external archives and additional GTS sources. Section 4 describes extensions to the IMMA data format and Section 5 discusses some of the data issues identified during R3.0 processing. Section 6 outlines future plans and Section 7 contains concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "Data composition and management", "text": "This section provides an overview of the composition of ICOADS in four categories. The first consists of historical data from Release 1 of COADS (Section 2.1). Many of these data were digitized onto computer punched card decks (hence the 'deck' nomenclature still used in ICOADS) and often are limited in terms of available parameters and metadata. The second category is new historical data acquisitions from data recovery and digitization projects (Section 2.2). Much of the ICOADS data for recent decades derives from GTS data streams (Section 2.3). The final data source is periodic merger of delayed mode (DM) archives, e.g. from the JCOMM Global Collecting Centres (GCC) or from reprocessing of research archives (Section 2.4). Lastly, Section 2.5 describes how the ICOADS processing brings together data from all these sources."}, {"section_title": "Legacy data: historical archives", "text": "The source data for COADS Release 1 are detailed by Woodruff et al. (1987) and derived from ships' logbook observations digitized onto punched cards and magnetic tape, extracted from atlas compilations or transmitted using wireless telegraphy and later the GTS. Bilateral exchange agreements with many nations substantially extended the US marine archive (Woodruff et al., 2003 . Release 1 (Slutz et al., 1985; Woodruff et al., 1987 ) brought together observations from many different national and international climate archives into a single repository with a common format. Buoy data were also included, though amounting to less than 1% of the total.\nThe quality and completeness of observations in the present ICOADS are strongly related to the source of the observations, the formats used to store the data, and any conversions used. The deck (DCK) and source identifier (SID) fields provide information on the provenance of each report. For some historical decks, platform identifiers (IDs; e.g. ship names or callsigns) are missing; other decks did not include all data elements originally reported. In some cases undocumented data adjustments or format conversions may have been applied. Over time ICOADS has tried to replace early data sources compromised by historical storage in inadequate formats or poor curation (Woodruff et al., 2003) . Because the archives from different countries contained much common data, the identification of duplicate reports is vitally important (Section 2.5) and extremely challenging due to variable and often undocumented historical data management practices."}, {"section_title": "New historical data from recovery and digitization", "text": "ICOADS works with several historical data digitization efforts, including: RECovery of Logbooks And International Marine data (RECLAIM; Wilkinson et al., 2011) ; The International Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) Initiative ; and 'oldWeather' (http://oldweather.org, accessed 1 January 2016). Records from data sparse regions or periods are given priority. Recently digitized data are typically as complete as feasible, including preservation of accompanying metadata, leading to higher quality.\nDigitization projects have helped to shape and expand ICOADS since its inception. Small or large, each set of newly digitized data makes a valuable contribution. Large, multinational efforts such as the Climatological Database for the World's Oceans (CLIWOC) (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2005) provided data, concentrated during 1750-1850, when temporal and spatial coverage remain sparse. However, these data were largely non-instrumental, i.e. mostly once-a-day observations of winds (speed and direction) and weather. A new source of digitized data for R3.0, from English East India Company (EEIC) logbooks, improves coverage during this early period. These voyages were selected from the much larger quantity of non-instrumental 17th-19th century EEIC data also recorded (Farrington et al., 1999) , because they included instrumental observations of AT and pressure, with occasional reports of SST.\nThis transition from non-instrumental to instrumental observations foreshadows the landmark 1853 Brussels Maritime Conference (Maury, 1854), which established a globally coordinated effort to report in a standardized manner and provide as much data as possible.\n2.3. Real-time data from the GTS Observations circulated in NRT over the GTS in support of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are an important constituent of ICOADS. GTS observations used include reports from ships in the WMO Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) Scheme, from instruments on moored and drifting buoys, and from coastal or other fixed stations such as tide gauges. Access to GTS data is typically via a National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (NMHS). Section 3.3 describes new and improved data from coastal stations and tide gauge installations from the GTS available in R3.0.\nExactly which reports are retrieved from the GTS depends on how and when the system is interrogated. GTS archives extracted by different operational centres therefore have different contents. Each centre will take a different approach to combining reports that may have been split during transmission, and may apply adjustments to reports. Up through R2.5, ICOADS used GTS data receipts primarily from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP; 1980-forward), and from US Navy (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) and Air Force (1973 Force ( -1997 sources.\nFor R3.0, GTS receipts from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) are blended with those from NCEP, resulting in about 5% additional observations. Also, since late 2007, VOS ship identification information has been largely missing from the NCEP stream, hampering the assignment of metadata to the observations and ship-by-ship QC . Adding the NCEI data stream has enabled unique ship identifier information (either callsigns or masked ship identifiers) to be recovered for about 70% of VOS observations. This new blended product now forms the NRT extension for ICOADS, normally published within five days of the end of the preceding calendar month."}, {"section_title": "DM data from international exchange and research archives", "text": "Data are received in DM from several global data centres, such as the JCOMM GCC for VOS data. DM observations are typically higher quality than the GTS data and may have additional QC, higher numerical precision or additional parameters. Most of the DM data from the GCC will replace data previously included in ICOADS as NRT data, and the duplicate elimination procedure (Section 2.5) identifies NRT reports to be replaced.\nSurface or near-surface data extracted from a variety of updated research archives have been incorporated into R3.0, including (see also Section 3.2): near-surface observations selected from the World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD; Boyer et al., 2013) ; data from the Global Ocean Surface Underway Data (GOSUD) Project; buoy measurements from the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA; McPhaden et al., 1998 McPhaden et al., , 2009 Bourl\u00e8s et al., 2008) and from the Canadian Oceanography and Scientific Data (OSD) archive; and a subset of near-surface measurements from research vessels (RVs) in the Shipboard Automated Meteorological and Oceanographic System (SAMOS) initiative.\n2.5. Combining the data streams to generate ICOADS Each Release of ICOADS has incorporated new sources of data (Woodruff et al., 1998 (Woodruff et al., , 2003 Worley et al., 2005) . Each new source must be translated into the IMMA format, which may require conversion from historical or non-standard units (e.g. knots or Beaufort Force to m s \u22121 , \u2218 F to \u2218 C) or between different representations of the same environmental parameter (e.g. from wet-and dry-bulb to dew point temperature, or wind components to wind speed and direction). At the same time, however, the original input data are preserved in the supplemental (Suppl) attachment to IMMA (see Section 4).\nFollowing conversion to IMMA format (Section 4) the major task of assembling the final data set for public release remains. This processing is referred to generally as 'dupelim' (duplicate elimination) and includes a complex set of rules specially tailored for each release intended to identify duplicate and poor quality reports, which are not included in the official release. Each report is first processed through a series of QC steps, including the identification and flagging of observations that are statistical outliers compared to a climatology (known as 'trimming'; Wolter, 1997) , followed by two separate preconditioning steps to: (1) exclude reports (e.g. known problematic or highly redundant data sources), and (2) to edit known erroneous fields, or compute some missing fields, e.g. dew point temperature, required for some monthly summary variables. Observational metadata from WMO (1955) Publication No. 47 are associated, where possible, with individual reports (Kent et al., 2007) and used to populate the ship metadata (Meta-vos) attachment (see Section 5.3).\nFor R2.5, 'intermediate' (pre-dupelim) data sets were produced containing duplicates and other suspect reports (e.g. landlocked), flagged as to retention status, and were also made available. For R3.0, we have refined this approach to separately flag intermediate data versus 'rejects' of clearly erroneous, or otherwise problematic, data in a 'total' file (not provided to users except by special request). This approach ensures preservation of all observations, both unique and duplicates. The total data set is then processed to remove landlocked, duplicate, and other reject reports, to generate the final output data set.\nThe dupelim procedure is complicated as many of the decks have been reformatted and modified over the years (particularly the legacy data, Section 2.1) predating their more careful data management under ICOADS. This means that reports originating from the same observation may differ in terms of even basic information such as position or time, as well as the available parameter or metadata fields, or the values stored in these fields. Much of the complexity of dupelim therefore arises from the specification of the tolerances required to identify as many duplicates as possible without excluding similar but unique reports and imperfections in this process will impact the final release and any data products derived from it. The inclusion of any new data source can be a complex and time-consuming task, often revealing problems with the new data sources, or with data that have previously been ingested.\n3. New data sources and resultant data coverage in Release 3.0"}, {"section_title": "New historical data sources from digitization", "text": "The RECLAIM project identified and prioritized historical data archives for digitization, conversion to IMMA and inclusion in ICOADS . Some of these have now been digitized, through volunteer crowdsourcing initiatives (oldWeather and Weather Detective), by data scientists or through national digitization programs, e.g. the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) KLI-DADIGI and HISTOR projects (Kaspar et al., 2015) and former NOAA Climate Database Modernization Program (CDMP). Each new source is listed in Table 2 , with its temporal and spatial coverage also illustrated in Figure 1 .\nThe new data sources provide valuable additional observations in the sparsely observed period before about 1880. The earliest observations, newly digitized by ACRE, are from voyages of exploration and early scientific expeditions (deck 246, Table 3 , Figure 1 Most digitization initiatives focus on particularly data sparse regions and periods. The very early data are always valuable, but the periods of the two World Wars also have sparse coverage and high latitude regions are poorly observed throughout the record. To address this, weather records were transcribed by the oldWeather crowdsourcing project (http://oldweather.org, accessed 1 January 2016) providing more than 185K new reports mostly covering the North Pacific and Arctic oceans; including observations from well-known ships such as the USRC Bear and the USS Jeannette (deck 710, Figure 1 Overall these newly digitized reports contribute many observations, and provide valuable additional coverage in the early instrumental period and during two world wars."}, {"section_title": "Data from external archives", "text": "Marine observations are often collected and assembled into separate archives, especially for the modern period. Data from external archives form an essential ingredient of ICOADS. New reports are typically added to these archives, and QC'd, on a continuing basis, thus sometimes also improving data that have been utilized previously in ICOADS. For R3.0, ICOADS has acquired many new reports from these sources and have translated the various formats to the common IMMA format. These sources are listed in Table 4 . Temporal and spatial coverage for each of these sources are illustrated in Figure 2 .\nThe World Ocean Database (deck 780, Figure 2 (a)) is a collection of quality controlled ocean profile and surface oceanographic data (Boyer et al., 2013) beginning in the early 1800s and updated through 2014. New sources of data have been included in WOD 2013 from digitization projects, additional data from recent real-time (RT) and DM streams have been compared and duplicates removed, and standardized QC completed on all data.\nData from the GOSUD project (deck 782, Figure 2 (c)), provided by NCEI, complement the WOD data with RT and DM near-surface observations of sea temperature and salinity from RVs and other ship types. The GOSUD archive is new to ICOADS, and both WOD 2013 and GOSUD provide oceanographic information made available in the new Near-Surface-Oceanographic attachment (Nocn; see Section 4.2.1).\nWhile GOSUD archives just near-surface sea temperature and salinity, the SAMOS initiative (deck 740, Figure 2 (e)) has been collecting a much broader suite of underway ocean and surface meteorological measurements from US and some international RVs. The SAMOS data undergo QC at FSU and both original and quality-processed observations are archived at NCEI (Smith et al., 2009) . Hourly 'super-obs' are created by averaging the data from the 10-min period prior to the top of the hour for inclusion in ICOADS. The choice to subset the SAMOS data was made so that the records in R3.0 are more consistent with manual VOS reports, which are typically observed within the 10 min prior to the reporting hour. R3.0 extends earlier FSU-processed World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) RV data in ICOADS (Flint, 1994; WHOI, 2002 showing temporal coverage by year (bottom) (and excluding \"landlocked\" reports using a 2 \u2218 \u00d7 2 \u2218 land-sea-mask; see also discussion in Section 6).\nThe time-series vertical axis units are log 10 and each tick mark on the horizontal axis represents a 10-year span. More information on these sources can be found in the Section 3 text, and in Tables 2 and 3 Numbers of input reports denoted by '*' are counts after reduction to hourly reports.\n(d) Figure 2 .

More information on these sources can be found in the Section 3 text, and in Table 4 The JCOMM GCC distribute global DM data collected on a quarterly basis from VOS paper forms and electronic logbooks (e-logbooks). While the number of Contributing Members (CMs) has decreased in recent years, currently around fifteen CMs, the GCC archive has continued to expand in recent years due to automated weather stations on VOS ships and the use of e-logbooks which help to facilitate the exchange of the archive data. The updated archive replaces many of the RT GTS reports providing additionally observed parameters and a standardized minimum QC applied to all GCC DM reports (deck 926, Figure 2(d) )."}, {"section_title": "New data sources from the GTS", "text": "Coastal data sources also provide a wealth of information for R3.0. Meteorological observations from the US tide-gauge station network derived from the GTS are a new data source. The sea-level measurements are not included, but associated meteorological and SST observations have been added to ICOADS. A complication in processing these data arises because location information is not reported in RT. Instead, it has been taken from an historical station metadata archive constructed by NOAA's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) (http://www.ndbc. noaa.gov/metadata/stationmetadata.xml, accessed 1 January 2016).\nSince the early 1980s NDBC has been operating its Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN), close to 50 stations typically on lighthouses, beaches, near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. Position information for the C-MAN network is also available through the NDBC metadata."}, {"section_title": "Composition and data coverage of Release 3.0", "text": "Release 3.0 improved ICOADS by increasing the number of available marine reports, starting in the late 1700s, making significant gains into the modern period, and further extending the DM period of record from 2007 in R2.5 to 2014 in R3.0. New and updated data sources described in Section 3 were incorporated into R3.0 and are illustrated in Figure 3 . There are notable gains from new digitizations, i.e. around 1855-1865 from the German Maury collection (deck 721), as well as around the World War 1 period, [1912] [1913] [1914] [1915] [1916] [1917] [1918] [1919] [1920] [1921] [1922] [1923] [1924] [1925] . Additionally, Figure 3 shows gains from reprocessed and updated archives, i.e. from the latest version of WOD (WOD 2013; deck 780) and updated GTMBA buoy archives (deck 146) from PMEL. GTS receipts from NCEI (decks 992-995) and NCEP (decks 792-795, 796) and RV reports from SAMOS (deck 131) also increased report counts, and spatial coverage, in the modern period.\nPercentage of ocean coverage has increased with R3.0 (Figure 4) . The EEIC collection (Figure 1(b) ) provided significant gains in observed AT and SLP in R3.0 during the early 19th century, and may be the earliest systematic collection of instrumental marine observations in existence. EEIC has provided much needed early observations in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins with some noticeable increases also in the South Pacific. Gains in early time periods are critical for extending reanalysis products and gridded analyses farther back in time and may help to constrain proxy reconstructions of past climate (Brohan et al., 2012) .\nThere are also significant gains in coverage during the period 1853-1868, a nearly 5% increase in ocean area sampled in SST, AT, SLP and wind, contributed mostly from the German Maury collection (deck 721) and some from WOD (deck 780). The gains were most notable in the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Figures 1(c) and 2(a)). A nearly 2% increase in ocean coverage during WW1 is from the OldWeather UK Navy logbooks (deck 249, Figure 1 (h)), with noteworthy gains in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nStarting around the year 2000 there are notable increases in coverage in the modern period due in part to high-frequency reporting systems such as automated ship reports and moored and drifting buoy archives described in Section 3.2. Near-surface ocean temperatures from the global network of Argo profiling floats (plus from other oceanographic instruments), incorporated in R3.0 via WOD 2013, appear to account for a large fraction of the increases in SST coverage from 2005 to 2014. Small decreases in sampled ocean area are also observed in Figure 4 . These decreases are associated with removal of suspected erroneous MORMET reports from 1958-74 (deck 732; see Section 5.2), and of erroneous AT values (retaining other elements of the report) from WOD 2013 (deck 780; SID 149).\nR3.0 represents progress towards the reduction of uncertainty in products derived from ICOADS. Although digitization activities typically target data sources for which pressure observations are available, efforts are made to digitize the full multivariate record and retain the associated metadata. The benefits of this approach are clear in the early instrumental record, R2.5 contained very few observations of AT or SLP prior to the 1830s. Although coverage in R3.0 remains low in this period, at around 2%, these Extended WW1UK Royal Navy Ship Logs, 1912 Logs, -1925 1.1M US Lightship, 1931 -1980 203K US Navy Hourlies, 1951 -1964 3.0M GODAR, 1968 3.0M GODAR, -1993 414K Australian Navy, 1974-77; 4K GTMBA, 1977 4K GTMBA, -2014 13.9M GOSUD, 1980 13.9M GOSUD, -2014 2.6M IMMT Data, 1982 -2014 14.2M SAMOS, 2005 14.2M SAMOS, -2014 new data should provide valuable input or comparison for reanalysis.\nThe estimation of air-sea fluxes from ICOADS is particularly sensitive to the available sampling and to uncertainties in the observations (Gulev et al., 2007) . R3.0 represents progress towards the reduction of uncertainty in products derived from ICOADS through improved coverage ( Figure 4 ) and improved sampling (Figure 3) . Figure 4 shows the coverage of reports containing total cloud cover (N) needed to estimate solar radiation, and in the evaporation parameter (G) shows the coverage for those reports containing variables needed to estimate either latent or sensible heat flux from mean parameters (Berry and Kent, 2009 ). There are noticeable increases in ocean coverage for clouds in the 1850s and 1860s and around 1900. The surface flux coverage illustrated by G is reduced by the lack of availability of humidity measurements in many reports with consistent coverage only from the 1910s.\nCoverage has decreased for most variables since the late 1980s (Figure 4) , the exception being SST personal communication) . The availability of higher quality and more complete observations retaining metadata, as is typical for R3.0 acquisitions, is a further important step towards producing higher quality products from ICOADS both for SST (Kennedy, 2014) and for other variables including estimates of air-sea exchange (Gulev et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "IMMA format updates", "text": "The IMMA format (Woodruff, 2007 ) is used to store and provide ICOADS observational data to users, and also to permanently archive the data and metadata in a technologically stable and readily exchanged form. The format is ASCII-based, containing a Core section including date, time, location, and identification information along with commonly reported meteorological variables and associated metadata. A simple fixed-length encoding scheme is used, with floating-point numerical values scaled to integers, e.g. 19.23 stored as 1923, and non-numeric data, such as QC flags and metadata, stored as 1-or 2-character coded values that are then decoded via look-up tables. Following the Core, a variety of attachments (attm) is available to hold additional data elements or metadata not represented in the Core. A new version of IMMA (IMMA1; Smith et al., 2016) has been developed for R3.0. This introduces several new features, summarized in Table 5 , and described in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "Unique identifiers and the UID attachment (Uida)", "text": "New to R3.0 and IMMA1 is the addition of the unique report-level identifier (UID) and UID attachment, i.e. the Uida attm. These features assist with record tracking and are assigned by ICOADS. The UIDs are merely numbers and are not directly related to callsigns or other platform IDs. The UID allows information such as flags for erroneous values to be linked to each individual report and tracked for investigation and correction where needed.

These comparisons along with pre-ingest data bias adjustments and model actions taken (e.g. rejection of the observation) are known as feedback records. The IMMA1 format includes a Rean-qc attachment that identifies if a particular data value was used or rejected, has numerical fields for the model-collocated first guess and analysis values, the bias corrected observational value, and fields that capture the analysis project, data provider, and a code that points to a reference document describing the reanalysis effort.\nImplementation of the Rean-qc feature in R3.0 is similar to that for the Ivad and Error attms (Sections 4.2.3-4.2.4). Rean-qc records are received from the reanalysis centre and added to the matching ICOADS report, linked via the UID. Feedback data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis of the 20th century (ERA-20C) are expected to be the first Rean-qc contributions to ICOADS (Poli et al., 2015) and will become available shortly after completion of R3.0. 4.3. Switch to multi-record 'linked-report' approach with subsidiary records In previous releases and the initial version of the IMMA format, IMMA0 (Woodruff, 2007) , each report consisted of a single, variable-length physical record (i.e. line) comprising the Core data and zero or more attachments. However, in response to IVAD (JCOMM, 2015) requirements, plus increasing needs to more systematically interchange data and metadata with the user community, IMMA1 has been modified to allow multiple records per report, i.e. each such 'linked report' consists of a Main record and optional Subsidiary records all linked by UID (see also \nThis implementation is backward compatible and allows information to be provided in a file containing only Subsidiary records, allowing users to help enhance future versions of ICOADS."}, {"section_title": "Data issues identified", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SLP biases", "text": "Early SLP values from the US Maury Collection, and possibly also in the newly included German Maury Collection, appear to be biased compared to other sources (Wallbrink et al., 2009) . While the reasons for these biases remain unclear, for R3.0 differently adjusted (i.e. for temperature and/or for gravity) versions of SLP for the German Maury Collection have been generated and will be offered in IMMA format as separate 'Auxiliary' data sets, to allow those interested to examine the adjustment effects.\nFor R3.0, some additional SLP biases have been identified, but only partially addressed, arising from atmospheric pressures reported at the height of the barometer, rather than adjusted to sea level. Inclusion of station pressure data in ICOADS is problematic since the IMMA format presently allocates space only for SLP, but station pressures from some data collections have nevertheless been stored in the SLP field, e.g. for some RV and moored buoy collections. The additional complication exists that as yet adjustment practices for VOS (and other platform types) have not been fully standardized by WMO (e.g. some RVs also report a value adjusted to sea level, but no standard practice has been followed).\nWhile contemporary VOS data at least should all be adjusted to SLP, the remaining scope of possible biases is not fully understood -but improvements have been made for R3.0. In the case of SAMOS RV data, for example, pressures at barometer height were adjusted to sea level, provided sufficient metadata were available. Similarly, discussions with PMEL indicated that the pressure reports from the GTMBA were at barometer height, rather than adjusted to SLP. For the new GTMBA archive (deck 146; Section 3.2), the adjustment was made following WMO No. 8 (WMO, 2010) using known barometer heights. (Only very limited amounts of GTMBA data have been carried over from previous ICOADS releases, and while increasing those pressure values by 0.3 hPa as an approximate adjustment appears desirable, this did not prove feasible for R3.0.)"}, {"section_title": "Identification of problematic data sources", "text": "Following completion of R2.5, it was discovered that reports from the US e-logbook software package, Shipboard Environmental Acquisition System (SEAS) versions prior to v9.1 were erroneous: there were unexplained differences between RT GTS and DM observations. These SEAS data are considered unreliable and hence removed from R3.0. Kennedy et al. (2011b) and Minobe and Maeda (2005) documented an approach of excluding data from deck 732, the Russian Marine Meteorological Data Set (MORMET, 7.9M reports output from R2.5). All data reported in prescribed regions and periods in Kennedy et al. (2011b) were excluded from R3.0 (339K total excluded) as many were found to be mislocated. The excluded reports are retained in the total file, and approximately 7.83M reports remain in the final R3.0 data set.\nFor R2.5, data collected by the Institut f\u00fcr Meereskunde at the University of Kiel were provided by Canada's OSD and included as ICOADS deck 715. Until 1990 typically the only available parameter was ocean current (Krauss, 1996) , stored in the Suppl attm. From 1990, many reports also contained SST but these contained large amounts of constant or other suspicious values. For R3.0, it was decided to exclude all deck 715 data from the final data set, but retain the reports in the total file.\nComparisons of past ICOADS holdings of tropical data from PMEL (decks 143-145) with the new GTMBA archive (deck 146) made it apparent that daily average deck 145 wind directions in previous ICOADS releases were in the oceanographic convention (the direction to which the wind blows) rather than the ICOADS standard meteorological convention (the direction from which the wind blows). This was resolved for R3.0 by removal of all ICOADS reports from deck 145 (1979-1991) . While these tropical Pacific data from buoys and some 'flat' island stations remain in the total file, their daily average nature also renders them inhomogeneous with respect to most other contemporary ICOADS data. The older versions of GTMBA data, in contrast, were largely replaced in R3.0 with higher temporal resolution and quality data from deck 146 (Section 3.2)."}, {"section_title": "Other data considerations", "text": "Since late 2007, many VOS began masking their callsigns -either to the anonymous 'SHIP' or to JCOMM approved unique 'mask' identifiers (generally designated on a national basis) -for security and commercial reasons (see also Section 2.3). For recent GTS data, R2.5 relied primarily on the NCEP GTS stream in which most callsign information was absent. In contrast, R3.0 also ingests the NCEI GTS stream, which does contain many genuine callsigns and the other uniquely assigned mask identifiers (Table 6 ). Moreover, inclusion of DM data from the GCC adds additional unique ship identifier information. For R3.0, UK NOC has again joined WMO Pub. 47 VOS platform/instrument metadata with VOS reports, provided the real callsigns were reported, as was done for R2.5. For future releases, in contrast, NCEI is planning to operationalize this task, which should facilitate access (by NOAA as an NMHS) to securely held JCOMM lists of mask-versus-real callsigns. This will permit the association of Pub. 47 metadata with reports containing the unique mask identifiers, further enhancing availability of the Meta-vos attm.\nThus far, NCEP has not decoded reports of sea ice (concentration, stage of development, etc.) from the GTS SHIP code, but any originally reported GTS fields should be available in the Suppl attm, since NCEP prudently preserves, in their BUFR format, the original SHIP message(s) used to construct each BUFR report. This remains the case for R3.0. However, ice elements in the NCEI GTS are being translated, and to some extent have replaced the near-duplicate NCEP reports missing the ice elements, e.g. during the NRT merging process (Section 2.3).\nIn translating WOD 2013 into IMMA format, it was recognized that wind direction measurements were in a mixture of oceanographic and meteorological conventions (similar to the situation for some tropical Pacific buoy/island data, as discussed in Section 5.2). Because of this complication and the inability to easily distinguish which convention was used, plus because these wind data generally become available for ICOADS via other sources, all winds from WOD 2013 have been removed from R3.0. Future efforts will be needed to discern the wind direction measurement methods in WOD in order to be able to utilize them fully in future ICOADS releases."}, {"section_title": "Priorities for future development of ICOADS", "text": "The trimming approach to climatological QC used through R2.5 was developed for Release 1 (Slutz et al., 1985) and has known limitations (Wolter, 1997) . For R3.0, the focus on recovering observations in data sparse regions meant that many new observations were in regions previously unobserved where the QC medians and ranges had not been defined (see Figure 5) . It was also apparent that the ranges used were underestimated when observations were sparse, further adding to the number of observations that may be erroneously removed by trimming. An important further QC-related complication is that ICOADS still mainly uses a coarse 2 \u2218 \u00d7 2 \u2218 land-sea-mask for screening, and thus some of newly rescued historical expeditionary data, e.g. which traverse remote near-coastal regions, will be difficult to access for most users (note: both the 2 \u2218 \u00d7 2 \u2218 mask, and a 1 \u2218 \u00d7 1 \u2218 mask used to a more limited degree, are described on: http://icoads.noaa.gov/mask.html, accessed 17 March 2016).\nWhile all data, including untrimmed observations and marine reports flagged as over land, are available in the total IMMA dataset, the final user product omits such coarsely landlocked data. Moreover, most users are presently encouraged to use an 'enhanced' (rather than 'untrimmed') IMMA product, and thus do not have ready access to observations over areas without trimming limits, or that have been trimmed incorrectly. In addition, downstream users of the enhanced (and other) monthly summary products are also heavily impacted by the results of the outdated trimming, land-sea-mask, and other legacy QC processing.\nAs an urgent priority following R3.0, the currently used trimming limits are therefore being renovated through a combination of more extensive gap-filling and extrapolation with the application of a lower limit for the range based on estimates of the random uncertainty in ship observations from Kent and Berry (2005) . Other improvements to QC are expected to incorporate checks developed by DWD's Higher-level Quality Control Software (HQCS), including improvements to the land-sea-mask, tracking of reports from individual ships, and climatological and spatial consistency checks.\nThe inclusion of new historical data sources remains a priority, and ICOADS will continue to work with international digitization initiatives and archives to rescue and translate newly available data and metadata into the IMMA format. Many documents remain in national archives and personal collections that have yet to be inventoried and will provide important new data to further flesh out weak or non-existent areas of temporal/spatial coverage in ICOADS. While it is a significant task to complete a project from paper (or digital images) to keyed records, and then ultimately to translate and blend these records into ICOADS -this critical work needs to continue for the foreseeable future. The vast bulk of extant ship observations reported prior to the 1853 Brussels Conference probably are non-instrumental -like CLI-WOC data (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2005 ) -but such early in situ observations are nevertheless of tremendous value for climate research, including bridging the overlap with paleoclimatic data.\nAdditionally, steps will be taken to reprocess original ICOADS data to improve completeness and data quality, particularly of legacy data sources. ICOADS will continue to work with providers of high quality DM data, including WOD, PMEL, SAMOS, and the GCC. Other , and with the annual potential percentage increase in global ocean and coastal area sampled (orange bars). In both cases, the potential spatial coverage improvements arise from allowing unfiltered data into ocean/coastal boxes with trimming limits missing, and it should be emphasized, e.g. for early GTS receipts (\u223c1966-1979 , that sizable apparent augmentations in coverage in some cases may arise merely from noisy, spatially mislocated data.\nnew sources of data will be investigated, for example surface meteorological data holdings under the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) and the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (e.g. Holgate et al., 2013) . Inclusion of additional GTS sources will be explored. More data and metadata, and better QC are keys to improving the data set to allow climate research to improve and answer today's most pressing climate questions, to provide improved marine data resources for climate assessments and to permit close scrutiny of recent environmental changes (e.g. Karl et al., 2015) . Platform tracking to ensure consistency of position and time information for observations with IDs and to cluster together observations without IDs likely to have been made on the same platform has been implemented for ICOADS (Carella et al., 2015) . Integrating tracking into ICOADS processing is valuable for QC, data set development and reanalysis.\nReprocessing and updating legacy data sources and documentation is another priority. Reprocessing will enable recovery of parameters and metadata fields not transcribed in previous ICOADS releases. A further benefit would be the generation of an improved intermediate (pre-dupelim) file containing duplicates for data sets integrated in ICOADS prior to R2.5. This would allow a more detailed comparison of differences between data sources than currently possible. Reprocessing will enable a reassessment of the dupelim procedure and is expected to improve the quality of the legacy data.\nAdditional advances in operationalization post R3.0 should benefit climate services in support of societally important monitoring activities and other NRT applications, e.g. through: (1) blending additional international GTS sources, to achieve even more complete coverage, robust to communications and computer failures; (2) more timely integration and utilization of NWP feedback information (e.g. as provided by the Met Office GTS) on data quality; (3) transitioning from monthly to more frequent (e.g. daily) updates (in support of satellite SST work, etc.); and (4) expanding capture of GTS and other frequently updated data streams, to include near-surface oceanographic parameters and NRT population of the Rean-qc attm. In support of improved SST analyses, e.g. the extensive coverage of Argo profiling floats, which have been included in R3.0 only in DM via WOD 2013, appears to be a major factor in enhancements in SST coverage since about 2005 as shown in Figure 4 .\nAdditional format improvements and extensions to the IMMA format will consider ways to incorporate and provide higher resolution data as well as more platform and instrument metadata. Other potential format enhancements include: platform tracking information; better preservation of original input values for historical data, such as Beaufort wind force values; linking of original logbook images to individual reports using UIDs and the more complete capture of meteorological and underway ocean data from automatic systems.\nICOADS will explore the potential for extending the monthly summary statistics to include wave and swell summaries (recommended by JCOMM, 2011). Providing ICOADS in other formats, e.g. netCDF, will expand the user base and possibly enable ICOADS to be served alongside observations in WOD 2013.\nTo promote further international formalization, there are also plans to initiate ICOADS as a WMO-IOC Centre for Marine-Meteorological and Oceanographic Climate Data (CMOC) under the new Marine Climate Data System (MCDS) (WMO, 2012; International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange of the IOC (IODE), 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "R3.0 establishes a framework for ICOADS, its partnership and widening user community, to collaborate to further improve the surface marine climatological record.
