[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT (Manuscript"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There are a number of strategies to monitor the strength and track of tropical cyclones (TCs), including aircraft reconnaissance, satellite, and radar. Aircraft reconnaissance is typically limited to the Atlantic Basin. Satellite data are available globally, and allow forecasters to monitor TC development, strength, and track far from land, but can have coarse temporal and spatial resolutions. As a TC approaches land, forecasters can use radar for higher resolution monitoring of intensity and track, including Doppler estimates of wind speed, and tracking convective elements within the eyewall and outer bands. These convective elements can have greater impacts if they make landfall, including higher wind speeds, greater rainfall, and occasionally tornadoes. In recent years, long-range lightning location systems (LLS) have enabled forecasters to monitor convective elements in TCs around the world in near real-time. Vagasky, C., 2017: Enveloped Eyewall Lightning: The EEL Signature in Tropical Cyclones. J. Operational Meteor., 5 (14) , 171-179, doi: https://doi.org/10.15191/nwajom.2017.0514 Lightning in TCs was once thought to be relatively uncommon because ice and supercooled water are rarely simultaneously present within the eyewall region of hurricanes (Black and Hallett 1986) . LLS have found lightning in TCs to be a more common event than previously thought. This resulted in an interest to understand how the location, frequency, and time trend of lightning in a TC may provide information about its intensity.\nOne of the first published studies of TC lightning comes from Lyons and Keen (1994) , who found lightning primarily in the outer rain bands, and a minimum in the inner core of mature TCs. It is important to note that many of the early studies on TC lightning were conducted on systems within 400-500 kilometers of the United States coast (Molinari et al. 2006 Mazzarella and Ritchie (2014) used lightning data over the Eastern Pacific Ocean to identify cloud clusters that were more likely to develop into TCs. They found that cloud clusters that developed into TCs had up to 2.84 times more frequent lightning than the non-developing clusters. As lightning data over the oceans became more available, lightning within the eyewall of TCs was seen more frequently, and studies of eyewall lightning outbreaks followed.\nConvective bursts in the eyewall can indicate a change in the TC's path (Willoughby 1990) ; eyewall lightning outbreaks can indicate the beginning or ending of an intensification period (Molinari et al. 1999) ; rapid intensification, an eyewall replacement cycle, or the maximum intensity period (Squires and Businger 2008); or impending landfall (Zhang et al. 2012) . Molinari et al. (1999) also suggest that the lack of lightning in the inner core of a TC may indicate a steady-state system. DeMaria et al. (2012) Jiang and Ramirez (2013) . Using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Lightning Imaging Sensor (TRMM LIS), Jiang and Ramirez suggest a negative correlation between inner core lightning and TC intensification. These sometimes conflicting findings suggest that there is still much to be learned about how lightning in the inner core of a TC can be used to help nowcast or forecast these systems.\nEarly notification of TC intensification can help forecasters issue better warnings for areas susceptible to damage (Price et al. 2009 ). Their paper reviewed 58 TCs around the world between 2005 and 2007 that reached maximum winds of 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) or greater, and lightning in a 10\u00b0x10\u00b0 box surrounding the system. Fifty-six of those TCs showed \"statistically significant positive correlations between lightning activity and sustained winds,\" with lightning peaking before the maximum wind in more than 70% of the cases. This suggests that lightning may be an indicator of TC intensification and could be used for nowcasting and forecasting purposes.\nThe findings of Price et al. (2009) are similarly seen in studies from Abarca et al. (2011 ), Bovalo et al. (2014 , and Zhang et al. (2015) . Abarca et al. (2011) used WWLLN data to look at 24 TCs in the Atlantic Basin, and found that intensifying TCs had up to twice as many lightning flashes in the inner core as TCs that did not intensify. Using WWLLN data in the Southwest Indian Ocean, Bovalo et al. (2014) studied 70 TCs between 2005 and 2013. Periods of increased lightning activity were found to be correlated with periods of rapid intensity change in those TCs. Zhang et al. (2015) analyzed 116 TCs in the Northwest Pacific Ocean between 2005 and 2009. Using WWLLN lightning data, they found the greatest lightning density in the inner core was found in storms that would intensify by 14.9-24.7 m s -1 (29-48 kt) in the following 24 hours. These four studies would seem to suggest a potential to predict rapid intensity changes in TCs based on an increase in lightning.\nIn recent years, GLD360 has detected lightning fully enveloping the eyewall of several significant TCs for extended periods of time, including 2013 Supertyphoon Haiyan and 2014 Supertyphoon Hagupit (Pessi 2015) . The author of this manuscript further noticed Hurricane Patricia (2015) and Supertyphoon Nepartak (2016) as exhibiting the same phenomenon. The goal of this paper is to introduce the Enveloped Eyewall Lightning (EEL) signature and its potential utility as a tool for monitoring TCs by operational meteorologists. The study to follow catalogs global TCs between 2012 and 2015 with a maximum one-min sustained wind speed of 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) or greater, and lightning that envelops the eyewall for a period of six hours or longer, which is named the Enveloped Eyewall Lightning signature."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": "Global TCs between 2012 and 2015 with one-min sustained winds of 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) or greater at any point during their lifetime were selected for analysis. The threshold of 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) was selected to narrow the TC search results. The author initially hypothesized the EEL signature would only be evident in the strongest TCs, supported by his experience identifying the signature in Hurricane Patricia (2015), Supertyphoon Nepartak (2016), and the results of Pessi (2015) . The best track center locations for the selected TCs were overlaid on the surrounding lightning data using QGIS (www.qgis.com)."}, {"section_title": "a. Lightning data", "text": "Lightning data for this study come from Vaisala's GLD360 (Fig. 1) , a ground-based LLS capable of detecting lightning over land and oceans globally. The operating principle of GLD360 is detailed in Said et al. (2010) . GLD360 uses a network of long-range lightning detection sensors tuned to the Very Low Frequency (3-30 kHz) band. Using Time-of-Arrival and Magnetic Direction Finding techniques, and an empirical waveform bank, GLD360 detects and geolocates individual lightning events (Said et al. 2010 ). The location algorithm that generates the GLD360 dataset was updated in 2015, with data prior to the update reprocessed using the new algorithm (Said and Murphy 2016). Using Vaisala's National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) as ground truth, Said and Murphy (2016) found the reprocessed GLD360 dataset to have a relative cloud-to-ground (CG) flash detection efficiency (DE) of 75-85%, and a median location accuracy of 1.8 km over the United States. Rudlosky et al. (2017) compared the reprocessed GLD360 dataset to TRMM LIS. Their results found that GLD360 detected more than 60% of LIS flashes between 2012 and 2015 over the National Hurricane Center Atlantic marine forecast areas, and suggest GLD360 can be used to investigate Atlantic basin TCs."}, {"section_title": "b. Best track information", "text": "TC best track information was selected from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS; Knapp et al. 2010) . The IBTrACS database collects best-track data from twelve Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers, including The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, NOAA's National Hurricane Center (NHC), and the United States Department of Defense Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Different forecast agencies use different wind speed averaging periods when discussing a storm's intensity (Knapp et al. 2010 ) and can make interagency comparisons difficult. Harper et al. (2010) provides guidance for converting between wind averaging periods, but this can introduce errors. Therefore, IBTrACS presents the original data from each agency, allowing users to develop their own methods for selecting which intensity data to use. Knapp et al. (2010) also present a table of recent TC climatology research and show that HURDAT (HURricane DATabase; Jarvinen et al. 1984) and JTWC (Chu et al. 2002) best-track data are most frequently used in global TC climatology reviews. This paper uses HURDAT from NHC for North Atlantic and East Pacific storms, and JTWC for the West Pacific, South Pacific, South Indian, and North Indian basins; both list wind speeds as one-min averages. Both HURDAT and JTWC data are included in the IBTrACS database."}, {"section_title": "c. Methodology", "text": "The University of North Carolina -Asheville hosts a user-friendly version of IBTrACS (www.atms. unca.edu/ibtracs/ibtracs_current/browse-ibtracs/ browseIbtracs.php). For each year in the study period, TC best-track data were reviewed for each of the six TC basins. Chosen candidate storms were any TC with a peak HURDAT or JTWC wind speed of 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) or greater during its lifetime. A total of 82 candidate storms were selected from the IBTrACS database from a total of 389 TCs globally between 2012 and 2015. Table 1 shows statistics of total TCs and selected TCs for each year in the study period.\nFor ease in collecting lightning data for each candidate storm, the following method was used to \u2022 The GLD360 database was queried within the lightning domain from the beginning time to ending time of each candidate storm Substantially more lightning data than required were generated through this technique, but it gave full visibility to lightning within the inner core and outer rain bands of each candidate TC.\nLightning data were received as an ASCII file for each candidate storm, with each lightning event identified by the UTC date and time (milliseconds) of occurrence, its latitude and longitude (ten-thousandths of degrees), and its magnitude (kiloamperes) and polarity. Said et al. (2013) discusses the method of estimating lightning magnitude and polarity in GLD360. Using QGIS, the lightning data were plotted and color-coded by day, and the best-track data were plotted and color-coded by wind speed. As an example of this technique, Fig. 2 shows the lightning domain, lightning data, and best-track data of Hurricane Patricia (2015) . Each candidate storm's plotted data were visually inspected for evidence of an EEL signature.\nA candidate storm was determined to have an EEL signature if the plotted archived lightning data formed a continuous path that completely surrounded at least two best-track data points (Fig. 3) . The requirement that the continuous lightning path includes two best-track data points limits the EEL events to long-lasting lightning outbreaks that previous studies (e.g., Abarca et al. 2011 , DeMaria et al. 2012 ) have found to be uncommon. This also allows for future analysis to be completed using information available from best-track data. Lightning that envelops the eyewall of TCs and persists for less than six h was observed (e.g., Hurricane Matthew 2016), but attempting to identify or catalog all instances of this more transient eyewall lightning outbreak is beyond the scope of this paper."}, {"section_title": "Analysis and discussion", "text": "A total of 32 TCs ( Table 2 ) were identified that exhibited the EEL signature, with 18 occurring in the West Pacific. EEL signature TCs occurred in all basins (Fig. 4) and in all years (Table 3) , with EEL duration ranging from approximately 9 h to 75 h (median 27 h; Table 2 ). Figure 5 shows EEL signatures from the West Pacific, North Atlantic, North Indian, and South Indian basins, and demonstrates the potential utility of using GLD360 lightning data to monitor TCs over the open oceans.\nAs discussed in the introduction, studies of inner core and eyewall lightning outbreaks have not yielded consistent results. Some studies have suggested these lightning outbreaks are coincident with storm intensification (e.g., Molinari et al. 1999, Squires and Businger 2008) , although some suggest storm weakening (e.g., DeMaria et al. 2012, Jiang and Ramirez 2013) . Thirty of the thirty-two storms identified with EEL signatures intensified during the period of time with enveloped eyewall lightning. Identification of the EEL signature may provide forecasters a visual indicator that a TC is beginning an intensification period. Figure 6 compares the intensity of EEL signature TCs when the EEL signature appears, when the signature dissipates, and the storm's peak intensity during the EEL signature. TCs with the EEL signature tend to be intensifying when it appears and reach a peak intensity during the EEL signature. The intensity of the TC then tends to decrease towards the end of the EEL signature lifecycle. In three storms, the peak wind speed during the EEL signature was less than 51.4 m s -1 (100 kt), and warrants future review. However, the median peak wind speed during an EEL signature was 69.5 m s -1 (135 kt). Figure 7 compares the overall peak intensity of TCs with the EEL signature to TCs without the EEL signature. There is an artificial lower bound of 59.2 m s -1 (115 kt) for both EEL and non-EEL TCs based on the minimum intensity requirement for this study and how wind speeds are reported in best-track data. The frequency of EEL signatures in storms weaker than 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) is unknown, and is worthy of future study. Finally, the peak intensity of EEL signature storms [median = 70.7 m s -1 (137.5 kt), n = 32] was significantly greater (Mann-Whitney U = 394.5, p <0.001 two-tailed) than that of non-EEL signature storms [median = 64.3 m s -1 (125 kt), n = 50]. Although this study used archived GLD360 lightning data and best track TC data from IBTrACS to identify and catalog EEL signatures, the signature was originally identified using real-time lightning data. Figure 8 shows 4 panels of how the EEL signature GLD360 is believed to be the only LLS that can identify the EEL signature, particularly at locations far from land. This expectation comes from the greater flash DE offered by GLD360 and its uniform global coverage. Networks with DE that decrease with increasing distance from land will detect and locate less lightning over the open oceans, resulting in a limited view of the lightning in TCs, including in the eyewall. The Geostationary Lightning Mapper on the GOES-16 satellite is reported to have similar DE to GLD360 (Goodman et al. 2013) , but it has just begun collecting data, so it remains to be seen what signatures will emerge in TC lightning with this new instrument."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Using lightning data from GLD360, 82 global tropical cyclones (TCs) between 2012 and 2015 with peak wind speeds of 58.1 m s -1 (113 kt) or higher were analyzed for periods of enveloped eyewall lightning (EEL). Lightning data and the EEL signature have potential utility as a near real-time tool for monitoring the location, track, and intensity of TCs at ranges beyond aircraft reconnaissance and Doppler radar. A total of 32 TCs from across all basins were found to have the EEL signature, which is defined as a signature of detected lightning in which lightning completely envelops the eyewall of a TC and persists for at least six h. The TCs that exhibited the EEL signature tended to be stronger than those TCs without the EEL signature. The median peak wind speed of EEL signature storms was 70.7 m s -1 (137.5 kt), whereas it was 64.3 m s -1 (125 kt) for non-EEL signature storms. Although the mechanisms behind the EEL signature are not known yet, this study provides a selection of TCs with the EEL signature that can be used for future research. These unique events can be used to help meteorologists develop a better understanding of lightning within a TC."}]
