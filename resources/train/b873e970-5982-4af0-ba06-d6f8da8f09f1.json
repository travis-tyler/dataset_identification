[{"section_title": "", "text": "with a Multi-Indexed Integrated Change (MIIC) analysis being used to update from 2001 to 2006. The NLCD uses a great deal of ancillary data in the mapping of urban land cover classes, and as a result may have better urban land cover, along with mapping the road network as urban land cover. The NLCD also applies a Minimum Mapping Unit, aggregating clusters of same class pixels less than a certain number into the surrounding land cover classes. (Homer et. al. 2007, Fry et. al. 2011 "}, {"section_title": "CCAP", "text": "The CCAP was also begun in 1992, and has updates for 1992, 2001, and 2006. The CCAP only has land cover for coastal regions and adjacent uplands, and as a result only covers a portion of our study area. Since most wetlands are in the coastal region surrounding the bay however, the CCAP covers approximately 98% of the wetlands in our study area. The 2001 and 2006 updates were done using a CART analysis, and the 2001-2006 changes were identified using Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique. The CCAP includes six wetland class, rather than only two, like the other two land cover datasets (Burkhalter, Herold & Robinson 2005, Dobson et. al. 1995"}, {"section_title": ") CBLCD", "text": "The CBLCD was created based on the CCAP and NLCD. For 2001, the CCAP and NLCD were combine to create a baseline map. This map was then updated for 2006, and retroactively for 1992 and 1984 using CCA and a CART. Because of this, the CBLCD is the most consistent for earlier time periods. The developers felt that the CCAP overcalled coastal emergent wetlands, and corrected for this. (MDA Federal 2009) Change Analysis A number of different change analyses were done on the datasets, and compared. Change analyses were done for all three land cover datasets for the 2001-2006 time period. Each showed about ~1 change over the 5 year time period. The CBLCD and CCAP had similar numbers for wetland change in most classes. The NLCD on the other hand, showed large losses offset by large gains in wetland area. This is most likely the result of the MIIC identifying change where it had not occurred, or pervious misclassification. This does indicate that the NLCD is the least reliable of the datasets. The CBLCD and CCAP were compared from 1992-2006 to a FWS report on Delaware Wetlands from 1992-2007, based on 2007 updates to the NWI. (Tiner et. al. 2011) Like the NLCD in the 2001-2006 time period, the CCAP from 1992-2006 showed large amounts of loss and gain, while the CBLCD was more stable. This is likely the result of changes in mapping technique for the CCAP from 1992 to 2001, indicating that the only land cover dataset reliable for dates earlier than 2001 is the CBLCD, which mapped them retroactively. A comparison between the 2007 NWI updates and the 2006 dates for the CCAP and CBLCD show that the NWI indicates somewhat less coastal emergent wetlands than the CCAP, but the CBLCD shows quite a bit less than the NWI. This indicates that although the CCAP might have overcalled coastal emergent wetlands, the CBLCD might have over compensated. Using a map of mapping areas for the NWI that included mapping dates I was able to normalize the ODA change, by expressing it as a rate of change/year. The rates were very high. This could indicate greater rates of change in earlier years, before policies for protecting wetlands were put into place. This could also be due to using to high a threshold for identifying change, or from incorrect mapping dates in some areas. Conclusion We were able to identify which land cover datasets were most reliable -the CCAP, and the CBLCD for earlier time periods. Knowing this, these datasets can be used to analyses change while new wetland change detection techniques are being developed. Our work also indicates existing difficulties in the mapping of wetlands that needs to be addressed. Future analysis using these and new datasets will allow us to understand the spatial distribution of human driven change. Citations Burkhalter, S., Herold, N., & Robinson, C. (2005).
