[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "We study the impact of government funding for R&D on privately conducted and financed R&D, and its ultimate effect on productivity growth. We focus on an important but relatively understudied component of public policy on R&D: defense-related R&D. Defense R&D represents a key channel through which governments all over the world shape innovation. In the US, annual government defenserelated R&D expenditures amounted to about $78.1 billion in 2016, 57.2% of all government-funded R&D (Congressional Research Service, 2018). While defense-related R&D is motivated by goals that are not mainly economic, it is often the most important de facto industrial policy used by the federal government to affect the speed and direction of innovation in the economy. The amount of public money flowing into defense R&D dwarfs the amount spent on other prominent innovation policy tools in the US. For example, the total budget of the National Science Foundation or the overall value of the federal R&D tax credit in a typical year are less than one tenth of federal outlays for defense-related R&D (NSF 2006). Defense R&D is the single most important component of government-funded R&D in the UK and France as well, and a major component of government-sponsored R&D in many other developed economies. In this paper we use two complementary panel datasets-a country-industry-year-level dataset for OECD countries and a firm-year-level dataset for France-to address two related questions. First, we estimate the effect of government-funded R&D on private R&D-namely, R&D conducted and financed by private businesses. We are interested in whether government-funded R&D in a given country and industry (or to a given firm) displaces or fosters private R&D in the same country and industry (or firm). We use arguably exogenous variation in defense-related R&D to isolate the causal effect of government-funded R&D. Having found evidence of a positive effect, we next estimate how investment in R&D affects productivity. For both types of analysis, we assess whether the benefits of public R&D investment are limited to a single country or spill over across multiple countries. The effect of defense R&D expenditures on private sector innovation and economic growth has been a hotly debated topic for many years (e.g., see surveys by Mowery, 2010, andLichtenberg, 1995). Proponents of the benefits of defense R&D point to the commercial success of major innovations such as jet engines, computers, radar, nuclear power, semiconductors, GPS, and the Internet as evidence that military R&D has been a crucial source of technological development with civilian applications. 1 Some even argue that the Pentagon's role as the world's most generous investor in technological innovation during the Cold War-ultimately resulting in superior technologies for American companies and enduring gains in their competitiveness (Braddon, 1999)-was an important reason that US industries became so dominant. More recently, defense R&D has been viewed as an important contributor to national economic growth through private sector spinoffs and agglomeration economies. 2 Proponents of this view often point to Israel as an example of how defense spending has spawned a multitude of commercially successful high tech startups (e.g. Senor and Singer, 2009). On the other hand, critics argue that the social returns to defense R&D are likely to be low because the secrecy that surrounds defense R&D inherently limits the scope of spillovers to civilian firms. Even more fundamentally, critics argue that defense-related R&D might displace private R&D and therefore could have little (or even a negative) impact on the total amount of innovation in a country. Overall, there is much anecdotal evidence of some of the positive and negative effects that defense R&D might have on growth, but little systematic econometric evidence. 3 We begin our empirical analysis using a unique dataset that we constructed by linking detailed information on defense-related and non-defense related government-funded R&D to information on private R&D, output, employment, and salaries in 26 industries in all OECD countries over 23 years. We estimate models that relate privately funded R&D in a given country, industry, and year to 1 For example, see Lichtenberg (1984Lichtenberg ( , 1988, Ruttan (2006), Mazzucato (2013) and the recent discussion of the DARPA model by Azoulay et al. (2019b). Draca (2013) estimates the impact of US defense spending on firm-level innovation and finds that increases in procurement contracts are associated with increases in patenting and R&D. Bhattacharya (2018) presents a structural model of R&D in the context of the US Department of Defense SBIR program and has a good recent survey of issues around military procurement and innovation. 2 An additional benefit of military R&D is the creation of highly specialized human capital valued by the private sector. Silicon Valley companies increasingly scout Pentagon and NSA personnel for potential hires (Sengupta, 2013) 3 For a recent survey of the literature on the evaluation of innovation policies, see Bloom, Van Reenen, and Williams (2019). The literature focuses on two types of R&D policies. First, there are fiscal policies towards R&D such as Hall (1993), Bloom, Griffith, and Van Reenen (2002), Moretti and Wilson (2014), Dechezlepretre et al. (2019) and Rao (2016). This generally finds positive effects. Second, there is a body of empirical research on the effect of public R&D on private R&D (e.g. David, Hall, and Toole, 2000;Lach, 2002;Goolsbee, 1998;Wallsten, 2000). The results here are mixedsee for example the metastudy of Dimos and Pugh (2016). There is a small number of recent papers that have clearer causal identification strategies, but these papers tend to differ from ours in that they focus on single countries, different policy instruments, and different outcomes than those we focus on. For example, Jacob and Lefgren (2011) and Azoulay et al. (2019a) study the effect of NIH grants on publications and patenting; Bronzini and Iachini (2014) focus on the effect of R&D subsidies on capital investment by Italian firms; Howell (2017) looks at Department of Energy SBIR grants on venture capital funding and patents; and Slavtchev and Wiederhold (2016) study the effect of government procurement on innovation. Guellec and van Pottelsberghe de la  and Pless (2019) are rare exceptions that look at multiple types of R&D policies. government-funded R&D in the previous year, conditioning on a full set of country-industry and industry-year fixed effects. We complement this industry-level analysis with a firm-level analysis based on a longitudinal sample of firms that engage in R&D followed collected by the French Ministry of Research from 1980 to 2015. This is the only available dataset we know of that disaggregates public defense R&D subsidies by firms across the whole economy. One advantage of using firm-level data is that we observe which firms within an industry actually receive public R&D funds and which do not. The longitudinal nature of the data allows us to control for firm fixed effects, absorbing all time invariant unobserved differences across firms that may be systematically correlated with the propensity to invest in R&D. We compare the same firm to itself in different moments in time and identification stems from the exact timing of the public R&D award. In both the OECD data and the French data, we use predicted defense R&D as an instrumental variable to isolate exogenous variation in public R&D. This instrument combines nationwide changes to defense R&D with fixed allocations across industries. Predicted defense R&D provides arguably exogenous variation because annual aggregate changes in defense spending reflect political and military priorities that are largely independent of productivity shocks in different domestic industries. Wars, changes of government, and terrorist attacks have had major influences on defense spending. In the US, for example, military R&D spending ramped up under President Reagan; fell back after the end of the Cold War, and rose again after 9/11. Importantly for our identification strategy, the impact that nationwide exogenous changes in military spending have on defense related R&D varies enormously across industries, because some industries (e.g. aerospace) always rely more heavily on defense-funding than others (e.g. textiles). 4 The sign of the effect of government-funded R&D on privately-funded R&D could be positive or negative, depending on whether government-funded R&D crowds out or crowds in privately-funded R&D. Crowding out may occur if the supply of inputs to the R&D process (specialized engineers, for example) is inelastic within an industry and country (Goolsbee, 1998). In this case, the only effect of an increase in government-funded R&D is to displace private R&D with no net gains for total R&D. Crowding in may occur if (i) R&D activity involves large fixed costs and, by covering some of the fixed costs, government-funded R&D makes some marginal private sector projects profitable; 5 (ii) government-funded R&D in an industry generates technological spillovers that benefit other private firms in the same industry; and/or (iii) firms face credit constraints. Empirically, we find strong evidence of crowding-in both the OECD and French datasets. Increases in government-funded R&D generated by variation in predicted defense R&D translate into significant increases in privately-funded R&D expenditures, with our preferred estimates of the elasticity equal to 0.518. Our estimate implies that defense-related R&D is responsible for an important part of private R&D investment in some industries. For example, in the US \"aerospace products and parts\" industry, defense-related R&D amounted to $3,026 million in 2002 (nominal). Our estimates suggest that this public investment results in $1,948 million of additional private investment in R&D. Considering the total amount spent by the US government, we estimate that private R&D investment in the US is $85 billion higher than the counterfactual with no government-funded defense R&D. Our estimates also indicate that cross-country differences in defense R&D might play an important role in determining cross-country differences in overall private sector R&D investment. For example, we estimate that if France increased its defense R&D to the level of the US as a fraction of its GDP (admittedly a large increase) private R&D in France would increase by 10.3%. We find evidence of spillovers between countries. 6 In the OECD data, increases in government funded R&D in one country appear to increase private R&D spending in the same industry in other countries. For example, an increase in government-funded R&D in the US chemical industry induced by an increase in US defense spending in the chemical industry raises the industry's private R&D in the US, but it also raises private R&D in the German chemical industry. This type of cross-border spillover is consistent with the presence of industry-wide technological or human capital externalities. In the final part of the paper, we turn to the effect of investment in R&D on productivity. We estimate models where measures of productivity growthgrowth in TFP or output per worker -are regressed on lagged private R&D intensity, using predicted defense R&D as a share of value added or sales as an instrumental variable. Industry-level models based on OECD data indicate a positive effect of private R&D on TFP. An increase in the defense R&D to value added ratio of one percentage point is estimated to cause a 8.3% increase in the yearly growth rate of TFP (e.g., from 0.98 percent per annum to 1.06 percent). OLS estimates from firm-level models based on French data are qualitatively consistent with these findings, but IV estimates are imprecisely determined. 7 We view this as a significant but not overwhelming effect. It suggests that a small fraction of US economic growth is accounted for by investment in defense R&D. For example, defense R&D in the US increased by a third between 2001 and 2004 following the 9/11 attack. We estimate that, holding taxes constant, this translated into a 0.005 percentage point increase of the annual TFP growth rate in the US in the affected years-about a 1.5% increase. Overall, our estimates suggest that cross-country differences in defense R&D play a role in explaining cross-country differences in private R&D investment, speed of innovation, and ultimately in productivity of private sector firms. We caution that our estimates do not necessarily imply that it is desirable for all countries to raise defense R&D across the board. Our finding that government-funded R&D results in increased private R&D does not necessarily imply that defense R&D is the most efficient way for a government to stimulate private sector innovation and productivity. There are other possible innovation policies available to governments (Bloom, Van Reenen and Williams, 2019) and our analysis does not compare defense R&D to other types of public R&D spending. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a simple framework and the empirical models. Section 3 describes the data. Sections 4 and 5 present the empirical results. Section 6 concludes. Online Appendices detail the data (A); quantify alternative policies (B) and simulate the impact of the 9/11 shock (C)."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework, Econometric Models and Identification", "text": "We start with a simple framework that is useful in deriving the empirical models we take to the data, and in clarifying how to identify and interpret our empirical estimates. Here we focus on the effect of government-funded R&D on private R&D activity. Specifically, we are interested in the direct effect for an industry-country pair or a firm of receiving government-funded R&D on the recipient's own private R&D investment. In addition, we are interested in international spillover effects that might arise if changes in government-funded R&D in a particular industry and country indirectly affect private R&D activity in the same industry in other countries. In Section 5, we will discuss the framework to estimate the direct and indirect effects of R&D investment on productivity."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "We assume that output of firm f in industry i in country k at time t is a function of capital, K, labor, L, and intermediate inputs, where A is Hicks-neutral TFP. Following the R&D literature (e.g. Griliches, 1979) we assume that A is determined by the lagged R&D knowledge stock G: where = is the elasticity of output with respect to the business R&D stock, X are other factors influencing TFP, and is a stochastic error term. The R&D stock G is an increasing function of privately funded R&D expenditures (R) and government-funded R&D expenditures (S). We assume that S is set by the government, while R is chosen by the firm based on the technology embodied in equations (1) and (2), as well as on the cost of R&D. We assume that the (static) demand for private R&D can be written as: where U is the Hall-Jorgenson tax-adjusted user cost of R&D capital, which is allowed to depend on public subsidies, S (see Criscuolo et al, 2019, for a discussion of how subsidies affect the user cost of capital). The user cost will also depend on current and expected interest rates, depreciation and the tax system as a whole (including R&D tax credits). This equation can be rationalized as the steady state demand for R&D from the first order conditions from specializing equation 1to a CES production function (e.g. Bloom, Griffith, and Van Reenen, 2002). Under this interpretation, \u03c3 is the elasticity of substitution and \u03b2 is the returns to scale parameter (\u03b2 =1 indicates constant returns) and v is a function of technological parameters in the production function indicating factor biases. 8 In our empirical analysis, we use two alternative datasets to estimate two variants of equation 3. In our analysis of OECD data, the level of observation is an industry-country-year and we assume that we can take a first order approximation of equation 3as: where the determinants of R&D other than S and Y are assumed to be a vector of country by year observables Xkt, a set of industry by country fixed effects (dik), industry by year dummies (dit, e.g. industry specific product demand or technological shocks), and an idiosyncratic error (\u03c5ikt). 9 In our baseline models, Xkt includes country-specific linear trends and GDP at t-1, thus controlling for countryspecific long run trends and business cycles as these demand side effects are likely to affect innovation (e.g. Shleifer, 1986). (The linear trends are not absorbed by the vector dit because they are allowed to vary by country). In some specifications, Xkt includes a country-specific quadratic trend and additional controls that may affect R&D. In our analysis of the French data, the level of observation is firm-years, and we assume that we can take a first order approximation of equation 3as: where we include a set of firm fixed effects (df) to absorb all sources of time-invariant heterogeneity across firms. Since in this specification we only have one country, we do not include Xkt and dik -these are absorbed by the time dummies and firm fixed effects respectively. We also consider industry-level versions of equation 5where we can disaggregate industries at a finer detail than in the OECD data. Equations (4) and (5) represent our baseline models in the empirical analysis of the effects of government R&D on private R&D. The focus of our analysis is on estimating the coefficients \u03b1 OECD and \u03b1 FRA that relate changes in government-funded R&D in a given year to changes in private R&D in the following year. (Recall that the dependent variable is only the privately funded part of business R&D, so there is no mechanical association between R and S.) The sign of \u03b1 is unknown a priori. If increases in government-funded R&D crowd out private R&D, the \u03b1 terms should be negative. In the case of complete crowding out, the only effect of the policy is to displace private R&D, with no net gain in total R&D. This would be the case if, for example, the supply of inputs in the R&D process in any given industry was perfectly inelastic in the short run. A key input in this respect is likely to be specialized scientists and engineers and the elasticity of their supply to a country-industry depends on their mobility across industries and countries. With inelastic supply to a country-industry, increases in public funds for R&D come at the expense of declines in private R&D. If, on the other hand, increases in government funded R&D crowd in private R&D, the \u03b1 terms should be positive. In this case, more public R&D stimulates even more private R&D. There are at least three possible reasons for why this might be the case. First, in the presence of large fixed costs, public R&D may make marginal private projects feasible. In most industries, R&D activity is characterized by large fixed costs in the form of labs, research, human capital accumulation, set up costs, etc. It is realistic to think that some of these fixed costs can be used for multiple projects. For example, lab infrastructure set up for a specific project can, in some cases, be used for other projects as well. Similarly, a scientist's human capital acquired while working on a specific project-the intellectual understanding of a specific literature, for example, or her mastery of a scientific technique-can be helpful in other projects. By paying for some of the fixed costs, government-funded R&D may make profitable for private firms' projects that otherwise would not have been profitable. Similarly, if government-funded R&D results in process innovation, it is conceivable that this innovation can indirectly benefit private R&D. Second, if firms are credit constrained, the public provision of R&D might relax these financial constraints. Although capital markets are generally well developed for the OECD countries we study, the special nature of R&D investments highlighted by Arrow (1962), such as riskiness and asymmetric information, may make it especially vulnerable to financial frictions. 10 Third, government-financed R&D investment by one firm may make other firms in the same industry more productive because of technology or human capital spillovers (e.g. Moretti, 2004 and. In this case, an increase in government-financed R&D directly raises R&D in the firm that receives the government contract, and may indirectly raise R&D in other firms in the same industry or same locality. Spillovers could also be negative in the case of strategic substitutability, as rival firms could free ride off the R&D of the supported firms (e.g. Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen, 2013). An implication is that in the presence of R&D spillovers within an industry the estimated coefficient from industry-level data in equation 4does not need to be identical to the coefficient from firm-level data in equation 5. Broadly, we expect industry coefficients should be larger if crowd-in induces rival firms to do more R&D (due to strategic complementarity) or smaller if rivals do less R&D (due to strategic substitutability). In terms of inference: to account for the possible correlation of residuals in each year across industries in a given country and across countries in a given industry, standard errors for OECD data throughout the paper are multi-way clustered by country by industry pair and country by year pair (Miller, Cameron and Galbech, 2009). In the regressions based on the French data, we cluster at the 2digit industry for industry-level regressions; and 3-digit industry for firm-level regressions."}, {"section_title": "Identification and Threats to Validity", "text": "Equations (4) and (5) allow us to control for a wide variety of shocks that affect private R&D and may also be correlated with government-financed R&D. In equation 4, the inclusion of industryyear dummies accounts for the fact that different industries have different propensities to invest in R&D, and these differences can vary over time as a function of technology shocks and product demand shocks. The inclusion of industry-country fixed effects accounts for differences in the propensity to invest in R&D across countries and the fact that these international differences may be more pronounced in some industries than others. In equation 5, the vector of controls also include firm fixed effects. This is an important advantage of using firm-level data. It allows us to absorb all time-invariant unobserved differences across firms that may be systematically correlated with propensity to invest in R&D. In equation 5, we compare the same firm to itself at different moments in time. Identification stems from the timing of the public R&D award. Even after conditioning on this rich set of controls, our models yield inconsistent estimates if the timing of public R&D is correlated with unobserved time-varying determinants of private R&D. We cannot rule out this possibility, as government policies are unlikely to be random. We use \u210e ( \u22121) rather than the actual own country share in order to further reduce the risk that the industry distribution of defense R&D subsidies responds to expected country-specific shocks. Using the US and French data also has the practical advantage that defense 11 Notice that this includes not only defense related R&D subsidies spent by businesses, but also spend by sectors including e.g., universities (called \"government budget appropriations or outlays on R&D\" or GBAORD by the OECD). We do not have aggregate numbers for the business sector only component for all OECD countries (only for France). In Table 3 we conduct robustness tests where we control for non-business R&D to make sure our affects are not being driven by defense R&D carried out in government labs or universities. R&D subsidy data at the country-industry level by year is not available for the other countries. 12 Notice that since \u210e ( \u22121) is country-industry-year specific, it is not absorbed by any of our fixed effects. Is possible that while the overall level of defense spending in a country is orthogonal to the residual \u03c5ikt, the industry composition of defense spending may still be correlated with \u03c5ikt. This would be the case if, for example, French defense spending declined after the end of the Cold War for exogenous reasons, but the decline was smaller in, say, aerospace, for endogenous reasons. Because we are using a weighted average of US and French industry shares for all countries, this is a problem only to the extent that endogenous adjustments to the industry shares reflect unobserved industry-specific time-varying shocks that are shared by the US, France and the relevant country. As tests of this we look at models that exclude the US or France (or both) and find that they all yield similar estimates. In the French analysis, the IV for firm-level models is defined as where \u210e 4 is the annual share of defense R&D subsidies allocated to firm f's main four-digit SIC industry (averaged across all years); and 3, is the level of defense subsidies defined at the threedigit industry level excluding subsidies going to firm f itself in a particular year, to avoid a mechanical correlation between the IV and instrumented variable. Analogously, in our three-digit industry level analysis for France, we use the three-digit industry defense R&D share and the two-digit industry defense R&D subsidy excluding the subsidy to firm f's three digit industry: \u210e 3 \u2022 2, . We tried using the US shares for the French analysis, but the level of coarseness of the aggregation of industry meant that the first stages were weak. A possible concern is that, although shocks to military R&D are unlikely to be related to technology shocks, they could in principle signal shocks to future product demand. Under this view, an event such as 9/11 generated a direct increase in military R&D, but also increased current and future demand for military products. In turn, this second channel could stimulate additional private R&D through a demand or market size effect, thus invalidating our instrument. We note that it is not ex ante obvious that this is a major issue in our context because historically large increases in government 12 The US industry shares are given for each fiscal year, so it is partially lagged compared to the other variables. It is available for the years 1987-2003 for the US (we hold the 2003 share constant for the years after 2003). Apart from the US, the defense breakdown by industry is only available for France between 1980 and 2015 (see data description further below). Our results are robust to dropping either the US or France or both. We use only the France-specific data in the French firm-level analysis below. defense procurement are typically targeted toward existing, rather than new technologies, while most R&D is likely to be directed at new technologies. 13 Nevertheless, we present four tests intended to probe the sensitivity of our findings to these demand effects. (i) As a first pass, we estimate models that condition on future industry output. These models are not our preferred specification, because future output needs to be thought of as an endogenous variable. (ii) We then estimate models that condition on non-R&D military spending and expectations thereof. (iii) We also estimate our baseline model solely on the US, where we have industry-specific R&D and non-R&D public military spending. (iv) Finally, we perform placebo tests based on components of defense spending that are unrelated to R&D subsidies paid to businesses. The idea is that our instrumental variable estimates should not be driven by changes in defense procurement that stimulate demand rather than R&D. Overall, our findings indicate that changes in expected demand are not major sources of bias in our models. Another issue to consider in interpreting our IV estimates has to do with the possibility that government-funded R&D by country i is set endogenously in response to government-funded R&D by country i's competitors. For example, an increase in government-funded R&D in, say, the German chemical sector may induce France to increase its own government-funded R&D in the chemical sector. This does not invalidate our estimates-even in an ideal randomized setting where public subsidies are randomly assigned this issue would arise-but it affects their interpretation. In this case, the \u03b1 parameters should be interpreted as the effect of S on R, after allowing for the endogenous reaction of other countries. This is arguably the parameter of interest for policy. It informs policymakers of what they can expect from a policy change is other countries react."}, {"section_title": "Employment and Wages", "text": "We also examine the effect of increases in public R&D investment on employment and wages. This is important because an increase in private R&D expenditures does not necessarily equal an increase in R&D activity. We distinguish between the effect on labor market outcomes of R&D workers and labor market outcomes of non-R&D workers. If the supply of R&D workers is completely inelastic in the short run, increased R&D spending could simply result in higher wages, with little or no effect on employment and innovation (Goolsbee, 1998). On the other hand, if R&D workers can move across industries or across countries so that supply to a specific country and industry is fairly elastic, we might find significant increases in R&D personnel and limited increases in their wages. The effects on demand for non-R&D personnel in the industry depend on whether R&D generates technologies that substitute for or complement such labor. On the one hand, more R&D in an industry may result in product innovation, higher sales, and therefore more labor demand. On the other hand, process innovation can easily reduce employment by making it easier to produce the same output with fewer labor inputs. To empirically assess these questions, we estimate models where the dependent variable is the employment of R&D workers, employment of non-R&D workers, and average wages."}, {"section_title": "International Spillovers", "text": "It is in principle possible that increases in government-funded R&D in an industry in a given country affect private R&D investment by firms in the same industry located abroad. For example, an increase in government-funded R&D in the German chemical industry may reduce private R&D in the French chemical industry. This may be due to strategic reasons, as French firms decide it is not worth competing to catch up with their German rivals (e.g. international R&D is a strategic substitute) or the cost of internationally used industry-specific R&D inputs (e.g. chemical engineers) may be driven up. The opposite spillover effect could also arise if R&D is a strategic complement between countries, so that increased public R&D in Germany results in French firms investing more to keep up in the race; or if there are significant cross-country technological or human capital externalities. To empirically assess international spillovers, we use our OECD data to estimate models of the form: where SPik(t-1) is a weighted average of government-funded R&D in other countries in the same industry and year with weights measuring the between country i and each other country: where dij is the economic or geographic \"distance\" between country i and country j (normalized to sum to one for each country i) and Sjk(t-1) is, as before, government-funded R&D in industry i in country j. We use two separate data sets: section 3.1 details the data used in our OECD industry-country level analysis; section 3.2 describes the data used in our French firm-level analysis."}, {"section_title": "OECD Industry-Country Data", "text": "Data Sources. We combine data for OECD countries from the STructural ANalysis (STAN) dataset and the Main Science and Technology Indicators (MSTI) dataset. Our data include 26 countries, 26 industries, and 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. The Data Appendix describes in detail how we cleaned and merged the data and provides the exact definition of each variable with the corresponding source. The definitions of R&D are based on the internationally recognized \"Frascati Manual\" used by the OECD and national statistical agencies. Our main R&D variable measures industry-level R&D conducted by businesses (known as \"Business Enterprise R&D\" or \"BERD\"). We will generally refer to BERD as simply \"R&D\" for brevity. While all BERD is conducted by firms, some of its funding comes from private sector sources while other funding comes from the government. Hence, in the notation of our model, BERD = R + S. \uf0b7 We refer to the part of BERD that is funded by private sources as \"privately-funded R&D,\" or \"private R&D.\" This is the variable R, the main dependent variable in equations (4) and (5). \uf0b7 We refer to the part of BERD that is funded by the government as \"government-funded R&D\" or \"public R&D.\" This is the variable S. \uf0b7 A subset of public R&D is defense-related, and we refer to it as \"defense R&D.\" Note that S only includes government-funded R&D conducted by private firms, and does not include R&D conducted by universities (and other non-profits) and by the government itself (e.g. in government R&D labs). Also note that we do not have data on industry-specific defense R&D in the OECD dataset, but we instead construct a predicted defense R&D as described above. 14 Appendix Table A1 (Panel A) summarizes the variable definition and presents summary statistics. Facts about R&D. There is wide variation in private R&D, public R&D, and defense R&D across countries, industries, and years. Consider first aggregate R&D as a percent of GDP by country (Appendix Table A2). The most R&D-intensive country is South Korea at 2.7%, followed by Sweden at 2%. The US also has a very high R&D/GDP ratio of 1.9%. At the other end of the spectrum, there are Southern European countries like Greece and Portugal, with ratios approximately 0.2%. Although there appears to be a general upward trend in R&D over time, there is substantial variation across countries in growth rates, with some countries experiencing steep increases (e.g. Denmark) while others experience declines (e.g. the UK). R&D intensity also varies widely across industries (see Appendix Table A3). such as the US, the UK, France, and Canada, the rate of public funding has decreased over time. Some of this is likely to be due to a shift from direct to indirect support to business R&D, such as tax breaks (see Guellec and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 1999). We explicitly add controls for tax incentives in robustness checks presented below. Table 2 shows the defense share of government-funded R&D by country. Not surprisingly, the US has the highest proportion of defense-related R&D (57%), followed by Great Britain (35%), and then France (29%). In the data, we observe the defense-related part of the government's total R&D budget from the OECD MSTI. 15 Ideally, we would have just the governmentfunded and business-conducted part of R&D, but this data does not exist over time across countries. It is likely that the two series track each other, however. 16 15 Specifically, \"Total government funded R&D\" is all government budget appropriations or outlays of total R&D, i.e., not just the government-funded part of R&D conducted by businesses, but also the government-funded part of R&D conducted outside of enterprises. 16 Indeed, for the US and for France we have a more detailed breakdown and we confirm that the correlation is 0.73 (US) and 0.88 (France). The defense share of R&D varies not just across countries, but also within country over time. This is important for the identification of our models, which include country by industry fixed effects. Figure 1 illustrates how the four largest economies in our data experienced very different developments in their shares of defense-related and government-funded R&D to GDP ratios over time.  2003, 2006, and 2007(Hagstr\u00f6m and Williamsson, 2009. Finally, France shows a timepattern relatively similar to Germany: The reduction in defense spending after the end of the Cold War is visible, but in contrast to Germany, France did ramp up defense spending after 9/11. Overall, the experiences of these four major economies with highly variable levels of defense R&D illustrate how the timing of changes in defense R&D often reflects factors that are largely exogenous to economic and technological conditions, being driven by geopolitical events that are heterogeneous across countries. 17 Our instrumental variable strategy is predicated on the notion that defense R&D is an important driver of overall government-funded R&D. Figure 2 presents the series of defense R&D and public R&D by country (summed across industries). Clearly, in most cases the two series tend to move together: the average correlation is 0.29 (standard error 0.11). The importance of defense R&D varies widely across industries: Aerospace tends to be the single most important beneficiary of defense R&D. In the OECD data the first stage of our IV relies on the relationship between public R&D and predicted defense R&D. The correlation at the industry level is visually strong (see Appendix Figure A1). In years when defense R&D is high (low), overall government funded R&D tends to be high (low). Below we quantify this relationship more formally."}, {"section_title": "French Firm-level Data", "text": "Data Sources. We use firm-level data collected by the French Ministry of National Education, \uf0b7 We refer to all R&D subsidies originating from Ministry of the Armed Forces and its agencies as \"defense R&D subsidies.\" \uf0b7 We refer to the sum of all R&D subsidies (including defense R&D subsidies) originating from any ministry or government agency as \"total R&D subsidies\" or just \"R&D subsidies.\" \uf0b7 We refer to the firm's R&D budget less total R&D subsidies, other national funds, and international funds, as \"privately funded R&D.\" Descriptive Statistics. The sample includes 40,787 firms for an average of 3.9 years each. Only 24% of firms appear in five or more years and almost 40% of firms appear just once. Since our models include firm fixed effects, we drop firms that appear only once. We also drop firms with missing R&D data. The usable sample includes 12,539 firms appearing an average of 6.5 years each, 56% of which appear in more than 5 years. Summary statistics are in Panel B of Appendix Table A1. The largest two-digit industries by firm count in our sample are business services (8,025 firms) and software/data (7,507 firms), followed by machinery (2,755 firms). Because the survey targets firms that are likely to be conducting R&D, this ordering also holds when we rank industries by number of firms conducting R&D in one or more years: 7,112, 6,940, and 2,550 firms in business services, software/data, and machinery, respectively. Looking at the number of firms receiving R&D subsidies, business services (3,118 firms), software/data (3,092 firms), and machinery (1,178 firms) remain the three most prominent industries. R&D subsidies cover a large fraction of firms in these industries, while a much smaller portion receive defense R&D subsidies: just 229 business services firms, 133 electronics firms, and 115 software/data firms over the 36-year period for which we have data. While most R&D subsidies are not for defense, most euros allocated via subsidies are for defense. Of the \u20ac833 billion in R&D conducted in our sample, \u20ac87 billion was publicly funded, and \u20ac57 billion of that was targeted at defense. In industries like aerospace/transport, 18 the dominance of defense subsidies is even clearer, with the industry conducting \u20ac119 billion in R&D, of which \u20ac38 billion was publicly funded, almost \u20ac31 billion specifically for defense. Using the value of defense subsidies allocated to each industry, the largest defense industries after aerospace/transport are electronics, technical instruments, machinery, and chemicals."}, {"section_title": "The Effect of Government-Funded R&D on Privately-Funded R&D, Employment and Wages", "text": "We begin our empirical analysis by estimating the effect of publicly financed R&D on privately financed R&D (sub-section 4.1) and jobs and wages (sub-section 4.2).

For example, our model would be biased if, say, right-wing governments tend to both increase defense spending for specific sectors and simultaneously adopt pro-business policies for those sectors. In the rest of the table, we probe the robustness of our estimates to additional controls intended to capture variation in public policies. Since these additional controls are not always available, and our sample size declines from 5,026 to 4,459, in column (2) we replicate the model in column (1) using the smaller sample for comparison. The estimated coefficient falls slightly to 0.492 (0.199). In column (3) we add controls for industry output and national GDP; the coefficient on public Empirically, the coefficient on public R&D in column (4) appears to decrease to 0.476 (0.190). Besides businesses, other institutions like universities and government-funded research labs receive subsidies for R&D, which might be correlated with business R&D subsidies. In column (5) we also include R&D subsidies to non-business institutions. Empirically, non-business R&D does not appear to affect private R&D undertaken by businesses significantly, and the coefficient on public R&D rises slightly. R&D subsidies might also be correlated with other business favoring policies, for example taxes on businesses, which might also affect private R&D directly (e.g. Akcigit et al, 2018). In column (6) we control for business tax revenues as a proportion of GDP (tax revenue data is from OECD and includes taxes on income, profits and capital gains of corporates). There is a weakly negative effect of taxes, but the point estimate on public R&D subsidies is robust to this addition. As an additional robustness check on the role played by government policies we estimate a model that controls for the political orientation of the government. If R&D subsidies are correlated with other government policies, this is likely to be especially true for the case when defense R&D changes are due to changes in the political orientation of the government after elections. 20 Columns (1) and (2) in Appendix Table A5 indicate that the estimated effect of public R&D appears unchanged, indicating that variation in industry-specific defense R&D is not highly correlated with the general political orientation of governments. As discussed above, an important concern is that increases in defense R&D spending might be correlated with increases in expected future demand for output. For example, after 9/11, US firms producing aircraft may have anticipated increased demand for military planes and increased private R&D in expectation of this greater demand, even in the absence of public R&D. This would violate the IV strategy as both public and private R&D respond to an exogenous event. While some specifications in Table 3 condition on industry and aggregate output and industry by time dummies, these variables may not fully account for expectations of future demand changes that are specific to an industry-country pair. We seek to address this concern in four ways. As a first pass, in columns (3) and (4) of Appendix Table A5, we show robustness to conditioning on future industry output. These models are not our preferred specification, because future output needs to be thought of as an endogenous variable. Second, in columns (5) and (6) of Appendix Table A5, we use only country*year variation in the defense instrument. These estimates ignore variation across industries and are identified only by variation across countries and time in defense expenditures. While the first stage is a bit lower, the estimated coefficients are not very much affected. Thirdly, in columns (7) and (8) of Appendix Overall, while we cannot completely rule out that future demand expectations play a role in our estimates, the weight of the evidence appears to be more consistent with the effects of public R&D on private R&D reflecting forces of supply rather than demand. We performed numerous additional robustness tests. Since our models are identified by changes in public R&D over time, one might be concerned that the results are driven by countries with very low defense R&D levels. If we re-estimate our model only including countries with above-median defense R&D to GDP ratios-US, France, UK, South Korea, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Slovakia, Italy-our estimates appear robust. The OLS and IV coefficients of the same specifications as in column (3) in Table 3 are 0.160 (0.026) and 0.694 (0.328), respectively. 22 We also checked for outliers by (i) winsorizing observations in the top and bottom 1% of the level of the private R&D distribution and (ii) winsorizing observations in the top and bottom 1% of the changes in the private R&D distribution. Additionally, we tried winsorizing the growth rates of the IV. The results are robust to all these modifications. 23 Finally, we note that our baseline model has linear country time trends but not a full set of country by year dummies. The reason is that the first stage is weak if country-year fixed effects are included, reflecting the fact that much of the variation in the instrument is at the country-year level. The addition 22 One may also harbor the opposite concern, namely that our results could be driven by the US or by France. The results are similar when we drop these countries. The coefficient on public R&D in the IV specification is 0.564 (0.247) when we drop the US, and 0.544 (0.217) when we drop France. 23 One other concern that we tested is whether the positive effect of public R&D subsidies on private R&D subsidies in the same industry might be driven by R&D subsidies to industries which are connected by input output linkages. In order to test this, we control for domestic R&D in other industries, which we weigh by their input or output share to the respective industry. This concern does not seem to be relevant in the data, as our estimates remain unchanged (results available upon request). of country-year dummies makes little difference to the OLS results, especially once we include GDP to account for macroeconomic shocks. 24 Panel A presents the industry-level results for France and panel B presents the firm-level results."}, {"section_title": "Estimates Based on French Data", "text": "We present industry-level results for comparison to the OECD industry-country data in Table 3, although it should be noted that the French data allow for a finer degree of industry disaggregation (195 sectors). Column (1) of panel A shows the OLS estimates. The coefficient suggests a positive correlation between privately funded business R&D and lagged government subsidies, but is smaller in magnitude than the OECD results in Table 3. Column (2) reports the corresponding IV estimate using defense spending predicted from more aggregate industry trends as an instrument for defense R&D subsidies. The first stage F-statistic is F = 11.56. (All first stage coefficients are reported in Appendix Table A7). The IV estimate is significant and much larger than the OLS estimate, just like the OECD results. The IV coefficient of 0.346 is not significantly different from the comparable OECD coefficient of 0.511 in column (2) of Table 3 Panel B (p-value of difference = 0.20). Recall that defense spending at the industry level is not available in OECD industry data for most countries, but we do have it in France. Consequently, we include it directly on the right hand side of the private R&D equation in the columns (3) and (4) of Table 4. The coefficient on defense subsidies is positive and significant for the OLS and IV specifications, although again the IV coefficient is larger: 0.150 (0.041). Note that a 10% increase in total subsidies is obviously a larger amount of money than a 10% increase in defense subsidies alone, which explains the smaller elasticity in column (4) compared to (2). The firm-level analysis in panel B is based on a longitudinal sample of 12,586 firms observed for several years, for a total sample size of 81,201 firm-years. Panel B shows similar patterns to the results in panel A. In column (2), the IV coefficient is 0.119 (0.069), while in column (4), it is 0.374 (0.215). The IV estimates again lead us to reject the null of crowd-out: increases in public R&D result in more investment in private R&D, not less. Based on entries in column (2), a 10% increase in R&D subsidies is associated with a 1.2% increase in the firm's privately funded R&D spending in the following year. This confirms that even after controlling for firm fixed effects, defense R&D subsidies appear to be crowding in private R&D spending. A comparison with panel A of Table 4 indicates that industry-level coefficients are smaller than firm-level coefficients when we use defense R&D subsidies (columns (3) and (4)), but the reverse is true for total R&D subsidies (columns (1) and (2)). Coefficients from industry-level data do not need to be identical to coefficients from firm-level data in the presence of technology spillovers from R&D within an industry. Industry coefficients should be larger if crowd-in induces rival firms to do more R&D (strategic complementarity). However, it might be that rivals do less R&D if there is strategic substitutability (e.g. free riding), for example, meaning that industry coefficients would be less than their firm-level counterparts (Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen, 2013). We will investigate spillover effects at the international level in more detail below. 25 Overall, there is little evidence in Tables 3 and 4 of upward bias in the OLS estimates. In fact, the OLS estimates are consistently below the IV estimates. In the context of our discussion in Section 2, this is consistent with compensatory government policies, whereby governments tend to subsidize industries that are underperforming in terms on R&D investment. 26 The finding of IV estimates larger than OLS estimates may also reflect attenuation bias from measurement error in OLS; or a local average treatment effect, with public funds directed towards industries that are likely to \"match\" subsidies more strongly (or a combination of these explanations)."}, {"section_title": "Magnitude of the Estimated Effect", "text": "Taken together, the estimates in Tables 3 and 4 indicate that increases in public R&D translate into increases in private R&D expenditures. This is true both when we focus on industry changes across the whole OECD or within France and when we focus on within-firm changes in France. This crowd-in is consistent with the existence of agglomeration economies-whereby increases in government R&D raise the returns for private companies in the same country and industry-or large fixed costs or credit constraints. Our preferred elasticity for the OECD dataset is 0.518 (Table 3, panel B, column (3)), suggesting that a 10% increase in government subsidies in a given year is expected to result in a 5.1% increase in private sector R&D the following year. At the mean values of public and private R&D, this implies that $1 of additional public funds for R&D translates into $6 of extra R&D funded by the private sector. Our preferred elasticity at the firm level in the French dataset is 0.119 (Table 4, panel B, column (2)). At the mean values of public and private R&D in France, this implies that \u20ac1 of additional public funds for R&D translates into \u20ac0.85 of extra R&D funded by the private sector. As noted above, the smaller firm level effects compared to industry level effects could be due to positive within industry spillovers. Our findings imply that in some industries, defense-related R&D is responsible for a significant portion of private R&D investment. For example, in the US \"aerospace products and parts\" industry, defense-related R&D amounted to $3,027 million in 2002 (nominal). Our estimates suggest that this public investment results in $1,948 million of additional investment in private R&D. 27 If we take the total amount spent by the US government, we estimate that private R&D investment is $85 billion higher than the counterfactual with no government-funded defense R&D. Interestingly, differences in defense-related R&D can account for some of the differences in private R&D across countries. For example, our estimates indicate that if France increased its defense R&D to the level of the US as a fraction of GDP (admittedly a very large increase: roughly a factor of 2.2), private R&D investment would increase by 10.3%. 28 27 Public R&D in aerospace products and parts amounted to $4,306 million in 2002 (nominal). Therefore, defense related R&D was 70% of public R&D. A reduction of public R&D by 70% translates into a reduction of private R&D by 36% using our preferred elasticity of 0.518 in column (3) of Table 3. Private R&D was $5,349 million in aerospace products and parts in 2002, so 36% of this number yields $1,948 million. 28 Our estimates also indicate that if Germany increased its defense R&D to the level of the US as a fraction of GDP (an even larger increase), private R&D investment would increase by 72%. Defense R&D expenditure as share of GDP in our data (averaged over all years) is 0.58% for the US, 0.28% for France, and 0.07% for Germany. To reach the defense R&D share Finally, we compare public R&D subsidies to R&D tax credit policies. We consider the impact on total R&D of abolishing the US tax credit and reallocating the saved public funds to direct government grants. 29 On the most recent data, the federal tax credit costs $11.3 billion. Using the user-cost elasticity of unity in Table 3, we estimate that the credit raises R&D by $14.2 billion. By comparison, the crowdin elasticities of Table 3 imply that spending the $11.3 billion saved from abolishing tax credits on grants would raise total R&D by $30.7 billion. This is over twice as much as the effect generated by R&D tax credits. Appendix B provides the details, considers a range of robustness tests and concludes that direct grants are likely no worse value for money than tax incentives and generally seem to perform better. There is, of course, great uncertainty over these back of the envelope calculations, but we do think they are useful for understanding the order of magnitude of the effects of alternative innovation policies."}, {"section_title": "Effect on Employment and Wages", "text": "Appendix Table A8 reports estimates of models similar to those in Tables 3 and 4 where the dependent variable is employment or wages.

At the same time, the employment effects are much larger than the wage effects, indicating a more elastic labor supply of researchers from possibly abroad compared to the average OECD country.

We now consider the possibility that government-funded R&D in an industry and country may have an additional, indirect effect on private R&D investment in other countries. It is possible that increases in government-funded R&D in an industry in a given country will result in lower R&D in similar industries abroad. Alternatively, knowledge generated from public R&D in one country may spill over to a different country and generate additional private research efforts. To quantify these spillover effects, we estimate equation 6where we include both domestic public R&D and neighbors' public R&D. We base this analysis on the OECD industry-country data. Specifically, in panel A of Table 5 we regress private R&D on lagged domestic public R&D and lagged neighbors' public R&D, measured as a weighted average of public R&D in other countries in the same industry and year, with weights reflecting various measures of geographic and economic proximity. Column (2) uses the difference in GDP per capita as a distance measure, column (3) the geographic distance in kilometers between the capital cities, column (4) the difference in skill intensity as measured by the share of the population with tertiary education, column (5) the similarity of patent technology classes (out of 15 different technology classes), column (6) the difference in R&D intensity as measured by R&D/GDP. We instrument domestic public R&D but not neighbors' public R&D, which we assume to be exogenous to domestic firms. (The corresponding OLS coefficients are in Appendix Table A9). The effect of domestic public R&D on private R&D remains positive across all specifications. The coefficient of interest is the one on neighbors' public R&D. It is positive and statistically significant in all columns but (4) which uses skill intensity, indicating that if one country increases its public R&D, firms in nearby countries in the same industry increase their investment in private R&D after controlling for public R&D received from their own government. The positive effect is consistent with significant crowd-in between close countries when proximity is defined by income, geography, technology, FDI flows, and R&D intensity. The estimated elasticities range from 0.151 (0.053) in column (2)-where proximity is based on per-capita GDP-to 0.909 (0.211) in column 5 to either no spillover effects or crowding out.

We conclude in sub-section 5.3 with an illustration of the magnitude of the effects implied by our estimates based on the 9/11 shock."}, {"section_title": "Econometric Models", "text": "We relate measures of productivity to R&D investment. In the OECD data, we measure productivity as industry-country-year TFP. We approximate F(.) in equation 1above by a second order flexible form and can therefore estimate TFP as the superlative index: where VAikt is value added, Likt is total employment, and Kikt is the capital stock. We measure using labor's share of value added in two ways. First, we simply use the industry-specific average of the share (across all countries and years). 30 Alternatively, we use Harrigan (1997) smoothing methods to construct the share of labor in value added, . Both methods give very similar results. The Data Appendix describes in more detail how we estimate TFP. To estimate the effect of R&D on TFP at the industry level, we assume that the total R&D stock can be described by the perpetual inventory formula: = where is the depreciation rate of knowledge. If is close to zero, the TFP growth equation can be approximated by: where = is the gross rate of return to R&D capital. 31 In the French firm-level data, we have no information on capital stock or value added. Thus, our dependent variable is labor productivity defined as output per worker, ( ) : 30 Since our TFP estimates are at the industry level, this method is more suited to estimate productivity than alternative methods such as Olley-Pakes (1996) or Levinsohn-Petrin (2003) which are designed for estimation at the level of the firm. 31 Although conventional, assuming = + + (1 \u2212 ) ( \u22121) is restrictive. We considered an alternative specification = + + (1 \u2212 ) ( \u22121) that allows a dollar of public R&D to have a different effect on the knowledge stock than a dollar of private R&D. This implies including two separate R&D terms on the right hand side of equation 8. The problem is that this requires an additional instrument for privately funded R&D. We considered using R&D tax credits, but the first stage had insufficient power when both public and private R&D were taken as endogenous. Equations (8) and (9) focus on the direct effect of a country's R&D investment on its own productivity. It is possible that there is an additional indirect effect in the form of an international technological spillover. This would occur if a country's investment in a given industry ends up benefitting the productivity of firms in different countries due to international knowledge spillovers. To test for this possibility, we use our OECD data to estimate a variant of equation 8: \u0394ln Aikt = \u03c1((R+S)/VA)ik(t-1) + \u03ba(RP/VA)ik(t-1) + \u03b3\u0394Xikt + \u0394uikt 10where (RP/VA)ik(t-1) is the weighted average of R&D/value added in all other countries in the same industry and year, with weights measuring the economic or geographic distance of country k to all other countries (as in the spillover variable in equation 6 In practice, variation in value added and output per worker reflect both variation in physical productivity as well as variation in the prices of output. This is a common problem in the estimation of production functions. In our context, this problem is likely to be serious because shocks to the demand for defense products (geopolitical shocks, leadership changes, etc.) are likely to results in shocks to the price of defense-related products. The defense industry is highly concentrated and has significant barriers to entry, at least in the short run. This means that the supply curve is almost certainly not infinitely elastic in the short run. An upward sloping supply curve implies that when product demand increases, our measure of TFP increases even if productivity does not change. As standard in this literature, we deal with this problem by using industry-year specific price deflators. 32"}, {"section_title": "Effect of R&D on Productivity", "text": "In Table 6, we estimate equations (8) and (9) by regressing changes in productivity on lagged total R&D intensity. Total R&D is measured as the sum of private R&D (R), public R&D (S) and R&D from any other source. Columns (1) to (4) are based on OECD industry-level data (equation 8). Columns (5) and (6) are based on the French firm-level data (equation 9). The OLS coefficient on R&D of column (1) indicates a positive correlation between lagged R&D intensity and subsequent TFP growth. Column (2) adds country dummies and shows that the coefficient is essentially the same as in column (1). We find a similar coefficient of 0.097 (0.031) for the IV estimate in column (3), which is not statistically different from the OLS estimate. Column (4) reports the reduced form estimate. In this model the independent variable is defense R&D divided by value added, which has a both positive and statistically significant effect. 33 We conduct a similar exercise for French threedigit industries in column (5). The OLS estimate is positive, just like the one for the OECD industrycountry panel, but of smaller magnitude-0.026 (0.004). In column (6) we repeat this exercise on the French firm-level data. We uncover a coefficient (standard error) of 0.040 (0.004), a bit larger than the corresponding industry-level elasticity. Unfortunately, the IV estimates corresponding to columns 5and (6) are unidentified as the first stages have insufficient power (the F-statistics at the industry and firm level are 0.96 and 0.10 respectively). 34 The magnitude of the estimated effects in Table 6 is economically significant. Using the estimate for the OECD industry-country panel in column (4), for example, a permanent increase in the predicted defense R&D to value added ratio of one percentage point is associated with an increase in the annual growth rate of TFP of 0.08 percentage points. Since average annual TFP growth in our sample is around 0.98%, this represents an increase from 0.98% to 1.06% a year (i.e., an increase by 8.3%). Using the OLS estimate in column (5), a similar calculation suggests an increase from an average annual labor productivity growth rate of 0.05% to 0.076% a year in France. To put this in perspective, consider that our estimates indicate that if France and Germany were to raise their defense spending to the level of the US as a percentage of value added-holding constant 33 We probed the robustness of our finding using several alternative specifications. For example, estimates of the impact of R&D on TFP using Harrigan (1997) smoothing techniques are very similar: the equivalent coefficient (standard error) on R&D intensity in column (3) was 0.089 (0.032). 34 The lack of first stage power in this table stands in contrast with strong first stages in the previous tables. A possible reason is that the first stage does not include firm fixed effects (otherwise the second stage would be effectively in double differences). This suggests the changes in firm R&D and changes in firm defense public may be more strongly related than the level relationship. everything else and ignoring the additional tax revenues needed-they would experience an increase in the productivity growth rate by 3% and 5%, respectively. 35 The finding of a positive effect on productivity has an additional implication for our earlier analysis of crowding in. The estimated positive effects on productivity indicate that the positive crowding in effects that we found in the previous section are unlikely to be driven only by a relabeling of other expenditure as R&D expenses in order to obtain subsidies. A pure relabeling would not result in measurable productivity increases. Finally, we turn to the question of international productivity spillovers. We estimate equation 10, where we use the same set of weights used in Table 5. Findings in Appendix Table A10 indicate statistically significant positive international spillovers with coefficients ranging between 0.188 (0.068) and 0.304 (0.070) in the IV specifications. In order to interpret the magnitude note that the average values of own R&D/value added and the international spillover pool are different, so the coefficients cannot directly be compared. The effect of the spillover pool is larger because it requires all the other countries to increase their public R&D. 36"}, {"section_title": "An Illustration of the Magnitude of the Effects: The 9/11 Shock", "text": "We end with an illustration of the magnitudes of various effects arising from our analysis based on a concrete example: the increase in military R&D that occurred in the US after the 9/11 attacks. As described in Figure 1, US defense R&D rose by 52% bringing it from 0.45% to 0.60% of GDP between 2001 and 2004. Using all the linkages in the results above, we calculate that the 9/11 shock induced an increase of the TFP growth rate by 0.005 percentage points, holding taxes constant. Since the average annual growth rate in this period is 0.4%, this effect amounts to a 1.5% increase. We view this effect as significant but not exceedingly large. In addition, TFP growth in other OECD countries is estimated to rise by 0.028% on average. We provide a detailed explanation of how we quantified these effects in 35 The average defense R&D to value added ratios for the US, France, and Germany in our data are 0.53%, 0.30%, and 0.08%, respectively. Thus, France would need to increase its defense R&D/value added by 74%, while Germany would need a 603% increase. 36 For example, in a specification using geographical distance weights for spillovers, the own R&D coefficient is 0.004 and the spillover coefficient is 0.237 (Table A10, column (3)). An increase by one standard deviation of own R&D/value added (14.8 percentage points) is associated with future TFP growth by 0.04%. By contrast, an increase by one standard deviation of the spillover pool (5.8 percentage points) increases TFP growth by 0.85%. Note that the coefficient on domestic R&D falls and becomes insignificant when spillovers are included which is due to the fact that domestic and international R&D are highly correlated, so it is difficult to estimate both effects simultaneously. Appendix C. In short, the effect on US TFP growth comes from using the TFP estimate in Table 6, column (3), combined with an increase in total US R&D/GDP of 0.06 percentage points (or 2.9%; which is composed of public R&D rising by 4.8% according to Table A4, column (3), and private R&D rising by 2.5% according to the IV results of Table 3, column (3), due to crowding in). The effect on other OECD countries comes from the international spillover arising from the increase in US R&D (Table   A10). There is also a small TFP offset because US R&D displaces some foreign R&D (down -0.02% on average; Table A11). In interpreting these estimates, three points need to be highlighted. First, our estimates quantify the TFP gains occurring within a relatively short horizon. It is likely that the effects are larger when looking at a longer time horizon, e.g. over decades, therefore our estimates are likely to underestimate the true effect of public R&D subsidies on private R&D and productivity growth. Second, we only examine within industry productivity effects. To the extent there are inter-industry spillovers, we again underestimate the productivity benefits. Third, these estimates do not account for the opportunity cost of public funds needed to finance the increase in public R&D. In reality, the US government faces a budget constraint, and the increase in public expenditures on R&D needs to be thought of as coming either from a decrease in other forms of public expenditures or as an increase in current or future taxes, or a combination of both. In either case, the opportunity cost of the additional public R&D expenditures induced by 9/11 is unlikely to be zero, although it is difficult to estimate in practice. 37 Overall, our estimates need to be interpreted as partial equilibrium estimates of an increase in public R&D (see Akcigit, Hanley and Stantcheva, 2017, for example for a general equilibrium approach)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Given the central role that productivity plays in explaining economic growth, it is not surprising that the search for the determinants of productivity has been central to modern economics. While a large body of empirical research has argued that R&D is a key source of firm productivity growth (e.g. Aghion and Howitt, 1992;Romer, 1990), the question of exactly which policies governments should adopt to foster R&D investment is still largely an open question. In this paper, we study the impact of public R&D spending-and defense R&D spending in particular-on private R&D spending and productivity. We uncover some unexpected intellectual spoils of war. First, our results suggest that government R&D \"crowds in\" rather than \"crowds out\" private R&D. Second, we find evidence that an increase in public R&D in one industry and country raises private R&D in the same industry in other countries through a positive spillover effect. Third, we uncover significant but not overwhelming effects of private R&D investment on TFP growth and therefore economic growth. government-funded R&D clearly has an opportunity cost in the form of taxpayer money used plus any welfare loss that inevitably comes from taxation. Our paper does not compare the benefits of government-funded R&D to its costs. Our findings also indicate that the benefits of public R&D investment do not stop at a country's borders, but spillover to other countries. This implies that countries that spend aggressively on government funded R&D-like the US-indirectly support the productivity of countries with less government-funded R&D. This externality indicates the desirability of more international cooperation in government-funded R&D."}, {"section_title": "FOR ONLINE PUBLICATION ONLY APPENDIX A: DATA (A1) OECD DATA", "text": "Main Variables. R&D data was obtained from the OECD database Main Science and Technology Indicators (MSTI). This dataset contains industry level R&D conducted by businesses (\"Business Enterprise R&D\" or \"BERD\") for 26 countries between 1987 and 2009. This is our main R&D variable, but note that BERD is the main component of general R&D (\"GERD\") which also includes R&D conducted by non-businesses such as universities and government R&D labs (it is not possible to break this down by industry). The panel is unbalanced as some data is not available for some countries especially in the early years. Note that BERD is R&D conducted by business but can be financed from several sources. The OECD breaks BERD into three sources of funding: government, business and abroad. Our main variable is BERD that we generally refer to simply as \"R&D\". The variable \"Public R&D\" is the government funded part of BERD (S). We used the OECD's PPP US$ values to deflate all nominal variable such as GDP, output and R&D. From the same dataset, we also obtained the total number of R&D personnel by industry and country (all measured in full-time equivalent on R&D activities) which is broken down into scientists (\"# researchers\") and other R&D personnel such as lab technicians. We also have the total wage bill of these R&D personnel that enables a crude construction of the \"R&D wage\" of R&D labor cost divided by total R&D personnel. For the main regressions where we use R&D as the dependent variable, we use the industryfunded part of BERD as the dependent variable. We refer to this as \"private R&D\" (R). For the regressions where we use TFP growth as the dependent variable, we use R&D as the key right hand side variable -i.e. total BERD from all sources of funds. We take output, employment, wage bill, capital and value added data from the OECD STAN database. We use the level of industry aggregation that maximized the matches between the databases STAN and MSTI, ending up with 26 industries (see below). Data for missing years was linearly interpolated for all variables (between the first and the last year available per country), but no data was extrapolated forward or backwards. These imputations accounted for between zero and 35% of the final sample, depending on the variable. The results are robust to dropping interpolated values. The industry level breakdown of BERD by source of funding was missing for the United States after 2001 in the MSTI because a change in industry classification of the OECD (to ISIC Rev. 3) required a new crosswalk from the industry classification used in the US, NAICS. However, we obtained the original R&D data from the National Science Foundation, Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD), and implemented the crosswalk to our data set, verifying that the totals (all source of funds) by industry matched the totals published by the MSTI. The crosswalk is available on request. Total Factor Productivity, TFP. TFP growth can be measured by a superlative index derived from the translog production function (as in Caves et al, 1982). This results in the following expression for industry-country-year TFP: where real VAikt is value added, Likt is total employment, Kikt is the capital stock, and is the share of labor in value added. Value added is from the STAN database, we use the variable VALK that gives value added in volumes. STAN uses volume indices provided by national statistical agencies that are typically derived by applying detailed deflators based on Producer Price indices (PPIs) or Consumer price indices (CPIs) coming from detailed surveys. Volumes for activity groups are either fixed-weight Laspeyres aggregates or annually re-weighted chained aggregates of the volumes of detailed sectors. Capital stock is given in STAN in variable CPGK, \"gross capital stock (volumes)\". For some countries (e.g. US, Japan, Australia, Norway, Sweden) the capital stock was not available in the STAN database, but investment data was (variable \"GFCK\", gross fixed capital formation in volumes). For these countries, we follow Scarpetta and Tressel (2002) and OECD (1999) and construct capital stock using a perpetual inventory model, which simulates the process of capital accumulation using past investment data that is adjusted for scrapping. Gross capital stock GCSt at time t is: where INVt-j is investment undertaken in period t-j, i.e. with vintage j at time t, and 1-\u03b4j is the survival coefficient that represents the fraction an investment of vintage j that is still in use in year t contributes to gross capital stock in year t. The survival coefficient is between 0 and 1, and falls with vintage. We follow the literature and assume that depreciation follows a delayed linear retirement pattern, where scrapping starts only 5 years after the investment has been undertaken. Average services lives (ASL) are usually used to measure the depreciation process of an investment. If depreciation starts after 5 year and is linear, ASL is given by where n is the time period during which an investment has positive depreciation (and n+5 is the total lifetime of an investment). Thus, with linear depreciation, in each year depreciation equals a constant fraction \u03b4 of past investment (starting after 5 years): = 1 = 1 2 * ( \u2212 5) Gross capital stock can therefore be constructed using the recursive relationship: Since our investment data starts only at the beginning of the sample period and we need past investment for the construction of gross capital stock, we assume that past, unobserved annual investment is equal to average investment across the sample years (separately for each industry within each country). Our results are robust to assuming past investment to be equal to initial observed investment, or average investment across the first observed years. This assumption about past investment can then also be used to calculate the gross capital stock at the beginning of the sample period. Average services lives (ASL) by country and industry are given in OECD (1999), p. 48. For countries without ASL data, we use the US industry-specific ASL. The share of labor in value added is measured in two ways. First, we simply used the industryspecific unweighted average of the wage bill over value added (across all countries and years). Alternatively, we use the Harrigan (1997) smoothing method to construct the share of labor in value added \u03b1ikt, by industry, country and year. For this, we ran a pooled OLS regression of the form where is the observed labor share in value added, are a full set of industry-country pair fixed effects and K and L are capital stock and employment as described above. We then used the predicted values from this regression for the industry-country-year specific share of labor in value added . As robustness checks we also used the overall average labor share in our data, or a constant labor share of 0.65 to construct TFP, but our results were not sensitive to the specification of the share of labor in value added."}, {"section_title": "(A2) French Data", "text": "We use data collected by the French Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research (which for brevity we will refer to as \"Ministry of Research\") for their annual R&D survey from 1980 through 2015. Firms conducting research and development activity are asked to report detailed information on their R&D performance-R&D budget, number of R&D employees, R&D wage bill, number of researchers-and broader firm information-SIREN (firm ID), total number of employees, sales, main industry. The survey seeks to include all large firms that perform R&D and a rotating sample of smaller firms that perform R&D. In particular, firms with R&D expenditures above a threshold are surveyed every year, while a rotating sample of firms below the threshold is surveyed for two consecutive years. The threshold varies over time. For example, in 2007 is was \u20ac250,000 and by 2011 it was raised to \u20ac400,000. For our purposes, the net effect is that there is significant turnover in the sample that we work with among the smaller firms. We observe 40,787 firms an average of 3.9 years each. Almost 40% of firms appear just once; and only 24% appear in five or more years. Missing R&D data and our empirical strategy (firm fixed effects) reduce the usable sample to 12,539 firms appearing an average of 6.5 years each, approximately 56% of which appear in more than five years. Overall, our sample over-weights large firms that conduct significant amount of R&D. We observe 40,787 firms an average of 3.9 years each. However, almost 40% of firms appear just once; and only 24% appear in five or more years. Missing R&D data and our empirical strategy (firm fixed effects) reduce the usable sample to 12,539 firms appearing an average of 6.5 years each, approximately 56% of which appear in more than five years. Defense R&D subsidies. Importantly, the survey asks about R&D subsidies granted under the authority of individual ministries, i.e. Ministry of Research or Ministry of the Armed Forces. We treat all R&D subsidies originating from Ministry of the Armed Forces and its agencies as defense R&D subsidies. Total R&D subsidies. We define total R&D subsidies as the sum of all R&D subsidies (including defense R&D subsidies) originating from any French ministry or government agency. Privately funded R&D. We call the firm's R&D budget less total R&D subsidies privately funded R&D. Industry classification. During this period French industry codes change three times (in 1993, 2003, and 2008) so we use a combination of correspondence mappings and crosswalks, created from firms surveyed under multiple classification systems, to harmonize all 4-digit industry codes to the NAF revision 1 classification in use from 2003-2008. We have 689 4-digit industries, 216 3-digit industries, and 59 4-digit industries. In addition to the variables mentioned above, we also use information on firm sales and employment. In our data the mean (median) sales and employment for a firm-year are \u20ac260 million (\u20ac19.8 million) and 925 (129) workers. Similarly, in 2000 prices, the mean (median) firm-year receives \u20ac576,000 (\u20ac0) in defense R&D subsidies, \u20ac843,000 (\u20ac0) in total R&D subsidies, and expends \u20ac6 million (\u20ac710,000) on private R&D. (A3) Instrument for Defense R&D Subsidies. Our IV is predicted defense R&D. The exact form of the IV depends on the dataset and level of aggregation."}, {"section_title": "OECD data", "text": "The endogenous variable is , government funded R&D in industry i in country k at time t. The IV for industry i in country k at time t is defined as where \u0303 is country k's total defense R&D spending in year t 38 and \u210e ( \u22121) is a weighted average of one-year lagged government defense R&D in industry i as a share of all the government defense R&D in the United States and France, where weights are country-industry-time specific and determined by the similarity of country k's patent technology class distribution to the United States relative to France. For example, for a country k like Japan our implementation of equation A1is: where in this case \u0303 = DefGBAORDkt, is the value of Government Budget Appropriations or Outlays for defense related R&D by country-year from OECD MSTI. 39 Note that we are not using the industry specific values of (for example) Japanese defense R&D subsidies in equation (A2), but rather the Japanese economy-wide expenditure, which reduces the risk that the cross-industry allocation in Japan could be endogenous to current industry-year shock in Japan. The industry variation comes from the first term, a weight that varies by industry, country and year, and that is itself a weighted average of the industry shares of defense spending for the two countries for which we can observe it: France and the US. To construct the weights \u210e for each country k, we start by measuring the similarity of country k and the US or France, respectively, in terms of the distribution of patents across technology classes (which we have for the year 2005 for all countries from OECD from the database \"Patents by 38 Notice that this includes not only defense related R&D subsidies spent by businesses, but also spend by sectors including e.g., universities (called \"government budget appropriations or outlays on R&D\" or GBAORD by the OECD). We do not have aggregate numbers for the business sector only component for all OECD countries (only for France). In Table 3 we conduct robustness tests where we control for non-business R&D to make sure our affects are not being driven by defense R&D carried out in government labs or universities. 39 Ideally, we would like to know the part of business enterprise R&D that was solely related to defense spending and then to break this down into the government and privately financed components, but this is unavailable. In the time series, however, it is likely that increases in DefGBAORDkt are strongly associated with increases the part of public R&D that goes to defense. Our first stages regressions confirm that this relationship is strong in the data. Further, for the US and for France we have a more detailed breakdown and we confirm that the correlation is 0.73 (US) and 0.88 (France). main technology and by International Patent Classification (IPC)\"). More specifically, we calculate the distance between the patent technology classes of one country and the US in the following way: where \u210e \u210e , indicates the share of patents in technology class p in country k (and we define in an analogous way). The weight \u210e , that determines how much weight country k gives to the industry share of the US, is then defined as \u210e = 1 \u2212 + = + The intuition is the following: The weight that country k puts on the US is larger, the smaller the distance between country k and the US, relative to the distance between country k and France. According to this definition, the US gets a weight of 1 for defense shares from the US (same for France), which raises endogeneity concerns for these countries. However, our results are robust to dropping the US and/or France. Using a combination of the specific industry breakdowns of the US and France (instead of Japan's) should again mitigate concerns that the industry allocation of defense R&D could be endogenous."}, {"section_title": "French Firms", "text": "Next, consider our firm-level instrument in France. In this case the instrument is defined as The weight, \u210e 4 , \u210e 4,( \u22121) , is the share of public expenditure on business conducted defense R&D in the firm's four-digit industry (\"i4\") as a share of the three-digit industry (\"i3\") that the fourdigit industry is located in (aggregated up from the firm level data) averaged over the entire sample period. Our preferred method uses a time invariant average because \u210e 4, can be noisy due to the changing year by year stratified random sampling. Further, we define 3, = defi3,t-1 + \u2206\u03063 , where \u2206 is the first difference operator and \u03063 , = defi3,t -deff,t is three-digit public R&D defense subsidies leaving out firm f's defense R&D subsidies. Therefore 3, is close to the \"leave-out mean. The reason for excluding deff,t from the construction of the IV is that the endogenous variable Sf,t is partly composed of deff,t (the other component is the firm's non-defense related part of R&D subsidies). Thus, including deff,t in the IV would lead to a mechanical (and potentially endogenous) correlation between the endogenous variable we want to instrument and the instrument itself. 40"}, {"section_title": "French Industries", "text": "Finally, consider the French industry level analysis. When pooled in the OECD regressions we use equation (A2). However, when we implement the more disaggregated industry analysis of (say Table  4, Panel A) we can disaggregate the IV further.

And 2, = defi2,(t-1) + \u2206\u03062 , is the two-digit defense R&D subsidies leaving out the three digit industry subsidies (\u03062 3, = defi2,t -deff3,t )."}, {"section_title": "Other data details of the implementation of defense IV", "text": "The instrument we use is: = ln (1 + ) We take logarithms as the R&D series is very skewed and we add a dollar due to zeros (there are no true zeros in the OECD data, so this only affects the French data). We check that the arbitrary adding one did not matter in various ways, such as considering the non-logged version, etc. Looking at the weight used in (A4) compared to (A2) (or (A3)), note that we could use the US share of industry instead of the French share. We did consider this, but in order to obtain a concordance between France and the US industry definitions we had to aggregate the industries even further, losing much of the industry granularity of the French data. Note that a practical advantage of our construction of the IV in equation A2is that we do not have industry and time specific variation of public defense R&D subsidies for all out countries in the OECD sample. This was a key motivation for looking at the French data where we can observe defense subsidies at every level from the firm upwards. However, it is also possible to calculate industry specific R&D shares for the US. In the US, we can observe data on individual defense contracts that are made publicly available because of procurement transparency rules. Draca (2013) analyses the millions of defense contracts from the early 1960s onwards and generously shared his data with us. His dataset combines historical military procurement data from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) with company accounts information from COMPUSTAT. NARA procurement data contains all prime military contracts awarded by the Department of Defense (DoD) between 1966 and 2003. Each year comprises around 250,000 different contracts awarded for the procurement of goods and services, with a minimum reporting threshold of 25,000 USD between 1984 and 2003 (the part of the dataset that we use). The data includes a four-digit product code known as the Federal Supply Code (FSC): we use only expenses with product code \"R&D\" as our measure of defense related R&D spending. Draca matched the name of the awardee with the COMPUSTAT database. The COMPUSTAT data include a four-digit SIC industry classification (SIC4) for each company. We aggregated the defense R&D expenses by industry and match the SIC4 industry codes to the (more aggregate) industry classification used in the OECD datasets in order to get a distribution of R&D defense spending across industries in the US. The US defense contracts data ends in 2003, so we assume the US weights remain the same for the last few years of the data. The timing of the data is such that it corresponds to the mid-year fiscal year (September) so that the data is partially lagged. because (i) the tax subsidy has become more generous (a 5% reduction instead of 4%) and (ii) private R&D has risen by more than public R&D. Nevertheless, the qualitative statement that direct funding delivers a better \"bang for the buck\" still holds. Quality of Public R&D. We assume that the social value of public R&D is the same as private R&D. One might argue that public R&D is spent less efficiently than private R&D. On the other hand, the general view is that public R&D is targeted more on the high spillover areasmore basic, more risky, less market stealing, etc. so is likely to be more socially (although not privately) valuable. This would mean we are underestimating the advantage of public funding of R&D. Note that since we assume a dollar of R&D is the same regardless of source, we do not have to take a stand on the impact of R&D on aggregate TFP, etc. Elasticity of R&D with respect to its user cost. The elasticity of one is common in macro studies (and is what we estimate in the paper). However, we could use alternative estimates, and the efficacy of the tax credit scales with this. For example, if we used a value of two (as suggested by the micro study of Dechezlepretre et al, 2019), then the tax credit generates $28 billion more R&D, almost as much as direct funding. One might be concerned, however, that the micro estimates incorporate business stealing and miss the equilibrium R&D price effectsthis means that they overestimate the policy relevant elasticity. 43 On the other hand, our OLS estimates in Panel A of Table 3 are as low as 0.62, suggesting that the tax credits only boost R&D by $8.8 billion. This suggests that direct governments grants are at least no worse than tax credits. Level of the User Cost. We use the latest OECD estimates of the impact of tax credits. The OECD uses \"Warda's B\", which is the tax price element of the user cost (also used in our paper). To convert Warda's B into a user cost we need to multiply it by the sum of the real interest rate plus depreciation (r + d). However, a 1% fall in Warda's B holding interest rates and depreciation constant is the same as a 1% fall in the user cost, so this is a valid calculation. The value of B in our paper (Table 3) is from Thomson (2012). This takes a value of 1.4% in 2006 instead of the OECD's 4%. It is unclear why there is such a difference, but seems better to go with the most recent methods. Clearly, if we use the lower figure then the tax credit becomes even less valuable. Administrative Costs. Tax credits have lower administrative costs than direct grants, but compared to the amounts given out, it is unlikely that these differences would make a material difference to the conclusion. in total R&D is 9.5%) for the foreign country to yield the effect on foreign total R&D, which yields a decrease in total R&D by 0.017%. Table A2 helps again to translate this percentage increase of foreign total R&D into a percentage point increase of foreign total R&D/GDP; for the average country we get a reduction by 0.0002 percentage points in terms of total R&D/VA. Effect on foreign TFP growth. As discussed above, there is both a displacement effect as well as a positive spillover effect. The displacement effect reduces foreign total R&D as shown above. Using Table A10, reduced foreign R&D/value added leads to reduced foreign TFP growth (given by the estimated coefficient on R&D/value added in column (3) of panel A). For example, in the case of the average country, the TFP growth rate falls by 0.00001 percentage points. However, the increase of US total R&D/VA by 0.06 percentage points (as shown above) has positive spillover effects, as given by the coefficient on the international spillover pool estimated in Table A10, panel A, column (3), again multiplied by the distance weight of the US with respect to the foreign country. In the case of the average country, this leads to an increase in the TFP growth rate by 0.0002 percentage points. Since the positive spillover effect dominates the displacement effect, this is also roughly the same as the net increase in the TFP growth rate; and equivalent to the TFP growth rate increasing by 0.028%. So in conclusion, a 9/11 type shock raises TFP growth by 1.5% in the US and an average of 0.028% in the rest of the OECD. This shock, which raised US defense R&D spending by 52%, would result in an additional $37 billion (nominal, PPP adjusted) if it happened again in 2013. According to our estimated increase in the US TFP growth rate, this then leads to an additional $0.9bn GDP per annum in the US, and an additional $0.2bn GDP per annum in the rest of the world."}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 1: DEFENSE R&D AS PERCENT OF GDP IN THE US, GERMANY, JAPAN AND FRANCE", "text": "Notes: This figure shows the defense related, government funded total R&D as a share of GDP.
