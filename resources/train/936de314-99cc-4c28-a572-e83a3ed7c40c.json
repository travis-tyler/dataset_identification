[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Acknowledging the theoretically postulated idea that job performance should not be defined solemnly on achievements of employees, there is an initiative to develop empirically verified scale for assessing the concept of work behaviour that encompasses all activities leading to the final accomplishments. As a matter of fact, existing paradigm of conceptualizing job performance considers wider framework. It includes all behaviours present in work context leading to the specific achievement and describing the way how work has been performed by employee . It analyses not only the results but also the manner of engaging in activities connected with the work process. It also takes into account different behavioural episodes according to the level of relevancy for organizational goals (Motowidlo, 2003). We consider the fact that job performance comprises actions that go beyond the frame of employment`s formal demands. Bialek and colleagues (1977) claim that employees spend less than half of working hours engaged in activities given in their job description. Therefore, work appraisals should not be based on homogeneous, one-dimensional constructs. Rather, a more complex method of assessment that incorporate all key processes involved in achieving the work tasks, should be developed and applied.\nLeadership is a process that captures the attention of many years. According to Bennis and Nanus (1985), there are over 350 different definitions of leadership, as a result of hundreds of studies conducted in the twentieth century. Being a complex managerial activity, leadership can be defined as a process of creating positive change and new values (Grubi\u0107-Ne\u0161i\u0107, 2008), as well as a process of influencing others to work in order to achieve the organization's objectives. Leadership is considered to be a shaping process of individual and group behavior, system of designing and directing teamwork, way of human behavior motivation, communication and negotiation system. Being a change agent, a leader alters the company culture. The change agent should recognize disproportion between the organization size and age, new conditions and organizational culture model. The leader should develop his technical expertise through education and experience, and initiate and monitor organizational changes. For example, organizational culture change implies the leader's activities towards destruction of the old culture elements and promotion of new elements that will form the basis for the new behavior.\nThe Internet has become a part of everyday life and with time it is becoming a necessity in the life of every individual. The Internet is used for a wide variety of purposes: providing information, communication, socialising, business transactions, education and entertainment. It facilitates the interaction between geographically distant individuals, which has contributed to the creation of enormous interactive networks which do not represent only sets of users but settings within which various social activities occur in the virtual environment. An increasing number of online video games have emerged especially on popular social networks which, apart from impressive graphical and technical features, offer the possibility of playing the game in the real time accompanied by the interaction with other players. Internet users visit sites with online games more frequently and stay there longer than on any other web pages (Beak et al., 2004). The data suggest that only in the USA and Great Britain, 120 million people play an online game at least once a week, of which 81 million people play them daily and that the trend increases annually (ISG, 2011). The access to the games is significantly facilitated and encouraged by the development of mobile technologies and the availability of telephones which have the capacity to support the use of wide variety of web applications. Online games in the most general sense represent a virtual environment with an Internet connection and a large number of players. In other words, they are computer games in which the interactions of Internet users are processed by an Internet connection (Ho & Wu, 2012). In the context of social networks such as Facebook, online games mostly represent simple applications easy to use and understand which lay emphasis on mutual cooperation and communication between players and are frequently called social games (Chang & Chin, 2011). Since online game market steadily increases, its economic potential has become obvious. Until recently, online games used to generate income only by advertisements on their pages. However, due to their growing popularity a possibility of direct profit has arisen (Beak et al., 2004). Certain games sell online accounts and take prepayment for participating on monthly or multi-monthly bases (Oh & Ryu, 2007). However, another mode of profit is becoming more frequent. It is made on the games which are essentially free and which are found on social networks. Users do not have any obligation to pay for participation, yet, within the game, they are offered a possibility to purchase various virtual items with real money. Virtual items refer to various types of objects, such as avatars, decorative articles (furniture, clothes, backgrounds, music) or virtual currencies which exist within the game (Lehdonvirta, 2009). Their purpose is the enhancement of the user's profile as well as the improvement of the performance during the game. They usually cost between several cents and several dollars (Kim et al., 2009). This way of charging has proven to be more profitable, due to the fact that it is not obligatory and that free games attract a greater number of users who, on the other hand, are more inclined to spend small amounts of money to buy a certain item within the game if it occurs periodically. Furthermore, it has been indicated that more frequent payments of small amounts of money are related to the extended game usage with respect to paying a long-term subscription which implies spending a large amount of money at once (Nojima, 2007). This way the game attracts a great number of users and establishes a community with a great total paying capacity. Accordingly, a higher profit is earned and the game gains popularity. Numerous Internet companies earn more than 100 million per year in this way (Kim et al., 2009;Oh & Ryu, 2007). The most frequently purchased item is virtual money i.e. currency which is valid within the game and can be used to buy virtual items (Oh & Ryu, 2007). Approximately 50% of users of Facebook, the most popular social network, play social games, of which 2-6% purchase virtual items. Although this percentage is low in relation to the total number of players, the profits of Internet companies are high. Social games industry earned 3, 65 billion dollars in 2010 of which 60% originated from the purchase of virtual items (Crowdpark, 2012). The number of people who buy virtual items has increased in comparison to the period of few years ago and there are indications that the increase will continue in future (ISG, 2011). It is clear that virtual item sales in games have a great financial significance, and most researches which dealt with this topic were focused on marketing and economic aspects (Guo & Barnes, 2009). Customer preferences were examined, most frequently regarding the attributes of virtual items aiming to improve the design, develop the game which will be enticing and position it well in relation to its competitors. So far, a small number of researches have dealt with the purchase of virtual items from a psychological perspective and there is still a lack of explanatory models and adequate measurement instruments in this field (Guo & Barnes, 2009;Lehdonvirta, 2009). There are few data about the psychological factors which underlie the purchase of virtual items with real money. Therefore, the aim of this research is to examine psychological factors related to this phenomenon. Most frequent reasons for playing social games are challenge and leisure. People play games because the process itself is attractive and demands engagement (Prensky, 2002). The games are designed in a way that they tempt users do be engaged in them actively and continuously, provide the feeling of engagement and improvement, ensure a quick and constant feedback, and set goals which are challenging enough to keep the interest but not too difficult to detract users. All of that occurs in a friendly but competitive social environment where users can share their success with friends, call attention to their accomplishment on the leaderboards and thus improve their social status in the virtual community. Considering the social aspect of these games, efficacy at problem solving serves as a criterion for comparison with other players and it is related to the individual's self-esteem. Individuals will participate in the game as long as they perceive that they are able to overcome the obstacles and achieve goals which the game sets. Players will tend to maximise their achievement in the game in relation to others (Voreder et al., 2003). Different researchers suggested categorisations of motives which initiate users into playing online games, based on empirical research. Wood and associates (Wood et al., 2004) distinguish pleasure and relaxation, challenge and excitement as well as social contacts and acquaintance as the most frequent reasons for playing online games. Yee divides motives for playing into three basic categories: achievement, social motive and escapism (Yee, 2006a(Yee, , 2006b. A similar typology of motives is offered by Wu and associates, who distinguish overcoming the challenge, making friends, killing time and leisure (Wu et al., 2008). One of the latest and most comprehensive classifications was suggested by Li who distinguishes seven motivation categories for playing games: applying knowledge and skills, identification with the theme of the game, fantasising, competition, leisure, social interaction and escape from reality (Li, 2012). Perceiving a certain product as useful, valuable in emotional or social sense is assumed to have a great influence on users' decision to purchase some virtual item. In other words, key factors on which the purchase decision depends are the product functionality in the sense of practicality, the emotional reaction which the product enhances and an estimate that it will contribute to the status in the virtual social group (Kim et al., 2009). Certain authors distinguish decorative and functional items: decorative mostly stay in permanent possession and have only aesthetic value, while functional items serve for progression in the game and easier goal accomplishment but they are consumable, which means that the players have to repurchase them (Lehdonvirta, 2009). It is established that the value of a certain item will be evaluated differently depending on the motivation which initiates the individual into participating in the game (Kim et al., 2009). For example, the need for achievement and exploration is positively related to the perceived functional value of the virtual item, which leads to the purchase (Li, 2012). Players mostly want to perform the tasks and goals in the game and they are prepared to pay to accomplish that (Crowdpark, 2012). It is established that the players are actuated to purchase virtual items by advancement in the hierarchy within the game and positioning in relation to playmates, exploration of new content and and adjusting the game to one's own preferences (Kim et al., 2009). Similar findings were also obtained in the study of a popular game -World of Warcraft -which indicate that the main virtual items purchase motivators are customisation and accomplishment (Guo & Barnes, 2012). In one of rare comprehensive studies of a large number of online games, it was established that there are certain differences between the users who purchase virtual items and those who do not in two of four examined game motivation categories. In fact, those who purchase virtual items more often play in need of competition while those who do not purchase them more often play for leisure. It was revealed that there is no difference between users who play for mental exercise or social interaction (ISG, 2011). Even though they are a significant factor, it was established that mere examination of preferences and motivation cannot entirely explain the variations in recurring purchases by the same user. From a business standpoint, the literature and research recognise the significance of user loyalty for generating profit and positioning in relation to competition (Cheng & Chou, 2011). A survey of different website users confirmed that the largest number of Internet users exhibit a tendency towards loyalty to certain web technologies. Loyalty in the context of business on the Internet is defined as a user's preference for a certain web technology and its continuous use. It was established that loyalty is positively related to the probability of repeated purchase (Anderson & Srinivasan, 2003). Since users can choose between various competitive offers which exist on the Internet and can satisfy their needs, loyalty represents a significant factor in generating profit (Cheng & Chou, 2011;Reichhfeld & Schefter, 2000). It was revealed that the active and constant users of a certain game purchase virtual items with real money more often than the ones who are not (Guo & Barnes, 2009;ISG, 2011). On the other hand, there are findings that players who have the need for novelty and who are not committed to a particular game are not inclined to participate in the same online games for long and spend money on them (Nojima, 2007). This study deals with examining the association of virtual item purchase and motivation and loyalty of the players. We attempted to consolidate the findings of previous researches as well as a psychological and IT approach in the perception of this phenomenon. Knowing relevant psychological factors and their effect would facilitate developing online games which would be enticing to users and thereby more profitable. Moreover, regarding the lack of research on this topic in our region, this study has the potential to record all feasible peculiarities of the Serbian sample concerning this phenomenon. Relying on the existent findings, we assumed that there would be significant differences in the type of primary motivation for playing between players who purchase virtual items with real-life money and those who do not. At the same time, we expected that the participants who purchase virtual items would more often be motivated by competition and winning than the ones who do not and that the ones who do not purchase them would more often be motivated by relaxation and entertainment. In view of the lack of clearly formulated theoretical models in this field as well as adequate empirical findings, there were no presupposed specific connections between purchase and other types of motivation for playing. Furthermore, we assumed that there would be significant differences in the level of loyalty to online games between the players who purchase virtual items and those who do not. Specifically, we expected that the participants who buy virtual items would be significantly more loyal.\nOne of the most important characteristics of modern business is that without competent people neither society nor organization can be healthy, so the development of employees is a permanent process and investment in the future of many organizations. In an era of knowledge where strong international competition prevails, Blustein (2006) noticed that the career development which aims at acquiring new knowledge and skills becomes increasingly important as a link between an individual and organization; it becomes the determining degree to which employees are attached to an organization. In order to be successful in the achievement of goals and development, the organization should be focused more on individual goals and interests of its employees, and on arranging, planning and achieving growth by developing its employees. Today, career is a complex concept that modern management is facing. The need to follow worldwide trends because of the globalization poses challenge to employees to care for their education, creativity, and productivity with the aim of positioning themselves in the organization.\nAlthough the method of storytelling as a communication strategy is well known among theorists, there is not many documented research endeavours on the application of these methods during the process of organizational change. ( Simmons, 2001;Wiggins, 2009;Oreg, 2003.) In this paper I will briefly summarize the scope of contemporary research and relevant publications on the corporate storytelling. By doing so, I aim to demonstrate the ways in which the use of storytelling can be an effective form (and even more effective than some other forms) of communication during organizational change. As such, corporate storytelling should secure the support from the employees, especially when it comes to the implementation of strategic goals. In order to demonstrate its power, storytelling will be put in contrast to the traditionally used internal communication channels during the period of organizational change. Research has shown that employees have a greater affinity for changes because of the application of storytelling, mainly due to the fact that stories can be, and often are in this context, associated with their experience and knowledge. Due to the importance of this topic, for both business and academic community, as well as the great interest in this topic and broader research area in general, this paper aims to highlight the specificities of the method of storytelling in organizations, with an emphasis on organizations that are going through the process of organizational change.\nEmergence and diffusion of teams -a particular form of groups brought many novelties upon modern organizations. Although a team is a type of group, it has certain distinctions which need to be taken into consideration when analyzing team effectiveness, as no other form of \"group work\" matches with it perfectly . Vast number of organizations creates teams for different work assignments and there is a widely popular opinion that teams should be a foundation on which organizations build up and develop in the future (Guzzo & Shea, 1992;Kozlowski & Bell, 2003). Considering prevalence of teams in business world, it is important to define criteria of successful teamwork. For more than half a century scientists from different disciplines make efforts to understand and measure that success and effectiveness. Dominant approach in literature regarding team effectiveness is explicit or implicit input -process -output sequence, or some sort of modification of this sequence introduces by McGrath 50 years ago (Guzzo & Shea, 1992). Different combination of inputs initiate team processes (interaction) directed at task accomplishment. Researchers considered many inputs of team effectiveness in the past and got to numerous and often contradictory results. Inputs can be described as factors that enable or shape interaction in teams (Mathieu J. , Maynard, Rapp, & Gilson, 2008), and usually include knowledge, status, personality traits, abilities, experience and demographics. Some authors modified definition of input and added certain organizational (rewards, interdependence, task design, etc) (Gladstein, 1984;Guzzo & Shea, 1992) or contextual factors that influence effectiveness directly (Campion, Papper, & Medsker, 1996;Cohen & Bailey, 1997). Team structure or composition is incorporated element of team effectiveness for more than 50 years (Mann, 1959), and is mostly explored in terms of job related attributes (Webber & Donahue, 2001) and general and specific attributes (Harrison, Price, & Bell, 1998). Research in the field of team structure or individual characteristics of team members are focused on team members' attributes and effects of those attributes on processes, emerging states and outputs. Most common individual characteristics in previous research are: (1) knowledge, skills and abilities; (2) personality traits; (3) attitudes; and (4) diversity. These are explained further in the text based on extensive literature review with the aim to answer the question: \"What makes an effective team member?\"\nThe concept of employee job satisfaction has been the topic of interest for the several disciplines -business psychology, sociology of work, and organizational behavior. Employee job satisfaction is a multifaceted construct, influenced by a number of different intertwined external and internal factors. There are several definitions of job satisfaction that can be found in the literature. Locke (1976, as cited in Saari and Judge, 2004) defined job satisfaction as a \"pleasurable and positive emotional state, resulting from the appraisal of one's job or job experiences\" (page 1304). Brief (1998, as cited in Weiss, 2002) defined job satisfaction from the viewpoint of the positive or negative attitude toward job, and Spector (1997) argued that there are two factors influencing job satisfaction: personal characteristics of an individual and overall job environment. Why is the study of employee job satisfaction important? According to Landy and Conte (2010) job satisfaction is directly related to productivity level, job performance, job turnover, absenteeism, both organizational citizenship behavior and counterproductive behaviours and a number of other different job related outcomes. The existing body of literature indicates that number of different factors can influence employee job satisfaction. Job satisfaction has been theoretically explained within several different theoretical conceptual frameworks: process theories, situational theories and content theories. All three groups of theories explain job satisfaction from the different viewpoints. Process theories such as Porter and Lawler model, look at the values and expectations that influence job satisfaction; the greater the disproportion is between some elements of the work that the individual values (e.g. high wages, opportunities for promotion) and the possibility of achieving this goal, the greater will be the dissatisfaction with the work and vice versa. Situational theories look at the organizational culture and person-organization fit. According to situational theories an individual will adapt his or her behavior to the change in the external environment. Quarstein,McAffee and Glassman (1992) conducted a study in order to test the situational occurrences theory of job satisfaction. The results of the study indicated that a number of situational characteristics and occurrences influenced an individual's job satisfaction. Herzberg's dual factor theory (1957) also looked at the job satisfaction According to this theory satisfaction in the work setting is determined by two separate variables satisfaction and dissatisfaction, which are influenced with the wide range factors. He differentiated two sets of factors -motivators that directly influence job satisfaction and hygiene factors that do not have a direct influence on job satisfaction but their absence results in increase in job dissatisfaction. The content theories take a dispositional approach to the job satisfaction, looking at the wide range of personality variables and how they relate to the job satisfaction. Maslow theory of needs with the need for individual growth and self-actualization viewed as the factor influencing job satisfaction, is an example of an dispositional approach to job satisfaction (Landy and Conte, 2010). A number of different factors influencing job satisfaction in various settings have been researched. All researchers recognized that people and their mutual interaction and synergy are one of the indispensable factors of any institution and organization, strongly influencing the levels of an individual's job satisfaction. Job dissatisfaction has been found to be one of the most important factors influencing employee turnover. However, according to Morison (2004), social support and cohesiveness at the workplace can have a mediating effect on job satisfaction, even when employees are dissatisfied with some other aspects of the job.\nManagement means managing a unique activity in order to achieve targets set by the organization with optimum use of resources. Even though the term management includes managing, planning, organization and control, this paper will focus on managing. Within transactional theory of management , the management is regarded as a two-way, transactional process. A person's manner of managing people is a result of interaction between his/her personality and circumstances defined by hierarchical position within the organizational structure. Based on the theory of roles, a certain management style represents the way a person sees their role in the organization and that role mean strong interaction with other people in the company. The success of entire organization largely depends on management mentality, on their way of thinking about production process issues, on their understanding their own role within the organization, the interpretation of co-workers' behavior... In this paper, special attention is given to attribution style of managers as a relatively consistent and long lasting way of interpreting causal phenomenon, which plays an important role in the cognitive processing of reality. Within his theory of social study Rotter (1966) defines locus of control as 'personality variable that assigns individuals to the degree to which they accept personal responsibility for what happens to them as opposed to assigning responsibility to forces beyond their control'. Attribution style as a relatively consistent and lasting way of affixing causal phenomenon plays an important role in the cognitive processing of reality and as such, has a great significance in efficient management. Joe (1971) and Lefkart (1976) proved that people with dominant internal locus of control overcome life obstacles more successfully and have better orientation. In accordance with Barnes and Seligman (1991), this research looked at attribution style as a character trait, as a person's relatively permanent tendency to interpret causal phenomenon. Hersch and Scheibe, as stated by Fanelli (1977), find that internally oriented examinees show higher degree of dominance, sociability and intellectual efficiency as opposed to externally oriented ones. Another important aspect that has been analyzed is self-confidence; a personality trait important to the successful functioning of managers, which Cohen (1968) defines as 'a compatibility degree between the ideal and the actual self perception'. Self-esteem is a significant dimension of a personal integrity. Position in the organizational structure and the role of the manager necessarily carries a certain degree of latent and manifest power that comes from a given position. Research of power problems within the organization go in several directions. The most common ones are those dealing with problems of efficiency in applying specific types of power in managing people. Based on review of numerous research Podsakoff and associates (Podsakoff, Todor, Grover & Huber,1984) come to conclusion that successful managers base their influence on expert and referent power. There have been only few studies on the topic of connection between need for power and the way of managing. McClelland and Burnham (1976), depending on the function of expressed power on a particular person, differentiate between orientation towards personal power and socialized orientation towards power. People oriented towards personal power have no strong inhibition and self-control, but express their power impulsively. Leaders who use power in order to satisfy personal needs in the first place (the need for self-confidence and status) try to dominate over their subordinates by creating conditions where those people depend on them. Leaders with socialized orientation towards power are emotionally more mature, less focused on themselves, use power in order to satisfy their personal goals and welfare of others as well. Leaders who exercise their power in a socialized way do so in order to develop and build the success of the organization. This paper will try to establish whether managers have an increased level of striving for power and if locus of control and level of self-confidence can be observed as predictors of striving for power among managers of different hierarchical level."}, {"section_title": "THE CONCEPT OF WORK BEHAVIOUR", "text": "Motowidlo (Motowidlo, 2003) believes that there are, at least, two conceptual and practical advantages of observing performance in the context of individual`s behaviour, rather than linked to its results. First, there are some situational factors that modify the effects. Second, there are some psychological processes and principles that govern the course of action during the performance of the tasks. Since performance is expected organizational value of employees` contribution, results are seen as conditions that are changed by it, behaviour is the means of contributing organizational value by changing those conditions (through results). Different conceptualizations of job performance and work behaviour are present in literature. Some of them are relevant for this study and their common qualities are universality and complexity. General definitions enable to include in concept all those behaviours that are not directly connected with concrete work tasks. Also, they cover these behaviours that contribute, as well as those that peril, the achievement of professional and organizational goals. Campbell (1990) has categorized work behaviour according to the direction of influence on organizational effectiveness as: (1) productive, that contributes to the organization, and (2) counterproductive behaviours, that impair organizational, and interests of its members. Accordingly, productive work behaviours are related to the work performance, organizational citizenship behaviour and innovation . On the other side, different definitions of counterproductive behaviour could be integrated in one broad definition that explains it as: \"total expected value to the organization of behaviours that are carried out over a standard period of time with the intention of hurting other individuals or the organization as a whole and that have negative expected organizational value\" (Motowidlo, 2003, 48). Models of work behaviour commonly distinguish behaviours that are closely related to the work tasks and those that accompany performance. So, Murphy (2004) differentiates work behaviour according to the course of impact and its relation to the core activity, on those: (1) closely associated with the task, (2) considering human relations, but also (3) causing absenteeism, destructive and risk behaviours. Waldman and Spangler (1989), for example, develops integrative model of work behaviour that focuses on: personal characteristics (experience, abilities), effects (feedback information, job security) and environmental factors. These models tend to offer valid predictors. Work behaviour on individual level is seen as a consequence of job complexity (task requirements), knowledge and working skills (based on abilities and experience) and employee`s consciousness (personal characteristic) while operating on job . Studies have confirmed that cognitive ability predicts better technical skills and work effort, whereas some personal features are better predictors of contextual work behaviours as discipline (Pulakos, Broman & Hough, 1988). Similar, Borman and Motowidlo (1993) emphasis that there are two sorts of work behaviours: (1) those directly linked with task performance and (2) those called contextual. Task performance considers activities that could be found in formal work description and refers to the working role. Contextual behaviours contribute to the organizational effectiveness due to the psychological, social and organizational work context. So, effects of contextual activities are executed via impact on others, increasing personal willingness to engage at work activities and through activities that has impact on organizational resources. These contextual behaviours serve to ease communication, sustain social interaction, reduce tension and disturbing emotional reactions, and are of highly importance to the issue of team work . Van Scotter and Motowidlo (1996) describe the manner how contextual work activities contribute to the organizational effectiveness by shaping organizational and social environment that facilitate task activities. It is believed that those contributions have general value that is present in every each job and organization, while work activities linked to the task varies from job to job. So, distinction between contextual and activities tightly connected to the task, is of theoretical, as well as of practical significance, due to the fact that they are probably determined by different antecedents. Specific knowledge, skills and abilities are better determinants of someone's behaviour while completing job tasks. On the other hand, dispositional factors are better predictors of contextual work behaviour. Arvey and Murphy (1998) claims that one should be careful with the idea of developing a new construct of contextual work activities. It defines something that is not in the job description, but if we formalize it as part of the job description, then it loses its specificity. However, researches shown that this theoretical construct has its empirical confirmation (Coleman & Borman, 2000). Factors linked to the job task, as well as, contextual ones, independently, contribute to the work outcomes (Barrick & Mount, 2005). Also, it was found that personal variables are in higher correlation with contextual activities (Pulakos, Broman & Hough, 1988). Recognition of the existence of contextual work behaviour, not strongly tied with formal work goal, jet essential for organizational performance, requires some methodologically valid approach of measuring its contribution. Here is an endeavour to include in the scales of measuring job performance contextual aspects and to develop an instrument that could be used in variety of settings by mixing different theoretical concepts."}, {"section_title": "MEASURING WORK BEHAVIOUR", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Theoretical and methodological considerations", "text": "It is not uncommon to assess job performance based on one narrow specific aspect of work activity based on outcome. However, the idea of perceiving job performance as a \"property of multiple, discrete behaviours that occur over some span of time\" (Motowidlo, 2003, 39) is very popular. As a matter of fact, the whole domain of practice, that envelops processes of defining, measuring, assessing and giving feedback with the objective to improve performance, exists. Defining a work process in behavioural terms enables accessing and measuring it. As Nelson and Quick (2006) posted, measuring the work outcome is an activity of appraising appropriateness and effectiveness of someone`s work activities in specific context. Consequently, different conceptions of measuring work behaviour exist. Borman and Motowidlo (1993) are among the first scholars to claim that there are two sorts of work activities both of particular importance for task achievement: operative and contextual ones. Further, authors distinguish five types of those, so called, contextual activities: (1) readiness to voluntarily complete tasks that are not part of the formal job demands, (2) persistence with additional enthusiasm and effort that is necessary for successfully accomplish working goals, (3) supportative actions toward colleagues and cooperation, (4) obeying organizational rules and procedures even when it does not go in one`s behalf, (5) acceptance, support and protect of organizational goals. Coleman and Borman (2000) observe this concept from the empirical point of view and parse it on 27 items from which they extract 3 factors: (1) interpersonal support, (2) organizational support and (3) consciousness and initiative related to work tasks. Those behaviours that are not strongly tied with the formal work goal and often called contextual became an inspiration for many researchers. For example, in case that those actions are not part of the formal system of appraisal and compensation, if they are rather optional and result of employee`s initiative, then it is often seen as the phenomenon of Organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB). It is first introduced by Organ in 1977 to define those behaviours that are not part of the formal job description and that are not prescribed by work role, but rather \"self-initiative behaviour that contributes organizational effectiveness and benefit and that are not directly and explicitly rewarded\" (Organ, 1988, 4). Also, some distinctions are made between OCB directed toward the colleagues (for example, expressing altruism) and toward the organization (consciousness and loyalty). Nevertheless, operationally defining work behaviour is not an easy task. The main problems are its inherent multidimensionality and its dependency on different factors. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly define the subject, the criteria and purpose of appraisal and methods for systematically observing targeted subjects and their behaviour on work. Also, potential predictors, conditions facilitating or aggravating work process, and epistemological problems of assessment (accuracy, reliability and validity), should be considered. Job behaviour is assessed: (1) to determine if a person is suitable for some job (selection), and (2) to determine if a person perform it well (evaluation). Appraisal could be theoretical, informal or highly formalized with significant consequences on compensation, promotion, retribution, dismissing, selection, training, and so on. According to the purpose we chose criteria, methods and sources of assessment. Studies show that there are significant differences in evaluation results in function of measures that are taken as criteria, job that are evaluated, and also of purpose of evaluation (Nelson & Quick, 2006). Although almost 95% of all appraisals in work context are based on evaluations of superiors, it is believed that when evaluating OCB and similar concepts, more relevant evaluators are subordinates and clients. Also, in theoretically inspired researches, self-appraisal is acceptable (Cardona & Espejo, 2002). The question of accuracy is highly dependent not only on criteria but also on the appraiser. On the other hand, reliability depends on phenomenon`s stability which is not the case. It is believed that past work behaviour is a good predictor of future work behaviour but it relies on the factor of experience. So, the concept of dynamic criteria should be introduced, considering the obvious fact that the work behaviour is changing over time. It is also one of the reasons why correlation of two measures of job performance decreases in function of time and it produces the, so called, problem of work behaviour temporal instability (Sturman, Cheramie & Cashen, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Empirical objectives and procedures", "text": "The main objective of this paper was to develop an instrument for measuring work behaviour that is strongly rooted in theory and then verify its practical value and metric features through application. This instrument was conceived as five degree Likert type scale with 27 items. Appraisal of work behaviour is left on performers themselves. It is justified with theoretical goals of the study with no practical implications on subjects what so ever. Inspired by theoretical ideas and methodological experience of other researchers (Slemp, 2013;Kahya, 2007;Coleman & Borman, 2000), we decided to develop an instrument for measuring work behaviour postulated as a wider concept of job performance, based not only on its effects but according to the idea of contextual relevancy. It was expected that it would be able to measure the excellence of work behaviour in totality and in its complexity. The additive nature and capability of instrument to give one single measure is going to be examined by alpha coefficient of internal reliability of the scale. On the other hand, there is also an assumed structure of operationally defined concept that distinguishes at least two categories representing the work behaviour domains. First one considers activities associated with main working processes and therefore items should describe the manner of accomplishing professional tasks. Second indicator should refer to the behaviours only indirectly associated with job tasks. In this context, interaction with colleagues and attitudes toward organization should be taken into account. It is important because it was found that performance is very much dependent on those qualities. The question of how many varieties of contextual activities exist remains open. This postulated structure of work behaviour concept was tested using Factor analysis, precisely, method of Principal components that extracts from original set of items, components that share common variance (Kova\u010di\u0107, 1998). The procedure of testing the instrument was conducted on 100 employees from five Belgrade IT companies. Respondents are all with similar educational background and they are working on tasks of similar complexity and content. Actually, they are engineers employed on positions of IT managers, system administrators and software developers. Gender structure is slightly biased, with 62% of males and 38% of females."}, {"section_title": "Defining scale`s rationales", "text": "Work behaviour self-assessment scale is based on previously mentioned Borman and Motowidlo`s concept of work behaviour (1993), as well as on Coleman and Boreman`s empirical verification (2000). Some items are inspired with popular Organ`s concept of citizenship behaviour (Organ, 1988). Finally, five degree Likert type scale measures work behaviour taking into account: (I) behaviours related to the final job result, although it depends on majority of mentioned factors and as well as on factors we did not include. Here, (2) quality of work is equally important (2 items) as (3) quantity of accomplished tasks (2 items). Further, there are evaluations of episodes of behaviour that are called (II) contextual, explaining the approach to work (manner in which work has been done), implicitly describing employees' attitudes toward job, colleagues and organization. Here, we distinguish between (3) behaviours expressed during the task accomplishment -directly connected with performing working tasks (core activities) (9 items), (4) behaviours referred to the psycho-social (contextual activities) (7 items) and (5) organizational aspects of work (contextual activities) (7 items). Indicators of work behaviour that are directly attached to the job performance refers to the employee`s persistence with enthusiasm, when additional effort is necessary to accomplish the task, regardless the work conditions. It includes taking an initiative to do whatever is necessary to achieve goals even if they are not a part of the regular duties. There are also tendencies to find extra tasks after fulfilling regular obligations, developing individual knowledge and skills by one's own means and resources. Also, accuracy, reliability and goal oriented qualities should be mentioned. Accordingly, we could mention motivational aspects in this context. Psycho-social domain of work behaviour encompasses questions of providing help to co-workers by coaching, advising, replacing and doing some part of their tasks, adjusting to their schedules, offering emotional support, as well as cooperation, courtesy, timely informing, expressing consideration, generating motivation, respect and trust. Finally, it could be seen as related to the organizational citizenship behaviour conception, especially that aspect that is directed toward the one concrete employee (colleague), opposite to the indicators of organizational work side. Behaviours associated with organization contribute to the whole organization by representing organization with good image, voluntary organizational promotion, loyalty even in crisis, consciously supporting organizational mission and goals, willingly obeying organizational rules and procedures."}, {"section_title": "TESTING A WORK BEHAVIOUR SELF-ASSESMENT SCALE (WBSAS)", "text": "Distribution of scores on scale is normal. One sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that we could retain null hypothesis due to the fact that there is no statistically significant deviance from normal distribution (AS=99.81; SD=11.47; N=100; p=.43). Internal consistency for 27 items given in the Likert type scale, was Cronbach`s alpha =.79. It represents the measure of homogeneity and internal reliability (low level of obtained measurement error). This measure could represent the level of excellence of someone`s work behaviour as it is seen by him. This measure could be used in studies as an indicator of work behaviour and it could be associated with other psychological variables, as it is the case with one recent study where it is correlated with satisfaction (Kova\u010devi\u0107, \u010cizmi\u0107, 2012). Nevertheless, it is possible to approach to the instrument as it is a composite of different dimensions that describe the content of the concept. Principal component analysis is mostly used for constructive validation, i.e. comprehension of the structure of operationally defined notion. Intercorellations between manifest variables (27 original items of Work behaviour scale) imply lesser number of latent variables that are extracted with retaining the maximum possible variability at the same time (Kova\u010di\u0107, 1998, 187). Based on Guttman-Kaisser reliability criteria, eight orthogonal components were extracted (varimax rotation). They give approximation of variation structure of original variables. Total explained variance is slightly above 64 %, which is rather satisfactory. Except first component that explains about 10% of total variance, components have almost the same amount of explained sample differences. Percentages of possible variances are given in the Table 1. Componential saturation with the scale`s item is given in the Table 2 and it provide us with the information how this components should be comprehended, as well as how real structure of theoretically conceived composition of scale looks like. First component that explains about 10% of total variance is saturated with items which classification in theoretically defined indicators is rather heterogeneous. Here, we have an item of work quality that overcome the expectations of superiors and work persistence despite the obstacles, but also a high saturation with items provoking enjoyment in informal interactions with colleagues and effort to protect colleagues from personal dissatisfaction, which seems to be mistakenly categorized in organizational aspects. Also, there is a relatively expressed saturation with items that describe a manner of performing task and willingness for professional development. Due to its multiplicity, we named this category (I) The general work behaviour indicator (items: 21, 5, 2, 12, 13, 19). Second component is explained with four items that mainly refer to the relations with colleagues -collegiality and punctuation (meeting deadlines). So, this component is called (II) Collegiality and devotion (items: 16, 6, 15, 11) in contrast with third component that is saturated by items with negative connotation of collegiality and psycho-social aspects: distrust and conflicts with colleagues and unwillingness to help. So it is called (III) Uncooperativeness (items: 18, 17, 14). Fourth component is strictly defined with organizational aspects of work behaviour, expressing positive attitude toward organization and readiness to protect its image and interest. Thus, it is called (IV) Organizational loyalty (items: 24, 25, 26, 27). These items could be incorporated with the organizational aspect of the concept of organizational citizenship behaviour. Fifth indicator is highly saturated with two items referring to the quality and quantity of work done, so we named it as (V) Efficiency and effectiveness indicator (items: 1, 4). It is almost opposite to the component defined by items indicating tendency toward absenteeism that is labelled as (VI) Skiving indicator (items: 10, 9, 20). Seventh factor is not consistent. There is an item articulating indifference and lack of information toward the organization and organizational public representation and an item about the quantity of work done that goes beyond average. We called this factor (VII) Organizational indifference (items: 22, 3, 23). At the end, eighth component is characterized by willingness to work overtime and undertaking tasks that goes beyond one`s responsibility. So, it is a question of (VIII) Personal conscientiousness indicator (items: 8, 7). "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "Learnt componential structure of instrument could be improved by analysing the saturations of components with representative items, expecting to, by removing or replacing some items attain higher internal consistency and better explanation of the concept. As a matter of fact, this operational definition of work behaviour could give a good insight to the real content of the notion. It indicates that it is a subject of complex composition that integrate some personal aspects as conscientiousness trait (VIII), attitude toward organization (IV, VII), motivation and inclination to counterproductive behaviour (VI, III), as well as organizational citizenship like behaviours (II, IV). Also, there is a measure of efficiency and efficacy as the description of finial result (V). There is also a general factor of job performance with the highest impact on work behaviour`s variance and on evaluation (I). This general factor could be seen as if it expresses the manner how the work is done. It explains mainly contextual activities. Finally, we might see this operationally defined work behaviour concept in the theoretical framework of Borman and Motowidlo (1993) where there is an distinction between task and contextual behaviours, with the conception of Borman and colleagues (2001) who categorized job performance into a personal, organizational support and conscientious initiative. Consciousness is also a predictor of job performance in Barrick an Mount`s (2005) model of performance. We should not forget the Organ`s (1988) concept of organizational citizenship behaviour and Coleman and Boreman`s (2000) methodological endeavours. Afterwards, there is an idea for further researches based on this conception trying to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modelling similar to the existing contemporary attempts where the idea of proactive approach to job is considered (Slemp, Vella-Brodrick, 2013). As a matter of fact, those researchers distinguish three domains of crafting: task, cognitive and relational, with the idea to introduce three factorial concept of job performance and correlate them with relevant variables. Similarly, Kahya (2007) proposed a concept of following dimensions: task performance, interpersonal and organizational citizenship and job dedication, associated with criteria of physical effort, environmental conditions and hazards. Although scale could be considered applicable according to the fact that its structure relatively coincides with expected theoretical structure of the concept, the question of its final composition remains open. As a matter of fact, validity of the concept is not yet systematically analysed and due to the fact that it considers multiple correlations with different related instruments and real behaviour observations, we left this important metric aspect for future researches. Also, objectivity issue could be examined by correlating the results gained by self-assessment and assessments from other sources. There is also a potential for gender issue to take into consideration and the question of different job characteristics.\nThe obtained results support the hypothesis that the users who do not purchase virtual items are more often primarily motivated by leisure than the users who purchase them. This finding, as well as the absence of significant differences when the intellectual and social motives are considered, is consistent with the results of the ISG research (2011). Moreover, the results support the hypothesis that the players who pay are more loyal. As opposed to that, the results did not confirm the expectation of significantly more frequent presence of competition as a primary motive among players who purchase virtual items. One of the possible reasons for the absence of the expected outcome is the type of the games included in the research. Both games are knowledge quizzes and competitive element is inevitably present during every playing. The players aim to give the correct answer or accomplish a task before the other player who is playing simultaneously. At the end of each segment, the achieved results are compared, and at the end of the whole game one of the players is declared the winner. Since the games of this format are almost impossible to play without an element of competition, it is likely that they attract competitive users more than the other games in which this element is possible to avoid. In that case, variations in decision to purchase virtual items couldn't be explained by competitiveness but other factors, such as, for example, loyalty or users' financial capability. The finding that users who pay are more loyal is consistent with the results of previous research (Guo & Barnes, 2009;ISG, 2011;Reichhfeld & Schefter, 2000). Prensky postulates the existence of a two-way association between these variables: the players who invest money in the game will not tend to give up their investment. Continuing the game, the players will be able to ascertain the progress after a certain time and gain the impression that the invested money has paid off, which will encourage them to keep spending and investing in the game (Prensky, 2002). Further research which would deal with this topic should consider the type of the game when examining the association of motivation and paying. Previous research established the association of paying with competitive and leisure motive (ISG, 2011). While every game can represent leisure to people who play it, the same does not apply to competition. In some games competition is inevitable (quizzes, card games and other games in which there are an unambiguous winner and loser), in some it represents a matter of choice (the games in which interaction with other players is optional) while in others this element is minimal or nonexistent (real life simulation games in which there is not an outcome to achieve, but the emphasis is on expressing individuality and creativity). It would be interesting to examine which variables best explain the variations in paying in games which are at the ending points of this continuum, i.e. in cases when the variability of the competitive motive is reduced to minimum (almost inevitable in one and almost non-existent in the other case). Furthermore, in future research, more salient information could be obtained if the participants are not asked to decide on their primary motive but allowed to estimate the degree of presence of different types of motives. In that way, we would have an insight into possible influences of different combinations of motives on virtual item purchase. Moreover, we could obtain additional insights by checking whether there is an association between loyalty and a certain type of motivation for playing, i.e. whether the players primarily led by one type of motives are more loyal than the players led by different motives. This finding can have implications for further development of online game industry. Since users' loyalty is one of the key factors in generating profit (Cheng & Chou, 2011;Reichhfeld & Schefter, 2000), it is expected that the developers of online games will attempt to make their products attractive for a large number of people. Possible revelation of the association of loyalty and motivation type could influence the design of future games and lay emphasis on the elements within the game which can satisfy a certain type of motivation. Kim, H. W., Kooh, J., & Lee, H. L. (2009, July  In this paper, main characteristics of the process of development of employees' careers is studied from the aspect of personal indicators in order to identify which personal factors set the direction of career development which contributes to more successful personal and professional development."}, {"section_title": "PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "The correlation between personal characteristics and leadership marked theoretical approaches to leadership in the early twentieth century by the theory of the Great Man, which evolved into the trait theory of leadership. The term trait is widely used to emphasize human attributes, including ability, motives or behavioral patterns. The trait theory of leadership does not make assumptions about whether leadership traits are inherited or acquired. It simply asserts that leaders' characteristics are different from non-leaders' ones. At the beginning of the twentieth century, psychological study, and later there were numerous discussions on trait approach, including Cowley's (1931), which summarized the views of trait theorists in the leadership approaches. The trait-based approach was challenged in the middle of the last century when, after a thorough examination of literature, a prominent theorist Ralph Stogdill concluded that a person could not become a leader by possessing a combination of traits. Trying to discover the character traits of leaders, the researchers within this theory group (Stogdill, 1948) used the two approaches, namely: comparison of the personality traits of leaders and non-leaders, and of successful leaders and unsuccessful ones. According to the first approach, studies have shown that, as a social group, leaders are generally smarter, more open and more self-confident than non-leaders. However, there are some divergences because there are people who possess all of these psychological traits, yet never become leaders. Stogdill believed this because the research showed that no traits were universally associated with effective leadership, whereas situational factors were also influential. It has been shown that the traits are of great significance. Six traits on which leaders differ from non-leaders are the following: drive, desire to lead, honesty and integrity, selfconfidence, cognitive ability and business knowledge. Despite a series of good assumptions defining the trait theory of leadership, the research results related to the personal qualities and leadership were inconsistent and often disappointing. The literature review leads to the conclusion that the trait approach has been abandoned among leadership researchers. Zaccaro, Foti, and Kenny (1991) noted that trait explanations of leader emergence were generally regarded with little esteem by leadership theorists. The primary source of skepticism towards the trait approach is often associated with Stogdill's (1948) influential statements. Although Stogdill detected consistent relationships, he concluded that leadership was not a matter of passive status or mere possession of certain combinations of traits. As Bass (1985) noted, after Stogdill's examination, the analysis of the specific situations was a dominant factor. Indeed, Hughes, Ginnett and Curphy (1996), commented that any trait effect on the leadership behaviour would depend on the situation. Even today, with a renewed interest in various explanations of attitudes and behaviour, there remains pessimism about the relationship between trait variables and leadership. House & Aditya (1997) concluded that there were few traits associated with the effective leadership. Reviewing the literature on theories of personality traits, Bass (1985) noticed two distinct questions: which traits distinguish leaders from other people and what is the magnitude of those differences? Despite the considerable research on this topic in the past century and previous meta-analytic views, (Lord et al., 1986), surprisingly little consensus has emerged to respond the two questions raised by Bass. Leaders must gather, merge, and interpret large amounts of information. These requirements are higher today than ever because of rapid technological change. Therefore, it is not surprising that leaders must be intelligent enough to design appropriate strategies, solve problems and make correct decisions. Charisma, creativity, originality and flexibility are qualities with a little less clear evidence of the leadership importance. Effective leaders may be charismatic, but this feature may be important only for political leaders. Effective leaders can be more creative than others as well, but there is no consistent research that proves it. Flexibility and adaptability may be important features in the present turbulent environment. Leaders must be able to make decisions and solve problems quickly, and initiate rapid changes. Effective leaders are proactive. They make choices and implement actions that lead to change, rather than just react to changes and wait for things to happen, they show a high level of initiative. Instead of sitting and waiting in vain for fate to smile upon them, leaders should challenge the process. Leaders are oriented towards achievements; they are ambitious, energetic, persistent and proactive. They have a relatively strong desire for achievement, which becomes the motive for further engagement because it draws satisfaction from the successful performance of ongoing tasks, excellence standard achievements and development of better ways to get things done. To maintain a high drive for achievement and progress, leaders must have a lot of energy. Achievement motivation is caused by a range of mutually conditioned factors, like personal characteristics (attitudes, needs, interests, aspirations, abilities, personality traits, internal motives), but also the job type and characteristics (type of work, degree of self-control, responsibility, autonomy, complexity of work, creativity). Working long, intense work weeks for years requires an individual to have a psychological, mental and emotional vitality. Leaders, as opposed to non-leaders, have much more strength and endurance, and generally are active, vital and constantly in motion. Leaders possessing willpower and persistence are better at overcoming obstacles than the others. Research shows that leaders have a strong desire to lead. Leadership motivation includes a desire to influence others and is often equated with the need for power. People with high leadership motivation think a lot about influencing other people, winning arguments and being a greater authority. They prefer a leadership rather than a subordinate role. Willingness to take responsibility, which coincides with leadership motivation, is another trait that can be seen in leaders. The psychologist Jon Bentz (in Kirkpatrik & Locke,1991) describes successful leaders as those who have a powerful competitive drive for the position, authority, and need to be recognized as people of influence. Effective leaders empower others to increase their own power. They do not see power as something that is competed for but rather as something that can be created and distributed to followers without diminishing their own power. Successful leaders should be ready to implement power over subordinates, tell them what to do and appropriately use positive and negative sanctions. Leader with a personal power motive seeks power as a target in itself. These individuals have little selfcontrol, are often impulsive and focused on collecting evidence of personal prestige. Gaining power only for the purpose of dominating others may be based on self-doubt. A leader of a socialized power motive uses power as a means to achieve desired goals or a vision. Its use is expressed as the ability to develop networks and coalitions, gain cooperation with others and resolve conflicts in a constructive way. Individuals with a socialized power motive are more mature than those with a personalized power motive. They exercise power more for the benefit of the whole organization and are less likely to use it for manipulation. These leaders are also less defensive, more willing to take advice from the experts and have a longer-range view. They use their power to build up the organizations and make them successful. The socialized power motive takes into account the followers' needs and results in empowered, independent followers. Self-confidence plays an important role in decision-making and gaining the trust of others. Obviously, if the leader is not sure of what decision to make, or expresses a high degree of doubt, then his followers are less likely to trust him and be committed to the vision. Not only matters the leader's self-confidence, but its perception in others. Often, leaders engage in impression management to maximize their image of competence; by projecting self-confidence they enhance the confidence of the followers. Self-confident leaders are more assertive and determined, which gains the confidence of others in decision-making. This is essential for the effective decision implementation. Even when decisions turn out to be incorrect, the selfconfident leader admits the mistake and uses it as an opportunity to learn, often by building confidence in the process. In order affect employee motivation, the leader must be intrinsically motivated, and know how to motivate others by rewards and punishments, based on a good distribution system of earnings, applied consistently and relied on the results of performance appraisals."}, {"section_title": "3.BIG FIVE AND LEADERSHIP", "text": "Overall, the results of meta-analysis show that Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Openness, Agreeableness and Neuroticism are useful traits or characteristics in relation to leadership. Collectively, the results support the importance of the five-factor model in the study of leadership. Previous studies do not withstand the test of time, but there is an idea of not only which traits are relevant, but also why that is so. Is Neuroticism negatively related to leadership, since the neurotic individuals are less likely to be found in leadership positions, because they are less inspired, or because they have lower expectations of themselves or others? Similarly, Extroverts may be related to leadership because they are more willing to talk, while talk and garrulity are strictly related to leadership emergence. Alternatively, it may be that others implicitly expect leaders to be extraverted. Implicit views of leaders expect them to be sociable (outgoing) and assertive (forceful, aggressive, aspiring). Extraverts could be better leaders due to their expressive nature or the contagion of their positive emotionality. The authors used the five-factor model as an organizing framework and meta-analyzed 222 correlations from 73 samples. Overall, the correlations with leadership were Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Results indicated that the relations of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness with leadership generalized in that more than 90% of the individual correlations were greater than 0. Extraversion was the most consistent correlate of leadership across study settings and leadership criteria: leader emergence and leadership effectiveness (Judge, Bono, Ilies, Gerhardt, 2002). Open individuals may be better leaders because they are more creative and are divergent thinkers, because they are more willing to take risks, while their tendencies for esoteric thinking and fantasy (McCrae, 1996) make them more likely to be visionary leaders. Agreeableness may be weakly correlated with leadership because agreeable individuals tend to be passive and compliant (Graziano & Eisenberg, 1997) but can also be helpful. Conscientiousness is correlated to leadership because conscientious individuals have integrity and engender trust so they excel at process aspects of leadership, such as setting goals (Hogan et al., 1994). Communication of a leader is a balanced, harmonized communication, first with itself, with its own emotions, and then with other people. Most psychological theories agree that it is impossible to build adequate communication with others, if own dilemmas are not, before that, recognized, clarified and established. And, on the other hand, it is important to avoid reluctance to admit those dilemmas in front of others and constantly look for solutions which can be achieved. The high level of successful communication with oneself means accepting yourself, not worshiping oneself, but realistically accept oneself and it implies a willingness to work on oneself, self-confidence, self-esteem, self-control... Personal integrity is a consolidated functional activity of a number of traits, skills, and abilities that make up a harmonized whole. The integrity is manifested in the behavior in which the words do not differ substantially from the work and thoughts of conduct. The value system that people of integrity have is stable and based on sincere beliefs that were adopted without calculated needs. Work on oneselves integrity means working to unify different image of oneself, such as the ones that our family, friends, acquaintances or enemies have."}, {"section_title": "4.CONCLUSION", "text": "In the process of leadership, the relationship between leaders and employees is established through work and action, i.e. through action and results, and not through command and control or hierarchical dominance and subordination, which are related to the traditional leadership model. In modern societies with advanced technical and technological bases, organizational structures and cultures permeated by psycho-sociological aspects, the phenomenon of leadership is very important. Most of leadership theories unreservedly accept the attitude that performance and satisfaction of followers are the outcomes of the leader's actions. The important feature of attributive approach is to warn us of the possibility that leadership is only an illusion, or, perhaps, a mere belief. Companies need leaders who do not try to anticipate the future so much as create it. New organizations require different management and a new employee.

The games involved were two popular online games. By type, they are knowledge quizzes and also include elements of social interaction. After accessing the game, a pop-up window appeared inviting the players to participate in the research. The research was in the form of a short questionnaire with multiple choice closed-ended questions. As recompense for research participation, the participants received a certain amount of virtual currency which is used in the two games. In order to control giving random answers, the participants who completed the questionnaire faster than two seconds per question on average were excluded from the analysis. Given that there are numerous various types of motivation for playing in the literature, in order to establish which types of motivation are the most prevalent among the users of this type of games, a pilot research was conducted on a random sample of 50 users. The participants were asked open-ended questions which demanded that they specify the main reasons why they play online quizzes. By content analysis, the answers were classified into four categories which could comprise the largest number of answers. Those categories are: 1) competition; 2) intellectual motive; 3) social motive; and 4) leisure. Competition includes motives which are related to pleasure in competing with other people, achieving victory and accomplishing a high ranking with regard to other players. Intellectual motive is related to desire for knowledge acquisition and improvement as well as for practising cognitive functions such as attention, memory, deduction and similar. Social motive comprises desire for meeting new people and socialising with acquaintances and friends by playing the games. Leisure relates to the desire for boredom elimination, relaxation and entertainment. After we described these four types of motivation, we asked the participants to select among them their primary motive for playing the games. Subsequently, the participants were asked to complete a short questionnaire specially designed for the purpose of this research which examined their level of loyalty to the game. The questionnaire consisted of Likert items where the total score was taken as a loyalty measure. Purchase was operationalised as a dichotomous variable. Information about whether each of the participants uses real-life money for virtual item purchase within the game is automatically registered from the administrators' database of the games included in the research. Given that, according to different researches (Crowdpark, 2012;ISG, 2011), players who purchase represent a very small part of the total population of players, the sample is composed of an equal number of players who purchase and players who do not in order to facilitate comparison of these two groups.

Namely, there are significantly more participants who do not pay for virtual items with real-life money among the ones who indicated leisure as their primary motive for playing. In order to test the hypothesis that there are differences in loyalty between users who purchase virtual items and the ones who do not, analysis of variance was conducted on the data (ANOVA). By Levene's test, it was established that the homogeneity of variance condition of the dependant variable (loyalty) was satisfied, W (1, 998) = 0.45, p>0.05.

Casto (2000) claims that career should be viewed as permanent development of personal competences in order to secure employment opportunities and remain satisfied with the job, as well as to be prepared for making decisions and taking responsibility during one's career. Arnold (2001) sees employees as the capital which must be constantly encouraged, directed, and provided with opportunities for growth; he points out that training given at work place is one of the most popular forms of management development. Bacanli (2006) claims that the organizations which learn and overcome the obstacles in the process of learning create conditions for development and engagement of all individuals. Development of career in modern business is a big challenge for individuals because there are no standards but just a few regulations that can be regarded as guidelines. Individuals primarily take responsibility for career development, education and training. This leads to interest in education and professional development of employees because it is necessary to constantly encourage employees by creating individual feeling of self-actualization and actual purpose of participation in business collaboration.

Career planning helps individuals to understand their personal goals and aspirations and their own identity, t o m a k e decisions based on information, t o be committed to what they do and to control the changes in their career, both planned and unplanned changes. Thus, it is important to consider a synthesis of biological (hereditary) and social (acquired) characteristics of a person because they build physical, mental, sensor, psychomotor and other biological properties, knowledge, skills, habits and social characteristics (Palmer,2004). Career has both subjective and objective dimension. Subjective dimension is related to attitudes, interests and motives of individuals, and objective dimension is related to the conditions provided by organization, workplace structure and advancement criteria."}, {"section_title": "INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL FACTORS ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF EMPLOYEES", "text": "Every organization, regardless of the nature of its business, is composed of members of that organizationindividuals. The employee is expected to take an active role in the organization in order to control his/her career and its development successfully. It is the individual who should draw the organization's attention to his/her needs and aspirations, and who should be active in looking for the ways to fulfill them. Career development of an individual is not necessarily connected to a single organization. According to Spencer and Harris-Bowlsbey (2014), every employee in an organization is the instrument that organization uses for achievement of its goals. Likewise, employees should see the organization as their instrument to achieve the goals related to their professional development and advancement. The best way to achieve mutual goal is when personal professional goals are similar to those of the organization. In order to analyze the organizational processes and functioning of an organization, the behavior of individuals who work in that organization should be analyzed first. By observing the behavior of each individual, certain characteristics that this person exhibits in community can be seen. People behave differently inside an organization, and those differences are mainly due to differences in their personalities. That is why it is of utmost importance for the management to define and be aware of the characters of all employees. Apart from understanding the behavior of someone, it is also important for the management to accept the fact that everyone is different, and to match the job with person as much as it is possible. Also, it is necessary to recognize person's characteristics and dimensions which will influence the development of employees and use the potential of other employees. When planning career development, the basis for that plan is person's characteristics. In the beginning, both employee and organization need to familiarize themselves with the strengths and weaknesses so that they could adjust the development to those strengths and weaknesses. Behavior and profile of an organization are the result of relation between personalities and behavior of its members."}, {"section_title": "Personality and personal characteristics", "text": "Personality is commonly defined as a unique combination of characteristics of a person, seen from this person's behavior and communication with other people. The most important fact is that it is a combination of characteristics which single this person out from other people in his/her surrounding. Also, another important fact is that the person's character is formed and expressed during the interaction with other people. Those interactions in someone's life create this person's character but they also serve us for evaluation of someone's personal characteristics. Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, Barick (1999) noticed two basic factors of personality are inheritance and environment where person is maturing, as well as the situations this person has experienced. \uf0a7 Inheritance includes factors which influence personality by birth. Those are physical qualities, gender, temper, energy level, biorhythm, etc. Genetic inheritance is an important factor in this group. \uf0a7 Environment includes several factors which influence the personality. This group includes those influences that occur during one person's growth and development. Those are family (as the most important factor shaping one's personality), belonging to certain social group (social class, profession), and belonging to a nation and national culture. \uf0a7 Situation is not as important as inheritance and environment but sometimes it can be of huge importance to person's development. The influence of a situation is more of a correction type because it can rarely create a characteristic if a person does not already have it, but it can emphasize some hidden characteristic that this person has not been aware of. Most personality research has been focused on discovering characteristics and personality traits. Personality traits are permanent characteristics which describe the behavior of a person. The Big Five Model gives the most significant classification of personality traits and characteristics according to John & Srivastava (1999). After a long research of several thousands of characteristics, five basic dimensions were selected based on which all characters can be distinguished. 1. Extrovert-introvert (sociality or openness) -degree to which person is sociable and satisfied with relationship with other people. Extrovert people are sociable and open, communicative and friendly towards other people. Introvert persons, are unsociable and closed people, and they are less willing to take part in social interactions. 2. Amiability -this dimension refers to: cooperativeness, warmness and trust, but on the other hand it is also marked with antagonism, coldness, doubt. This trait shows tendency of a person to be agreeable and keep good relationship with others. 3. Consciousness-this dimension shows reliability and trust, but on the other hand it also shows disloyalty and distrust. This trait describes a person who is careful, scrupulous and persistent. 4. Neuroticism -this dimension, on the one hand, shows emotional stability, safety and calmness, and on the other hand it shows nervousness, uncertainty, depression. People who are adjusted or emotionally stable are calm, stable, relaxed and feel safe. 5. Openness-this dimension of personality shows creativity, originality, curiosity, openness to new experiences, imagination, and un-conventionalism and risk proneness. At the other end of this dimension, there is closeness, conventional person, conservatism, lack of imagination, aversion towards risk. One of the well known classifications of personality types is the one defined by Judge et al.,(1999). They observed dimensions of personalities in the context of their development. He determined that every person's personality was developed from immature to mature based on certain dimensions.  determined that this development occurred in cycles and not continuously, and he set the hypothesis about those cycles: up to the age of 18, from the age of 18 to 30, from 30 to 45, and from 45 onwards. Dimensions of mature and immature personality can be seen in the following table: "}, {"section_title": "Matching of personality and job", "text": "According to the description and dimensions of personality, it can be concluded that people are different and that individuals cannot be categorized as being better or worse for some jobs (Judge & Bono, 2001). The fact is that all people are different. However, we cannot say that employees' characteristics are not important for an organization. According to Holland's theory, although all characteristics of people are legitimate, they have to be adjusted to the work that employees do. Although all personality traits are equal they are not equally good for all positions. Matching of personality traits to job requirements increases both productivity and job satisfaction. In case that a manager forces an employee to do the job which requires personality that is totally opposite of the personality of that employee, the employee will be dissatisfied and frustrated regardless of the fact that this type of job can be attractive to someone else. According to Holland's theory, there are 6 main personalities which have corresponding jobs. Realistic -prefers to work in the field of civil engineering, agriculture, architecture; Investigative -prefers the following jobs: biologist, chemist, dentist, vet, programmer; Artistic -prefers the jobs of: artist, musician, poet, interior designer, writer; Socialprefers jobs of: social worker, counselor, police officer; Conventionalprefers jobs of: teller, clerk, typist, data input; Enterprisingprefers jobs: lawyer, business director, politician, TV producer."}, {"section_title": "Career and working styles", "text": "1. Perfection -people who set goal to work perfectly and to be perfect must not make mistakes and in that way they renounce their right to be average. This person strives for perfection in one aspect of life which is important for him/her or in more aspects. The person devotes a lot of energy to these aspects, which is why it is difficult for him/her to perform other activities. Perfection can be comparative, which means that an individual wants to be better than the others, or non-comparative, when an individual does not compare himself/herself with the others but tends to be the best at what he/she does. Perfectionists are not productive because they waste considerable time irrationally on achieving good results for something that is not necessary. These people can suffer from obsessive disorder or depressive disorder. They need help in order to be able to develop the personality which they can use to distinguish between optimum and maximum. 2. Strong personality -these people tend to show their strengths and not weaknesses, they are proud of their persistence, strength and resolution. This type of behavior is common in our country where life has been cruel to people and they are exposed to danger of not being able to ever lead better lives. These people prepare themselves for cruel life and in that way they renounce the right to enjoy. They often develop antisocial personalities; they have paranoid tendencies and suffer from psychosomatic disorders. 3. Arduous work -these people work constantly regardless of the fact whether their work is visible or not to other people and in that way they pose limitations on going on holidays and having fun. People often choose this type of work when they want to avoid pessimistic mood, loneliness and boredom. These people are afraid of being rejected and do not allow themselves to have rest. They often suffer from chronic fatigue, heart attack due to being extremely tired, spine problems, depression (Katic et al.,2013). 4. Pleasing-these people stick to the principle that they should not oppose the others and have to fulfill their wishes. There are two extremities: according to the first extremity, the imperative is to please the other people and according to the second extremity, the imperative is to please them. This type of person is narrow minded and often looses social power, avoids conflicts by withdrawing from a conversation with other people and remains separated from her/his wishes. Due to their behavior, these people are often in danger of suffering from depression and psychosomatic disorder. These people should be persuaded to realize that they are not responsible for the other people's feelings and that their wishes are very important. The model of assertiveness training can influence on the changes. 5. Speed -the imperative of speed is of particular importance in urban western societies. An individual is extremely fast and effective in everything he/she does, but he/she can easily become bored. These people believe that normal and low work rates are undesirable. The basis here is productivity and efficiency. These people are limited because they have problems with handling all social situations where things are performed at normal or low work rates. These people choose professions which require speed such as journalism, television, stock market, medicine. They are constantly exposed to stress and there is an increased risk of suffering from hypomania, psychosomatic disorder and cardiovascular diseases. The most important for these employees is the fact that they have to behave in accordance with their nature because in that way they will feel better and have right attitude about themselves and the environment around them."}, {"section_title": "Personal values", "text": "Personal values represent beliefs that certain modes of conduct or existential conditions are desirable from personal or social aspects in comparison to the opposite modes of conduct or conditions. Therefore, values represent an ideal condition or mode of conduct which we are striving for. Values show what people believe is good and what is bad. Every value has content and intensity. Content of value shows the things that people believe are good and important, and intensity shows how good and important those things are. An individual system of values is developed when individual's values are ranked based on importance and then connected. The value system shows the values which are important for individuals and the values which individuals believe are good and which are bad, as well as which values are important, less important and the relationship between them. As such, individual value system is the best in showing predisposition of an individual to behave in a certain way. Values develop in early childhood and they are set early in people's lives. Family is a factor which has the largest influence on the development of values in every person. Apart from the family, environment also affects development of values.  noticed values are rather stable and difficult to change. The reasons for this are: they are set in early childhood which makes them resistant to changes, and, over the time, they are placed into sub consciousness and people keep them even when they are not aware of that; alteration of values requires radical change of people's attitudes about the world, which is rare and difficult."}, {"section_title": "Locus of control", "text": "It defines the extent to which people believe they can control their own destiny.

On the other hand, some people believe they do not have the control over their lives and they are affected by activities of the other people or destiny. They have external locus of control because they feel that their lives are beyond their control. In organizations according Blau (2011), those who have external locus of control are, as a rule, less satisfied with job, more absent from work, less dedicated to work and have strong tendency to obey orders and authority.

People, their needs, preferences, motivation and satisfaction become the center of attention in business, considering the fact that we have come to the conclusion that human capital represents major tool of the competitors' abilities and advantages on the global market. Personality represents complex psychological structure which requires knowledge in personality psychology so that their career development could be affected. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the analysis of psychological traits of employees that affect their careers. Assessment of personality by using five-factor model of personality provides information on significant personality indicators that affect job performance. Adopted attitudes of employees, that are seen through locus of control, attitudes, working styles, self-esteem, self-observation, and employees' expectations are conditioned by personality traits, which further leads to assuming the responsibility for career management. Strengthening of organizational culture and climate, in order to establish criteria, is necessary, as well as establishing the criteria for employees' development so that employees could build portfolios of their own achievements and abilities. Business reason for the mentioned concept lies in the productivity of employees which is the result of more realistic dedication of employees to the career development.\nNow we can return to the question how people perceive functionality of democracy and whether they are satisfied with the situation and do they support the democratic process and democratic institutions. From the findings we can see that the authoritarian legacy burden the conscience of citizens of Serbia greatly, and in particular the examined population -university students. Confirmation of this was seen in the finding that the majority of respondents believe that the best global management model is technocracy. This leads us to the conclusion that our society still does not have a fully developed and mature political culture since the people are still inclined to accept (personalized) authorities that are ultimately reflected in the state and the holders of state power rather than citizens and their associations. Technocratic system can be considered as a transitional form between classical authoritarianism, which may be embodied in personalized authority or in authoritarian institutions such as the army in a very limited context, and democracy which is represented with the government and the parliament elected in free elections. In this case it is masquerading as professional competence of their carriers so that it can be easily uncritically accepted as a system of governance which is better than authoritarian personnel governments or military administration in periods of turbulent social upheaval which also impairs the democratic nature of the social system at the same time. The problem is that a technocratic government is not the same as a democracy. Technocratic government and management of society is just one more model of authoritarian rule. The difference compared to other authoritarian models is that the technocrats hide behind the professional competencies what inspire some confidence, but it does not mean that there is an existential interest of experts to work for the common good. Technocrats are not controlled by numerous mechanisms of broader social control backed by the citizens. Technocrats are controlled by centers of alienated social power and behind them can stand very different authorities. The expansion of political freedom (democracy) achieves different effects on economic growth (Barro, 1999). The positive thing is that democratic institutions enable control of the government, which limits the potential of public servants to accumulate personal wealth or to do the unpopular policy. Negative is that more democracy encourages redistribution of income from the rich to the poor, and the growing power of different interest groups. Therefore it can be considered that the net effect of the growth of democracy is uncertain. On the other hand, practice shows that economic development embodied in the higher standard of living promotes democracy. This relationship is clearly shown when a democracy is presented through the electoral rights and civil liberties and impact, and the living rate through the growth of gross domestic product per capita, access to primary education and reducing the gap in education of male and female population and the growing importance of the middle class etc.\nThere are many individual characteristics of team members that influence team effectiveness. Most important characteristics, which were in detail explained in this paper, are: knowledge, skills and abilities, personality traits, attitudes and diversity. Looking at knowledge, skills and abilities most important is knowledge of task, average cognitive ability, and absolute level of skill. Personality traits of all individuals affect team climate and specific combination of personalities in team has a great influence on team performances When it comes to attitudes, preferences towards teamwork bring high performances and last, but not least, diversity is a complex input and findings of different researchers are often conflicting. The main dilemma is about \"homogeneity and heterogeneity\", of team members and the influences of both approaches. Each of individual characteristics may have a positive, neutral or negative impact on overall performances depending on different organizational, situational or contextual factors.\nAccording to the literature, job satisfaction has been found to be the significant factor for the wide area of other job-related issues such as job performance, productivity, organizational citizenship behavior and a number of counterproductive behaviours and turnover (Landy and Conte, 2010). The influence that job satisfaction may have on all these different aspects of job, explains the importance of the research related to the job satisfaction. Since some studies (Birx, Lasalla&Wagstaff, 2011) have shown that employee job satisfaction can be influenced and improved by the intervention programs, this opens the possibility for other work-related aspects to be influenced through increasing the job satisfaction. Replication of the presented studiescould be attempted in future studies in order to analyze what are the main factors that influence job satisfaction of the faculty members at Serbian Universities, how interpersonal and collegial relationships influence their overall job satisfaction, and to compare these findings with similar research conducted so far in other countries. Overall, the presented literature review indicated that the specific area of faculty job satisfaction has not been that well researched so far as the job satisfaction in the other professions, and that some of the factors that are influential in other professions might not be that influential with the faculty members. . innovation (Rothstein & Goffin, 2006). In this regard, Barrick and Mount, in their meta-analytic study find that the rights of the correlation dimension of the five-factor model of personality and job performance range from 0.04 for Openness to 0.22 for Conscientiousness 1 (Barrick & Mount, 1991;Rothstein & Goffin, 2006). Mentioned results of meta-analytic studies, although overpriced and under-impressive as it is considered by Murphy , represent a real incentive for the use of personality tests in the selection of employees. In addition to that, research conducted back in 2003 estimated that 30% of U.S. companies use personality tests in the selection of employees (Heller, 2005by Rothstein & Goffin, 2006). Despite the \"revolution\" in the application of personality tests in the areas of organizational and industrial psychology, Schmitt still asks: \"Why now all of a sudden we look at personality tests as valid predictors of job performance when the validity over time was not significantly changed and remains equal to zero\" ? In support of the aforesaid, Murphy stated that the results of the revolutionary metaanalytic studies are impressive, as the correlation between the Big Five dimensions and job performance is only 0.13 . Using the median as a measure of central tendency, Campion shows that the middle coefficient of validation, in appraising training, is 0.10 with interquartale range (50% of our core measures) from 0.05 to 0.17 . It is possible to assess that their criterion validity is low, in relation to cognitive tests . Barrick found a few years ago that the personality test, taking into consideration that it is fully corrected, can explain about 15% of the variance, which is impressive, because simple cognitive tests can assess 25% of the variance . Also, personality tests are not good predictors of success in training, as cognitive ones .However, it is certain that there is a potential for incremental validation of personality tests in relation to the applied cognitive tests, but it should be taken into account that they do not say much about who does work well and who does it badly (Morgenson et al., 2007). On the other hand, Campion considers that incremental validation of personality tests is insignificant if the cognitive battery of tests is applied in selection of employees . Ones and colleagues agree with the statement that cognitive ability, regardless of the type of job and profession, predict overall job performance well, which is not the case with personality tests (Ones et al., 2007). The predictive power of personality tests is that some of the five-factor model of personality dimensions have predictive value in certain types of jobs, for example, diligence in business sales, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and friendly demeanor in police duties, in management of extraversion and conscientiousness. (Ones et al., 2007). Also, Ones and colleagues believe that the assessment of criterion validation of personality tests based on observed (unadjusted) meta-analytic data is not reliable (Ones et al., 2007). The observed data on metaanalytic studies are biased because the fact that such data influenced by statistical artifacts (restrictions rank and criterion unreliability) were not taken into consideration. If the correction of data on meta-analytical studies was done, as some scholars have done, data on the criterion variable validation of personality tests would be different and suggested that the predictive value in assessing the performance appraisal was low (Ones et al., 2007). In this regard, Ones and colleagues published corrected data amount of meta-analytic study and determined that the predictive validity of the Big Five was 0.27, as opposed to the non-adjusted, which was 0.13 (Ones et al., 2007). In the opinion of Morgeson and colleagues, correction data for rank restriction and criterion unreliability is justified, while other adjustments overstate the criterion validation of personality tests . Some meta-analytic studies, in addition to the above corrections, corrected data also because of the predictory unreliability and the constructive invalidity . Correction of predictor of uncertainty and constructive invalidity overestimates validation and it shows in research 2 (Barrick, Mount Stewart, 1998. As in previous meta-analytic studies it is not clear how the data was corrected, the only reliable information is observed (uncorrected) . It should be considered that if the scores are corrected, the correction of the rank restriction is possible only if the data suggest this phenomenon, while correction for criterion unreliability is usually small . Still, regardless of the capabilities of correction, it is well known that organizations in the selection process use personality tests without correcting scores . So, Morgeson and colleagues believe that regardless of the impact of statistical artifacts, the only \"real\" results are uncorrected scores obtained in the research studies . In addition, they make several claims. Firstly, none of the organizations, which in its selection process used personality tests, adjusted score . Secondly, the correction of the scores, the predictor unreliability and constructive disability, which are in meta-analytic studies used by some authors, usually overestimate the validity coefficients .Thirdly, when the correction is performed due to the rank scores of the restrictions, it is only feasible if the information is available to identify it. Fourthly, correction scores for criterion unreliability, although justified, slightly improve the validity coefficients . On the basis of these four reasons, Morgeson and colleagues conclude that the usefulness of personality tests can only be judged on the basis of unadjusted data, as previous studies have data corrected, for justified and unjustified reasons, and thus overestimated the power of personality tests in predicting job performance . But either way, not even corrected data, which are published by Ones and colleagues, are impressive in terms of the assessment of corrected validity, which Schidmt and Hunter gave, and which is for the cognitive tests 0.51, 0.54 for the sample of work and for a structured interview 0.51 (Schidmt & Hunter, 1998. Tett and Christiansen believe that the correlation predictor (personality traits) and criterion variables (job performance) is not enough data to make a conclusion on the criterion variable validation test figures (Tett Christiansen, 2007). In addition to measures of correlation obtained in certain samples, one should not lose sight of the population measures of correlation and standard deviation (Tett Christiansen, 2007). Specifically, based on the value of correlation obtained by meta-analysis, it is possible to make a conclusion about population measures (parameters) of correlations and standard deviations (Tett Christiansen, 2007). Confidence intervals, which are defined on the basis of meta-adjusted correlation and the analysis of the population of the standard deviation, indicating that 80% of the population correlation is expected in the range from 0 to 0.54, with an average value of 0.30 (Tett Christansen, 2007). Even in some cases 10% parametric measure of correlation will be above and below the confidence interval (Tett Christansen, 2007). The key measure is the population standard deviation, whose variability is not the result of statistical artifacts, but of situational specificity (Tett Christansen, 2007). Namely, the range of the population correlation indicates bi-directive relation of personality and job performance and the related mean value of the correlation test of personality and job performance, which Morgeson and colleagues presented, understates the potential value of personality tests, ignoring the variability in strength and population directorate validation coefficients (Tett Christansen, 2007). So, bi-direction of the person-job success relations indicate that the validity of personality tests under certain conditions can reach significant levels (Tett Christansen, 2007). The attention should be drawn to the conditions that create stronger, more positive relation of personality tests and job performance (Tett Christansen, 2007). The relation between personality dimensions and job performance is dependent primarily on a number of moderators and their effects (Tett & Christiansen, 2007). For example, as the personality tests, including the Big Five model, are multi-dimensional, it is necessary to extract the subscales that were positively associated with job success rate. Unlike explorative strategies that take all scales (personality traits) into account, even those that are irrelevant to success in business, confirmative research strategies first identified scales that are associated with the activities and then focus only on them 3 Through his research, Tett pointed to the fact that the validation coefficients are higher by application of confirmative rather than explorative research strategy and he confirmed through his meta-analytic studies that by the application of confirmative strategy the validity coefficient is twice higher (unadjusted data: 0.20 applying confirmative study 0.10 using the explorative strategies; corrected data: 0.30 confirmative application strategies, 0.16 using the explorative strategies) (Tett et al., 1999;Tett & Christiansen, 2007). In addition to the choice of research strategy, an important factor in relations person-job success is the analysis of person-oriented work. In his research, Tett comes to the conclusion that, by using personoriented work, validity coefficients are higher (Tett & Christiansen, 2007). Tett has empirically shown that the study, which included analysis of the work had higher average correlation coefficients (Tett Christansen, 2007). Morgeson and colleagues believe that the conclusions of Tett and Christiansen are significant, but still we have little empirical data about it on how . It is clear that the average of the test validation may underestimate validity, but it should be taken into account that the direction of person-job success relations should be defined a priori, and not after data collection . In addition it is not clear which theoretical explanations are the basis of the choice of certain personality traits in predicting job performance . For example, Christiansen in one of his research shows that only four personality dimensions 16PF (Cattell Personality Inventory) can be extracted in predicting job performance in managerial jobs . Although the four personality dimensions showed the highest predictive power, it is not clear which theoretical models explain the relation of the above personality dimensions and job performance .\nThe employees' personality traits have an important role in predicting different forms of their behavior in the context of the work, and that also applies to the managers. Since the management is a very complex psychological phenomenon, the subject of this research the focus was only on some aspects of this role. This paper studied leadership within specific types of large groups, such as enterprises, where there is a clear hierarchical structure and formally defined roles for managers. The company where this research was conducted has a very clear and rigid hierarchical structure with the organizational culture in which high demands addressed to managers of all levels are very openly communicated. The subject of the research were some aspects of the managers' personality, locus of control, self-confidence and level of striving for power, their interconnectivity as well as the impact of various socio-demographic characteristics and aspects of work on stated personality traits of managers. The results of the research showed that basic settings, defined in the starting assumptions, were confirmed in most cases. The results analysis, which are in relation to the interpretation of causality of phenomena, confirmed that people in leadership positions mostly have internal locus of control, and these people successfully overcome life problems and are more socially oriented, which is in accordance with the Rotter (1966) theory. At first glance, the dominance of the internal locus of control is preferable and healthier since it gives a person a sense that they can affect the outcomes in their life, making people more proactive and more oriented toward achievement. However, if the internal locus of control is not accompanied with appropriate competencies, personal efficiency and specific capabilities, it can lead people astray, or cause anxiety, neurosis or depression as evidenced in the research of Kobasa (1979). On the other hand, people with external locus of control, unburdened by high expectations, can lead peaceful and happy life, unless existentially threatened, because they are not expected a higher level of performance. Therefore, rigid and extreme manifestation of internal or external locus of control is not desirable. Simply, some life events can be influenced and some cannot. It is very important to properly distinguish them and accept them adequately. The main findings of this study about self-confidence confirm that managers have a high level of selfconfidence, which helps them in making business decisions, problem solving, risk acceptance, responsibility... Cohen (1968) particularly emphasizes the role of self-confidence in social interaction. People with higher levels of self-esteem are less susceptible to the effects of social interaction and tend to influence the attitudes and actions of others, unlike people with lower levels of self-confidence. The results confirm that managers at higher hierarchical levels have a higher level of confidence. Education level of managers is a significant factor in self-confidence which means that managers with higher levels of education have higher levels of self-confidence. However, the results did not show that older managers have a higher level of self-confidence than younger ones. This finding is very interesting and is not in line with the initial hypothesis that the total life experience affects self-confidence build-up. Managers who work in administration have a higher level of self-confidence than those who work in operations, which may be associated with the level of their formal education. The number of employees who report to them is not a significant factor in the expression of the level of self-confidence nor is the experience in management. Striving for power can be observed as dimension and managers can be distinguished by the degree of directivity development. The results of this research confirm the initial assumption that managers strive for power strongly and have a tendency to guide and control behavior and attitude of others. People with higher levels of self-esteem are less susceptible to the effects of social interaction and tend to influence the attitudes and actions of others, unlike people with lower levels of self-confidence. The results are in accordance with those theories which see managing as a role, realized through social interaction between the superiors and subordinates in the group. For managers, subjective experience of social environments the reality within which they choose their own ways of handling the interaction with others, which is consistent with the views represented by . This research confirmed the predictors' connection of levels of self-confidence with striving for power but not in the case of locus of control and striving for power. On the basis of these results, it is recommended that in the management selection process an assessment is conducted which will provide information on the level of self-confidence, the dominance of the internal locus of control and presence of striving for power. All these traits are very important for the successful functioning of managers in their daily activities. It would be very interesting to see what the difference in these respects between management and non-management population would be through the correlation research model. Striving for power, as a complex variable, can be divided and some of its aspects analyzed as well as its impact on management. according that reveals basic information about them -gender, race, age, while the degree of self-control can be established on the basis of non-verbal behavior, impulsivity, failure to envisage a consequence, inconsistencies, etc. It is assumed that there is a connection between social networks usage and loneliness and shyness. People who are socially anxious and having difficulty in direct communication with the people, see the Internet as a lighter, alternative type of communication (Papacharissi & Rubin, 2000). By following the comments, photos and videos, shy social network users do not have to reveal their true identity and that is exactly what makes it easy in communication with other users (Ayd\u0131n, Muyan, & Demir, 2013). When it comes to loneliness (Ayd\u0131n, Muyan, & Demir, 2013) have come to the conclusion that there is a negative correlation between loneliness and online communications in the sense that when increased levels of loneliness, the frequency of communication with friends decreases, and vice versa. Research shows that although personality characteristics affect the usage of social networks, it is not the only factor that affects the use of the Internet as a means of communication (Ross, Orr, Sisic, Arseneault, Simmering, & Orr, 2009). On the basis of mentioned above, the question which arise is how the average Facebook user in Serbia is experiencing the opportunities that this social network provides, and which are their habits on the social network that reveal their character. For this purpose, a survey was conducted which will be described in the following sections.\nTaking all the answers of survey participants into consideration, it is possible to determine that among the respondents there are members of all groups represented in Figure 2. Respondents who belong to the first group, Facebook addicts have the following characteristics: time spent online (3 hours and more -10 %), the number of friends on Facebook (between 300 and 400-27%), the number of photos on profile and frequency of changing profile pictures (800 more photos -8%; once a week -5%), frequency of publication status (once a day -5%), network access via mobile phone (yes -90%), the importance of Facebook (great -10%). These participants highlighted the importance of Facebook as aninstrumentfor connecting with people and sharing photos and thus they opened their profiles. On the other hand, among respondents there are those who belong to the group ofFacebook trend followers with next characteristics: number of friends (which are usually their acquaintances), personal information are available only to friends (79%), intensive communications with up to five friends (40%), rejection the friendship invitation from strangers (48%), rarely publishing status (57%), the importance of Facebook (2-23%). The main reasons for these users to access to Facebook are influence of their friends and a sense of belonging to this trend. There are also a Curious Facebook users, to which is not especially important number of friends (between 100 and 150 -8%) nor the time spent on Facebook (half an hour to one hour -45%), but these are the most frequent users who accept the invitation from strangers (52%) out of curiosity and using the option to follow people that are not on their list of friends (10%). The reason for their stay on a social network primarily is curiosity regarding the Facebook functionality as a social network, but also for following the events in the online lives of other users. For the end, there are Sociable Facebook userswho open profile to extend the circle of friends they met on their journeys and in different places. These are active users of social networks that leave their photos available to friends and their friends (13%), and for them is extremely important the number of friends (400 or more -30%). They often use check-in option when they are at the interesting places (37%), but do not attach great importance to Facebook in general (3 -42%). From all the above it can be concluded, that based on the respondents' answers and their habits on social networks and Internet in general, can identify some basic characteristics of their personality. The aim of this study was to determine the rough character traits based on the online survey, as well as whether it is possible to determine some of the habits of the participants based on specific questions. The fact is that social networks have become the basic platform for sharing photos with loved ones, friends, but also the place where you can make new friends. However, the user decides how much and in what way he distributes information about himself. With development of mobile applications, Facebook has opened new doors for spreading among users, and offered users possibility to share favorite moments with friends. Check-in option offers the possibility of capturing the user's current location. In order to determine the detailed character traits of Facebook user, this research must be conducted in detailon the contents of customer's photos, the content of their posts, statuses. Also,the structure of Facebook friends and pages that respondent follows, must be taken into consideration. For the purposes of this paper it was sufficient to collect respondents' opinions about their own habits on the social network."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH INTO ATTITUDES ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE AND GLOBAL MODELS OF 1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The beginning of XXI century can be considered as the period of the third wave of democratization (Huntington, 1991), the period characterized by accelerated breaking up with authoritarian systems and the consolidation of democracy at the global level. The third wave was initiated in 1974 with the democratic changes in Portugal and continues to this day. The process has been accelerating since the second half of the eighties. Authoritarian regimes transit to a democratic form and parliamentary elections are becoming freer and more open. The number of countries in which democratic electoral system is evolving (multi-party parliamentary democracy) has more than doubled in the last three decades. It seems, at least when it comes to the beginning of the XXI century, that this is the age when democracy is, at least nominally, becoming a global political norm rather than one of the possible choice. But in the new democracies, as it is the case with us, it appears, as a general problem, that they still retain an authoritarian heritage since the democratic norms, values and practices are still a great uncertainty for many actors of social change, starting with political and economic leaders, political parties, civil` associations and to the ordinary citizens. It takes time for people to adapt and accept democracy as a form of global management and government of the state and society. So in order for democratic systems to be functional it is important how the citizens themselves perceive their functionality among other things, e.g. if they are satisfied with the situation and whether they support democratic process and democratic institutions. Therefore, it is nothing strange that the new democratic society has a lot of problems in the way of democratization. The aim of this paper is to determine the extent Serbian citizens support the democratic system and democratic institutions, e.g. to what extent do people experience democracy as the optimal form of global management. Therefore, we conducted a survey of social attitudes of citizens relating to the acceptance of democracy as a system of global management, relationship to social changes and issues if the social subject should be managed by the state. A variety of factors affect citizens' satisfaction with the democratic process (McAllister, 2008). One of them relates to the institutional aspects of democracy. This is especially true when it comes to whether the elections can provide representation in the establishment of their will, and whether that can ensure the quality of the electoral process, which will be reflected to the effects of the election activities of citizens. Second, support for the democratic system takes into account a responsibility and performance of the system, i.e. whether the system is effective in providing good management, as well. It should be taken into account whether the occasional and temporary convergence of political parties in order to create coalitions limits the choice to citizens. Third, the consequences of political participation and political involvement of the citizens to political efficacy are important. Here will be analyzed the results of the empirical research \"Cultural Orientation of Actors/Students, Interethnic Relations, National Identity and the Culture of Peace in the Balkans\" performed within the macro project \"Tradition, Modernization and National Identity in Serbia and the Balkans in the EU Integration Process\" (179074) in the implementation of the Centre for Sociological Research, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Ni\u0161, which is financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia. The study was a survey type and realized in the area of South and Southeastern Serbia (summer 2013) on a sample of 818 students of the University of Ni\u0161. The sample is proportional to the composition of students and includes three groups of students: (1) students of social sciences and humanities, (2) students of technical and technological sciences and (3) students of medical and natural sciences and mathematics, by years of study and educational institutions."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY DATA ANALYSIS", "text": "Many years even decades-long crisis facing the Serbian society has endangered the stability and functionality of the society to the extent that the issue of fundamental social transformation became a development imperative. Of course, there may be different types and different political contexts in which transformation may take place. Today, the broader public often raises the question whether it is better for our society to establish a democratic or an authoritarian form of political organization. Of course, this is a false dilemma considering that the current social practice has shown that democracy has many advantages over other forms of political organization. Every form of authoritarian government favors particular social subjects to the detriment of some others while democracy strives to articulate different interests. Of course, democracy may have specific problems and go through developmental difficulties and even \"children's diseases\" but at the end of the development path however shows socially favorable results which for various forms of authoritarian government generally it cannot be told. Revisiting the concept of political power often corresponds to the dominant value patterns in the society among which we would emphasize the global type of national culture and within it the issue of organizational and political culture as particularly important. (Moji\u0107, 2010). Unfortunately, in the society of Serbia during recent history dominated patriarchal and traditional cultural patterns within which authoritarianism (Kuzmanovi\u0107, 1994(Kuzmanovi\u0107, , 1995 and nationalism (Miladinovi\u0107, 2006(Miladinovi\u0107, , 2007Popadi\u0107, 2010) played a particularly significant role. This context dictated in many respects the type of organization and political culture and attitude towards work cultivated in our society. It is no coincidence that the personal authorities were easily accepted in these areas and built cults of leaders on the basis of them (Kuzmanovi\u0107, 2010). Rather than democratic solutions characterized by the free elections and a parliamentary form of government there are often present personal authorities who frequently promoted populism and hid themselves behind the idea of technocracy in a public arena. The essence of a technocratic government, which is supposed to represent the rule of experts, is that they, despite their expertise, they are not politically neutral for general benefit, but they support various authorities and their ideologies and interests clans. Authoritarianism as a value framework and personal power as a political practice are in the firm coupled with the demagogic action that was done in parallel demagogic rhetoric and concrete action designed to satisfy the low passions, and launch the broad masses support (Stojanovic, 2011). Authoritarianism, cult of leaders and demagogic actions triggered mass as inarticulate subject which is easy to manipulate. In such circumstances, the power of mass gives legitimacy to the leader and theirs will is seen as a general people will. It has long been known that when ideas mastering the masses become the driving force that can fundamentally change the social circumstances. The key problem is that the charismatic leaders with a skillful manipulative rhetoric present their ideas as ideas of the masses and thus get an enormous social power that presents as a legitimate political will of the people and their every move as the fulfillment of the peoples will (Miladinovic, 1994). The recent political history has shown that every social crisis, whether economic or political, is an introduction to the period in which the leader has grown over the society. The Second World War and the period of revolutionary construction led to the cult of Josip Broz. After his death, the political crisis has led some nationalist leaders in the political arena (Bowman, 2004;Denitch, 1996;Miladinovi\u0107, 1994):. Ideological turmoil, in the conjunction with the birth of multi-party system, brought to the surface a larger number of potential candidates who play on personal charisma and fought for the position of undisputed leader of the nation. The period after the 2.000 year is a period of temporary calm. It seemed that the leaders go down in history, and vacuum is filled with new social and political patterns. However, the crisis at the end of the first decade was favorable for the fact that citizens of Serbia turned again to personal authorities and give the support to the cult of personality at the beginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century. At this moment it is a thankless task to predict the outcome of the current social and political turmoil. It can be reliably argued only that there are all necessary conditions to establish the cult of the charismatic leader and his personal power. What will be realized from it depends on a number of political, economic and cultural factors that set the tone of current events. With the aim to determine the tested population attitudes towards democracy we asked respondents to declare themselves to which extent they agreed with the four statements (Table 1): 1. Democracy may have its problems, but it is better than any other form of government 2. Undemocratic order is sometimes better and more efficient than democratic 3. Democracy is the same as anarchy 4. For people like me it does not matter what kind of political system they live It turned out that is the highest compliance exists with the first claim. Even 43.83% of respondents believe that democracy is better than any other form of government, although it may have its problems. If we take into consideration dominance of authoritarian patterns in the value structure of the society in Serbia, this finding seems to be very good. However, it does not provide developmental perspective of Serbia. The problem is that one in four does not endorse this attitude and one in three does not have clearly defined opinion on this issue. Even among those who agree with this statement dominate is the caution about the claim that democracy is the best form of governing a society (28.89% tend to agree but only 14.94% completely agree). This answers configuration suggests there is a poor subjective potential for adoption and development of a democratic political ideas and system in Serbia. The largest numbers of the respondents are not in a state to respond about their own compliance with the claim that the undemocratic order is sometimes better than democratic (39.24%). There is an equal number of respondents who refuse and accept this attitude (about 30%). Within the structure of those who reject this essentially anti-democratic attitude, half of them reject it completely but the other half do it mainly. This configuration of responses indicates that there is very good potential for the acceptance of non-democratic forms of governing a society. This finding is not surprising given that previous studies have shown a very high presence of authoritarianism in the value structure of the population of Serbia (Kuzmanovic, 2010). If we sharpen the previous attitude and say that democracy is the same as anarchy, then we have a slightly more favorable response configuration. Now willingness to defend democracy shows more than half of the respondents (53.45% of which 29.19% completely) while 30.54% are indecisive. So, there are only 16.01% of those who directly admitted that democracy and anarchy can be equated. In the structure of those who equate democracy and anarchy are 6.16% of those who completely agree this attitude. Ultimately, this is about the potential for acceptance of extremist political organizations and their ideologies. This potential can be extended from the current six percent to a significantly higher number in times of crisis. Moreover, here is a potential core for extremist forces first line support in any context of escalation of social conflicts and their transmission from parliament and factory halls to the streets. This number can grow up in a short time and take on alarming proportions by skillful political manipulation and attempts to establish the cult of the charismatic leader, as it was seen in Serbia and former Yugoslavia in the nineties. The last statement \"for people like me it does not matter what kind of political system they live in\" expresses political apathy. Political apathy may be considered as an expression of saturation with political events or dissatisfaction among citizens about social perspective or inadequate party and electoral offer and the entire political elite (Stojiljkovic, 2011) as the \"lull before the storm.\" In our case, only 16.26% of respondents expressed a direct political apathy supporting such attitude. Half of it (8.13%) accepted this attitude completely. It should be added that 22.41% of those who cannot opt which in total are 38.65% of potentially apathetic citizens, i.e. those who might want to take off from any political activity. On the other hand there is the majority of 61.33% of the respondents who do not accept political apathy as a way of his personal relationship with the government of the state and society. An interesting finding is that almost half of the examined population completely rejects this claim. This means there is a great potential for political activism in the Serbian society, and that the citizens are very interested in the politics and political perspectives of the society. Table 2: Which of the following statements best describes your opinion: Which of the following statements best describes your opinion: The whole organization of our society must be radically changed (in revolutionary action) 25,31% Our society must be completely changed through a reform 52,21% Our present society must fight vigorously against any changes 7,74% I do not know 14,74% A democratic society is essentially a dynamic society. A dynamic society is a society that is willing and able to change itself quickly and create new forms of social behavior. Of course, it is important to the changing of society that there are no subjective forces that would be carriers of changes. It is common understanding that the younger and more educated, which includes our respondents, are more willing to accept and initiate social change. Therefore, we offered them to choose an attitude that best reflects their relationship to a global social change (Table 2). Offered attitudes exemplify the following orientations: a radical change (radical cut -a revolution), gradual change (reform), resistance to change and the absence of change attitude. The modal response was that the society should completely change through a reform. So, every second respondent accepted reform, gradual changes, as the best solution to the current social problems. On the other hand, one in four respondents thought that the best pattern of social change is a radical revolutionary action. The key difference between these two versions is the duration of the transformation process. While, on the one hand, the reform involves long duration process on the other side revolution implies a relatively short-term action. A revolution brings stormy and very dramatic changes almost as a rule while the reform is not necessarily the case. It is an interesting finding that even 7.75% of the respondents think that our society must fight vigorously against any changes. They advocate for the status quo, for preserved existing situation of social relations. We need to add 14.74% of those who declare that they cannot opt for any of the available variants. So almost 85% of students have a clear vision of the pace with which the social transformation is supposed to happen and more than half is for gradually changing social relations. Respondents were also given to declare themselves within which global government model changes should happen (Table 3). We asked them the question: \"Who should manage the state?\" and it was given as standard variants authoritarianism (strong leader who is not limited by Parliament and elections), democracy (the government and parliament elected in free elections), technocracy (experts who know best what is good for the country) and militarism (the army). The answers are surprising. The modal response was based on the idea that the state should be managed by technocracy i.e. experts who know best what is good for the state. Technocracy as the best model of state government adopted by more than half of respondents (60.49%). The second ranked was the answer that the best model of state management is a democracy that declared one in five respondents (19.14%). Authoritarianism is accepted by 17.04% and militarism by only 3.33%. Thus, the technocratic model is three times more desirable than the democratic model of state management and government. Here, in our example, we recognize the authoritarian heritage in accepting the authority of experts. The key disadvantage of the technocratic model compared to the democratic is that professionals are given carte blanche confidence to make strategic decisions and the bulk of the population is excluded from the decision-making process. Technocracy is a kind of the minority educated professionals tyranny over the majority of less educated members of society. It should be noted that technocracy does not necessarily produce socially valuable results. It can be linked to any political or economic strength of society and defend its own interests, or simply take care about their own interests primarily. The point is that global politics should be left to the democratically elected government that will be able to articulate the interests of all stakeholders of civil society and ensure the protection of minority interests in the broadest sense of the word. Experts should be left to perform the individual specific tasks that require professional competence and thereby achieve socially valuable effect. But it seems to be, the much greater problem is that one in five respondents accept authoritarianism either in any form of government of a strong leader who is not limited by Parliament and elections or in the form of militaristic government. In the next step (Table 4) we crossed questions that show the attitude towards change and attitude that defines the optimal model of change. There is statistically significant relationship (p = 0.000) of low intensity between these two variables (Contingency coefficient C=0.23 and Cramer`s V=0.13). Most frequently accepted combination is the one that connects the reformist view of social change with the technocratic model of governance. Concretely, 65.3% of the supporters of reform course accept technocratic model of governance as the best, or 56.4% of the supporters of technocracy accept the reform course. Another cell of the table which contains interesting results is one in which even 58.1% of the supporters of the democratic model of governance accept the reform course of changes. Of course, acceptance is not bidirectional, as only 21.4% of reformists accept democracy as the optimal model of governance. It is also interesting results in the row where intersects supporters of revolutionary change (radical cuts) given that more than half of supporters of radical change (56.4%) also preferred technocratic model of governance, while on the other hand, only about a quarter of supporters of technocracy accept the radical changes. It is interesting that 44.3% of supporters of the status quo accept the government of technocracy. The table can be viewed either in vertical columns or in horizontal rows only. If we look at the vertical columns, we see that on the one hand one third of the supporters of the authoritarian model of governance advocating the radical course and in the other hand the next third advocating the reform course. It is observed that within this group it is twice more of those who oppose any change (16.2% of supporters of authoritarianism to 7.6% of supporters in the general population. It is observed that within this group, the share of those who oppose any change is twice bigger (16.2% of supporters of authoritarianism to 7.6% of supporters in the general population). Supporters of technocratic model are mainly directed towards the reform course (56.4%), while a quarter of them (23.6%) accept the radical cut. A third of the supporter of militaristic model of governance prefer radical cuts (33.3%), a quarter of them prefer reform change (25.9%), while the same number of them are undecided. It is interesting that there are the most of those who do not have a clearly defined attitude toward the preferred dynamic of social change (25.9% compared to 14.9% of the total population) among the supporters of militarism. It seems that the militaristic attitude towards choosing a subject of change occurs as an expression of profound social hopelessness considering that a large number of supporters of this form of government either want quick, radical change or just do not know what would be good for the society, the state and the economy and they found force that can bring order in the society in the army. It has already been noted that three fifths of the supporters of democratic government model accept technocrats. It should be added that one in five believes that social problems can be solved in the best way applying radical cuts. Analyzed by horizontal lines we observe that a technocracy is the modal choice of supporters of radical changes (56.4%). In addition to this, almost a quarter of them advocate an authoritarian model of governance. The presence of the acceptance of democracy and militarism in this group is significantly less Two-thirds of reformist oriented respondents accept the technocratic model of global management and government, while only one-fifth of them accept a democratic model. Other models of governance (authoritarianism and militarism) barely have supporters in this segment of the population Slightly less than half of the opponents of social change (44.3%) accept technocratic model as the best model of governance, while more than a third of them (36.1%) support the authoritarian model of governance. The distribution of those who declare not to know which the model of governance would be optimal is almost identical as in the general population. The only visible difference is related to supporters of militaristic model which are almost twice more than in the total population (5.8%)."}, {"section_title": "STORYTELLING AS AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT TOOL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CHANGES AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIZATIONS", "text": "Organizations are nowadays faced with high level of complexity and uncertainty in various fields of business due to the fact that economic and social unrest are changing the game, often more rapidly than one can observe. Unfortunately, many companies are designed to operate in conditions where there is no change, or when operating effectively at \"full speed\" means consistently keeping up the track on the past actions. In that respect, changes are often seen as something that must be overcome, controlled, as a simple break in the known world, not as a new \"norm\" that needs to be properly managed. This new \"norm\" refers to the fact that organizational agility and flexibility have to be developed; organizations need to be able to constantly adapt and change in order to meet diverse economic and competitive challenges. Truly agile organizations are able to meet these changes and challenges through the implementation of different organizational projects that allow them to adapt, to continually be assessed by an educated and informed leadership, and in a way that is common and normal for all employees (Change Management Institute, 2012). To sum up, companies need to develop and strategically apply sophisticated change management practices. Change management can be defined as a process of constant renewal of the direction of the organization, its structure and its ability to adapt to the needs of internal and external clients (Moran and Brightman, 2001). According to Burns (2004) changes are always present -existing part of organizational life, both on the operational and strategic level. Therefore, there should not be any doubt about the importance of opportunities to be identified on where the organization needs to be in the future, as well as how to manage changes in a way which will make that happen. Finally, organizational changes cannot be separated from organizational strategy or the other way around (Burnes 2004;Rieley and Clarkson, 2001). Organizational change is one of the building blocks of the corporate strategy. Although it is difficult to establish any kind of consensus on the framework for the management of change, there seems to be agreement on two important issues. First of all, it is accepted that the pace of change has never been greater than in the current business environment. Secondly, there is a consensus that changes caused by internal or external factors come in all shapes and sizes and therefore, can potentially affect all organizations in all industries. Hence, the significance and the relevance of the topic get constantly reinforced."}, {"section_title": "RESISTANCE TO ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE", "text": "The basis for the success of organizational change is their acceptance by employees. In the context of his work Kubler- Ross (1973) argues that people faced with loss or change go through five stages of ''grief'' namely: anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance. This indicates the essential aspects of change management in an organization. Wiggins (2009) uses this model for the purpose of communication and support during the period of change which again indicates that it should be adapted to the stage in which the employees are concerned. For example, after the news about the change have been communicated, employees must be given the information that would oppose their potential (and most likely to happen) rejection. After they receive the information, they experience a sense of anger, negotiating and entering into a state of depression, which actually requires different types of support within each of these phases. At the end of the cycle, once employees start to accept the new situation, they need a vision of the future -the one that can make them dedicated and committed to the new circumstances. On the contrary, some other researchers advocate a different approach in the research on change governance, arguing that individual reactions are complex, different and unpredictable. One representative of such thinking is Oreg (2003) who suggested that the resistance to change is based on the personality and the context in which the change occurs. In his initial study (Oreg, 2003), the author developed and tested a scale called ''The scale of resistance to change (RTC)'' which is conceptualized as a stable personality trait. In this study, Oreg came to a positive and significant relationship between the individual RTC results and their affective and behavioural resistance to specific organizational changes with which they are faced. In addition to personal settings that affect the level of resistance caused by organizational changes, Oreg (2003) also showed that the context variables played a significant role. Trust in management has proven to have a strong effect on cognitive and behavioural resistance, which is pointed to the importance of good governance in a time of change. Similarly, studies have shown that a large amount of information about changes given to individuals resulted in a worse evaluation of changes and increased the ability to act against them. This latest finding has led Oreg (2003) to suggest that there will be an optimal amount of information that can be given, after which the employee will feel satisfied. He also suggests that if the change has a negative impact on the individual, it would not be surprising that more information about the change increases the resistance to it. This study highlights the importance of another management approach in connection with the communication strategy. On a day-to-day basis, the engagement of an employee relies on the effectiveness of internal communication through the exchange of information between employees and management and employees among themselves. Such an internal communication takes place on three distinct levels: the daily management of employee relations, strategic plan for realisation of the mission of the organization, and project management (Cheney and Christensen, 2001). In the times of change, employers need to successfully shape and manage information throughout these three levels of communication, in order to maintain and support amplifiers of positive employees' attitudes (Gots and Wilson, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "THE CONCEPT OF STORYTELLING", "text": "Corporate storytelling is the process of transferring messages that form a new angle or reinforce the opinion or behaviour using narratives about people, organizations, past, visions of the future, social cohesion and work in general. Stories are one of the most important motivational tools known to a man. Useful, anytime and anywherefrom the Bible to contemporary comedians -stories explain, entertain and motivate. Through jokes, tragedy and comparisons, they make us laugh, sadden, or inspire. In business, good communicators use storytelling to sell products, generate ideas, develop and nurture a corporate culture. Kyle and Jacobson (1999) remark that the story can communicate vision and build a sense of common goals as well as create a sense of community among different people. Certain situations are perfect for storytelling, such as new beginnings or calming employees during crisis. Kaye and Jacobson (1999) identify a typical three-step sequence that holds the key to the power of storytelling: \uf0a7 The story. One person tells the story while one or more others listen. \uf0a7 The understanding. Both parties begin to gain a deeper understanding of something that was previously known only superficially. \uf0a7 The shared meaning. Groups use the shared meaning of one thing as a metaphor or shorthand for the broader understanding of other things. Organizations are dependent on effective communication as drivers of success. Storytelling already plays an important role in the world of organizations, businesses and modern politics. Stories can be used internally by the organization in order to motivate people and create a memorable message for employees (Madlock, 2009;Marques, 2010). Traditionally, stories in the workplace have been used to highlight the safety and wellbeing, and reduce risk. From an employer's perspective, the expansion of the value of corporate storytelling is the potential to persuade, motivate and inspire staff, especially in the period of change, which strengthens the internal loyalty (Simmons, 2006). The key advantage of using stories as a communication strategy during organizational change lies in the fact that management can use the corresponding narrative in order to understand employees (their wishes, expectations, ambitions, general attitudes and attitudes in relation to a respective organizational change etc.), without compromising the goal of communication (Harrison, 2008). The common opinion is based on the fact that the pure logic between management and employees may be significantly improved through storytelling, thus making it easier for employees to adapt to a change and the new emerging organizational reality. Another important advantage is the universal need for the use of storytelling in contact with members of the organization who have different interests and learning styles. Many large organizations have a great range of stakeholders. The stories provide a flexible framework for the narrator to present objectives in accordance with interests of certain stakeholders (Dowling, 2006). We can see that storytelling is not only a communication tool aiming at employees but all other relevant internal, and potentially also external stakeholders."}, {"section_title": "STORYTELLING AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT", "text": "According to Fleming (2001), the role of the leader is to challenge the cosy and outdated beliefs, selectively discarding them, and providing new insights into the attitudes and existing organizational practices. However, most leaders can confirm that this is easier said than done. The following story confirms these claims to a great extent (James and Minnis, 2004). The lack of commitment of employees is the main reason why a program of organizational change fails. Successful change requires a new general behavior of all members of the organization, but employees usually react in the opposite way, with anger, denial, doubt and anxiety. Theorists generally agree that the key to overcoming this resistance is open communication. The most common barrier to organizational changes is the top management who hold tickets to unto in its hands. The change is frequently experienced emotionally by the employees, and task of the leaders is to spend their followers through uncharted waters. The challenge is to involve employees in the current changes so that they feel as participants and not as targets. This requires leaders to engage not only the technical but also the human side in an effort to change. They can build consensus with strong relationships instead of using the power that their positions bring. In contrast to positional power, where the results are achieved by emphasizing rank, power relations strengthen new projects through the involvement of leaders and provide information to those who will be affected by the changes. Further, leaders more often consider human emotion as a potential threat, rather than as a potential opportunity for engagement. As the process of creativity stories can be used as a symbolic tool for persuading others to change their views and consider new beliefs. Aristotle talked about the three pillars of persuasion: \uf0a7 logos -that appeals to the intellect; \uf0a7 pathos -indicating emotions; \uf0a7 ethos -which appeals to the credibility of one who convinces. Intellect and emotion are strongly related, but not always aligned. Emotions have the ability to affect the intellect. The right time, well directed story, can cause emotions to transform the point of view of the employee and motivate the desired response. Mark Walton (2003) calls the stories that affect the change \"strategic narratives\". Walton (2003) describes a three-step process to develop a strategic story. The first determines what the desired end is -what we want the audience to take. The second one -establishing strategic story should provide a positive view of the future that the audience should imagine. Thirdly, develop a story line that meets the specific needs of the audience, their desires and goals. Annette Simmons 2001, on the other hand, wrote that the need for a demonstration of the benefits of compliance with the changes should be understood -it is the key aspect of this plot. When listeners believe that their needs are understood, linking actions or commitment to the plan provides multiple and significantly higher chances for success."}, {"section_title": "STORYTELLING AND RESISTANCE TO CHANGE", "text": "It is the fact that storytelling is a way for the suppression of organizational change, but not a substitute for changes in policies, programs, budgets, incentives, staff, measurement and other actions that are necessary for prolonged periods during the transformation of a large organization. Storytelling is just a tool that can be used to implement these measures in the first place. It helps inciters of changes to communicate the changes to all levels. Storytelling connects employees and managers in order to support the changes that seem strange and threatening. There are a number of reasons why stories can be effective to change organizations: \uf0a7 Storytelling is natural and easy. The ability to tell and follow narrative is a capacity that happens at such an early age -around the age of two or three years of age -that one is tempted to call the capability innate, or at least a natural, capacity (Brunner, 1990). By contrast, abstract analysis is not something that we do naturally. It is something that we have to be trained to do, through many years of schooling. For most of us, it emerges as burdensome work. It may be excellent mental exercise and good for self-improvement. But except for a few unusual people, who like living in an inert world of non-living things, the experience makes us tired and weary, as compared to listening to stories which most of us experience as invigorating and refreshing and energizing. We find the telling of stories inherently pleasurable (Weick, 1995). Stories invite the listener to visualize a different world, and in the imagining, to add value to the activity. The shared imagining of the teller and listener creates a common space. As the storyteller watches the reactions of the listeners, he instinctively builds on and emphasizes the elements that are resonating with the listeners, thereby encouraging the phenomenon of co-creation. The audience senses that the storyteller is interacting with them, and they respond to it with more reactions. The phenomenon is natural, spontaneous and pleasurable. \uf0a7 Stories show the connections between things. A good story holds disparate elements together long enough to energize and guide action, plausibly enough to allow people to make retrospective sense of whatever happens, and engagingly enough that others will contribute their own inputs in the interest of sense-making (Weick, 1995). \uf0a7 Stories bypass defense mechanisms. The story is bypassing defense mechanisms. One of the attractions of the story is that people can not immediately see where this story is going to take. People find it difficult to categorize stories, especially if they are unfamiliar. Therefore, the defense mechanisms are normal in storytelling. The mind is not critiquing it, but following it, and projecting on to it. This enables a more participatory spirit towards understanding what is involved in it, than if listeners are hearing an analytic presentation where they have their critical apparatus at the ready, to dissect, analyze and appraise the proposed change. In the case of a story, the listeners are not analyzing it. They are living it. The mindset is fundamentally different. (Brunner,1990.) \uf0a7 Stories help cope with complexity. The world is a complex place. Despite the impression we have often been given in school, simple linear phenomena are rare in our world. Non-linear phenomena are everywhere. It is only in the last several decades that scientists have been discovering this reality. How then has the human race coped with such complexity for thousands of years? One of the early ways of coping was by personifying complex events, so that we expect the same non-linear behavior that we expect with persons. Stories provide a simple way that has been used since time immemorial to communicate the complexity of the world. Modern corporations, and the changes that are needed in them, are complicated entities. People in them can understand and make sense of what is going on by telling stories to each other (Capra, 1996). \uf0a7 Stories engage our feelings: Stories have the inherent capacity to engage our emotions and get to deep meaning, because stories are in their nature about the irregularities in our lives, things that catch our attention as being different from what is expected, and hence arouse our curiosity, or even fear. The regularities in our lives attract little attention. They are boring. They are the background noise of our lives and do not constitute the subject matter for stories, except when we discover a new regularity, which in itself is unexpected and hence irregular. It is the irregularities that attract our attention: they operate as a potential threat to our capacity to stay in control of our lives, as well as an incentive to understand them so as to be able to have a say in our future. As a result, stories, in addition to their cognitive dimension for understanding the irregularities, tend to engage our emotions to the extent that we perceive our well-being and safety to be at risk. (Brunner, 1990.) "}, {"section_title": "AN EXAMPLE", "text": "Results of an employee satisfaction survey conducted by Ericsson Australian and New Zealand during the global financial crisis period in 2008 indicated poor results, with: senior leaders' motivation rating 52 per cent; leadership communication capability rating 57 per cent; and, strategy awareness rating 66 per cent (Aplin, 2010). Ericsson launched a three-year strategy with programs addressing business challenges and opportunities, focussing on transforming the organisation's culture to becoming more customer-centric. The goal of the program was to help employees understand the organisation's ambitions and feel motivated to contribute. To achieve this, Ericsson recognised the need to build communication competence with senior leaders. The organisation set objectives to improve leadership communication capability and strategy awareness by three points. The senior leadership group (including the CEO) was required to attend two halfday workshops on storytelling, which had been identified as the way to connect, not just communicate, with the staff. It was identified from these sessions that although the organisation had a story to share with employees, each team had unique challenges that needed to be addressed by the leaders to gain support for the cultural change. Gaining senior leadership 'buy-in' was an important element to making the storytelling strategy a success. Of the Ericsson leaders, although some scepticism was initially detected, 97 per cent rated the workshops as developing relevant skills for their roles as leaders and 91 per cent saying storytelling improved their influence as a leader (Aplin, 2010). The results from educating leaders in the strategy of storytelling to engage with employees indicated a resounding success rate, with employee surveys at the end of 2009 showing leadership communication competency jumping 18 points to 75 per cent, strategy awareness increased by 11 points to 77 per cent, and senior leaders' motivation increasing by 22 points to 74 per cent. Ericsson's customers rated them five points ahead of their competitors in the Customer Satisfaction Index Survey and the company finished the year in a stronger financial position (Aplin, 2010). The 2009 turn-around was due to a range of initiatives, but equipping leaders with storytelling expertise had a real impact (Aplin, 2010). Even though just a brief summary of how Ericsson uses storytelling to cope with resistance to change, these results show encouraging effects of corporate storytelling in this domain. Such success stories should encourage other practitioners to deploy this tool, but also researchers to study it more thoroughly."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper I presented the importance of the implementation of corporate storytelling as an internal communication strategy that facilitates the understanding of management decisions. Using the story by the leaders is an interesting way to build loyalty in times of organizational change, and doing so by strengthening the support and communication between employees. References included in this paper strongly support the concept of corporate storytelling as a powerful mean for building stronger engagement and create greater loyalty to employees. The needs of employees include both cognitive and emotional domains, especially during periods of change. Therefore, corporate stories can address these requirements through a deeper and more personal communications medium. A carefully planned narrative delivered through the story, meets employees on a more individual level, strongly enhancing the potential of understanding, memory and commitment to corporate interests. On the basis of the above-mentioned, it can be concluded that the corporate storytelling is an effective medium of communication for the purpose of increasing engagement and building loyalty to employees. Will the storytelling be more than temporary managerial trend? It is possible, if it is perceived as some kind of drug. But actually, communicative leader who had a positive experience to applying storytelling can choose to keep this as a strong advantage in managing organizational change. The stories represent and shape the organizational culture. They have a role in clarifying ambiguities and provide meaning. The stories also work to change the beliefs and behaviours through cognitive and emotional processes. Once leaders seize the transformational power of language to motivate and inspire, they would undoubtedly conclude that organizational storytelling makes sense. Taking this into consideration, further research should address narratives and corporate storytelling as one of the pillars of the organizational culture. Finally, the development of information-communication technologies has opened a whole new horizon of the possibilities for digital and online storytelling. Examples can already be found both in practice and within the research streams of academics. Oreg, S. (2003).

(Morgeson, Reider, & Campion, 2005). Interaction in team environment imposes the need for unique set of competencies (Stevens & Campion, 1994) with empirical confirmation of their influence on performances (Cooke, Kiekel, Salas, Stout, & Bowers, 2003;Hirschfeld, Jordan, Feild, Giles, & Armenakis, 2005;McClough & Rogelberg, 2003). Knowledge of the task is extremely important for teams working on assignment for a long period of time. Teams with high level of knowledge of the task not only have better performances but go through transition processes much easier (Mathieu & Schulze, 2006). Average team cognitive ability is a good predictor of performances. Teams with high average cognitive ability acquire new knowledge much easier when there is an equal work overload among members. (Ellis, Hollenbeck, Ilgen, Porter, West, & Moon, 2003). Team performances are influenced by structure with highly interdependent tasks (Tziner & Eden, 1985). In meta analysis of 17 studies considering relationship between cognitive ability and team performances on student population, Devine and Philips (2001) concluded that \"functional sum of cognitive abilities in team may affect team performances in different types of teams\". According to them, effects are largest in teams working on intellectual tasks or teams involved in decision making process, unlike teams working on tasks with dominant physical component. They also concluded that relationship between cognitive ability and effectiveness is stronger when teams work on unfamiliar task (Devine & Philips, 2001). This conclusion is consistent with literature analyzing individual performances which also proved interdependence between cognitive ability and performances . Interesting discovery in team effectiveness literature is the fact that team composed of highly skilled individuals is more effective than teams composed of individuals with lower level of absolute skills (Hackman, 1987;Guzzo & Shea, 1992). Although team members' skills and abilities have positive correlation with effectiveness, it doesn't mean organizations only need talented individuals to create effective teams. Another consistent conclusion in literature is although absolute level of individual skills and abilities is necessary in teams; organizations must consider the total sum of skills and abilities in teams (Campion, Papper, & Medsker, 1996). For example, successful basketball team must have pointers to achieve points during game. On the other hand, important players are those who can jump or play defense. It was proven that team member diversity has positive correlation with team performances (Guzzo & Shea, 1992), and teams with diverse knowledge and skills grade their own effectiveness much higher (Magjuka & Baldwin, 1991)."}, {"section_title": "PERSONALITY TRAITS", "text": "Despite the significance of skills and abilities, in practice situations where teams with high-quality individuals are ineffective are often. Beside cognitive ability, personality traits are a good predictor of performances. Most reliable predictor is team consciousness that reflects as reliability and regularity in performing task related activities (Barrick & Mount, 2005). Van Vianen and De Dreau (2001) found that harmony and consciousness in teams are related to performances. Same conclusions produced meta analysis of other authors (Peeters, Van Tuijl, Rutte, & Reymen, 2006). Interesting conclusion of these authors is that changes in harmony and consciousness have negative impact on team performance. Researchers analyzed influence of personality traits on team performances in respect with type of task given to team members. LePine, Colquitt i Erez (2000) found negative correlation between consciousness and effective decision making when decision making rules demand the need to adjust (Le Pine, Colquitt, & Erez, 2000). Adjustment to modified conditions is difficult for individuals with need for stability. Other authors came to the conclusion that effect of personality traits varies upon task as well (English, Griffith, & Steelman, 2004). Another argument why personality is important is it's' influence on team climate. George concluded that teams differ on affective tone determined upon individual personalities (George, 1990). The fact that personality influence team climate is not surprising considering the fact that personality traits of all individuals affect organizational climate (Schneider, 1987). Specific combination of personalities in team has a great influence on team performances. There could be conflicting personalities in team environment, and it is also possible that one individual has a bad influence on team performances just because he/she possesses certain personality trait. Barrick et al., (1998) found that teams with emotionally unstable members have lower values in cohesion, flexibility, communication, conflicts and division of labor, in comparison to teams without that type of member. However, one emotionally unstable team member does not influence performances in negative manner (Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, 1998). Bell conducted meta analysis of relationship between personality traits and performances. Her results indicate the fact that average team consciousness, cooperation, extraversion, emotional stability and openness to experience have positive correlation to performances (Bell, 2007). Likewise, teams consisting of highly conscious members who cooperate achieve higher performances (Halfhill, Sundstrom, Lahner, Calderone, & Niels, 2005). At the same time, teams with members who have low need for cooperation are not skilled in acquiring new knowledge (Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, & Gilson, 2008). Spectrum of personality traits analyzed in relation to team performances is extremely wide and surpasses the most popular model in the field -Big Five model, that considers neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and consciousness (Costa & McCrae, 1995). Many authors include orientation to achievement and dependability (LePine J. A., 2003), assertiveness (Pearsall & Elis, 2006), and locus of control (Boone, Van Olffen, Van Witteloostuijn, & De Brabander, 2004) as significant personality traits in teamwork and team effectiveness."}, {"section_title": "ATTITUDES", "text": "Effects of attitudes on team effectiveness can manifest in one of two ways. Campion defined direct effect as \"preferences towards teamwork\" that reflect desire of team members to be in team environment (Campion, Medsker, & Higgs, 1993). Irrespective of team presence in organizations, not everyone likes to work in teams and certain employees prefer individual work. Teamwork may bring frustrations due to social loafing, conflicts and other problems. Campion et al., (1993) concluded that teams are less effective in general, looking at several criteria, when members have low preferences towards teamwork (Campion, Medsker, & Higgs, 1993). Other authors came to the same conclusion that preferences towards teamwork increase effectiveness (Bell, 2007;Jung & Sosik, 1999;Watson, Johnson, & Merritt, 1998), quality of teamwork (Eby & Dobbins, 1997;Harris & Barnes-Farrell, 1997) and team sustainability (Harris & Barnes-Farrell, 1997). Second way of influence attitudes have on effectiveness is through similarities in them. Taking into consideration the findings of social psychologists that people like people similar to themselves (Byrne, Clore, & Smeaton, 1986), teams function better when there is moderate similarity of attitudes on significant matters like team leader effectiveness or organizational support (Bliese & Britt, 2001). Despite potential value of similarities, there are considerable dangers in situations where team members are much alike. When team members agree on every issue, necessary debate in work activities lacks and team members become resilient to changes. Janis (1982) defined such dynamics as group thinking and described it as \"model of thinking individuals adopt in cohesive groups in situation when team unity has prevalence over realistic consideration of alternative ways of action... Group thinking is related to deterioration of mental efficiency, reality checks and moral judgment as a result of group pressure\" (Leana, 1985)."}, {"section_title": "DIVERSITY", "text": "Diversity domain has developed over the last decades and covers a wide range of different phenomena. The term diversity is used in this paper to describe the distribution of different characteristics among interdependent team members that may affect effectiveness, and as a representation of the influence of heterogeneity in teams on processes and outputs. There is an old dilemma about \"homogeneity and heterogeneity\". This a problem of increasing diversity for the purpose of multiplying available set of skills and perspectives necessary for problem solving, but making work and cooperation harder at the same time among significantly different team members . Relatively homogenous teams in age, gender, ethnicity, race, experience and culture have quality interpersonal relationships and interact easily during teamwork. On the other hand, homogenous membership may limit the team due to shortage of ideas, creativity, and same views on the problem at hand . Certain differences among team members are inevitable, some are even desirable (Mihailovi\u0107 & Risti\u0107, 2005). Heterogeneous team, with members that vary in demographics, life style, experience and culture, also bring potential advantages to teamwork. Diversity is a rich source of information, talents and different perspectives that can advance problem solving in teams and increase creativity, especially with complex and demanding tasks. Research has shown that team diversity may be the cause of bad performances, especially in early phases of team development. Problems occur as interpersonal stress or conflict due to diversity. Solving these problems may slow down team development and interfere with interpersonal relations , but heterogeneous team have an excellent position for utilizing positive aspects of diversity in achieving high performances after handling difficulties at work. Although it takes more time and effort to create great teamwork based on diversity, long-term benefits in terms of creativity and performances make the investment worthwhile. Full potential of heterogeneous teams is one of great strengths in high performing organizations. Personal characteristics significant from the diversity aspect can be classified in several ways, as: clearly visible characteristics (e.g. race, gender, age), characteristics evident after introduction (e.g. personality traits, knowledge, values), and characteristics in between two extremes on a transparency continuum (e.g. education, years of employment). Some of them have direct (e.g. education), and others indirect (e.g. age) effect on work results (Jackson, Joshi, & Erhardt, 2003). Jackson et al., (1995) also defined taxonomy of job related attributes and interpersonal related attributes, and grouped them as superficial and essential. Race, age and gender can shape interpersonal relationships, but don't usually affect performances. Differences in knowledge, skills and abilities (e.g. position, education, permanent job), do have a direct impact on performances. Research shows that diversity is a complex input and findings of different researchers are often conflicting. Some believe that influence of diversity on processes, emerging states and outputs is positive, negative or non-existent (Webber & Donahue, 2001). For example, Campion et al., (1993) looked at heterogeneity in service sector and found no connection with productivity and satisfaction (Campion, Medsker, & Higgs, 1993). Additionally, studies have shown that diversity is in interaction with time (Harrison, Price, & Bell, 1998), task (Pelled, Eisenhardt, & Xin, 1999) and organizational culture (Brickson, 2000;Ely & Thomas, 2001). Though there is a vast literature in the field of diversity and several comprehensive literature reviews (Jackson, Joshi, & Erhardt, 2003;Milliken & Martins, 1996;Williams & O'Reilly, 1998), focus of this paper is on several individual characteristics of team members: demography, functional diversity, personality traits and status. Demography. Webber and Donahue conducted meta analysis with the aim to find the influence of demographic diversity, and did not manage to prove the relationship with cohesion or team performances (Webber & Donahue, 2001). Several other researchers found diversity in age (Kilduff, Angelmar, & Mehra, 2000) and years of employment (Jehn & Bezrukova, 2004) to have influence on performances. It was shown that ethnicity, gender, age, years of employment and education (Jackson, Joshi, & Erhardt, 2003;Kirkman, Tesluk, & Rosen, 2001;Leonard, Levine, & Joshi, 2004;Li & Hambrick, 2005;Mohammed & Angell, 2003;Simons, Pelled, & Smith, 1999) have negative impact on processes (e.g. managing conflict), emerging states (e.g. empowering employees, commitment to organization) and performances (Townsend & Scott, 2001;Watson, Johnson, & Merritt, 1998). But, if time aspect is taken into consideration, findings change. Harrison et al., (1998) noted that differences in age stop having influence on performance when team members spend significant amount of time working. It can be concluded that effects of diversity vary depending on team task, culture and climate in organization (Jackson, Joshi, & Erhardt, 2003). Functional diversity. Functional diversity is defined as degree to which team members differ among each other in terms of functional career (Bunderson & Sutcljffe, 2003). This aspect of heterogeneity isn't always related to increased performances (Carpenter, 2002;Jehn & Bezrukova, 2004;Pelled, Eisenhardt, & Xin, 1999;Pitcher & Smith, 2001) and it was found that it can limit the processes and effectiveness due to numerous appearances of conflict (Knight, et al., 1999;Pelled, Eisenhardt, & Xin, 1999), bad information exchange (Ancona & Caldwell, 1992) and slow response time to set demands (Hambrick, Cho, & Chen, 1996). Despite this fact, different theoretical and practical approaches emerged lately regarding functional diversity. Bunderson and Sutcliffe (2002) found that different conceptualization of functional diversity may influence processes and performance. They introduced the term interpersonal diversity (e.g. degree in which team members posses highly specialized or wide spread of knowledge in certain fields) and concluded that interpersonal functional diversity (among several team members) has a negative impact, while intrapersonal diversity (heterogeneity inside the individual) has a positive impact on data processing inside team and on performances (Bunderson & Sutcljffe, 2003). Differences in personality traits. Personality traits as individual predispositions to react in a similar manner in different situations (Mihailovi\u0107, 2010), brought the array of various conclusions in the literature. Authors found that diversity in extraversion (Mohammed & Angell, 2003;Neuman, Wagner, & Christiansen, 1999) and emotional stability (Neuman, Wagner, & Christiansen, 1999) has positive impact on performances. Also, this type of diversity has negative impact on processes (Mohammed & Angell, 2004), while diversity in agreeableness and neuroticism has negative influence on performances (Halfhill, Sundstrom, Lahner, Calderone, & Niels, 2005;Mohammed & Angell, 2003). Besides Big Five personality traits, diversity in perception of urgency has a positive correlation with resolving conflict in teams (Mohammed & Angell, 2004;Landy, Rastegary, Thayer, & Colvin, 1991). Integration of different personalities is an important aspect of teamwork. FIRO-B theory identifies differences in relationships between individuals in groups upon their needs for love, participation and control. These three groups of needs are the key in work environment and determine behavior of each individual. Schultz, the author FIRO-B theory, believes that groups with compatible members are more successful than groups in which members do not share the same needs. Symptoms of incompatibility may be members' withdrawal, open hostility, fight for control and domination of few. If managers don't pay attention to members' compatibility in times of forming teams, a vase amount of time is lost on resolving interpersonal conflicts (Schultz, 1958). Status. Another source of diversity is status -rank, prestige or position of team members. Team member's status is influenced by several factors: age, years of employment in organization, profession, education or performances. Status congruence occurs when position of the tem member is equivalent to status outside the team. Problems occur with status inconsistencies, such as if a younger team member takes on leader's role in the team with senior and more experienced workers )."}, {"section_title": "INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS", "text": "A number of different studies has been undertaken in order to determine influence that interpersonal relationships at the workplace have on overall job satisfaction. Romig, O'Sullivan, and Denmark (2011) and Birx, Lasalla, and Wagstaff, (2011), confirmed interpersonal relationships with coworkers to be one of the main factors influencing job satisfaction of the faculty members. Research has shown that group cohesion and positive interpersonal relationships at the workplace have direct effect on employee job satisfaction and on individual's overall well-being. Inadequate social support and negative interpersonal relationships at the workplace are related to counterproductive work behaviours, negative attitudes toward the job, and a decreased level of overall job satisfaction (Landy& Conte, 2010). The basic premise of many of these researches was that both interpersonal relationships with coworkers and managers have certain impact on job satisfaction. As mentioned before, collegial relationships are found to be based on two types of relationships: leader-member relationship (exchange) and coworker's interactions (Sherony and Green, 2002). A study conducted by Harmer and Findlay (2005) also indicated that overall job satisfaction of young workers is highly correlated with both the interpersonal relationship with the supervisor /manager and the interpersonal relationships that an individual has with his or her coworkers. Chiok (2001) explored how job satisfaction is influenced by leadership behaviours. He found significant correlations between five different leadership behaviours and employee job satisfaction; 29% of the overall job satisfaction was explained by leadership behaviours indicating that leadership behaviours are indeed one of the factors that can strongly influence employee job satisfaction. Birx, Lasalla&Wagstaff (2011) found out that interpersonal relationships at work can be influenced with the intervention programs. In their study they explored influence of a team building retreat on overall job satisfaction and group cohesion. Team building intervention was conducted with a group of participants. The intervention was found to be an effective way to increase faculty cohesion, satisfaction with coworkers and overall job satisfaction. There were statistically significant differences between pretest (before the team building retreat) and posttest (after the team building retreat) on the JDI questionnaire; scores on JDI were higher after the team building intervention indicating that participants' job satisfaction increased after the intervention. However, when the same survey was conducted at the end of semester, several months after the team building retreat, scores on JDI went back to the pretest level, indicating that the positive changes stimulated by the retreat were not maintained over the course of the semester. This indicates that follow up team building activities needs to be conducted on a regular basis in order to preserve positive effects of the team building intervention."}, {"section_title": "FACULTY JOB SATISFACTION", "text": "Job satisfaction is one of the most important variables in the field of business psychology, sociology of work, and organizational behavior.As noted before, the number of different factors may influence an individual's level of job satisfaction. The existing body of literature related to the specific factors influencing job satisfaction of the faculty members, and influence of the interpersonal and collegial relationships on job satisfaction will be further reviewed. Tack andPatitu (1992,as cited in Okpara, Squilace andErondu, 2005) highlighted the importance of conducting specific research on the faculty job satisfaction. They argued that lower level of job satisfaction of faculty members have a direct impact on quality of both educational and research-related activities that university professors conduct. They also noted that some of the factors that might influence job satisfaction in different environments may not be good predictors of the faculty members' job satisfaction, having in mind the specific characteristics of the university jobs. Bozeman and Gaughan (2011) wanted to find out if job satisfaction of the university faculty members is determined by the same factors as other workers' job satisfaction, and to explore if there are some specific aspects of the academic faculty job determining job satisfaction. In their research they have found three main determinants of faculty job satisfaction: demographic characteristics, colleague interactions, and pay motivation. However, they have found recognition of the faculty member's research by his or her peers to be the strongest predictor of job satisfaction. Gender was also predictor of job satisfaction; male faculty members were more satisfied with their jobs from their female colleagues. Additionally, perception that they are rewarded accordingly to their qualifications was also a predictor of job satisfaction. Oshagbemi (1994) conducted the study in order to explore potential differences in the levels of job satisfaction of faculty members and their managers (department heads, deans, etc.). A range of demographic characteristic and differences between faculty members at managerial positions and other academics were explored: age, gender, seniority and rank. Significant differences were found between academic managers and other faculty members on five out of eight explored aspects of the job satisfaction. Faculty members at managerial positions were found to be more satisfied in following aspects: teaching, promotions, supervisor behavior, co-workers behavior, and physical conditions/working facilities. Moreover, some of the demographic characteristics were found to be related to the levels of job satisfaction. Age, seniority and rank were positively related to the job satisfaction; older faculty members, with more years of experience and higher ranks were overall more satisfied with their jobs. Gender was, however, not found to be related to the job satisfaction in this particular study. In addition to the primary research, the secondary sources have been also analyzed in order to explore the influence that different facets of job have on faculty job satisfaction. For example, Sabharval and Corley (2009) conducted secondary data analysis from the data from the 2003 Survey of Doctorate Recipients funded by the National Science Foundation in USA in order to explore the levels of job satisfaction of faculty members, with special emphasize on how job satisfaction differ by gender and discipline. The main findings were that across all scientific disciplines men were found to have significantly higher levels of overall job satisfaction. Moreover, research productivity was found to be correlated to job satisfaction in a variety of ways in different disciplines. The highest job satisfaction for women was in health, science, social science and, lastly, engineering whereas the highest job satisfaction for men was in the fields of social sciences, engineering, and health and the lowest in the scientific disciplines. Rosser (2004) analyzed data from the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty. The results of the analysis indicated that quality of faculty work life had a direct impact on both job satisfaction and decision to stay at the particular university. The influence of each component of the quality of faculty work life was explored. Utilization of technologies was found to be the important part of the overall work life of the faculty members. Since all faculty members are expected to quickly adopt and utilize modern technologies; for some faculty members this continuous update of skills related to the use of technologies was found to be a somewhat demanding component of the work life. Committee and service work was found to be the source for dissatisfaction mostly for the junior faculty ranks; some of them perceived those duties as a barrier to earning tenure and promotion. Professional development was another strong contributor to the overall work life of faculty members in this study; travel, conferences, trainings, release time, and sabbatical leave, have been shown to be important factors in the retention of faculty members. Cultural factors were also found to have impact on faculty job satisfaction. Sabharval (2011) explored the job satisfaction of the foreign-born faculty members in order to find out how their job satisfaction compares with native-born citizens. She analyzed secondary data available from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients funded by the National Science Foundation in USA (2003). Main findings of her study were that all categories of foreign-born university faculty members (naturalized citizens, permanent, and temporary residents) showed significantly lower level of job satisfaction compared with native-born faculty members. Moreover, foreignborn faculty members were found to occupy less leadership positions then native born faculty members did, which according to Sabharval (2011) might also have influenced their level of job satisfaction. Crothers at al. (2010) explored gender differences in promotion and salary negotiation practices of female and male university faculty members in psychology departments, and its influence on job satisfaction. They have found job satisfaction and salary to be positively correlated for male faculty members, but not for the female faculty members; for female participants job satisfaction was found to be negatively correlated with the perception of negative repercussions for undertaking promotion and salary negotiations. The results of their study also indicated that the level of job satisfaction for women faculty members is related to the interpersonal relationships and overall departmental climate. Horton (2006) explored differences and similarities between faculty and staff job satisfaction, looking specifically to look at the relationship between job satisfaction and career aspirations of the university employees. According to the results of this study, faculty members had lower job satisfaction from the university staff. Majority of negative responses of the faculty members were related to issues of workload, work/life balance and university policies. Majority of the faculty members also responded that they would not choose again to work at the same institution. Additionally, faculty members also gave more negative responses related to their satisfaction with supervision, management support and communication than staff members did. This findings relate to the body of literature related to job aspirations, indicating that employee satisfaction also depends on career aspirations (higher aspirations of faculty members is related to lower level of job satisfaction). Romig (2011) conducted a literature review with an aim of examining the various factors that influence job satisfaction, especially by allied health faculty, in institutions of higher education in the U.S. Compensation, advancement opportunities, the quality of supervision and social and collegial relationships were identified as main factors influencing job satisfaction of the allied faculty members. Literature on work experience and job satisfaction was found to be limited; however, according to the literature presented in the article, years of experience did not have influence on job satisfaction. On the other hand, work experience did influence the faculty turnover with higher turnover being related to fewer years of employment. Additionally, job satisfaction seemed to be related with decision making and locus of control for some of the program directors and department heads and with the specific commitment to the department. A research conducted at the University of Windsor (Drakich et al, 2012) indicated that the relationship with the department head influenced job satisfaction of the faculty members, with a better relationship with the department head predicting a higher job satisfaction. Gender, rank and faculty positions did not significantly influence quality or satisfaction with collegial relationships in this particular study. Based on the presented literature review we can conclude that interpersonal and collegial relationships within department are found to be the influential factor of the job satisfaction for the faculty members."}, {"section_title": "3.CONCLUSION", "text": "The use of personality tests in the selection context has always been and will be a critical issue in the field of industrial and organizational psychology. This eternal question is undoubtedly increasingly more thorough, because the dilemma remains the same as half a century ago when Gottier and Guion noted that the two major problems of personality tests were forging responses to the items and low criterion validation. Although at first glance it seems that the discussion of speakers and critics has not progressed much since the positions are unchanged, there is an evident consensus on several important dilemmas that can undoubtedly affect the future status of personality tests in the selection context. In fact, despite the claims of Morgeson and his colleagues that the observed scores are the only real criterion of validation data, there is no doubt that there is consensus that the meta-analytic data can be justified and it is correct in the case of rank restriction and criterion unrealiability. Also, Morgeson and colleagues acknowledge that the relationship personality -job performance is complex and that it is dependant on the situational specificity. Also, correspondence with the Ones and Tet still led to a partial withdrawal in the stance of Morgeson and colleagues that for the personality tests in the selection context it is neccessary to look for an adequate replacement, although there are firm and steadfast conclusions for such a position, because nothing has changed in the criterion variable validation personality tests since the conclusion of Gottier and Guion . It is worrying that since the appearance of the \"revolutionary\" meta-analytic studies, personality tests are widely used in a selection of employees that, according to the available empirical data, there is no real basis for (Moregeson et al., 2007)."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH METHODOLOGY", "text": "\nSince Facebook has become a trend that is followed by all younger and older people around the world aim of this study was to measure the users' habits, their behavior on Facebook and characteristics of their character."}, {"section_title": "Subject and problems of research", "text": "This paper analyses one segment of management within a specific type of large groups, such as enterprises, where there is a clear hierarchical structure and formally defined managers' roles.

Managers' level of self-confidence was measured by a scale created by partially taking over items of S-C inventory, (Self confidence) Basavanna, adapted to our population (Djuric, 1980). The instrument has 30 items and responses are given on a six-level Likert scale (reliability-Alpha 0.80).

In a small number of managers (12.33%) locus of control is in balance. The sample does not have managers who interpret causality phenomenon with external factors. Since the values of skew (coefficient of curve distribution) and kurtosis (degree of elongation of normal distribution) are less than the limit value of 1.96, at a reliability level of 0.05, it can be concluded that the distribution of the results does not differ significantly from the normal distribution, but it is certainly moved to the right. Test results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilkinson are statistically significant at all levels of reliability, thus proving that the distribution of the results obtained in the study on a scale of locus of control does not deviate significantly from the normal distribution.

Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the influence of predictor variables of self-confidence and locus of control on the criterion variable, that is managers' striving for power. The introduction of predictors was conducted in blocks so that the first phase included self-confidence, whose predictor's contribution was to explain the 3.4% variance in striving for power and it is significant at a reliability level of 0.01. The next step was to introduce the locus of control as a predictor, but since it was found that there is a low correlation with striving for power, which is not statistically significant, it was pointless to continue to measure the predictor correlation.  Beta coefficient which confirms partial contribution of predictors of self-confidence is statistically significant at a reliability level of 0.01. Based on all of the above, it can be concluded that self-confidence can be defined as a predictor of striving for power, but not the locus of control."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION OF RESULTS", "text": "Results of the research regarding the locus of control among managers indicate that they have predominantly internal locus of control. The internalized have a strong need for achievement, high standards of work, challenging goals, control and independence. There are a smaller number of managers where the locus of control is in balance, there is an equal amount of the internal and the external one. The sample did not indicate managers whose interpretation of causality phenomenon gives preference to external factors, as it could have been expected, given the organizational culture of the company in which the study was conducted and where very high expectations of staff in managerial positions are openly communicated. Based on findings of Joe (1971) and Lefkart (1976), people with dominant internal locus of control are more successful in overcoming life problems and are better socially oriented. This manager's characteristic can be a significant predictor of their success as managers. The obtained results confirm findings by Hersch and Scheibe (1977) that internally oriented examinees show higher degree of dominance, sociability and intellectual efficiency as opposed to externally oriented ones. The findings confirm that managers have a high level of self-confidence. Gaining leadership position in the enterprise means that a person believes in their abilities and their efficiency, and could be viewed as an indicator of the existence of feelings of personal adequacy. Self-confidence plays a very important role in business decision making, problem solving, acceptance of risk, responsibilities, expectations of a positive outcome of his own actions and those of his associates. The results of the research show that the managers are a population with a characteristic high level of striving for power. These results could have been expected since people with developed striving for power prefer those positions in the organizational structure, which allow them to meet this motivational disposition. On the other hand, striving for power is connected to daily managerial demands when it comes to responsibility to influence their associates, in certain situations managers tell associates what to do, monitor their work in order to achieve better performance, convince them of validity of their opinions etc. Those are all integral activities of a manager which they use to guideline their associates' behavior, organize work activities and maintain necessary work discipline. People who avoid affecting other people, who do not want to impose and who find it difficult to tell others what to do, do not possess the characteristics that are a prerequisite for a manager. Striving for power can be seen as a dimension and managers differ in levels of development of striving for power. The results of the research confirm that managers have a high level of striving for power. People with higher level of self-confidence are less susceptible to the effects of social interaction and they tend to influence attitudes and actions of other people whereas people with lower level of self-confidence do not exert such tendency. Predictors connection of levels of self-confidence with striving for power is confirmed but not in the case of locus of control and striving for power."}, {"section_title": "Defining the problem", "text": "The problem which needs to be examined is importance of social networks like Facebook to the users, and what is the main reason for opening the profile.

These are also users who often share their photos, and which every aspect of the \"offline\" life trying to share with their online friends. \uf0a7 Facebook trend followers -users who access to Facebook because their friends follow this trend. To them Facebook is not very important as a social network, but as aninstrument of following the trend. \uf0a7 Curious Facebook users -these are the most frequent users who are, unlike the previous group, interested in the social network itself, for its functionality, as well as to follow the activities of their Facebook friends. \uf0a7 Sociable Facebook users -these are mostly the users which meet new friends on various places and who are constantly expanding their circle of friends. They have friends abroad and use Facebook as a way to communicate with physically distant friends, sharing photos with them, videos, and so on. They use a check-in option whenever they find themselves in a new, interesting place. The tables show the answers to the questions in the survey.   The largest proportion of respondents (45%) spends less then hour on Facebook. A slightly smaller percentage (35%) spends mostly two hours. Number of friends varies, but the most (30%) have more than 400 Facebook friends. Number of photos on profile is one of the indicators of how the subject is active on Facebook, and the results of the survey indicate that the lowest percentage (only 8%) of respondents have over 800 pictures in the profile, and the highest percentage (27%) have less than 50 images on profile.    The frequency of changingprofile picture also indicates the activity of users on Facebook. 5% of respondents changed the profile picture every week, but the largest percentage of respondents (32%) change their profile picture once in three months. 3% of respondents do not have a profile picture.   5% of respondents share personal information with everyone, and 8% of respondents do not share information with anyone. However, the largest proportion of respondents shares photos and information only with friends (70% and 79%). Of all respondents 73% share music with friends, and even 52% accepted the invitation for friendship from strangers. The largest proportion of respondents (40%) intensively communicates with up to 5 friends. Only 5% of respondents use Facebook as a tool to communicate with more than 15 friends. With how many friends you intensively communicate via Facebook? 2 at most 10% Between 2 and 5 40% Between 5 and 10 28% Between 10 and 15 17% More than 15. 5%  According to the survey, 57% of respondents rarely publish status, only 5% of respondents publish once a day. 10% of respondents use the option to follow people who are not their friends. 10% of respondents actively participate in discussions of Facebook groups. The largest proportion of respondents (90%) accesses their Facebook account via mobile phone. When it comes to the check-in option which Facebook users can use on their mobile devices, the survey shows that 43% of respondents use this option, of which 37% of respondents use it only at interesting places. During the analysis of poll results it was showed that 10% of respondents said that Facebook is very important to them, 42% believes that access to Facebook has a medium importance, and 15% that it have small importance (see Figure 11). Some respondents indicated that, in addition to connecting with people and sharing photos, Facebook is suitable for easy organization of dates and meetings, as well as the proper place for the collection of new information. The last question concerns the reasons for opening the Facebook profile. This is key question because in most it helps to identify to which category user belongs. The largest proportion of respondents (48%) as the reason for opening the Facebook profile states communication with friends from abroad, which, clearly, indicates that these are Sociable Facebook users. 20% of respondents said that they joined to this social network out of curiosity to see how it works and what people share with their friends, and this group of respondents belongs to the Curious Facebook users. There are 17% users who belong to the groupFacebook trend followers because they stated the influence of their friendsas the main reasonfor opening the profiles. 15% of respondents are part of categoryFacebook addicts, because,among other things, they stated that Facebook is extremely important to them, not only for socializing, but also for sharing photos, check-in and connecting with the people in general.
