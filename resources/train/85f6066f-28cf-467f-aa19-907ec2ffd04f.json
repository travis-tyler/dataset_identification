[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Defensive behavior of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) in response to models of a female Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) and a control (Spizella passerina, Passerella iliaca, or Melospiza melodia) placed near their nests was investigated in fragmented and contiguous boreal forest of western Canada. Female redstarts usually discovered and responded first to models but males also participated in nest defense. Based upon several behavioral measures, which included distraction displays, close passes or striking the model, and alarm \"chip\" or \"buzz\" vocalizations, female redstarts reacted more intensely or aggressively to the cowbird model in fragmented compared with contiguous forested landscapes. We interpret these differences as evidence that redstarts are more familiar with cowbirds in fragmented landscapes because cowbirds are more common there and pose a greater threat to this host' s reproductive success. Our findings have implications for interpretations of the demography of redstart populations and the fixation of antiparasite behavioral responses within populations. We suggest that tests using models provide a viable means of evaluating the influence of landscape matrix on the severity of cowbird exposure to host populations. "}, {"section_title": "", "text": ", long sympatric with Brown-headed Cowbirds at Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada, showed more overt nest defense behaviors in response to cowbird models presented near their nests than allopatric populations at Churchill, Manitoba. These authors attributed the persistence of such nest defense behaviors to continued introgression of genes from sympatric populations or to the low cost of such behaviors when parasites are rare. However, to date, few studies have investigated nest defense behaviors at smaller scales of geographic segregation of cowbirds and hosts or at the landscape scale (Freeman et al. 1990 ).\nPrior to European settlement of North America, Brown-headed Cowbirds were associated primarily with short-grass prairies and were absent from contiguous forests and tall grass openings (Mayfield 1965 in each landscape type (fragmented vs. contiguous forest) in order to confirm more adequately any effects of treatment on host response. In the fragmented landscape, tests were conducted along the edges of park boundaries or in wooded fragments surrounded by agricultural land. These areas had been fragmented by agriculture for at least 50 years and cowbirds were engaged in these behaviors. All other categories were quantified by counting the actual number of behaviors observed in a 5-min trial.\nWe made no assumptions about the distribution of behavioral responses and so used nonparametric tests throughout when testing for differences between models or study sites. Unless otherwise stated, tests are two-tailed and the assumed level of significance is P < 0.05. Whereas it is more appropriate to examine "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "In all trials, female redstarts were the focal bird. However, in 9 trials, we also observed male redstarts near the nest, often joining in attacks or distraction displays. On these occasions, we noted the presence and general behavior of males but continued to focus our attention on females. For this reason, male response behaviors are not examined here.\nWithin each landscape type, we detected no difference in responses of American Redstarts to either cowbird or to control models within each landscape category (Mann Whitney U-tests, P > 0.3 in all cases), and so we pooled responses within landscapes for each model type. We detected no effect of landscape in responses of female redstarts to control models with the exception of a greater number of strikes against the control in fragmented compared with contiguous forest (Mann Whitney u-test; P < 0.05, Table 1 ). However, as measured by several behavioral categories, redstarts responded more aggressively toward the female cowbird model in fragmented landscapes than in contiguous forest (Table 1) . Although redstarts spent a similar amount of time close to cowbird and control models in both landscapes, they changed perch more frequently in fragmented habitats in response to the cowbird model; this was related to more aggressive behaviors such as strikes, as well as distraction displays and associated behaviors, such as tail fanning and bill gaping. Redstarts also uttered more \"chip\" and \"buzz\" vocalizations in response to the cowbird model in fragmented compared with contiguous forests (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We hypothesized that redstart populations would consistently exhibit more overt nest defense behaviors in fragmented forests than in extensively forested landscapes. This was indeed the case, even when extensive forest sites were relatively close (within 20 km) to fragmented forests with high cowbird abundance. Our results agree with the few previous studies investigating host defenses in sympatric and allopatric populations (Briskie et al. 1992 ). However, ours is the first study to reveal that such population differences also may be driven by landscape rather than larger-scale geographic effects contributing to differential distributions of cowbirds relative to their hosts. Our results emphasize the fact that forest fragmentation may influence the degree of sympatry of potential hosts with Brown-headed Cowbirds, and subsequently influence the establishment of antiparasite behaviors at the population level. These findings are surprising given the proximity of our contiguous forest sites to areas of high cowbird abundance. Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (available from the authors, Price et al. 1995) show a distinct peak in the abundance of cowbirds in the Great Plains, and relatively contribute to the differentiation of nest defense behavward decrease can be seen from the prairies of southiors between the two landscape types.

Our study indicates that the large-scale patterns in variance in host response to cowbird models or in nest cowbird abundance and parasitism frequencies dedefense in general has been noted by other researchers scribed above do not necessarily override effects of (Roe11 and Bossema 1982, Regelmann and Curio 1983, habitat configuration and landscape structure at the reSealy et al, in press). Such variation may be associated gional scale.

Our findings raise important questions about the relative importance of inherited and learned components of nest defense behavior, and the role of dispersal in the spread of these components. In Passerines, natal dispersal is substantially more extensive than breeding dispersal (Greenwood and Harvey 1982) . Although the extent of natal dispersal movements is currently unknown for American Redstarts, their very low natal philopatry suggests that redstarts disperse over long distances in their first year (Lemon et al. 1996, Sherry and Holmes 1997) . Hence, most of the dispersal between fragmented and contiguous boreal forests probably results from natal dispersal. The fact that females exhibited a lower response to cowbird models in contiguous forest sites suggests that either the learned component of nest defense behaviors dominates the inherited component, or that dispersal movements over the spatial scales considered here (20-100 km) are In this study, we have assumed that cowbirds were infrequent or absent in extensively forested landscapes. This assumption cannot be tested, however, because cowbird censuses for all of our sites are not available. However, data from northern Alberta indicate that, depending upon the year considered, cowbirds were 2.5 to 5.5 times less frequent in the contiguous forested landscape near Calling Lake than in an agricultural landscape 70 km to the south (S. Hannon, pers. comm.). Furthermore, previous studies investigating cowbird movements and frequency of parasitism support the assumption that cowbirds do not penetrate deep into extensively forested areas (Coker and Capen 1995) . In the central Missouri Ozarks, an area with over 90% of the landscape forested, parasitism frequencies were 5% (Robinson et al. 1995 Although models of cowbird intruders placed near nests cannot fully elicit the behavioral nest defense repertoire of hosts, this approach nevertheless has a number of advantages when conducted in a standardized fashion. As we have shown, this approach readily allows the comparison of nest defense behaviors among discrete populations (Sealy et al., in press) . The distraction displays we recorded were consistent with those described previously and also involved a rich repertoire of gaping, bill snapping, crouching, and tail fanning (Ficken 1962) . Reactions by redstarts to model cowbirds also involved behaviors recorded previously in actual encounters with live cowbirds (Sturm 1945 , Ficken 1961 ). The \"chip\" vocalization we recorded apparently is a general alarm response used by redstarts in antagonistic encounters (Ficken 1962) and is similar to that recorded for Yellow Warblers responding to models of predators and cowbirds placed near their nests Sealy 1989, Gill and Sealy 1996) . We are less certain whether the \"buzz\" vocalization we witnessed corresponds to alarm vocalizations previously described for this species (\"screech,\" \"hiss.\" or \"snarl:\" Hickev 1940. Ficken 1961 Ficken . 1962 ). Hobson and Sealy (1989) hescribed sitting in the nest as an antiparasite strategy of Yellow Warblers, a behavior that was usually accompanied by a \"seet\" vocalization. Further studies designed to identify whether redstarts emit a specific vocalization in response to cowbirds would be useful. Benson (1939) described redstarts sitting in their nests in response to live cowbirds but not to other species that came near their nests. We also detected this response most frequently in redstarts that occupied fragmented habitats.\nCowbirds are difficult to census in forests (Rothstein and Fleischer 1987), and their actual penetration into forests is difficult to quantify. Our study suggests that for some potential hosts, the use of behavioral trials with cowbird and control models, in addition to observed frequencies of cowbird parasitism, may provide a more powerful means of evaluating historical and contemporary influences of cowbirds in different landscapes. Our understanding of factors influencing behavioral responses in American Redstarts and other cowbird hosts also is elementary and there are multiple areas where further research is needed. In particular, it would be most useful to more carefully document the "}]
