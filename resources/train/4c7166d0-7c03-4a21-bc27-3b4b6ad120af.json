[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Based on associations between sleep spindles, cognition, and sleep-dependent memory processing, here we evaluated potential relationships between levels of CSF A\u03b2 42 , P-tau, and T-tau with sleep spindle density and other biophysical properties of sleep spindles in a sample of cognitively normal elderly individuals.\nMethods: One-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and morning to early afternoon CSF collection were performed to measure CSF A\u03b2 42 , P-tau and T-tau. Seven days of actigraphy were collected to assess habitual total sleep time.\nResults: Spindle density during NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep was negatively correlated with CSF A\u03b2 42 , P-tau and T-tau. From the three, CSF T-tau was the most significantly associated with spindle density, after adjusting for age, sex and ApoE4. Spindle duration, count and fast spindle density were also negatively correlated with T-tau levels. Sleep duration and other measures of sleep quality were not correlated with spindle characteristics and did not modify the associations between sleep spindle characteristics and the CSF biomarkers of AD.\nReduced spindles during N2 sleep may represent an early dysfunction related to tau, possibly reflecting axonal damage or altered neuronal tau secretion, rendering it a potentially novel biomarker for early neuronal dysfunction. Given their putative role in memory consolidation and neuroplasticity, sleep spindles may represent a mechanism by which tau impairs memory consolidation, as well as a possible target for therapeutic interventions in cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "With 10% of adults over the age of 65 suffering from dementia [1, 2] and this number projected to double by 2050 [3] , understanding the factors responsible for cognitive impairment is of critical importance [4] . Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are two key pathological processes that are thought to lead to cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 and tau concentrations have been used extensively as biomarkers of AD pathology and found to correlate with plaques and tangles at post-mortem [5] [6] [7] [8] . Emerging evidence suggests that the sleep-wake cycle directly influences their levels in older adults [9, 10] . Specifically, low NREM stage 3 (N3) slow wave activity (SWA) is associated, in healthy midlife and young-old, with trait-markers of high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 [11, 12] , while active disruption of slow wave sleep (SWS) results in state-dependent CSF A\u03b2 peptide increases within subjects [13] . Sleep disruption has also been associated with increased tau pathology in both animal models [14] [15] [16] [17] and humans [18] , but the precise mechanisms are not known. Unlike A\u03b2, associations between poor SWS and CSF tau have not been reported [12, 13] , suggesting that disruption in other sleep oscillations could be linked to tau pathology.\nCortical sleep spindles are [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Hz bursts of activity generated within the thalamo-cortical network that occur during N2-3 and have been defined as slow or fast based on their spectral frequency [19] . A decrease in sleep spindle activity is a good candidate to be associated with tau pathology for several reasons. First, early structures affected by NFTs include sleep/wake regulating centers such as the locus coeruleus [20] , suggesting that changes to sleep architecture might be one of the early outward manifestations of tau pathology. Second, sleep spindles are known to decline with age [21, 22] , with a specific decline in fast spindles in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD that predicts low MMSE scores [23] . Third, sleep spindles are also associated with sleep-dependent improvement in motor learning [24] [25] [26] [27] and memory [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , with differential roles for fast and slow spindles depending on age [35] [36] [37] . A decrease in these neuroplasticity-promoting processes could render a greater vulnerability to the spread of tau pathology. Therefore, the mutual associations of cognition with both tau and sleep spindles raises the possibility of ties between them, particularly in older adults. Indeed, NFT load corresponds more closely to cognitive status than A\u03b2 plaques [38] , and both AD and MCI patients show significant spindle density reductions [23] . In this study, we sought to determine the relationship between sleep spindle activity in N2 and CSF biomarkers in a population of cognitively normal older adults. We carried out additional analyses looking into other spindle biophysical properties such as spindle count, duration, peak frequency, and slow/fast spindle density. We also explored whether sleep quality measured with polysomnography or habitual sleep duration measured with actigraphy is associated with CSF AD biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and clinical evaluation", "text": "Fifty subjects were recruited from a pool of healthy elderly participating in NIH-supported longitudinal studies on normal aging and biomarkers of AD at NYU.

To restore normality for regression analyses, a square root transformation was applied to spindle density in N2, spindle count in N2 and fast spindle density in N2, while natural log transformations were applied to WASO, AHI4%, AHI-all, arousal index and CSF variables. Box-Cox transformation was applied to spindle duration and SE. Before conducting the regression analyses, we checked for inter-correlations between all the above variables.

No associations were observed between spindle density and age, likely a consequence of the relatively restricted age range of our sample. Similarly, although women generally have higher spindle density than men [21, 48] , in this sample there were no significant differences in N2 spindle density across sex (males: 1.9 \u00b1 1.3 #/min N2 sleep, females: 2.2 \u00b1 1.5 #/min N2 sleep, p = 0.566)."}, {"section_title": "Association between N2 spindle density, CSF tau proteins and A\u03b2 42", "text": "Pairwise unadjusted and conditional (on age, sex and ApoE4 status) correlations between the CSF biomarkers of AD and N2 sleep spindles density are presented in Table 2 .

The pairwise correlation coefficients adjusted for age, sex and ApoE4 status, given above the main diagonal, show a similar pattern and indicate that the conditional associations were even stronger than the unadjusted ones. In addition to individual CSF protein levels, the ratios between T-tau/A\u03b2 42 and P-tau/ A\u03b2 42 have been used as AD biomarkers. Spindle density during N2 sleep was also found to be negatively correlated with the ratio of T-tau/A\u03b2 42 (r = \u2212 0.380, p = 0.010) and P-tau/A\u03b2 42 (r = \u2212 0.31, p = 0.043).\nTo evaluate the relative strength of the association of each of the CSF biomarkers with N2 spindle density, we conducted hierarchical regression analysis with N2 spindle density as the response and each of the CSF biomarkers as the predictors. The results are given in Table 3 . The model with only the age, sex, and ApoE4 genotype and no CSF predictors explained 12.8% of the variance in spindle density (Model 1).

Finally, inclusion of pairs of CSF biomarkers together (Model 3) showed that in the presence of T-tau or P-tau, A\u03b2 42 did not remain a significant predictor of N2 spindle density, while T-tau and P-tau remained significant predictors in the presence of A\u03b2 42 , albeit with T-tau having greater predictive value. There was a dramatic decrease in magnitude of the coefficients for A\u03b2 42 from Model 2, where it is the single CSF measure, to Model 3, where it is together with T-tau (Table 3) , while the T-Tau coefficients remained unchanged or increased in strength in the presence of A\u03b2 42 . This suggests the principle importance of T-tau among the three CSF biomarkers in their association with N2 spindle density."}, {"section_title": "CSF measures of tau do not correlate with measures of sleep quality or habitual sleep duration", "text": "In order to ascertain that the influence of tau is specific to spindles, we investigated potential relationships between T-tau and P-tau and sleep quality variables measured with PSG, including sleep efficiency, WASO, AHI4% and AHI-all, as well as variables measured with actigraphy, including habitual sleep duration (TST). We did not observe any correlations between T-tau or P-tau and any of these measures at baseline (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ).\nTo further confirm the specificity of sleep spindles in predicting CSF T-tau, we conducted hierarchical regression analysis with CSF T-tau as the response variable with several sleep measures as predictors ( Table 4 ). The baseline model with age, sex, and ApoE4 genotype alone without sleep predictors explained 7.7% of the variance in CSF T-tau (Model 4, Table 4 ).

The addition of comorbidities including presence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and thyroid disorders did not influence the relationship between N2 density and CSF T-tau (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). There were also no significant correlations between N2 spindle density and any of the other sleep variables examined in this cohort. In a related model, we conducted hierarchical regression analysis with the CSF T-tau/A\u03b2 42 ratio as the response variable with several sleep measures as predictors.

Fast spindles can be functionally differentiated from slow spindles by their greater tendency to nest within oscillations and promote memory processing [49] . In linear regression models where CSF T-tau, age, sex, and ApoE4 genotype where held constant as predictor variables, we observed that CSF T-tau explained 25% of the variance in N2 spindle count (F (4, 49) =3.77, p = 0.010), 45% of the variance in spindle duration (F (4, 49) =9.23, p < 0.001), and 41% of the variance in fast spindle density (F (4, 49) =7.90, p < 0.001) (Additional file 4: Table S3 ).\nThe cohort examined in this study contains significant overlap with subjects in which we found associations between measures of SWS and CSF A\u03b2 42 (39/50 subjects) [12] .

While attenuated SWS has been shown to be associated with elevated CSF A\u03b2 [12, 13] as well as increased PET amyloid uptake [51] , other changes in sleep oscillations have not been well characterized with respect to other AD biomarkers. In this study, we investigated the relationship between sleep spindles and CSF T-tau, P-tau and A\u03b2 42 in a population of older cognitively normal adults. Spindle density in N2 sleep was significantly correlated with CSF T-tau, P-tau and A\u03b2 42 both unadjusted and after adjustment for age, sex, and ApoE4. Nonetheless, because of the inter-correlations between CSF T-tau, P-tau and A\u03b2 42 , we posit that the association between A\u03b2 42 and spindle density might be largely driven by the primary association of CSF tau with spindle density. This was supported by the loss of significant associations between CSF A\u03b2 42 and spindle density when CSF T-tau or P-tau was included as a covariate. We interpret the association of low spindle density with elevated CSF T-tau and P-tau as representative of increased AD risk. It is less clear that the association of low spindle density with elevated CSF A\u03b2 42 is also reflective of increased AD risk, given that CSF A\u03b2 42 is lower in bonafide AD dementia subjects when compared to age matched controls [52] . That said, how CSF A\u03b2 42 changes over time, particularly in cognitively normal individuals who may be remote from developing symptoms remains a matter of some debate. For example, individuals with dominantly inherited AD have higher concentrations of CSF A\u03b2 42 on average than controls 20 or more years from estimated symptom onset that then decline more rapidly [53, 54] . Additionally, recent data from the NYU, ADNI and NACC cohorts suggests an early preclinical stage, marked by CSF elevations in tau accompanied by elevations in CSF A\u03b2 42 which were largely observed in younger age quartiles (between 45 and 70 years of age), indicating that elevated CSF A\u03b2 42 might also be associated with very early preclinical AD risk [55] . When viewing CSF A\u03b2 42 in isolation, we cannot rule out the possibility that low spindle density being associated with elevated A\u03b2 42 might be protective. However, it is worth highlighting that spindle density was also significantly inversely correlated with CSF T-tau/ A\u03b2 42 and P-tau/A\u03b2 42 which is meaningful because these CSF ratios have predicted decline from normal cognition in cognitively normal older adults over a 1-8 year follow-up period [56] .\nIn addition to total spindle density, we also found evidence that spindle duration and fast spindle density during N2 sleep are significantly associated with CSF T-tau. Of note, a decrement in total spindle density and fast spindle density has also been observed in AD patients, who presumably have high brain tau load [57] . When evaluating other properties of sleep, we confirmed our prior observation that frontal SWA is associated with CSF A\u03b2 42 , however, SWA, SE, WASO and number of arousals during sleep were not correlated with CSF tau proteins in this sample.\nThis seeming specificity of CSF T-tau for spindles stands in potential contrast to recent findings suggesting that measures of subjective sleep quality by questionnaire were negatively correlated with both CSF T-tau/ A\u03b2 42 and P-tau/A\u03b2 42 ratios [58] . This may be explained by differences in the use of subjective versus objective measures of sleep used in this study. Several other observations suggest that sleep disruptions from a variety of sources including insomnia [59] , OSA [60] [61] [62] and arousals measured with actigraphy [18] increase risk for cognitive decline and development of AD. Our current results support further longitudinal investigation into whether spindle density is a sleep variable that also increases AD risk. Of note, spindle density did not correlate with general measures of sleep quality in these older subjects without documented sleep disorders, highlighting the utility of multidimensional and oscillation-specific analysis of sleep physiology such as the one used in this study.\nWhile any correlation can represent an epiphenomenon, the observed associations between sleep spindles and CSF T-tau warrant thinking about possible mechanistic underpinnings that link the two. One possibility to consider is that accumulating tau negatively impacts the generation of spindles. Spindles are thought to largely evolve from a thalamo-cortical feedback loop involving thalamic reticular neuron inhibition of thalamic relay neurons. Tau is not thought to accumulate in thalamic reticular neurons, but tau in cortical neurons could affect this circuit. Tau in brainstem neurons projecting to thalamic reticular neurons could be involved [63] [64] [65] , but would be expected to have more diffuse effects on sleep. In any such cases, reduced spindle density could serve as a biomarker of this pathological process [65] .\nThe converse possibility is that sleep spindles reduce the production or increase the metabolism of tau. Animal studies have shown that neuronal activity can promote tau production [66, 67] , however, spindles are an organized network pattern, and do not represent a simple decrease in overall network activity [19] . Additionally, sleep in general has been associated with immune function [68] and an increase in interstitial space in the brain [69] , both of which constitute plausible mechanisms contributing toward reducing extracellular soluble tau in the brain. To date however, a specific role for sleep spindles in these processes has not been identified. Irrespective of a full understanding of the mechanism, the ability to manipulate sleep spindles with drugs [70] or with greater temporal precision using oscillating acoustic or other stimuli [71] establishes intriguing opportunities to test a causal role for sleep spindles in tau aggregation in human subjects.\nFinally, spindle density and CSF tau levels could be associated by being common downstream consequences of an upstream process. For example, tau is released in response to axonal injuries (often from traumatic brain injury) at the time of injury and before frank evidence of neurodegeneration is present. Because we observed associations of sleep spindles with both CSF T-tau and P-tau, we cannot completely infer whether any association is more strongly tied to axonal injury versus formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In subjects with moderate to severe diffuse axonal injury, sleep spindle amplitude and peak frequency were significantly reduced acutely with subsequent return to baseline levels commensurate with functional improvement over 1 year [72] . Tauopathy is also observed in other neurodegenerative disorders including frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), primary age related tauopathy and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. If there is a common upstream process that generally promotes tauopathy, reduced spindle density could be a corresponding consequence. In a study that included analysis of sleep spindles in subjects with PSP, spindle density was markedly reduced [73] , supporting this idea.\nLimitations of this work include the fact that the NPSG can itself alter sleep quality [74] in ways that vary between subjects. However, it should be noted that all subjects completed home monitoring for OSA screening prior to the in-lab NPSG that constituted the source of sleep data. Also, while we strived to perform LPs at a consistent time of day, the time interval between the LP and NPSG was variable and could constitute a source of variance. However, there is low intra-individual variability over 6 months to 2 years in CSF levels of T-tau, P-tau and A\u03b2 42 [75] . Finally, it bears noting that when using a preclinical AD classification [76] , our cohort contains a distribution of putative AD pathology, ranging from 48% without evidence for either CSF A\u03b2 42 or tau to 8% that have presence of both CSF A\u03b2 42 and tau above biomarker cutoffs. Therefore caution is warranted in interpreting the prognostic value of sleep spindle density, and studies tracking how sleep spindles change longitudinally along the progression of AD should be insightful."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, we report that spindles during N2 sleep are negatively correlated with CSF T-tau levels and to a lesser degree to CSF P-tau and CSF A\u03b2 42 . Further, sleep quality measures were not correlated with these CSF measures. These results indicate that poor sleep quality alone does not reduce spindle occurrence and is unlikely to be an explanatory factor in the observed associations between spindle density and levels of CSF tau. While reductions in NREM sleep oscillations, including SWS and spindles, may reflect a preclinical AD state, it remains unclear just how these attenuated oscillations are mechanistically linked to the cellular processes regulating A\u03b2 and tau. Candidate mechanisms would include patterned activity-driven synthesis or degradation of such molecules or the coupling of such oscillations to neuro-immune function. Longitudinal and interventional studies to assess changes in sleep oscillations as well as AD biomarkers are needed.
