The development of statistical approaches for the joint modelling of the temporal changes of imaging, biochemical, and clinical biomarkers is of paramount importance for improving the understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, and for providing a reference for the prediction and quantification of the pathology in unseen individuals.

The correct understanding of the relationship between the different pathological features is of paramount importance for improving the identification of pathological changes in patients, and for better treatment. To this end, the recent availability of collections of imaging and clinical data in NDDs is a unique opportunity to define statistical models for the joint modelling of the temporal changes of imaging, biochemical, and clinical biomarkers.\nThe goal of disease progression modeling in NDDs is twofolds: 1) quantifying the dynamics of NDDs along with the related temporal relationship between different biomarkers, and 2) staging patients based on individual observations for diagnostic and interventional purposes. The related challenge is in the definition of optimal methods to integrate and jointly analyze the heterogeneous and highly multi-modal information available to clinicians. Moreover, longitudinal clinical datasets of NDDs generally lack of a well-defined temporal reference, since the onset of the pathology may vary across individuals according to genetic and environmental factors [12] . Therefore, age or visit date information are biased time references for the individual longitudinal measurements.\nTo tackle this problem, in [3] the authors proposed to model the temporal biomarker trajectories as a random effect regression problem, building on the well established theory of self-modeling regression [6] . Practically, the trajectories are modelled by monotonic B-splines, and the estimation is performed by subsequent minimization of the partial residuals sum of squares associated with regression parameters and individual time shift, respectively. Based on the assumption of a logistic curve shape for the average biomarker trajectories, [11] frames the random effect regression model in a Riemannian setting, in which the random effects identify individual time-shift and acceleration factors. Finally, image-based progression models have been recently proposed [13, 2] , based on time-reparameterization of voxel/mesh-based measures. While the main focus of current works mainly concerns the modeling of neurodegeneration, the use of disease progression models for predictive purposes is much less investigated. Predictive models of patient staging were proposed within the setting of event based models [4] , or still through random effect modeling [5] . However, the event based model relies on the coarse binary discretization of the biomarker changes, and does not account for longitudinal observations, while the model proposed in [5] requires cohorts with known disease onset, and therefore does not easily generalise to the study of general clinical populations.\nIn this study we propose an unified approach to the consistent disease progression modeling and probabilistic prediction of clinical data, by introducing a Bayesian regression framework of imaging and clinical biomarker progressions from time series of individual observations. The model is based on Gaussian process (GP) regression, and is formulated to account for individual random effects and time reparameterization, as well to naturally account for missing observations. The methodological contribution of this study consists in reformulating disease progression modeling within a Bayesian context, allowing non-parametric estimates of the biomarker evolution, as well as high flexibility in specifying random effects structure, and time reparameterization models. The uniqueness of the time transformation is enforced by imposing a monotonicity constraint on the trajectories, via a prior on the temporal derivatives, while the model is computationally efficient thanks to the block-wise algebraic structure of the GP covariance function. From the application point of view, the proposed approach enables novel applications of disease progression modeling such as the probabilistic prediction of disease staging in unseen patients. Moreover, the model naturally accounts for missing data, and allows for uncertainty quantification of both evolutions and parameters.\nSection 2 introduces the proposed GP regression model of joint temporal progression of biomarkers, along with the prior derivatives specification. The resulting posterior and approximated inference scheme through expectation propagation (EP) is described in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 illustrates the validation of our model on i) synthetic data and ii) clinical and multivariate imaging measurements from a cohort of 517 amyloid positive individuals of the ADNI database. The experimental results show that our model provides a biologically plausible description of the evolution of AD across the whole disease time-span, as well as statistically significant prediction of disease staging and high classification accuracy on unseen and incomplete testing data."}, {"section_title": "Gaussian process-based random effect modeling of longitudinal progressions", "text": "In what follows, longitudinal measurements of N b biomarkers {b 1 , . . . , b N b } over time are given for N individuals. We represent the longitudinal biomarker's measures associated with each individual j as a multidimensional array (y j (t 1 ), y j (t 2 ), . . . , y j (t k j )) sampled at k j multiple time points t = {t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t k j }. Although different biomarkers may be in reality sampled at different time-points, for sake of notation simplicity in what follows we will assume, without loss of generality, that the sampling time is common among them. The observations for individual j at a single time point t are thus a random sample from the following generative model:\nwhere\nis the fixed effect function modelling the biomarker's longitudinal evolution, \u03bd\nthe individual random effect, and = ( b1 , b2 , . . . , b N b ) is observational noise independent from time. The group-wise evolution is modelled as a zero-mean GP, f \u223c GP(0, \u03a3 G ), the individual random effects are assumed to be Gaussian distributed correlated signal \u03bd j \u223c N (0, \u03a3 S ), while the observational noise is assumed to be a Gaussian heteroskedastic term\nFixed Effect Process. The covariance function \u03a3 G describes the biomarkers temporal variability, and is represented as a block-diagonal matrix\nwhere each block represents the within-biomarker temporal covariance expressed as a negative squared exponential function:\nand where the parameters \u03b7 b and l b are the marginal variance and length-scale of the biomarker's temporal evolution, respectively. Individual Random Effects. The random covariance function \u03a3 S models the individual deviation from the fixed effect, and is represented as a block-diagonal matrix\nwhere each block \u03a3 j b corresponds to the covariance function associated with the individual process \u03bd j b (t). Thanks to the flexibility of the proposed generative model, any form of the random effect covariance \u03a3 S can be easily specified in order to model the subject-specific biomarkers' progression. In what follows we will use a linear covariance form\n, where t is the average observational time for individual j, if more than 4 measurements were available, and\n2 if 2 or 3 measurements were available, while assigning it to 0 otherwise. This choice is motivated by stability concerns, in order to keep the model complexity compatible with the generally limited number of measurements available for each individual. Individual time transformation. The generative model (1) is based on the key assumption that the longitudinal observations across different individuals are defined with respect to the same temporal reference. This assumption may be invalid when the temporal alignment of the individual observations with respect to the common group-wise model is unknown, for instance in the typical scenario of a clinical trial in AD where the patients' observational time is relative to the common baseline, and where the disease onset is a latent event (past or future) which is not directly measurable. We assume that each individual measurement is made with respect to an absolute time-frame \u03c4 through a time-warping function t = \u03c6 j (\u03c4 ) that models the time-reparameterization with respect to the common group-wise evolution. Model (1) can thus be reparameterized as\nThe present formulation allows the specification of any kind of time transformation, and in what follows we shall focus on the modelling of a linear reparameterization of the observational time \u03c6 j (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 + d j . This modeling assumption is mostly motivated by the choice of working with a reasonably limited number of parameters, compatibly with the generally short follow-up time available per individual (cfr. Table 3 ). Within this setting, the time-shift d j encodes the disease stage associated with the individual relatively to the group-wise model.\nOverall, model (4) is identified by (N j + 3)N b + N j parameters, represented by the fixed effects and noise\nk=1 , by the individual random effects parameters \u03b8\nk=1 and by the time-shifts d j . Monotonic constraint in multimodal GP regression. Due to the nonparametric nature of Gaussian process regression, we need an additional constraint on model (4) in order to identify a unique solution for the time-warp. By assuming a steady temporal evolution of biomarkers from normal to pathological values, we shall assume that the biomarker trajectories described by (4) follow a (quasi) monotonic behaviour. This requirement can be implemented by imposing a prior positivity constraint on the derivatives of the GP function f . Inspired by [10] , we impose a monotonicity constraint by assuming a probit-likelihood for the derivative measurements m(t) associated with the derivative process\u1e1f (t) = df (t) dt at time t:\nwith \u03a6(z) = k=1 to the value of e-6. This choice for the parameter is motivated by the need to enforce a strong monotonicity constraint, necessary for the stability of the initial time-shift estimation. On adding a monotonic constraint to the individual observations. By following a similar construction, we could equally enforce a monotonic behaviour to the random effects associated with the individual trajectories. This additional constraint would however come with a cumbersome increase of the model complexity, since it would introduce an additional layer of virtual derivative parameters (with associated location) per individual. Moreover, while we are interested in modeling a globally monotonic biomarker trajectory on the fixed parameters, we relax this constraint at the individual level, since some subjects may be characterised by non strictly monotonic time-series due to specific clinical conditions."}, {"section_title": "Joint Model: marginal likelihood and inference", "text": "Given the sets of individual biomarker measurements y = {(y j (t i ))\n, and\nfor the progression of each biomarker b k , the random effect GP model posterior is:\nwhere\n.

This preliminary selection is aimed to validate the model on a clinical population likely to represent the whole disease time-span.\nThe model was trained on a group including normal individuals, mild cognitive impairment subjects converted to AD (MCI conv), and AD patients having at least one measurement for each of the following biomarkers: volumetric measures (hippocampal, ventricular, entorhinal, and whole brain volumes), glucose metabolism (average normalized FDG uptake in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, precuneus and parietal cortex), brain amyloidosys (average normalized AV45 uptake in frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, precuneus and parietal cortex), and cognitive function measured by common cognitive questionnaires (ADAS13, RAVLT learning score, FAQ). The testing set was composed by the remaining subjects with at least a missing biomarker, as well as by the subgroup of MCI non converted to AD during the observational time (MCI stable). The volumetric measures were scaled by the individual total intracranial volume, and all the biomarkers measurements were converted into quantile scores (0 to 1 for normal to abnormal values).

The method was applied to the training data by using the standard parameters defined in the R package grace 4 . Results. The estimated biomarker progression ( Figure 1) shows a biologically plausible description of the pathological evolution, compatible with previous findings in longitudinal studies in familial AD [1] . The progression is defined on a time scale spanning roughly 20 years, and is characterized at the initial stages by high-levels of AV45, followed by an increase in ventricles volume and abnormality of FDG uptake. These latter measures are however heterogeneously distributed across clinical groups, and with rather large variability. The evolution is further characterized by increasing abnormality of the volumetric measures, and finally by the steady worsening of neuropsychological scores such as FAQ. Figure 2 shows the posterior predicted distribution of the individual time shift. Healthy individuals are associated with the early stages of the pathology in both training and testing data, while MCI and AD patients are characterized by respectively intermediate and late predicted progression stages. The group-wise comparison between the expected time-shifts is statistically significant between each group pairs (p <1e-4). Furthermore, the temporal positioning of the non converting MCI lies between controls and MCI converters: when using the temporal cut-off based on the 10 th quantile of the time-shift distribution in the training AD population (t = 3.6 years) we obtained an accuracy of 0.84 for the discrimination between MCI converters and stable in the testing data.
