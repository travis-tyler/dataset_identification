[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "In any moving container contain with liquid should generate the liquid sloshing inside which can affect a system dynamics and performance. As an example, a hazardous overturns of a large liquid cargo from the forces induced by the slosh [1] . Therefore, slosh control is important in suppressing the residual slosh induced by the container motion [2] .\nLiquid slosh control system is a class of the underactuated mechanical systems. This class of system is well known for the very challenging problem of the controller design due to the small number of input space dimension compared to its controlled variable. In recent decades, various control strategies for slosh control systems have been widely reported [1] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] . The common ground shared in these reported works are hard to apply in practice due to their control designs derived based on the model of the systems. This is because of the control designs normally impose a huge gap between control theory and real applications due to the unmodeled dynamics problem. In order to vanish this gap, control researchers are now diverting to model-free control approach, since its controller design is based on only the input and output data measurement of actual process plants. In other words, this scheme does not explicitly include any parts or the whole of plant models, which make its control performance independence of the plant model accuracy. Particularly, a model-free proportional-integralderivative (PID) tuning is one of the promising model-free control strategies due to its simplicity, understandable and more reliable to the industrial usage.\nIt is crucial to design a PID tuning scheme that perform lesser computation time. For example, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) approach has been widely implemented in the data-driven controller tuning due to its effectiveness in using only two objective functions to update the controller parameters [2] , [9] , [10] . Nevertheless, there is a probability that the of design parameters in SPSA changed to huge values and abruptly trapped in an unpractical region. In order to solve this weakness, the modified SPSA algorithm is introduced in [11] , where the saturation function is used to avoid the unstable solution during the optimization [2] . However, with the introduction of this saturation function, there are additional parameters to be determine in advanced, which may require a lot of effort. Moreover, the saturation function will also limit the searching capability of the algorithm. In order to overcome these problems, the safe experimentation dynamics (SED) [12] , [13] based method is seen a promising tool for this view point. It is because the SED algorithm produces stable convergence, less parameters to be used and robust to any disturbance and uncertain dynamics changes during tuning process. Hitherto, there are few works to discuss the application of the SED to model-free PID tuning problems. Therefore, it would be useful to investigate the proposed method competency in tuning the slosh control system. This research thus implements the SED algorithm in a datadriven PID tuning for slosh control system. The proposed controller effectiveness will be evaluated by numerical examples. Hence, the efficiency of the tuning scheme will be evaluated based on the tracking performance, control input energy and computation time. Furthermore, a comparative assessment between the SED based method and SPSA based method, are discussed.\nThe reminder of this paper is structured as follows; the datadriven PID controller problem formulation for slosh control tuning is expressed in Section II. While in section III, the safe experimentation dynamics implementation is explained. Section IV presented the simulation results and discussion. Finally, a conclusion of findings is presented in section V.\nNotation: R and + R respectively symbolize the set of real numbers and the set of positive real numbers."}, {"section_title": "II.

It displays that, the objective function is successfully minimized by SED based method after 400 iterations. Since SED algorithm only requires one objective function evaluation per iteration, it requires 400 iterations to obtain equivalent number of objective function evaluation compared with SPSA based method. The optimal design parameters are shown in Table II , while the control performances, in terms of the objective function, norm of error and norm of input, are depicted in Table III . Based on the results, it reveals that the SED based method is capable to minimize the objective function more efficient than SPSA based method. The average computation time taken by SED method also lesser than SPSA method (refer Table III ).\nNext, the cart position responses are shown in Fig.5 for both methods, where the black colored line indicated the reference signal for the cart position, the blue colored line indicated the initial response of the cart position, while the red and green colored lines were indicated the response after 200 iterations for SPSA and 400 iterations for SED respectively. Based on the graph, the time taken for the cart to settle at the desired position is around 11s for the SED based method and 12s for the SPSA based method. In terms of slosh response as shown in Fig. 6 , the SED based method successfully reduces the slosh magnitude. Nevertheless, a significant minimum value of control input energy is used by SED approach as compared to SPSA, as shown in Fig. 7 . "}, {"section_title": "V.
