[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In December 2019, a new form of pneumonia was described in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the city of Wuhan, province of Hubei, China [1]. Soon after, a new beta-coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of that disease [2]. The new virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease was called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. Since its initial discovery, COVID-19 has become a pandemic of catastrophic proportions, with over 17 million confirmed cases of viral infection and over 670,000 deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, last accessed on July 30th, 2020).\nNumerous demographic, clinical, genetic, and behavioral factors have been identified to influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, among those infected, the severity of the disease, including the risk of death. Those factors include age, sex [3], genetic loci of certain cytokines/chemokines and the ABO blood system group [4, 5], smoking history [6], obesity and underlying comorbidities such diabetes, hypertension, lung diseases [7, 8], and cancer [9\u201311]. Among cancer patients, those with malignancies of hematological origin have been reported as particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 [12].\nSARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that replicates using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. As such, the virus is subjected to high rates of nucleotide sequence changes, and has evolved through molecular evolution and founder effects during its explosive spread throughout the globe. Virus replication rates directly impact the accumulation of mutations in the virus genome, enabling the existence of a viral quasispecies (a swarm of different, yet highly related, viral entities) within an infected host. Although within-host variations of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented [13, 14], the impact of underlying comorbidities that promote persistent viral RNA detection and shedding on virus evolution remains to be elucidated. Moreover, viral genetic variation, as a source of novel mutations, may hinder future therapeutic antiviral and vaccine strategies targeting COVID-19, by the selection of drug-resistant and vaccine escape mutants [15].\nIn the present work, we have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (non-cancer controls) employing next-generation sequencing (NGS), and analyzed their epidemiological relatedness and lineage classification. This approach also allowed us to study the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantify intrahost viral genetic diversity and characterize specific genetic changes with potential to impact the virus biology. Finally, we have also assessed associations between viral diversity and patients\u2019 clinical and laboratory characteristics, thereby identifying determinant factors of viral evolution in this particular group of patients."}, {"section_title": "Clinical characteristics of the studied population ::: Results", "text": "Summarized demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients and healthcare workers from whom SARS-CoV-2 sequences were studied can be seen in Table 1. Among patients, the median age was 61 years and most of them (72%) had solid malignancies, 16% of patients used corticosteroids and 14% used oseltamivir previously or during COVID-19 diagnosis specimen collection. Among healthcare workers (HCW), the median age was 40 years and most (86%) were female. The most prevalent COVID-19 symptoms among patients were cough, fever and dyspnea. Death from COVID-19 occurred in 33.3% of the cases. For HCW, cough and coryza were the mainly reported COVID-19 symptoms (85.7% each), and all subjects recovered from the disease, with no deaths reported. No difference was found in sex distribution between the two groups (p = 0.118), but HCW had a lower median age when compared to cancer patients (p < 0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Sequence coverage, quality and metrics ::: Results", "text": "A total of 27,433,528 reads were obtained from sequencing, with an average of 382,118 reads per sample, ranging from 217,922 to 631,796 reads.

A phylogenetic analysis of the viruses together with sequences previously defined as Brazilian circulating strains B1.1-BR and B1.1-EU/BR showed that most B1.1 genomes generated in this study clustered with B1.1-BR sequences (Fig 1A) [16]. A phylogenetic tree including all local SARS-CoV-2 sequences isolated from patients residing in the state of Rio de Janeiro available at the GISAID database (accessed on July 27th, 2020, S1 Table) was performed to investigate potential epidemiological linkage between samples (Fig 1B). We noted that some of the viruses sequenced at INCA clustered in clades containing identical sequences, suggesting a transmission link between the study subjects. In some instances, both cancer patients and HCW were involved in those epidemiological clusters. Although in some cases sequences from outside the hospital were also identical to viruses from our series, therefore not excluding the possibility of community transmission, the most likely scenario for those cases is a nosocomial transmission between patients and/or HCW."}, {"section_title": "Single nucleotide variations across the SARS-CoV-2 genomes ::: Results", "text": "Overall, 95 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and three deletions were found across the SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed (Fig 2). Four genetically linked mutations previously described as the globally dominant haplotype in April 2020 were found in the majority of our consensus sequences: C241T (100%; 5\u2019UTR region), C3037T (98.6%; silent mutation), C14408T (100%; resulting in P4715L/P323L amino acid change in ORF1ab) and A23403G (100%; resulting in D614G amino acid change in S) [17]. Additionally, SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were found in most samples, such as G28881A and G28882A (98.6%; resulting in R203K change in N), G28883C (98.6%; resulting in G204R change in N), T27299C (91.6%; resulting in I33T change in ORF6), and T29148C (90.1%; resulting in I292T change in N) [16, 18]. The two latter SNVs are synapomorphic traits of the B1.1-EU/BR and B1.1-BR Brazilian circulating strains [16]. Another 85 SNVs were observed in our sequences in a lower frequency (1.4\u201319.7%; S2 Table), including nine non-synonymous mutations in S protein (V16F, V367L, K558N, Q675H, A879V, S939F, V1176F, K1191N and G1219V). Deletions were found in three genomes: a 12-bp in-frame deletion in S (comprising positions 21603\u201321614), a 6-pb in-frame deletion in ORF3a (25710\u201325715) and a 244-pb frameshift deletion in ORF7 (27508\u201327751), resulting in a truncated protein. All deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 intrahost genetic diversity ::: Results", "text": "The next-generation sequencing method used for the study viruses allowed us to assess the intrahost SNVs (iSNVs) that compose each subject\u2019s viral quasispecies. The number of iSNVs across the viral genome can be visualized in Figs 3A (patients) and 3B (HCW). All but one iSNV with intrahost frequency greater than 20% were found exclusively in cancer patients\u2019 samples (Fig 4). Interestingly, patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity when compared to HCW (p = 0.009; Fig 5A) and remained significant even after outlier subjects with higher virus diversity were excluded from the analysis (p = 0.029; Fig 5B). Viral genetic diversity within each ORF was compared between the two groups, and cancer patients carried a higher genetic diversity in ORF 1A when compared to non-cancer HCW (p = 0.045).\nAs the within-host genetic diversity of viruses is commonly associated with viral replication, we have evaluated the correlation of the quasispecies diversity in our subjects with the Ct values obtained in the RT-PCR swab tests of the same samples. Ct values work as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 viral load in samples and are expected to be inversely correlated with viral diversity and replication. Surprisingly, however, Ct of the samples did not inversely correlate with viral diversity, but rather showed a positive significant correlation, despite having rs values below 0.5 (Fig 5). This was true for patients\u2019 samples (rs = 0.490; p = 0.001; Fig 6A) and also when all patients and HCW were analyzed together (rs = 0.478; p < 0.0001; Fig 6B). Of note, no differences were found when Ct values were compared between the two groups (p = 0.175). Despite the above mentioned age difference observed between HCW and cancer patients, age did not correlate with viral genetic diversity (S2 Fig, p = 0.844).\nRegarding patients\u2019 characteristics, intrahost virus diversity was not associated with disease severity (overall death [p = 0.632] or death due to COVID-19 [p = 0.934], ICU requirement [p = 0.612]), use of corticosteroids chronically or during COVID-19 course (p = 0.333), or use of oseltamivir prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (p = 0.144; S3A\u2013E Fig). We also assessed the potential association of cancer patients with hematological malignancies compared to those with solid cancers, but no association was found (p = 0.473; S3F Fig)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is striking to infectious disease clinicians worldwide, because no viral infection has been previously seen with such an enormous range of phenotypic outcomes, from no symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death. Most of this physiological variance, however, has been attributed to host genetic and behavioral factors. Numerous characteristics have been associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity among infected subjects, and underlying comorbidities seem to play a major role in unfavorable disease outcomes. Chronic non-communicable diseases such as cancer are among those conditions. Cancer patients have been reported to be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to clinically evolve to more severe conditions upon infection [9\u201311], but the determinants of these severe outcomes remain largely unknown.\nIn this study we have evaluated the near full-length sequences of SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer inpatients in one of the largest public cancer hospitals in South America, the Brazilian National Cancer Institute, and compared these sequences with those generated from healthcare professionals from the same institution. These complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed signatures characteristic of the virus that spread globally and is currently the predominant strain [17]. All but one virus also belonged to clade B1.1, which is the clade primarily circulating in the Americas. The viral genomes also displayed sequence features of other already characterized Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. In fact, the timeframe of the analyzed infections (from April 7th to May 5th, 2020) is consistent with a period in Brazil where community virus transmission was already established and ongoing [18]. Moreover, as a public and free hospital in the Brazilian Public Health System, INCA is also likely to admit patients with low socioeconomic resources who are mostly unable to travel abroad and most likely acquired viral infections from local sources.\nWe explored the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships between the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of the studied samples. Upon a phylogenetic inference with viral sequences isolated from other infected subjects residing in the state of Rio de Janeiro (the same geographic location of the study site), we found that almost half of the sequences from our subjects lie in clusters with sequences from other patients and/or from HCW. Some of the consensus sequences within each cluster were identical, suggesting a direct epidemiological link between those groups of patients/HCW. Some identical sequences retrieved from the database representing subjects from the community outside the hospital were also identical to some hospital-based sequences, ruling out the possibility of completely excluding transmission from outside the hospital. However, the most parsimonious explanation is nosocomial transmission in those cases. Indeed, the subjects\u2019 samples were collected at a time in Brazil when tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not easily accessible, and inpatients and HCW had to wait several days for a test result, thus presenting a risk for further transmission.\nSingle nucleotide variations were found across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome. The spike (S) D614G mutation, found in all samples analyzed, has been associated with higher viral titers, suggesting increased viral infectivity [17]. Other variations were also found in different regions of the spike protein, including a 12-bp in-frame deletion that harbors part of the signal peptide and the predicted cleavage site in the beginning of S. As expected, the P323L change in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), genetically linked to D614G, was also found in all our samples. In silico analysis showed that P323L may have an impact on the protein secondary structure, leading to a reduction in its molecular flexibility [19]. However, the phenotypic impact of these mutations is still poorly understood. Numerous other missense mutations were found that warrant further investigation concerning their phenotypes.\nThe most striking observation of our intrahost quasispecies variation analysis was that cancer patients carried significantly higher numbers of minor variants when compared to non-cancer counterparts (Fig 5). This difference was independent of, and unrelated to the Ct values obtained at the diagnostic tests, which did not differ between the two groups. Ct values (as a proxy to viral load) not only did not inversely correlate with virus diversity, but indeed showed a direct correlation, albeit with a low rs coefficient. It is well established that naso- and oropharyngeal swabs are not the best types of sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2, compared to sputum for example, which contain a larger amount of viral genetic material [20]. Our data underscore the possibility that the variation in the viral quasispecies that we see is not generated in the naso- or oropharynx, but rather more distally in the respiratory tract (lungs) or even in other tissues such as the gut. Reports on the comparative expression of the virus\u2019 cellular receptor ACE2 support the idea that those other tissues might be relevant sources of viral replication and, consequently, sites where diversity emerges [21, 22].\nUnexpectedly, the intrahost quasispecies variation observed in cancer patients was not related to disease severity (requirement for ICU, death by any cause or COVID-19-related) or to the use of corticosteroids (which could lower their immunity status). Diversity was neither related to the use of oseltamivir, which was used by some patients to overcome a potential H1N1 infection until the COVID-19 diagnosis was released. Finally, the genetic diversity was not associated with the type of primary malignancy developed by the patient (solid tumor vs. hematologic tumors). Despite conflicting data existing in the literature, the hematologic cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 herein analyzed did not show an increased chance of COVID-19 severe outcomes when compared to those with solid tumors [23].\nDespite the fact we do not know the mechanisms by which or the anatomical sites where the SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies variation is generated in cancer patients, such increased variation compared to non-cancer patients may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer patients with COVID-19 are subjected to. By generating a higher number of distinct variants, the virus can explore wider areas of the sequence landscape and test variants with different regulatory and structural changes. Variation may impact tissue tropism, protein expression and function, stability, immune escape, drug resistance and pathogenicity. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 diversity, especially in vulnerable patients with underlying comorbidities will shed light on our understanding of the underlying wide spectrum of disease outcomes associated with COVID-19 in humans."}, {"section_title": "Study population ::: Methods", "text": "Fifty-seven cancer patients followed at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 7th and May 5th 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, were included in this study.
