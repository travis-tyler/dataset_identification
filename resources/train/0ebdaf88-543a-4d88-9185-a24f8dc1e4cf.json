The ACT Assessment is a battery of curriculum-based achievement tests designed to measure students' critical reasoning and higher-order thinking skills in four core subject areas: Mathematics, English, Science Reasoning and Reading. These tests not only reflect the acquired skills and levels of achievement of students as a result of their high school learning and instruction, but also serve as a measure of students' preparation to undertake rigorous coursework at the postsecondary level.\nIn addition to the ACT Assessment results, colleges and universities typically require applicants to submit their high school transcripts, teacher recommendations and other supporting evidence to be considered in the admissions and placement process. ACT Assessment test scores, along with high school cumulative grade point averages (GPA), represent the quantitative measures that are typically used by colleges to predict a student's first semester or freshman year college GPA. The results of these predictions also serve to provide additional information regarding admission and placement considerations.\nThe decision to use these two measures in the equations developed by colleges to predict freshman potential or success, is based on the premise that both variables provide valid and reliable measures of students' high school learning and achievement. However, of these two measures of achievement, high school grades are more subjective due to varying standards and purposes teachers associate with grades (Pitcher, 1994; Brookhart, 1993; Stiggins, Frisbie. & Griswold, 1989) . Teachers within schools vary in the criteria they use to judge student achievement: effort and reward are often confounded with grading achievement (Pitcher, 19941. Likewise, grading practices certainly vary across schools; an \"A\" in one school may be equivalent to a \"C\" in a different schooi (OERI, 1994) .\nThe subjective nature of grades and grading practices, affected by varying standards and/or interpretations on behalf of teachers, contribute to the phenomenon referred to as grade inflation. Operationally, grade inflation exists when there is an increase in grades without a parallel increase in ability (Bejar & Blew, 1981) . In this case an indicant of ability would be a student's score on a standardized achievement test such as the ACT Assessment (Wood, 1994) .\nAlthough there has been much speculation on the existence and degree of grade inflation at the high school level (Turnbull, 1985; Adelman, 1983; Keith, 1982) , there exists a lack of current empirical data documenting the extent of this phenomenon (Bracey, 1994) . In the most recent study conducted by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), using data collected in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS;88), researchers documented a large discrepancy between grades reported by eighth grade students in reading and mathematics courses across schools of varying \"poverty\" levels (measured by the percent of students receiving free and reduced price lunches) and test scores on standardized mathematics and reading tests. Students in schools where more than seventy-five percent received free or reduced price lunches and who reported receiving mostly \"A's\" in English had, on the average, the same reading test scores as did the \"C\" and \"0\" students in the most affluent schools. A similar result was reported for mathematics (OERI, 1994) .\nSeveral aspects of this study need to be clarified. First, this study was not directly concerned with investigating grade .iflation, as opposed to differences in grading practices across schools. However, it is clear from the results that grade inflation, at least at the low achieving 3 schools is likely. Second, the study focused on eighth grade and not high school students, which is not to dismiss the concern over differential grading practices or grade inflation at earlier grade levels. Third, the results are based on a single year, as opposed to successive years.\nConsequently, it is impossible to infer whether this is a unique finding or whether the problem is persistent and the degree to which it is improving or becoming worse. To address these concerns several years of data would have to be collected. Finally, no evidence is provided about the accuracy of student self-reported grades. Students in low performing schools may have a tendency to inflate their reporting of grades (Bracey, 1994) .\nThe current study was designed to investigate evidence of the existence, persistence and degree of grade inflation at the high school level by monitoring a large sample of schools, over a five year period, whose graduates were planning to attend college."}, {"section_title": "Method Data", "text": "All of the data collected for this study came from ACT's student history files for the years 1989-90 through 1993-94. Only public schools in the United States that had at least thirty ACTtested students for each of the five consecutive years were retained for this study. This selection criterion resulted in 5,136 public schools being included in the longitudinal analyses, with an average of approximately 530,000 student records per year.\nAs part of the registration process, prior to sitting for the ACT Assessment, students are asked to indicate which high school courses they have completed and the grades (\"A\" through \"F\") they received in each of the completed courses from a preidentified list of 30 standard high school courses. ACT periodically conducts courseigrade validity studies, comparing students' self-5 being more prominent in the last two years. Second, relative to cleciles across years, the largest increases in the standardized differences of average GPAs occured in the seventh through tenth deciles. Until more empirical evidence can be accumulated regarding the typical magnitude of the effect size, the interpretation of the standardized differences of the GPAs as large or small is relative and confined to the data presented in Table 3 (Light & Pillemer, 1984; Glass, McGaw & Smith, 1981) . Inspection of the data in Table I reveals that computing the standardized differences for average ACT composite scores is not necessary because of the constant achievement results across years within deciles.\nA more detailed examination of the trends displayed in Tables 1 and 2 is presented in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 presents trend data related to the percent of students falling into six GPA ranges for the first, sixth and tenth deciles. For the first four GPA ranges, for each of the decile categories, the percent of students falling in the lower GPA ranges has declined across the five year period, while the percent of students falling in the highest two GPA ranges steadily increased across this same time period. Table 5 displays a breakdown of the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantile ACT composite scores for the first, sixth and tenth deciles within each of the six GPA ranges. An obvious trend is portrayed by the stability of the interquartile score ranges across years within each of the GPA ranges by decile. If student ability had parallelled the increase reflected by GPAs then the quantiles presented in Table 5 would also have increased; however, that is not the case. A careful examination of the interquartile ranges within each GPA category reveals an overlap of the interquartile ranges of the first and tenth decile school students for the first four GPA categories.\nAt the two highest GPA ranges this overlap disappears."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Within the GPA category 3.50 to 4.00, for 1993-94, seventy-five percent of the students in first decile schools score at or below an ACT composite score of 22; whereas, twenty-five percent of the students in tenth decile schools score at or below an ACT composite score of 24.\nThe diffetence of the quantile ACT composite scores for the first and tenth decile school students is seven scale score points (the ACT score scale range is 1-36), although both groups of students have GPAs in the 3.50 to 4.00 range!"}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The focus of this study was investigation of the existence of grade inflation at the high school level. Operationally, grade inflation was defined as an increase in grades without a concommitant increase in ability. The results provide evidence supporting the grade inflation hypothesis. Moreover, not only does there appear to be evidence of high school grade inflation, the phenomenon appears to be especially significant at GPAs greater than 3.00, across all decile categories. The creation of school level decile categories based upon ACT composite averages does not introduce an artifact in this study, because the decile categories averages are free to rise or fall based upon the achievement of each year's group of students. What the results do reveal is that no significant improvement in average student achievement has occured over the five year period investigated regardless of the school attended. In addition, the difference in achievement between students attending schools grouped in the first decile compared to students attending the highest achieving schools, despite the similarity of average GPAs, is substantial. This finding is consistent with the results reported in the OERI study.\nAn obvious conclusion, which supports common knowledge, is that grading and the standards teachers use to award grades are relative; teachers still award the highest grades to the 7 \"best\" students in their classes. In addition, as noted previously, it is difficult to determine whether grades are indeed representative of a student's knowlege of course content, or if other factors, such as attendance, effort, discipline, etc., are included by teachers as part of a student's course grade.\nAn important issue impacting college admissions, is the weight placed on GPAs, a nonstandardized metric, which varies across schools, teachers, and years, as compared to the scores on the ACT Assessment which have the same meaning, relative to student achievement across years and schools. Grade inflation becomes problematic for very selective institutions which typically review applicants with high GPAs. Because GPAs are restricted to a narrow range, (UK) to 4.00, the prediction equations developed by these institutions will be affected by a GPA \"ceiling effect\", essentially reducing the variability and therefore the contribution of GPAs to predicting first year eHiege grade point averages.\n12 ,18,20 16,18,20 16,18,20 16,18,20 16,18,20 GPA Range 2.00-2.49 1 13,15,17 14,15,17 14,15,17 14,15,17 13,15,17 16,18,20 16,18,20 16,18,20 16,18,20 16,18,20 10 17,19,22 17,19,22 17,19,22 17,19,21 17,19,21 Note:\nThe values in each cell from left to right are the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles.
