[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Corona viruses have been studied for more than fifty years and are known to infect multiple animal species including human. Though their pathogenesis and mechanism of replication has already been well described due to previous outbreaks ( is also an essential requirement for transmission across different species 2 . It is known that SARS-CoV interacts with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for their entry and after COVID-19 outbreak, researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with ACE2\nfor the viral entry into host cells 3, 4 . SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein gets cleaved by host proteases into S1 and S2 domain which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion respectively 5 . Wang et al. (2020) reported that, the S1 domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a region called receptor binding domain (RBD) which makes a complex with human ACE2 and facilitates viral entry 6 . However, emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome might alter the process of infection transmission, replication and potential of viral attachment with ACE2. According to epidemiological data, COVID-19 has an origin from bats in Wuhan, China and then spread to other parts after its zoonotic transmission via the Malayan Pangolins 7,8 . In a country like India having a diversified geographical distribution, it is important to understand the pathogenesis of different strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from different parts of the country. As interaction with ACE2 is the main pathway of entry of this virus into its host, knowledge on the RBD binding affinity of different Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates with the ACE2 of their natural reservoirs including human is highly essential.\nHowever, this has remained a grey area with a little information available. In the current study, we have analysed the RBD sequences of spike protein from different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients of Odisha. Further we analysed the binding affinity of RBDs with the ACE2 of different probable natural hosts of corona virus: bat, pangolin and hamster including human. The detected mutation in the RBD region of one isolate shows stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 than the wild type RBD, providing important information regarding its virulence as well as drug targeting."}, {"section_title": "Sequencing of different Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab samples", "text": "The current study was a part of whole genome sequencing study carried under the Odisha Study group constituting different Government organisations jointly by Regional Medical "}, {"section_title": "Sequence alignment of RMRC spike genes with reference sequence", "text": "For sequence alignment, full length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate of Wuhan-Hu-1 (Accession no.NC_045512) was downloaded from NCBI database and used as reference sequence for all further analysis.

Hamsters were reported to be the best suitable animal model to carry out SARS-CoV-2 related experiments; therefore it was essential to understand the interaction of its ACE2 receptor with isolated Indian SARS-CoV-2 RBDs 10 Before inception of structure prediction, the ACE2 sequences from pangolin, hamster, Chinese and Indian bat were aligned with the human counterpart to identify the percentage of similarity and dissimilarity between these sequences.\nThe experimental 3D structure of human ACE2 was retrieved from RCSB PDB (PDB ID-6M0J) with a resolution of 2.45 \u00c5 positioning from 19-615 amino acids. Protein Data Bank (PDB) did not provide any experimental structure of ACE2 receptors of pangolin, hamster, Chinese and Indian bat, which has prompted us to predict their three dimensional (3D) structure through homology modelling using Modeller v 9.19 tool followed by structure validation. Suitable templates were identified for 3D model building of ACE2 using BLASTp 11 search against PDB (Protein Data Bank) database. The templates with PDB ID: 1R42, 6CS2, 6LZG, 3SCI, and 2AJF, were found to be the better homologs for target-template alignment and modelled 3D structure prediction. Based on the optimized target-template alignment, Modeller v9.19 12 facilitated in model developments, the models with lowest Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) score were retained for further structural refinement. Side chain optimization was performed using WHATIF 13 and GalaxyRefine 14 tool. The optimized models of ACE2 were finalized based on its overall quality and stereo-chemical geometry and energy. The geometry of the predicted model was evaluated using PROCHECK 15 and Ramachandran analysis 16 . ERRAT 17 programme was used to calculate the accuracy of the nonbonded atoms for the predicted model. Verify 3D 18 tool was used to evaluate the compatibility of the 3D model with its own amino acid sequence by assigning a structural class based on its location, environment and comparing the results to good quality structures. The structure was uploaded in Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN) server (bencrept), for resolving the model quality. The energy potential of the predicted model was calculated using ProSA-web server 19 ."}, {"section_title": "In silico translation of RBD sequences and their interaction with ACE2 receptor of different natural reservoirs", "text": "Four nucleotide sequences of RMRC RBDs were selected and translated to protein sequence using EMBOSS Transeq tool of European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

According to the travel history, out of 35 isolates, one had a foreign travel history, 11 were Nizamuddin (cluster detected from New Delhi, India during April, 2020) returned and rest 23 migrated from Surat, Gujarat, India. The detail of the demographic and clinical status of the patients included in the study has been described in one of our unpublished reports (Turuk et al). We did not record any death case among the patients whose samples were included in the current study.\n. In the current study, the spike region was identified at the position from 21563-25384 of the whole genome and consists of 3822 nucleotides. The BLAST alignment analysis of RMRC spike nucleotide sequences alignment analysis showed that, three spike sequences (RMRC 104, 157, 158) were 100 % identical to the Wuhan reference spike whereas all other RMRC spikes shared 99 % identity with one or multiple altered bases at different positions (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Sequence identification, alignment and phylogenetic analysis of RBD", "text": "The alignment of the spike sequences of RMRC isolates with the reference strain RBD, grouped in the third cluster and all other RBDs were in cluster four, which describes their phylogenetic distribution (Fig.1B) ."}, {"section_title": "Protein structure analysis and interaction of RBD with ACE2 receptor", "text": "The sequence alignment analysis showed that ACE2 of pangolin, hamster, Chinese and Indian bat shared 85 %, 84 %, 80 % and 78 % identity with human ACE2 respectively (Suppl.

In Hamster, out of 785 amino acid residues, the Ramachandran analysis illustrated 613 (87.2%) residues in most favoured regions, 70 (10.0%) in additional allowed regions, 12 (1.7%) generously allowed regions and 8 (1.1%) in disallowed regions (Fig.3B) . In Chinese bat, out of favoured regions, 66 (9.2%) in additional allowed regions, 12 (1.7% ) generously allowed regions and 2 (0.3%) in disallowed regions (Fig.4B) .

Low quality models are expected to have a negative QMEAN Z-score. The QMEAN4 ranges from 0 to 1 and a higher value indicates good qualitymodel 22 . Additionally, the overall quality of the model was evaluated using Protein Structure Analysis (ProSA) tool which provides a quality score (Zscore) as compared to all known protein structure from x-ray crystallography as well structural NMR. The obtained Z-score value was -6.33 (Pangolin), -4.76 (Hamster), -6.24 (Chinese bat) and -6.73 (Indian bat); which indicates the high quality of the models compared to known protein structures (Fig. 2B-5B ).\nAs the 3D structure of human RBD was already available in the database (PDB ID-6M0J), we Table-2 . However, if we compare the interaction of mutated and wild type RBD with ACE2 receptor of all species, the interaction between mutated RBD and human ACE2 is the strongest one with highest binding energy and highest number of hydrogen bonds."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The complex trajectory of the recent COVID-19 pandemic in India poses greater risk towards control and containment of the infection. It is high time to understand its mobility pattern in the country and the viral genetic properties favouring its virulence. Though during early phase of pandemic, Odisha, had comparatively very few positive cases as well as small number of deaths, gradually, the virus has become rapidly infectious making the clinical scenario worsen. Many people from Odisha were working outside the state and during this pandemic, they returned to their home state due to many reasons. The samples included in our study were mainly collected from suspected cases who had a travel history from different states with one foreign travel record.\nAs spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry in to host and houses RBD, which binds to ACE2 receptor of host cell, understanding the spike-RBD distribution in the genome of Indian isolates is crucial for therapeutic design. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is reported to have a stronger binding affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV and higher affinity means low number of virus is required to infect the cell, which may explain the high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 23 . In the current study, spike region of 32 isolates showed altered nucleotide bases at multiple positions as compared to the Wuhan reference strain suggesting mutations in these Indian isolates during the spread. For SARS-CoV-2, specific RBD-ACE2 binding ensures infection as well as serves as a potential target for developing treatment strategies for this infection 23 . According to Premkumar et al. 2020, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is an immunodominant and a potential target of antibodies in COVID-19 patients 24 . The mutation found in RMRC 22 isolate might play a role in altering the antigenicity or binding affinity of the respective RBD. Due to the rapid spreading and evolution, SARS-CoV-2 RBD is known to acquire several mutations leading to increased binding affinity to human ACE2 receptor 25 .\nIn France, multiple mutations were identified in RBD of SARS-CoV-2 contributing to higher receptor binding capacity, which might be responsible for increased virus spread and infectivity 26 . On the other hand, a mutation in S protein has been found to be associated with decrease in receptor binding affinity 27,28 . In the current study, mutation in the RBD region of Indian isolates did not seem to affect its interaction with ACE2 receptor of other species prominently except that of human. Surprisingly, the patient, from whom, the RMRC 22 isolate was obtained, had a travel history of returning from Nizamuddin (cluster detected from New Delhi, India during April, 2020) recently before he tested positive for SARS-CoV-1 0 2. However, no mutation was observed in the isolates obtained from his other family members (his father and two brothers) who were also COVID-19 positive. It appears that, emergence and role of a mutation in any region of SARS-CoV-2 genome depends upon multiple factors including the geographical distribution, rate of spreading, alteration in the virulence of the virus and immune response of the host. The interaction analysis of mutated and wild type RBDs with ACE2 receptor indicated that bats and pangolins could be suitable natural reservoirs for Indian isolates of this virus and this finding falls parallel with other earlier reports 29, 30 . As hamster has been reported as a suitable animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, the interaction of RBD of the Indian isolates included in the current study makes the earlier report more relevant 10 "}]
