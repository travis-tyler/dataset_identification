[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Neighborhood environments can influence the ability of individuals and families to access necessary resources for achieving and maintaining good health. Neighborhood attributes have been linked with a broad array of health outcomes including mortality, (Wing et al., 1992; Tyroler et al., 1993; Morris et al., 1996; Eames et al., 1993; Townsend et al., 1988) life expectancy, (Clarke et al., 2010 ) mental health, (Truong and Ma, 2006) self-rated health, obesity, (Mujahid et al., 2008; Black et al., 2010; Heinrich et al., 2008) and diabetes. (Lysy et al., 2013; Grigsby-Toussaint et al., 2010) Neighborhood built environments with mixed land use (residential, commercial uses, institutional) (Frank et al., 2004) may promote health because they position amenities and community resources where people live. Infrastructure like roads is critical because these connect people to goods, services and social networks.\nResearch on built environment characteristics can be expensive and time consuming. (Rundle et al., 2011) Neighborhood audits of built environmental features have typically entailed onsite visits and due to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2019.100859 Received 2 March 2019; Accepted 28 March 2019 the cost and logistical challenges of these methods which include travel time and staff training, data on built-environment features are often limited in scale to a few neighborhoods or regions. (Bader et al., 2017) However, understanding the potential impacts of neighborhood design on health outcomes necessitates the inclusion of diverse, heterogeneous neighborhoods. Using road network data and Google Street View (GSV) images, we were able to construct neighborhood characteristics for geographically diverse areas across the entire United States. Computer vision tools were used to automatically process street segments-which dramatically lowered costs while offering new data resources for neighborhood research.\nIn recent years, public health and social scientists have started to utilize GSV to conduct innovative research, and those nascent studies suggest that GSV is a reliable and cost-effective tool. (Rundle et al., 2011; Naik et al., 2014; Kelly et al., 2012) Rundle and colleagues compared field audits of neighborhood features to GSV data and they found high levels of concordance especially for measures of pedestrian safety, traffic, and infrastructure for active travel. Small items or features that had temporal variability displayed lower levels of concordance. Another team utilized GSV to audit built environments in Indianapolis and St. Louis and found high inter-rater reliability. (Kelly et al., 2012) Outside the U.S., Silva and team found GSV to be a reliable and valid tool compared to in-person audits for assessing obesogenic built environment features in a heterogeneous urban area in S\u00e3o Paulo. (Silva et al., 2015) A group of European scientists utilized GSV to measure physical environment characteristics in London, Paris, Budapest and other cities. (Feuillet et al., 2016) Using computer vision models on approximately 1 million GSV images, Naik and colleagues created high resolution maps of perceived safety for 21 cities across the United States. (Naik et al., 2014) Nevertheless, rural areas in particular have been understudied-although they make up over 97% of the land area in the United States.(U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) Rural areas have comparatively less access to some amenities for maintaining and promoting health such as health care resources, supermarkets, transit systems and nearby schools, recreational facilities, and cultural attractions within walking distance that encourage physical activity (Khan et al., 2009; Meit et al., 2014) . Additionally, good road structures are important for providing access to jobs, facilitating the movement of goods and people, accessing health care and education, and providing links to social services. Rural roads may lack capacity, fail to provide needed connectivity to communities, and inadequately support freight travel.(TRIP, 2017) These features may help explain stark health disparities seen between rural and urban areas, with rural areas having much higher mortality, morbidity and chronic diseases. (Wilcox et al., 2000; Befort Christie et al., 2012; Eberhardt and Pamuk, 2004; Hartley, 2004; Parks et al., 2003; Eberhardt et al., 2001 ) Obesity, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, limitation of activity due to chronic health conditions, leisure time physical inactivity, and mental illness are higher in rural counties than in urban or suburban counties. (Meit et al., 2014) Since their launch in 2007, GSV has captured 20 petabytes of data, equivalent to 5 million miles of road around the world. (Farber, 2012) GSV images provide a unique lens into the local built environment with ground-level views not possible with other data sources such as satellite data. Street View image data also provide flexibility in allowing investigators to extract a variety of built environment features from one data source. Additionally, the geocoordinates associated with each image allows the use of flexible neighborhood boundaries to summarize built environment characteristics at different levels of aggregation (zip code, census tract, county, state). Other neighborhood data sources such as the U.S. Census provide complementary information on demographics and economic characteristics of residents.\nStudy Aims.\nIn this study, we leverage millions of GSV images and computer vision to create indicators of urban development based upon the physical features of the environment. We focus on the absence of infrastructure and facilities because we believe that one main mechanism driving urban-rural disparities is fewer community resources and services found in rural communities. We examine whether our constructed indicators of urban development predict county level chronic disease, premature mortality, self-rated health, and health behaviors-controlling for population density as well as county demographic and economic characteristics. These diverse outcomes were selected in order to investigate the degree to which different dimensions of health were associated with our GSV measures. Previous research have linked neighborhood conditions to health behaviors (Saelens and Handy, 2008; Sallis et al., 2018) , chronic conditions (Alvarado, 2016; Barrientos-Gutierrez et al., 2017) , mental health (Galea et al., 2005; Evans, 2003) as well as mortality.

We focused on sampling images from street intersections in order to create a dataset that characterizes environments where people inhabit. In the United States, there are vast, sparsely populated roadless areas, especially mountain ranges and deserts. The roadway network files were accessed from the 2017 Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing data set. We downloaded all road types. We identified street intersections using PostgreSQL (an open-source object-relational database system) with the PostGIS plugin. The plugin is spatial database extender and enables location queries to be run in SQL. More information about the plugin can be found at https://postgis.net/.\nUsing these latitude and longitude coordinates, we retrieved GSV images for these locations. Between December 15, 2017-May 14, 2018, we used Google's Street View Image Application Programming Interface (API) to obtain images. Parameters for the API include the following: image size (640 \u00d7 640 pixels is the maximum image resolution for nonpremium plan users), geographic location (geographic coordinates or addresses), field of view (zoom level), up or down angle of the camera relative to the Street View vehicle (default is 0), and heading (direction the camera is facing with 0 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south and 270 = west). Previously the API allowed users to download GSV images free of charge up to 25,000 map loads per 24-h period. However, on July 16, 2018, a new pay-as-you-go pricing plan went into effect for Maps, Routes, and Places. More information can be found at https:// developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/usage-andbilling.\nWe obtained four Street View images (directions: west, east, north and south) for each pair of coordinates to comprehensively capture 360 degree views of the environment. Image resolution was 640 \u00d7 640 pixels. We first sampled two-thirds of counties and then obtained all the intersections within the sampled counties. In total, we collected 16,171,605 images from a subset of 2143 counties in the United States. eFigure 1 displays the national coverage of our image data collection with sampling points dispersed across the United States. eTable 1 displays the number of images collected per state as well as the number of counties, by state, with image data."}, {"section_title": "Image data processing", "text": "We used Google's Vision API, Out-Of-Box, to label each Street View image. The API is able to detect thousands of different pre-defined items in images, ranging from wildlife to food to clothing. Users can output labels as .txt or .csv for further analysis. The API provides the advantage of having access to image classification algorithms that have been built using very large training sets. Computer vision is an established field and concepts employed by Google's API would also apply to other software or specifically trained algorithms. Pricing information for the API can be found at the following website https://cloud.google.com/ vision/pricing.\nThe API took less than one second to process each image and we utilized the API to analyze 16 million images from April 25-May 10, 2018. The API to provides ten labels for each image. For this study, we focused on labels that characterized the built environment including 1) presence of highways (main road, especially connecting towns or cities), 2) rural area (sparsely spaced houses or buildings; limited surrounding infrastructure; unpaved roads), and 3) grassland (a large open area covered by grass, especially farmland used for grazing or pasture). More highways may represent more robust transit systems that enable the travel of goods and people. Conversely, more images labeled as rural area and grassland signal less urban development. Each image had a unique image identification number that was comprised of its latitude, longitude and camera direction. Image labels were merged with the images using this unique ID."}, {"section_title": "Quality control activities", "text": "In order to evaluate the accuracy of the computer vision API and considering time and participant fatigue, two coauthors manually labeled 300 images.

Inter-rater reliability varied from 87% (rural area) to 94% (grassland) (eTable 2). Across the indicators, agreement between the manual labels and computer vision labels ranged from 82 to 95%. The number of manual labels is comparable to other GSV studies that have utilized 200-300 manually verified images and report similar agreement rates between human-and computer produced labels.

Adult obesity was assessed by the percentage of the adult population (age 20 and older) that reported a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m 2 . Diabetes was assessed via the question, \"Has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes? (for women, outside of pregnancy).\" General self-rated health was categorized as fair or poor vs. excellent, very good, and good.

County and census travel level built environment characteristics were categorized into tertiles-high, moderate, and low using cut points that grouped one third of areas in the highest tertile, another third in the moderate tertile, and another third in the lowest tertile for each of the variables. Tertiles were chosen to ease interpretation of results and allow for non-linearities in the association between area characteristics and health outcomes. Area level health outcomes as defined above were modeled as continuous variables (e.g., county obesity rates). Models controlled for population density (population per square mile) and county sociodemographic characteristics. County-level demographic and economic characteristics were obtained from the 2010-2014 American Community Survey 5-year estimates and included the following: percent < 18 years old, percent 65 years and older, percent Hispanic, percent non-Hispanic black, percent non-Hispanic Asian, percent American Indian/Alaska Native, percent not proficient in English, economic disadvantage (standardized factor score summarizing the following four variables: percent unemployed; percent with some college, percent with high school diploma, percent children in poverty, and percent single parent households).\nWe implemented adjusted linear regression models to estimate differences in the prevalence of county health conditions (95% CI) by tertile of built environment characteristic, controlling for area compositional characteristics. The lowest tertile served as the referent group. Reported prevalence differences represent comparisons between the prevalence of health outcomes for those living in the 3rd tertile (vs. 1st tertile) and 2nd tertile (vs. 1st tertile) for area characteristics. Because our analyses are cross-sectional, the results of the linear regression models are prevalence differences (rather than risk differences as would be the case of longitudinal data). Positive prevalence differences indicate that individuals living in areas in the 3rd and 2nd tertile have higher prevalence of adverse health outcomes than those in the 1st tertile. Negative prevalence differences indicate that individuals living in areas in the 3rd and 2nd tertile have lower prevalence of adverse health outcomes than those in the 1st tertile. Models were run separately for each health outcome. Across models, sample size varied (2-5%) due to missing outcome or predictor variables.

Places with the most street intersection images labeled as rural areas included Oklahoma (33%), Mississippi (29%), and Louisiana (25%). Grasslands were most prevalent in street intersection images captured from North Dakota (33%), South Dakota (25%), and Wyoming (23%). Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for the 16.1 million Street View images covering 2143 counties across the United States, with representation from each of the fifty states including territories like Puerto Rico and Guam. Highways were detected in about 11% of images. Additionally, about 14% of images were labeled as rural areas (having limited infrastructure and buildings) and 5% of images were labeled as grasslands (a large open area covered by grass, especially farmland used for grazing or pasture). County-level summaries were created by averaging all the images pertaining to a given county. Correlations between the built environment indicators were generally low (range in |r values|: 0.09-0.25).\neTable 3 presents the results of adjusted linear regression analyses examining associations between population characteristics and GSVderived built environment characteristics. Percent < 18 years old was related to more rural areas and more grasslands. Economic disadvantage was related to fewer highways, more rural areas, and fewer grasslands. Greater population density was related to modestly fewer highways. Table 2 and Table 3 display results of analyses relating county-level built environment predictors and county-level health outcomes-controlling for county level demographic and economic characteristics. Presence of highways was beneficial for outcomes (fair/poor self-rated health, diabetes, premature mortality, physical distress, mental distress, physical inactivity, and teen births) but was non-significant for obesity. For instance, counties with the most highways in images had 452 fewer years of potential life lost per 100,000 population compared to counties with the least highways. Additionally, counties with the most highways saw a 0.81% increase in excessive drinking rates compared with counties with the fewest highways. In additional analyses, we examined the relationship between highways and motor vehicle mortality. More highways were associated with increases in motor vehicle mortality (eTable 4).\nWhile presence of highways was associated with better health outcomes, indicators of less development were associated with worse health with some exceptions. Counties with higher percentages of street view images denoting rural areas (having limited infrastructure and buildings) had worse health in terms of higher obesity, diabetes, fair/ Q.C.

Counties with more grassland had higher obesity, physical inactivity and teen births but lower mental distress and physical distress. Given that our GSV-derived indicator of rural area was consistently connected with worse outcomes, we implemented additional analyses to investigate possible mechanisms. Rural areas were correlated with fewer primary care physicians (per 100,000 population) and less access to recreational facilities at the county level (Table 4) .\nIn further analyses, we examined health outcomes at the census tract level, controlling for compositional characteristics. Similar to associations seen at the county level-the GSV-derived measure of rural area was related to higher diabetes, physical distress, mental distress and physical inactivity but lower binge drinking. GSV-derived rural area was also associated with less access to healthy foods and dental care (Table 5) .\nSensitivity analyses were also run comparing the GSV-derived variable for rural area and other indicators of rurality. A census tract was rural if the geographic centroid of the tract contained fewer than 2500 people. A GSV image was defined as rural if it displayed sparsely spaced houses or buildings; limited surrounding infrastructure; or unpaved roads. The GSV rural area variable was correlated with the census tract rural designation (r = 0.58) and with population density (r = \u22120.70). Table 5 displays these predictors in separate models and their relationships with census tract health outcomes. Tertiles of population density were similarly related to health outcomes but associations were smaller in magnitude than those seen for the GSV rural area indicator. Similar findings were also observed with the censusderived designation of rurality and the USDA rural-urban continuum codes (Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The built environment has implications for health outcomes by structuring amenities, risks and resources.

We assessed national patterns and identified a robust pattern of health disparities in areas with less infrastructure. Study implications may include advocating for more health resources and structural investments in rural areas in order to mitigate against observed health disparities."}, {"section_title": "Study findings in context", "text": "Our study contributes to the nascent body of literature utilizing GSV to implement virtual neighborhood audits for neighborhood features such as walkability, (Brookfield and Tilley, 2016 ) physical disorder, (Mooney et al., 2014) retail alcohol stores, (Less et al., 2015) and urban greenery, (Li et al., 2015) Researchers have also implemented computerized approaches to label images for pedestrian count (Yin et al., 2015) and visual enclosure (i.e., proportion sky visible from a point on the street) (Yin and Wang, 2016) -measures that are connected with walkability. A previous study found Google's Computer Vision API to be effective at characterizing the naturalness of urban areas with GSV images from the city of Edinburgh. (Hyam, 2017) In this paper, we extend the literature by scaling up to analyze millions of GSV images across the United States in order to examine the relationship between built characteristics and health outcomes.\nOur GSV rural area indicator was associated with an array of adverse health outcomes and this is in alignment with research finding stark health disparities between rural and urban areas; for instance, lower physical activity (Parks et al., 2003) and higher obesity in rural areas. (Befort Christie et al., 2012) Research has found higher mixedland use, street connectivity, and public transit to be positively associated with meeting recommended physical activity guidelines and reductions in overweight/obesity. (Li et al., 2008) Additionally, people in rural areas may also have lower health care access due to increased travel distance and fewer health care providers. (Chan et al., 2007) In our study, highways were associated with a reduction in most outcomes examined except for obesity. Previous literature has found the presence of highways correlated with restaurant density and in particular, fast food restaurants (Block et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2013) -which may negate some of the potential positive effects of greater infrastructure in a community. Research on proximity to roads has also suggested that they can expose individuals and families to harmful air pollutants, elevate the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, and increase noise disturbance, motor vehicle injuries and mortality. (Kim et al., 2004; Egan et al., 2003; Boothe and Shendell, 2008) Furthermore, the presence of highways, which may bring traffic and noise, may deter walking and other forms of physical activity. For people living in locations with adequate access to health resources, living away from major roads may be health beneficial, especially for those who have underlying conditions that can be aggravated by proximity to traffic. However, our analysis of street view data comparing (urban and rural) geographies across the United States suggests that individuals living in areas connected by highways experience a wide range of potential beneficial effects compared to those living in areas with fewer highways-these beneficial effects may be mediated by ease of travel to resources that highways provide."}, {"section_title": "Study strengths and limitations", "text": "The neighborhood built environment can promote health by locating neighborhood amenities or resources that are conducive for health or health behaviors. Thus far, investigations on built environment features in the U.S. have generally been limited to local studies because traditional neighborhood studies rely on people to perform neighborhood audits. Moreover, neighborhood studies in rural areas have been greatly under-investigated. In this study, we utilized road network data to build a national database of image search points for street intersections. The novel data collection strategy allowed us to capture street images from rural, suburban and urban areas, providing an extensive data source for future neighborhood research. We leveraged recently developed computer vision tools to produce area summaries of built environment characteristics. We then investigated the potential impact of neighborhood environments on chronic diseases and health behaviors.\nUsing GSV images offers three advantages that contribute to existing research on urban-rural health disparities. First, GSV images allow for assessments of built environment features, which complement other neighborhood data on population density and sociodemographic characteristics. Second, GSV indicators may offer more recent neighborhood data. Highly valuable and finely detailed neighborhood surveys like the Boston Neighborhood Survey (latest wave of data in 2010) are expensive and time-consuming, and thus difficult to update and conduct beyond a local geographical scale. Other indicators of rurality may also have a time lag of several years; the most recent USDA rural-urban continuum codes are available for 2010 at the census tract level and 2013 at the county level. A third advantage of GSV is that users have flexibility in creating neighborhood level summaries from GSV images that may be aggregated to any user-specified region (census tract, zip code, county, or other neighborhood-specific boundary).\nNonetheless, our study has limitations. We utilized proprietary software to conduct computer vision and generate pre-defined labels. As a result, we could not specify particular neighborhood indicators. To evaluate its performance, we compared with manual labels and found excellent levels of agreement. Of note, the built environment indicators selected for this study were large in size. The Google API may have lower accuracy for smaller objects (Hyam, 2017) , as is the case for other computer vision tools."}, {"section_title": "Table 2", "text": "Google Street View-derived predictors of county health outcomes County built environment characteristics categorized into tertiles with the lowest tertile serving as the referent group.

Robust standard errors reported. Nguyen, et al. Preventive Medicine Reports 14 (2019) 100859 Moreover, Street View image data can only capture some of the neighborhood features within the community. For instance, image data does not allow for the creation of indicators for noise and perceived safety. Also, collected image data were from street intersections which offer unique viewpoints on local activity given that they are gathering points for traffic and people, but nevertheless, do not capture all important environmental features. As such, our measures are interpreted as the percentage of built environment features seen at these intersections.\nOnsite field visits have enabled researchers to identify hundreds of neighborhood characteristics that impact health. Well-known neighborhood inventories include Irvine-Minnesota Inventory, (Day et al., 2006) the Pedestrian Environment Data Scan, (Clifton et al., 2007) and the Maryland Inventory of Urban Design Qualities. (Ewing et al., 2006) Utilizing computer vision may impact the type and depth of neighborhood features examined. In particular, computer vision models have difficulty with features that have variability across time or are small in size. Understanding the context in which certain neighborhood features appear may also be difficult in virtual audits compared to onsite field visits. However, as this study demonstrates, computer vision models make possible national neighborhood studies incorporating millions of images.\nAn additional study limitation is that data on census tract level outcomes were only available for select cities and hence leaves out more rural areas of the country. Even among these select cities, we find that cities characterized by less infrastructure have worse health outcomes. While GSV and other technologies begin to enable larger-scale characterization of U.S. neighborhoods, data availability for geotagged health outcomes across wide areas of the United States continues to be an issue for neighborhood research.\nAnother study limitation is a possible temporal mismatch between health outcomes and GSV data. Google Street View API provides the most recent image available for a location. However, areas differ with regard to the rate at which their GSV image are updated. In our dataset, image dates ranged from 2007 to 2017; the median year was 2013. The main health outcomes were assessed between 2014 and 2016.\nMoreover, the observational nature of the study inhibits causal inference; relationships reported here are observed associations rather than causal effects. Causal effects are difficult to estimate for neighborhood characteristics in particular because people are often not randomly assigned their residential environments (indeed previous and existing policies have led to high levels of residential segregation in certain communities). Further research with additional study designs, for example, involving changes in neighborhood conditions and changes in health outcomes, may further help elucidate the relationship between built environment characteristics and health.
