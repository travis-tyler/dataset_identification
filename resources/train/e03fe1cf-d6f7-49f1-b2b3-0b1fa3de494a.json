Although its incidence is decreasing due to improvements to public health systems and control of cardiovascular risk factors, 1 its prevalence is steadily increasing due to rising life expectancy of human populations. 2 Dementia is linked to many underlying pathologies, with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as the most common condition. AD brain autopsies commonly reveal three neuropathological hallmarks: amyloidosis, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 3 . However, the co-existence of other brain pathologies, especially cerebral vessel pathology, is the rule, and the number of \"pure\" AD cases is relatively small 4 . In that context, it has been proposed that there is a spectrum of this disease composed of a gradient of vascular and neurodegenerative features. 5 Genetic factors play a pivotal role in AD etiology. In fact, two forms of the disease can be differentiated according to individual genetic background. The mendelian form is an uncommon disorder that mainly affects families with Early-onset AD (EOAD) (<65 years old), whereas the polygenic form is a complex disorder that mainly appears in sporadic cases with late-onset AD (LOAD) (>65 years old). Highly penetrant mutations detected in EOAD families have been pinpointed to three genes: APP, 6 PSEN1, 7 and PSEN2. 8 The connection between earlier genetic and neuropathological findings promoted the establishment of the amyloid hypothesis as a potential causal mechanism for the disease.\nLOAD heritability falls in the range of 25%-80%. 9,10 APOE \u03b54 was the first to be discovered and still remains the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. 11 The identification of additional genetic factors has only been feasible with the emergence of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large sequencing projects. Almost 40 genetic variants have been identified in these ways. 12, 13, 14 Despite these advances, current genetic findings account for 31% of LOAD heritability. 15 The missing heritability may be explained by several reasons: first, LOAD presents a complex genetic architecture; second, a lack of statistical power to detect uncharacterized variants with small effects; and third, the presence of ethnic differences together with clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity between AD cases.\nThe clinical and neuropathological variability of AD cases, comprising those with concomitant vascular brain disease to those with a pure AD phenotype, might be hampering the identification of functional categories of genes underlying differential biological routes to dementia. To gain insight on the causality networks behind AD clinical heterogeneity, we conducted the Genome Research at Fundacio ACE (GR@ACE) study, a GWAS of dementia and its clinical endophenotypes defined according to AD's clinical certainty and the presence of vascular co-morbidity. GR@ACE is a unique genomic resource comprising a GWAS of the largest number of dementia cases diagnosed in a single memory clinic reported to date. First, we determined whether we could identify categories of known genes underlying clinical endophenotypes. Next, we explored whether these categories underpinned different biological routes. Finally to assess the impact of heterogeneity in GWAS findings and to address the need for more powerful and comprehensive AD genetic studies, we metaanalyzed the GR@ACE data with independent GWAS series."}, {"section_title": "Gr@ACE cohort and phenotype definitions", "text": "The GR@ACE study comprises 4,120 AD cases and 3,289 control individuals ( "}, {"section_title": "GWAS genotyping, quality control, imputation and statistical analysis", "text": "Participants were genotyped using the Axiom 815K Spanish Biobank array (Thermo Fisher).

If a sex discrepancy was detected, the sample was removed unless the discrepancy was safely resolved.

Effect size change represents the difference between variant odds ratio (OR) and null-effect (OR=1), and provides information about the strength of the association. \nTo explore whether GR@ACE clinical endophenotypes reflect variations in the underlying biological pathways driving dementia, we classified LOAD genetic variants in three categories. Category A comprised variants strongly related to the purest form of clinical AD (i.e., subjects with probable AD in primary and secondary diagnoses). Other loci included in category A were CR1, BIN1, MEF2C, MS4A2, PICALM, MAPT and CD33. In contrast, category B comprised variants with the strongest effect observed in subjects with AD mixed with vascular disease (SORL1, ADAM10, CASS4, ATP5H, and ACE) (appendix). Category C comprised a group of variants with effects in all clinical endophenotypes. Figure 2 shows the enrichment trend per marker and by category.\nNext, we explored biological pathways for each gene category. Note that the regulation of vasculature development and blood vessel morphogenesis were only detected for genes in category A, which is more closely related to pure AD (p =2\u00b703 x 10 -7 , p = 1\u00b790 x 10 -6 , respectively) (table 2). Additional categories indicated immune system pathways (Category B, p = 2\u00b707 x 10 -7 ; Category C, p = 5\u00b777 x 10 -15 ) (table 2) . Finally, with the aim of validating previous results, we conducted a sub-analysis by classifying LOAD genetic variants with more stringent classification criteria (widely described in appendix).

The appendix presents the linear effect trends per variant. Regulation of vasculature development was exclusively identified as the top pathway in Category A (p = 2\u00b714 x 10 -7 ), when we restricted the analysis to include those loci co-expressing with, at least, 4 LOAD genes (appendix).

We showed differential biological classes underlying clinical endophenotypes and demonstrated that the composition of differential sub-groups of AD patients impacts GWAS discoveries. The GR@ACE study represents a unique genomic resource because all affected cases were diagnosed in a single memory clinic using the same screening and diagnostic techniques. This might limit potential sources of clinical variation between study participants, as has been recently demonstrated in a large meta-GWAS. 9 Based on the increase in evidence suggesting that vascular brain pathology can act concomitantly with AD to produce more rapid cognitive decline, 20 we explored the effect of known LOAD loci across different levels of vascular burden in dementia patients using only clinical definitions. Our basic idea was to dissect, from a molecular point of view, the model previously proposed by Viswanathan et al. 5 . We observed the existence of three categories of loci, which might reflect the disease's clinical heterogeneity, from vascular and mixed forms to a more \"pure\" AD phenotype. Intriguingly, we detected vascular processes to be the main causal mechanism in clinically pure AD and we found the immune system pervasively detected across the three categories. Although both pathways have been previously associated with LOAD by network analysis, 21 this is the first study to show that the association with the vascular system is conducted by AD-specific clinical subgroup. Despite these findings, replication in an independent and large single-site GWAS cohort might help contrast the proposed loci classification, which was based on the clinical endophenotypes of the GR@ACE cohort.\nSilent changes occur in brain microvasculature during AD progression. In fact, CAA is a well-recognized AD pathological feature characterized by the accumulation of amyloid proteins, mainly A\u03b2 1-40, in the walls of small cerebral vessels. CAA has been proposed to compromise the perivascular drainage of A\u03b2 from the brain to the peripheral system. 22 Almost all AD brains harbor CAA pathology to some extent, although in vivo most CAA cases remain undiagnosed, even when using the validated Boston criteria. 23 Mendelian mutations of the APP gene have been found in both CAA and AD. 6,27 APOE \u05104 and CR1 have been associated with an increased risk of CAA. 24, 25 In particular, distinct AD loci have been associated with capillary and non-capillary CAA. 26 Between them, APOE \u05104 was strongly related to capillary CAA 26 . These links make it conceivable a potential genetic overlap between CAA and AD, and suggest that CAA pathology could represents an underlying process for AD. In that context, we think that intrinsic alterations to the vasculature could contribute to disease pathogenesis in more pure forms of AD, explaining our results. Conversely, in AD individuals with evident cerebrovascular lesions comprising mixed forms, the additional role of cardiovascular risk factors, i.e., hypertension, atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis, should be considered, as these could point to a systemic pathological state leading to vascular damage and dementia. This would accord with the limited genetic correlation between neurodegenerative and other neurologic disorders, 9 as well as with results coming from heterochronic parabionts in aging models. 28 Understanding the role of vasculature pathology in AD seems a pertinent step. In that scenario, CAA would be a key AD hallmark. CAA represents the unique identified link between the vascular and amyloid hypotheses, but it has been completely neglected in the original hypothesis formulation.\nFrom a clinical point of view, placing each patient somewhere along the disease spectrum proposed by Viswanathan is complex. 5 A deep understanding of heterogeneity in AD seems necessary to design better genetic studies, which must drive the discovery of novel loci and, ultimately, innovative targets for AD therapies. In this study, we explored how clinical heterogeneity might impact GWAS findings by integrating distinct GWAS datasets with either the GR@ACE cohort as a whole or its endophenotypes. We found several new GWS signals that seem strongly dependent on the sample composition. For example, after combining IGAP Stages I and II with the entire GR@ACE dataset, we identified genetic signals in the NDUFAF6 genomic region. When this exercise was conducted using GR@ACE endophenotypes, the NDUFAF6 signals disappeared. It is tempting to speculate that studying per endophenotypes has reduced statistical power. However, at this point, with a smaller sample size, the SCIMP signal was detected using the clinically \"pure\" AD GR@ACE endophenotype, suggesting that a purer AD dataset without clinical mixed dementia cases would be necessary to safely replicate this finding. We think that using the specific clinical subgroups of the AD population empowered this study to detect genes associated with specific disease axes.\nAn alternative strategy is taking advantage of clinical heterogeneity. Specifically, heterogeneity might play a dual role in genetic studies. Although it might decrease the power to detect genes associated with more specific clinical subgroups, incorporating detailed clinical AD definitions can also promote identifying genes shared with other conditions or co-pathologies such as SVD. In fact, this was the case for the ATP5H loci, which was previously found to be associated with AD 29 and more recently found in relation to SVD. 30 We think that the same applies to the ANKRD31 findings. ANKRD31 encodes a protein containing ankyrin-repeats, and has been involved in neurodevelopmental disorders 31 . Of note, the brain eQTL of a linc-RNA, located 1.6kb from the HMGCR locus and residing in the COL4A3BP gene, was mapped for ANKRD31 GWAS signals. The HMGCR locus is one of the most important coregulators of cholesterol biosynthesis, and it is a therapeutic target of statins. The COL4A3BP gene is involved in lipid transport. 32 Several studies have linked HMGCR polymorphisms and AD risk or age at onset for AD, 33 and cholesterol pathway has been identified such as biological route shared between AD and small vessel disease. Interestingly, markers in the POLK locus, located in the same disequilibrium block of ANKDR31 (figure 3), jointly conferred risk for AD and plasma levels of LDL. 34 Taken together, these findings support the role of this genomic region in AD. The reported genetic signal should be considered a highly probable finding, although independent replications are still required.\nNDUFAF6 and SCIMP signals have presented suggestive evidence of association in IGAP studies. 12, 18 , and recently, SCIMP reached GWS 14 . In the present work, NDUFAF6 genomic region reached GWS for the first time, and we detected that SCIMP signal was mainly conducted by specific group of AD cases. The NDUFAF6 genomic region, containing the TP53INP1 locus, was first associated with AD in a gene-based analysis, 35 and it has been involved in mitochondrial function. The SCIMP genomic region influences several eQTLs, from uncharacterized cortical lncRNA to blood eQTLs in SCIMP or its neighbor, the RABEP1 locus, both of which are associated with immune system function. 36, 37 The CD33 locus remains a controversial LOAD locus due to large meta-GWAS were unable to replicate previous this signal, 18 but here it reached GWS. We previously proposed that the cryptic population sub-structure could explain the divergent observations for this locus. 38 Note that the lack of definitive neuropathological data for AD cases used in this project is a severe limitation of the present study. Clinical definitions have important uncertainties, and diagnosis misclassifications sometimes occur. Hence, some AD individuals included in enriched AD endophenotypes may present concomitant vascular brain disease. The generation of large histopathological GWAS cohorts with associated quantitative data on each pathological hallmark is the ultimate solution to tackling the intrinsic pathologic heterogeneity observed in AD dementia. Unfortunately, there are few examples of neuropathological cohorts: only one GWAS has investigated the genetics of CAA, being APOE the unique GWS signal. 24 Furthermore, in this study, small number of AD cases evolved to vascular dementia during follow-up. Large clinical GWAS cannot control diagnostic changes occurring in clinical practice. Clinical diagnosis is a dynamic variable, so understanding the genetic profiles of specific subgroups of patients that develop other pathologies would provide relevant and powerful information. Finally, the exact effector genes for LOAD genetic findings remain unclear. This is a severe limitation to pathway analysis that can only be circumvented by isolating the causative mutations. Independent replication will be needed to corroborate our new reported GWS signals. In that sense, the selection of specific patient groups might lead to successful replication studies.\nThe assessment of heterogeneity has important implications for gene discovery, the development of treatments and their appropriate use in individual patients. In that sense, the GR@ACE cohort provides useful genomic information, as it accounts for potential sources of variability and contains different sub-groups of cases. This enabled us to analyze the LOAD genetic landscape in terms of clinical endophenotypes. Our efforts to disentangle the mechanistic pathways operating under clinical sub-groups of patients revealed that vasculature regulation may be an essential part of the causative mechanism of LOAD. Finally, our exploration of AD genetics highlights the relevance of sample composition in genetic discoveries. Considering sample composition in the design of genetic studies might lead to the identification of genetic profiles, which can help clinicians distinguish subsets of patients within the disease spectrum and promote novel therapy targets for Alzheimer's disease.\nResearch Institute at the University of Southern California.
