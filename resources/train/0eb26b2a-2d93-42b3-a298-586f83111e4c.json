We propose a diagnostic method for AD that involves using whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), and we select effective brain regions for the diagnostic probability and investigate the genome-wide association with the regions using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The two-step dimension reduction method, which we previously introduced, was considered applicable to such a study and allows us to partially incorporate the proposed method. We show that the proposed method offers classification functions with feasibility and reasonable prediction accuracy based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and reasonable regions of the brain and genomes.

Early studies mainly focused on using a single modality as a biomarker, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Structural MRI (sMRI) is useful to characterize the brain structure; however, there exist other modalities to characterize the brain condition, for example, and are associated with each other; thus, the difference between the results obtained using these techniques would not be significant.\nOne of the perspectives of matrix factorization is to consider the score, which is a linear combination of the variables and their weights, as determined by certain criteria (correlation is most used). Occasionally, this score is not meaningful because it only uses information based on the correlation; hence, the clinical interpretation of the result would be problematic. Gross and Tibshirani (2015) proposed the supervised CCA method and it was extended by Luo and others (2016) to the case with more than two modalities. These methods, which were not applied to imaging data, considered the pairwise correlation among modalities to have no structure to enable modalities to be distinguished within image and genomic data. The multiblock structure, which has two major (super (or global) and sub (or block)) levels and the sub (block) level corresponds to each modality, would be useful because the super level, which is a linear combination of sub levels, can be used in the prediction score. The other reason for their usefulness is their multivariate fashion against pairwise correlation, and the contribution of sublevels (association between modalities within image phenotype or genotype) on the super level can be evaluated through the loading (weight). As far as we know, the application of the multiblock framework to multimodal imaging analysis has not received much attention. In this regard, we propose a method involving supervised multiblock sparse matrix analysis (SMSMA) in which to incorporate the clinical outcome to determine its direction and to be applicable in the muBIG study.\nIn our previous study, two-step dimension reduction was studied for imaging analysis from an application perspective (Araki and others, 2013; Yoshida and others, 2013) . Two-step dimension reduction was originally proposed by Reiss and Ogden (2010) to functionalize spatial data. The method was first functionalized through the basis expansion of the original data, and the scores were then represented as the linear combination of the reduced data by performing principal component analysis. Because their approach was to use a regression model, the method was regarded as constituting functional data analysis with the regression coefficients being the functional form. In our interpretation for our extension, this method is able to reduce the dimension by taking into account two kinds of correlation. The first is structural correlation, which originates from the data structure, whereas the other is the sample correlation, which is computed from the data values by using a kind of correlation coefficient. Taking brain-imaging analysis as our example, in the first step, taking into account correlation in the form of structural correlation, the dimension is reduced by basis expansion. This would be reasonable because the spatial neighborhood voxels rather than isolated voxels should be carefully considered, as disease-induced brain structural or functional change often happens in local regions. Then, the SMSMA method is applied to reduce the dimension as a second step by taking into account the sample correlation.\nThis emphasizes that the development of the method presented in this article can be studied with respect to the following aspects: the complementary usage of multimodality, including not only imaging but also genomic data, which are high dimensional and exhibit correlation within and between modality, in addition to the use of selection regions that affect disease and their related SNPs and their usefulness for prediction, that is, as biomarkers.\nThis article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed method. In Section 3, the proposed method is applied to real data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Section 4 presents a simulation study. Section 5 summarizes and concludes the article."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "In this section, we present the proposed SMSMA method. Consider n subjects and M X and M Y blocks (modalities) for the predictor and response, respectively. We assume that modalities are given and discuss the modality selection in Section 5. X m is the n \u00d7 p m (m = 1, 2, . . . , M X ) and Y m is the n \u00d7 q m (m = 1, 2, . . . , M Y ) for the m-th block (modality) predictor and response matrix, respectively. Each block corresponds to the modality, for example, Y 1 is MRI and Y 2 is PET. Subjects also have a univariate outcome, and the n-dimensional outcome vector is denoted by Z. We consider scores t and u for the predictor and response, respectively, with the following multiblock structure. Here, it should be noted that the scores in (2.1) are referred to as the super score, whereas t m = X m w X ,m and u m = Y m w Y ,m are referred to as the block score. Thus, the super score, which is used in an application such as a prediction, has a hieratical structure. This scoring has a low dimensional representation of not only the data in each block but also the relationship between blocks. Thus, this would be useful for modeling statistically such as construction of the prediction model as in our application by using the multimodality of images and genetics whose importance is discussed in the previous section. We could also evaluate the effects of modalities through b X ,m and b Y ,m . For an application perspective in our case, it is necessary to detect the pair of images and genomic component with the block feature, in which the image is used as marker. Our aim is to determine the associated genomic information with the marker. Thus, the association between two data sets (e.g. images and SNPs) is evaluated by maximizing the correlation between the super scores t and u supervised by the outcome. Actually, when matrices X m and Y m are normalized by their column, the weights\nis the proportion of the supervision, P \u03bb (x) is the penalty function, (P \u03bb (x) = 2\u03bb|x| is used in the application of this article because of the simplicity and the possibility for the sparsity of the weights), and \u03bb > 0 is the regularized parameter that is used to control the sparsity. Note that it would be possible for the penalty function to have other structures, but these structures are beyond the scope of this article. Note that when \u03bc XZ = 0 and \u03bc YZ = 0 the regularized multiblock PLS or CCA is induced, and when X m = Y m the supervised regularized PCA framework (regularized PLS) is induced. These could fit flexibly to several applications according to clinical interests. The proposed method is closely related to that of Li and others (2012) , which is the unsupervised version and was applied to multi-genomic data analysis without imaging data.\nWe estimate the weights in (2.1) by stating the following proposition.\nPROPOSITION 1 The solution of optimization problem (2.2) satisfies\nwhere h \u03bb (y) = sign(y)(|y| \u2212 \u03bb) + is the sparse function. The proof is shown in the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online.\nThis leads to the following algorithm to estimate the weights in (2.1) by maximizing L in (2.2).\n1. Initialize t and u and normalize the super scores as follows.\nwhere \u2190 means \"replaced with\". 2. Repeat until convergence.\n(a) For fixed u,\nNote that the deflation step yields multiple components and has several alternatives. The convergence of this algorithm was supported by the proposition provided in the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online. The larger value of the regularization parameter \u03bb X ,m or \u03bb Y ,m has many non-zero elements in w X ,m or w Y ,m . The method for the regularization parameters selection was also provided in the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online."}, {"section_title": "APPLICATION", "text": "In this section, we provide the method we applied to perform the muBIG data analysis. The proposed method is dimension reduced and describes the association between multimodal images and genetics. Our previous work showed that a single dimension reduction was insufficient and this led us to propose the use of two reduction steps. In this section, we use this method with the SMSMA method as a second step (Araki and others, 2013; Yoshida and others, 2013) . We first review the first step briefly and start by providing some notations. Consider the data of n patients with the notation:\nwhere Z is the scalar clinical outcome. The brain imaging data (sMRI, FDG-PET) is represented by\n, which is the vectorized image data, where v j \u2208 Z 3 (j = 1, 2, . . . , N m ) is the voxel location, and N m is the number of voxels assuming the same number among modalities, that is, N 1 = N 2 . For m = 3, s m is the SNP data vector and N m is the number of SNPs."}, {"section_title": "Dimension reduction", "text": "In the first phase, the number of dimensions for imaging data is reduced by applying the basis expansion. As the dimensions of the sMRI and FDG-PET data are the same, we consider the same basis function to reduce the dimension to q.\n..,N ,k=1,...,q with the element being the radial B-spline function (Saranli and Baykal, 1998) \nis the pre-specified knot, h > 0 is the distance between knots, and \u00b7 is the Euclidean distance. The basis function reduces the number of parameters from N to q, that is, by converting each voxel to a component of the function. The number of basis functions q is determined by the number of voxels and the distance between pre-specified knots. In this work, we used four-voxel (therefore, h = \u221a 3 \u00d7 4 2 =6.93) equal spacing knots because our simulation study (Yoshida and others, 2013) showed that the possible smaller distance between knots improved the accuracy. It should be noted that the use of a basis expansion of this nature as a preprocessing procedure for reducing the number of dimensions was useful for neuroimaging analysis as in, for example, Reiss and Ogden (2010) , Araki and others (2013) , and Yoshida and others (2013) . Dimension reduction based on the basis function is followed by the use of the SMSMA method. Thus, the result is obtained as the linear combination of the basis functions\n, which is referred to as a composite function. \u03c8 1 (\u00b7) and \u03c8 2 (\u00b7) are paired because of the hierarchical structure. This can be regarded as a paired composite function and can be interpreted as representing related regions in the brain between modalities. It would be possible for the composite basis \u03c8 m (v) to represent a flexible shape, whereas the original basis function \u03c6 k (v) has a spherical shape.\nThis method can be applied to SNP data by defining the distance as the physical distance between SNPs. However, the incorporation of the specific biological information required the reduction of the dimension of the SNP data by performing grouping based on the information of linkage disequilibrium (LD), that is, the haplotype block (Gabriel and others, 2002) . Thus, in this application, X = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x p ), where x j is the n-dimensional mean of SNPs within the block j."}, {"section_title": "Real data analysis", "text": "We assessed the validity of the proposed method by applying it to real data. The data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in our analysis or in writing this report. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a five-year public-private partnership of several research institutions and private pharmaceutical companies. The ADNI database includes results from various types of imaging examinations and from clinical and neuropsychological assessments; therefore, it is expected that effective results can be obtained by combining data from this source of information to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD (for the details of study procedures, see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/).\nFor confirmatory purposes, we predicted AD from both 48 normal and 52 AD subjects (n = 100 in total) in the ADNI-1 cohort, which has already been studied well. Thus, we could evaluate the proposed method by referencing the existing results. We preprocessed imaging data by using the common software, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Three-dimensional T1-weighted images of a subject were first segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space, and this was followed by anatomical normalization to a template image using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007) . In the case of PET, images were co-registered to the bias-corrected T1 image and the same warping parameter as for the T1 images was applied, following an intensity normalization to the GM for each subject using the same method that was used for the global normalization in SPM. For SNP, we used PLINK for screening and haplotype block estimation. SNPs with a minor allele frequency = 0.05, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test p.level = 0.001, and call rate per subject = 0.95 were excluded. Median imputation for missing data was applied.\nThe clinical outcome is given by Z = 3.17 \u00d7 CDRSB + 0.11 \u00d7 ADAS13 \u2212 0.57 \u00d7 MMSE, where CDR is the Clinical Dementia Rating score, ADAS13 is the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, and MMSE is the Mini-Mental State Examination score. These coefficients were only computed based on the logistic regression model from data with 1684 subjects as a more general population both with and without images, and genetics data not only in the ADNI-1 but also in the ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO cohorts. Note that although the diagnosis information is available, we used this continuous clinical outcome taking into account the circumstances without the diagnosis.\nThe SMSMA method was applied to data (X , Y 1 , Y 2 , Z) with parameters \u03bc XZ = 0 and \u03bc YZ = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and the number of components was 10. The case of \u03bc YZ = 0 corresponds to the original method (multiblock PLS). As a result of the 1st step of the dimension reduction, the dimensions were 299 336 and 7162 for X and Y's, respectively. The original dimensions were 549 709 and 2 122 945 (=121\u00d7145\u00d7121) for X and Y's, respectively.\nWe evaluated the methods by applying the multiple logistic regression model with the diagnosis (AD or Normal) as a binary response and selected the super scores of Y as predictors by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), that is, logit Pr(AD|T ) = T \u03b2 where T is the matrix of the super score for Y with n rows for patients and the components as the columns. Then, Figure 1 shows the 10-fold cross-validated Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and its area under the curve (AUC) based on T\u03b2 as risk score, where\u03b2 is the maximum likelihood estimator in the training super score set and AD or normal are the binary outcomes in the test dataset. It shows the proposed supervised feature works well and the score of Y in the case of \u03bc YZ =0.5 is most predictive with AUC =0.952 (for other cases, as displayed in Figure 1 ). As in our situation, the dementia status is predicted using image data only and the related SNPs are obtained as supportive information. Thus, using the same\u03b2 as in Y, the ROC analysis based on U\u03b2, where U is the matrix of the super score for X was conducted and the result is shown in the left side of Figure 1 , which shows the case of \u03bc YZ = 0.2 is most predictive with AUC = 0.762. The average of the AUCs between X and Y was highest for \u03bc YZ = 0.2. Thus, the details of application result for \u03bc YZ = 0.2 are presented as follows. Table 1 lists the non-zero numbers for w X ,1 , w Y ,1 , and w Y ,2 and the estimates for parameters b Y ,1 and b Y ,2 in the result of the SMSMA method with \u03bc YZ = 0.2. In the multivariate logistic model, five components were selected and estimated coefficients\u03b2, standard errors, Z statistics, and p-values are also presented in Table 1 . All selected components by using AIC from the logistic regression model were significant at the 5% level.\nBw Y ,m\u03b2 (m = 1, 2) is shown in Figure 2 for \u03bc YZ =0.2. The results were divided into two parts according to the sign of Bw Y ,m\u03b2 . The negative part means atrophy in MRI and hypometabolism in PET. The selected regions show a flexible shape due to the composite basis. For the MRI result, the medial temporal lobe including amygdala and hippocampus, precuneus, and lateral parieto-temporal regions were detected as negative regions, which were well consistent with previous studies (Matsuda, 2013; Whitwell and others, 2012) . The positive regions showed complementary results, showing a peak at the boundary of the caudate nucleus, which was considered to reflect the widening of ventricular space. For the PET result, lateral parieto-temporal regions were more prominent than in the MRI result, whereas the weights in the medial temporal regions were lessened. These results were also in good agreement with the previous reports (Jagust and others, 2010; Ishii and others, 1998) .\nThe vector w X is expanded to the SNP level from the block level, which is easy to implement by taking the mean value and its absolute values and displaying them as a Manhattan plot in Figure 3 . These values represent the association of SNP with the structural and functional regions shown in Figure 2 . The vertical dotted line represents the top 10 AD candidate genes listed on the AlzGene database (www.alzgene.org), and the number is the rank.\nThis application found an association among the top 10 genes, except for ABCA7, CR1, and PICALM. The gene with the highest coefficient was near the BIN1 on chromosome 2, which is a well-validated AD risk gene ranked second in the AlzGene database. There were several genes detected near APOE, the most established AD risk gene (Bertram and others, 2007) . Although most likely, our result didn't completely "}, {"section_title": "660", "text": "A. KAWAGUCHI AND F. YAMASHITA reflect the review, for example, APOE has the highest association. We inferred that the reason originated from the difficulty of GWAS as high dimensional analysis and there was a possible improvement in the first dimension reduction step prior to application of our method. Further discussion is provided in Section 5. Other identified regions were close to the top genes defined in the AlzGene database, CCR2 on chromosome 3, LOC651924 on chromosome 6, and IL33 on chromosome 9. Other SNPs may be close to those identified in previous studies, which are included in the AlzGene database. Further details are not shown here."}, {"section_title": "SIMULATION STUDY", "text": "In this section, the characteristics of the proposed method are shown based on the synthetic data.

Note that, as described in Section 2, the case of \u03bc YZ =0 corresponds to the original method."}, {"section_title": "Setting", "text": "We consider one and two modalities for the predictor and response, respectively, that is, M X =1 and M Y =2.

The predictor is given by The SMSMA method is applied to data (X , Y 1 , Y 2 , Z) with parameters \u03bc XZ =0 and \u03bc YZ =0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 by using two components, and the radial B-spline function with 2-pixel equal spacing knots. The iteration for generating data and applying the method was conducted 100 times for each parameter pair."}, {"section_title": "Result", "text": "All the resulting weights from the SMSMA method were binarized with the weight being equal (unselected) or not 0 (selected) and the c-index was computed with true images and variables. The c-index is defined by the c-index = sensitivity -(1 -specificity). The average value of the c-index of 50 simulations and blocks by parameters w u,0 , w Y , and \u03bc YZ are listed in Table 2 and Table S1 of the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online. for e 0 =0.001 and e 0 =0.005, respectively. Note that to facilitate interpretation, w Y is displayed as the inverse w the last three columns. The highest mean value among \u03bc YZ for each w u,0 and w Y is displayed in bold style. Figure 4 shows 2-D displays of the resulting probability for Y for e 0 =0.001 and e 0 =0.005, respectively. The probability is computed from the pixel-wise mean value of binary images, which represents whether a pixel is selected or not. For Table 2 , in the case of w u,0 = 0.2, which means a lower association between the scores u and t of X and Y , respectively, the over performance of the supervised method with \u03bc YZ >0 against the original method with \u03bc YZ =0 is shown. The difference appeared in the second component of Y, which only has an association with the outcome. For the higher values of \u03bc YZ , the mean c-indexes in the second component of Y were higher than those of \u03bc YZ =0, whereas we observed that for the reverse results for the first component of Y, that is, the mean c-indexes, the higher values of \u03bc YZ were lower that those of \u03bc YZ =0. This might be suitable if the purpose is to extract only the associated components with the outcome. More importantly, the loss of accuracy was also observed in X from both tables. The mean values of the c-index among components of X were the highest except for \u03bc YZ =0.8, which yielded \u03bc XY =0.2 from equation (2.2). This suggests that placing too much emphasis on the supervision of the outcome should be avoided. In the case of w u,0 =0.8, which indicates a higher association between the scores of X and Y, the difference among \u03bc YZ may not be essential. In that case, we also observed that in the case of w u,0 =0.2 it was necessary to use the higher value of \u03bc YZ and in the case of w u,0 =0.8 it was not, although the difference may not be essential. For the noisier case (e 0 =0.005) in Table S1 of the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online, the mean values in the strong effect of the score on Y, that is, in the case of w Y =1 the values were generally higher than those of the case of w Y =5, where the effect is weak.\nIn the cases of w u,0 =0.2, the detection of true images for the second component in Figure 4 was difficult for the unsupervised version and the lower value of \u03bc YZ =0.2. On the other hand, for the proposed supervised version \u03bc YZ =0.5 or 0.8. These are mainly because of the data structure of the simulation, where only the second component was associated with the outcome. However, the over-supervised (\u03bc YZ =0.8) resulted in poor reconstruction of the true image for the first component especially in the noisier case ( Figure S1 of the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online, e 0 =0.005). We performed an additional simulation to evaluate the local optimization and the estimation with misspecified parameters. Results are shown in the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online. Table S2 in the supplementary materials available at Biostatistics online showed the maximum number of results having same c-index from the applied method by 100 times with replacing initial values to one data for each parameters. In this case, the large values mean that the algorithm met the global maximization. The balanced case (\u03bc YZ =0.5) presented relatively less global maximization, whereas the case of \u03bc YZ =0.8 showed acceptable convergence although these were relative evaluations because we didn't use the true values. We also provided the proposition about the convergence in the supplementary materials. Table S3 of supplementary material available at Biostatistics online shows the mean c-indices for the method with \u03bc XZ > 0 applied to the same data in Table 2 . Because \u03bc XZ = 0 was correct from the simulation setting, general cases were worse but some cases in Table S3 of supplementary material available at Biostatistics online had a similar result as in Table 2 . The parameter selection would be important and will be discussed below."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The work we present in this article involves the development of a method to analyze high-dimensional data sets. From a methodological perspective, we developed a supervised multiblock matrix analysis (SMSMA) method capable of determining the association between block structured multivariable data sets incorporating clinical outcomes. From an application perspective, we developed a method to predict dementia from brain images and to identify associations with SNPs by referring to muBIG data with the following three key features: (i) A paired composite basis function with a data-driven shape, (ii) Datadriven brain regions and selection of SNPs, (iii) Available for brain-wide and genome-wide analysis. The proposed method is capable of constructing a prediction model by using multimodalities imaging as well as genetic information and is expected to generate new knowledge from an exploratory analysis.\nThe most characteristic aspect of the proposed method is the supervised feature, in which the selection of the tuning parameters \u03bc YZ may be problematic. The best performance differed depending on the simulation scenario, and we suggest addressing this issue by using moderate values, that is, \u03bc YZ =0.2 or 0.5 or by testing for candidates by using an appropriate measure such as predictive accuracy as in our application. In this work, for simplification purposes, \u03bc XZ was fixed as \u03bc XZ =0, even though we could obtain reasonable results in the application of our method. The use of \u03bc XZ > 0 in the method would be helpful if it were necessary to obtain a more predictive score for X. However, over-supervised larger values of \u03bc YZ and \u03bc XZ yield a loss of accuracy in the association between X and Y as shown in our simulation study. Thus, the criteria for selecting \u03bc YZ and \u03bc XZ should evaluate not only the predictivity and the reproducibility, but also their balance. This would have to be further investigated in future.\nThere are some possible extensions. It would be desirable if the connection of our dimension reduction to the prediction model was to appear in the application. In our application, the scores obtained from our method were given following the construction of the prediction formulation based on the traditional logistic regression model. One extension is to use the regularization version of the logistic model, and the tuning parameters in (2.2) are selected taking into account the generalization in the prediction model, which may yield more sparse weights in Figure 2 . The uncertainty of the parameter estimate in the super and block weights could be considered by using the statistical model and be incorporated into the inference in the prediction model. In addition, although cross-validation was used for the evaluation, it may be insufficient for the generalization and can be extended: for example, the usage of completely independent test data which was impossible in our study because of the limited sample size and the normalization of data. As an additional simulation study, local optimization has been evaluated. Although it showed that the convergence was not completed, which would be general in these kinds of high dimensional data analysis methods, this could be solved by using the multiple initialization technique as in Kawaguchi and Truong (2011) . The proposed method includes a regularization estimation procedure that enabled us to select the effective brain and genetic regions. In this work, we used the L1 type penalization because of the simplicity, but, it would be straightforward to apply other penalty functions such as SCAD and MC+. These functions will be included in the package and compared in future work. In the application, although we already studied the image data well previously, there may be aspects of the genome side that could be improved based on our result. One of them is to reduce the dimension prior to the application of our method, which is based on the LD block. It would not be sufficient reduction which was a half of the original (549709 to 299336). Not only the number but also the usefulness such as reproductivity would be need to be considered. To achieve this, we need more studies and additional genetic information by collaborating with experts in the future.\nWe showed one application, which offers the possibility for various application studies; in other words, it would be possible to extend the proposed method in response to application problems. In our application, only the block in Y was considered for imaging data. Although we only used SNP in X, genomic data could also be considered on other levels such as for gene expression, transcriptome, and proteomics. The proposed method could analyze such data by incorporating the blocks into X. For Y, other neuroimaging data, such as fMRI, DTI, and the other PET, could be considered. These selections would depend on the clinical interests and measurability. One of the problems associated with a multimodality study is the acquisition cost and the burden to patients. This concern could be addressed by applying the penalty function at the super level, which would be straightforward. Thus, the modalities considered effective for a particular disease could be selected to lighten the burden imposed on subjects. Another application could be to consider the relationship between images. The neuropathological diagnosis of AD relies on the deposition of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in the brain tissue. In living patients, this can be measured by the administration of the radiotracer 11C Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and subsequent positron emission tomography to assess the spatial pattern of A\u03b2 deposition (Adlard and others, 2014) . Structural brain changes are known to occur after A\u03b2 deposition and are more relevant to the clinical diagnosis of AD."}, {"section_title": "664", "text": "A. KAWAGUCHI AND F.
