The Southwest also has more cotton farms than any other region. Southwest cotton producers are vulnerable to swings in cotton demand since they generally lack alternative crops and cotton accounts for a higher percentage of their farm production value. These farmers were more likely than cotton farmers in other regions to mitigate their risks by purchasing buy-up or revenue crop insurance. \u2022 Low-cost producers' operating and ownership costs averaged $0.44 per pound of cotton, compared with $0.64 per pound for mid-cost producers and $1.02 per pound for high-cost producers. Cotton producers with the lowest operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton had higher cotton yields and lower costs per planted acre than mid-and high-cost cotton producers. The lower per-acre costs stemmed mainly from lower application or usage rates of seed, gasoline, diesel, fertilizer, and labor per planted acre. Low-cost producers made fewer trips across their fi elds, reducing machinery use and ownership costs per unit. Most low-cost producers in 2007 farmed in the Southwest, where favorable weather boosted their yields. \u2022 Operating costs per acre did not vary signifi cantly by the size of the cotton enterprise. Operators with larger cotton enterprises generally did not have lower costs per planted acre or per pound, despite economies of scale. Many operators with smaller cotton enterprises minimized their ownership costs by relying on custom work to avoid the purchase cost and maintenance of expensive cotton harvesters. Providers of custom work supply their own machinery as well as labor to accomplish a task. \u2022 Most cotton production takes place on very large farm operations, with half of the cotton production occurring on farms with annual gross sales of $1 million or more. Those farms had the highest average cotton yields per planted acre and the highest average per acre costs. They were more likely to irrigate their cotton acres than smaller cotton farms. \u2022 Cotton farms vary considerably in the degree of reliance on cotton. Operators with the larger cotton enterprises often had less commodity diversifi cation on their farms. They depended more on cotton compared with operators with smaller cotton enterprises. In contrast, operators of the largest U.S. farms who included cotton in their production mix had more commodity diversifi cation and were less dependent on cotton than operators of smaller cotton farms, since many operators of the largest farms growing cotton had small-to mid-size cotton enterprises."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "Cotton producers were grouped by cotton production costs, region, cotton acreage, and typology to examine the variation in characteristics and production practices of U.S. cotton farms in 2007. Farms were ranked by the operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton lint to analyze the factors associated with low and high cotton production costs. We analyzed the characteristics of cotton farms by major cotton production areas to gain insights into regional shifts in cotton production. Cotton farms were grouped by the size of the cotton enterprise (planted acres) and size of the farm (gross farm sales) to determine whether size offers advantages or disadvantages. The data we analyzed came from ERS's farm-level production cost estimates for cotton and the cotton version of the 2007 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)-a joint effort conducted annually by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and ERS. These two data sources are tightly intertwined since the cotton version of ARMS is one of several data sources used by ERS to compute cotton production cost estimates. Several NASS reports provided secondary data for estimating cotton production costs. For our purposes, a farm is considered a cotton farm if 1 or more cotton acres were planted with the intention of harvesting the cotton for lint, with cottonseed as a byproduct. Therefore, data from producers who planted cotton with the intention of harvesting the cotton for commercial seed are excluded from our analysis. In addition, yield and cost data per acre are based on planted acres rather than harvested acres."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The cotton plant produces both cotton lint and cottonseed. Cotton lint is a natural fi ber that competes with other natural and synthetic fi bers in textile production. Cottonseed is fed as whole seed to animals or is separated into three components-hulls, meal, and oil. The hulls and meal are used as feed for livestock, poultry, and fi sh, or as fertilizer. Cottonseed oil is used as cooking oil and as an ingredient in various food products, especially snack foods. Cotton lint is more valuable than cottonseed, even though cottonseed accounts for two-thirds of harvested cotton by weight (USDA/ERS, 1992). In 2007, the value of cotton lint accounted for 81 percent of the gross value of cotton production and cottonseed for the remainder, according to ERS production cost accounts. Cotton producers often use their cottonseed as payment to the cotton ginner for transporting their cotton to the gin and for ginning their cotton. In addition, cotton producers may either receive or pay a small additional amount, depending on prices. U.S. farmers planted 10.8 million acres of cotton in 2007, according to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS, 2011). Nearly all cotton acres planted in 2007 were harvested, pushing the yield to 879 pounds per harvested acre, a record that has yet to be broken through the 2012 season. According to NASS, cotton prices averaged $0.61 per pound in 2007, up from $0.48 per pound in the previous year. In 2007, net returns after operating costs averaged $183 per planted cotton acre, while the total cost of production exceeded the gross value of production by an average of $32 per planted acre. Net returns per acre for cotton in 2007 were the highest since 2003. 1 In the United States, cotton is a major fi eld crop that generates signifi cant cash receipts for farm producers. Only corn, soybeans, wheat, and greenhouse products account for more crop cash receipts than cotton. From 2005 to 2007, cotton accounted for 2.4 percent of total cash receipts from agricultural commodities and for nearly 5 percent of annual crop cash receipts (USDA/ERS, 2011a). In 2007, cotton was planted on 1.2 percent of U.S. farmland and on 2.5 percent of farmland in cotton-producing States, according to NASS data. Understanding the trends that faced cotton producers may help put the data in this report in perspective. According to the 2007 and 1997 Censuses of Agriculture, 18,591 farms grew cotton in 2007, down 41 percent from 1997. Planted U.S. cotton acreage trended downward slightly between 1997 and 2007. Texas accounted for 43 percent of U.S. cotton production in 2007, while Arkansas, Georgia, California, and Mississippi each accounted for 7-10 percent. As a major cotton producer and the leading cotton exporter, the United States ranks third in production behind China and India. The share of the U.S. cotton crop exported has grown rapidly as domestic mill use has declined. By 2007, U.S. cotton exports had grown to 13.6 million 480-pound bales and accounted for 75 percent of U.S. cotton disappearance. A decade earlier, 1 Net returns after costs were lower in the 2 years following 2007, while 2010 returns were higher than those for 2007. Estimates of returns to cotton production in 2011 were signifi cantly lower than those for 2007. For current information on returns, see http://www. ers.usda.gov/data-products/commoditycosts-and-returns.aspx. the United States exported 7.5 million bales of cotton, which accounted for 40 percent of U.S. cotton disappearance. As U.S. cotton exports trended upward, domestic mill use declined to 4.6 million 480-pound bales in 2007 after peaking in 1997 at 11.3 million bales. Domestic mill use fell as apparel imports rose amid lower trade barriers and lower labor costs abroad (Meyer et al., 2007). As higher shares of the U.S. cotton crop are exported, the economic wellbeing of U.S. cotton producers becomes linked more closely to changes in foreign demand for cotton. Trade policies, exchange rates, the global economy, and cotton production and prices in foreign countries all infl uence foreign demand for U.S. cotton. Cotton producers may face increased market risks as a result of greater fl uctuations in annual cotton exports than in annual domestic mill use. Since China is a major importer of U.S cotton, changes in China's cotton demand will have signifi cant impacts on U.S. cotton producers."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "The data we analyzed came from ERS's farm-level production cost estimates for cotton and the cotton version of the 2007 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). 2 These two data sources are tightly intertwined since the cotton version of ARMS is one of two major data sources used by ERS to compute cotton production cost estimates. Several NASS reports provided secondary data for estimating cotton production costs. 3 The cotton version of the 2007 ARMS collected data related to cotton farms with a focus on cotton production practices, cotton production costs, and farm business characteristics, as well as the characteristics of farm operators. The survey was implemented in three phases: \u2022 Phase I: verifi ed the operating status of a farm and identifi ed whether the operator was a cotton producer. If so, the farm operator received the phase II cotton questionnaire in fall 2007. \u2022 Phase II: collected data on production practices, input usage, and input costs for a randomly selected cotton fi eld. Acres in the selected fi eld were weighted to represent NASS's number of planted cotton acres in the surveyed States. \u2022 Phase III: collected data related to the whole farm operation, including the fi nancial situation of the farm operation and the characteristics of the farm, farm operator, and farm household. The phase II cotton version of the survey provided 1,502 usable observations on farms planting cotton for lint, and these data served as the basis for estimates found in tables 1 and 2. The phase III cotton version of the survey targeted the same set of producers in spring 2008 that received phase II. As a result, data for the cotton production practices and costs collected in phase II of the survey can be matched with data on farm and operator characteristics from phase III. The phase III cotton version of the survey contained 1,114 usable observations from the pool of phase II respondents. Weights were applied to phase III data to more closely represent the population of cotton farms in the surveyed States. The weighted phase III data were used to produce estimates in the third table \"Characteristics of 2007 cotton farm and operators\" in each of the major sections in this report with one exception. Data on the type of crop insurance for cotton acreage came from phase II rather than phase III. Cotton producers from 11 States within the 4 traditional U.S. cotton producing regions-the Southeast, Delta, Southwest, and West-where the majority of cotton production takes place, were surveyed in the 2007 ARMS (fi g. 1). The 11 States included North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Texas, and California. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, these States accounted for 92 percent of all cotton farms, 95 percent of the harvested cotton acreage, and 94 percent of the cotton production. 2 ARMS is a joint effort by the National Agricultural Statistics Service and Economic Research Service.

Compared with mid-and high-cost producers, low-cost cotton producers, on average, used lower levels of inputs on their cotton fi elds and made fewer trips across their fi elds. Fewer trips resulted in lower ownership costs per unit. In addition, low-cost producers planted more cotton acres per farm than high-cost producers. Cotton production costs per acre and per pound varied widely in 2007 among farms due to differences in production and management practices, weather conditions, natural resources, effi ciencies, and varieties of cotton. Cotton farms were ranked from lowest to highest based on the operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton lint in 2007 and grouped into quartiles to evaluate the factors associated with various cost levels. 4 We chose to rank farms by operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton lint since these costs, over a period of several years, must be covered for sustainable cotton production. Low-and high-cost farms were in the extreme quartiles, while mid-cost farms consisted of farms in the mid-quartiles. 5 Producers in the lowest cost quartile produced 31 percent of the cotton lint, while producers in the middle two quartiles produced 56 percent of the cotton lint and high-cost producers produced 13 percent of the cotton lint (see table 1). In 2007, low-cost cotton producers received $0.55 per pound for cotton lint, far exceeding the price they needed to break even on cotton lint (see glossary, break-even price for cotton lint). As a result, all low-cost producers were able to cover their operating and ownership costs of cotton production from gross value of cotton production. At the opposite end, highcost producers needed $0.88 per pound, on average, to break even (fi g. 2). However, they received $0.59 per pound, on average, for their cotton. Nearly all the high-cost cotton producers, 96 percent, were not able to cover their operating and ownership costs of cotton production from cotton production in 2007. The average price of $0.57 per pound for cotton lint received by producers in the mid-cost group exceeded their average break-even price of $0.51 per pound for operating and ownership costs. Nearly 70 percent of mid-cost producers were able to cover their operating and ownership costs of cotton production from cotton sales. Although differences in both yield and costs per acre contributed to the $0.56 per pound gap in the average break-even price of cotton lint between low-and high-cost producers, yield differences contributed more. Low-cost producers averaged 1,057 pounds per acre of cotton lint in 2007, compared with 967 pounds per acre for mid-cost producers and 569 pounds per acre for high-cost producers. Part of the large yield difference between low-and high-cost producers was due to weather conditions in 2007. Southwest cotton producers saw record cotton yields in 2007 resulting from favorable weather conditions, while the drought in southeastern Tennessee, Alabama, northwestern Georgia, and southwestern South Carolina reduced cotton yields in 4 See box, \"ERS Cotton Production Costs and Returns,\" for more information on cost measures or refer to Appendix I: Determining the Break-Even Price per Pound of Cotton Lint. Less than 2 percent of cotton farms changed cost groups when cotton ginning and custom hauling costs were subtracted from the operating and ownership costs before ranking the farms into quartiles based on the remaining operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton lint. 5 Quartiles represent a quarter of the total. The low-cost group represents the 25 percent of farms with the lowest total operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton lint, while the highcost group represents the 25 percent of the farms with the highest operating and ownership costs per pound. Mid-cost producers were ranked from the 26th to the 74th percentile of farms."}, {"section_title": "ERS Cotton Production Costs and Returns", "text": "USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) production cost estimates include costs and returns for all participants in commodity production. Thus, the costs and returns of farmers, landlords, and contractors are included. Costs and returns for commodities are calculated on a per planted acre basis rather than per harvested acre. By computing the costs and returns per planted acre, varying degrees of crop failure are taken into consideration. ERS production cost estimates are computed based on the recommendations of the American Agricultural Economics Association Task Force on commodity costs and returns. ERS calculates gross returns per acre from the harvested quantity of the crop times the harvest month price from NASS divided by the number of planted acres. All expenses incurred up to the point of \"fi rst rest\" are included. The fi rst rest point for cotton is the selling point or, if it is not immediately sold, the storage point. Since cotton must be ginned, ginning costs are included in cotton production cost estimates. There are several measures of commodity costs , and each measure has a different purpose. Generally, a producer will not plant a commodity unless the expected revenue from commodity production exceeds expected operating costs. Operating costs include inputs that vary with the amount of the commodity planted. Often, these inputs are purchased and paid for annually. For our purposes, cotton operating costs include seed, fertilizer, chemicals, custom operations, fuel, repairs, purchased irrigation water, interest, hired labor, and cotton ginning costs. Over several growing seasons, producers need to recover their operating and ownership costs to continue producing a commodity profi tably over the longer term, including replacement of farm machinery, equipment, and facilities needed to effi ciently produce the commodity. Annual ownership costs include those for capital recovery in farm machinery, equipment, and facilities used in the production of the commodity, as well as the annual nonreal estate property taxes and insurance. Producers may examine expected and actual returns over total production costs for their farm operations and for individual commodities over a period of years to assist in planning their long-term goals. Producers who feel that their net returns are not suffi cient may reassess the commodity mix on their farming operation; allocation of time among farm work, nonfarm work, and other activities; and returns from alternate investment sources. Total production costs include the opportunity costs for land and unpaid labor and general farm overhead, in addition to operating and ownership costs. Often, the gross value of production does not cover total production costs in ERS's production cost estimates. This does not necessarily mean that producers are losing money by producing the commodity. Producers often store crops for later sale when prices are typically higher than the harvest month price or use forward contracting to lock in higher prices for their commodities. Many crop producers also receive Government payments, loans, or subsidies that, although not directly tied to the crop being produced, supplements income from commodity production. Producers may be willing to accept different rates of return than the ones used by ERS to estimate opportunity costs for owned land and unpaid labor. In ERS's production cost estimates, the cash rental rate for farmland is used to measure the opportunity cost of land used in cotton production. The off-farm wage rates earned by workers with comparable age, education, and location serves as a measure of the opportunity costs of unpaid labor. Producers may accept lower returns due to personal preferences, costs of switching occupations, Federal and State income and estate tax laws, or other factors. these areas. High yields likely pushed a higher-than-normal percentage of Texas cotton producers into the low-cost group in 2007. In the Southeast and Delta regions, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) data show that the average 2007 cotton lint yield was lower than the average annual yields for 2005-09 by 23 percent in Alabama, 6 percent in Georgia, 41 percent in South Carolina, and 31 percent in Tennessee. Many producers in these States were classifi ed with the high-cost group due to a temporary reduction in their cotton lint yields that boosted their average production costs per pound of cotton lint. The operating and ownership costs, which include ginning costs, averaged $468 per planted acre for low-cost producers in 2007, compared with $617 per acre for mid-cost producers and $580 per acre for high-cost producers. The cost per planted acre was lower for high-cost producers compared with mid-cost producers because high-cost producers had lower ginning costs per acre as a result of lower yields. Low-cost producers had statistically significant lower costs per planted cotton acre compared with mid-and high-cost producers for all operating and ownership cost items except for taxes, insurance, and ginning. Ginning costs were higher based on higher yields. Low-cost cotton producers planted an average of 771 acres of cotton per farm compared with high-cost producers who averaged 567 acres of planted cotton per farm. Since more cotton acreage may allow low-cost producers to make effi cient use of larger machines, low-cost cotton producers used larger planters and harvesters. On average, low-cost producers used planters that were 2 feet wider and harvesters that were 4 feet wider than those of highcost producers. On average, low-cost producers used lower levels of major inputs per planted acre of cotton in 2007, consuming less seed, gasoline, diesel, fertilizer, insecticides, and labor per planted acre than mid-and high-cost producers (see table 2). Low-cost producers were the least likely to apply fertilizers, and they made fewer applications of herbicides and insecticides. These actions resulted in fewer trips over their cotton fi elds and fewer labor hours used per acre. Low-cost producers' use of larger planters and harvesters also reduced their labor hours per acre. Mid-cost cotton producers were the most likely to irrigate their cotton fi elds. Irrigating typically raises fuel costs and capital recovery costs (i.e., machinery and equipment) that result from the use of irrigation pumps, wells, and various irrigation systems. Since electricity is a major energy source for irrigation pumps, electricity use per acre was highest for mid-cost producers. Cotton accounted for a larger share of the farm value of production for lowcost producers compared with high-cost producers. Approximately 57 percent of the gross value of agricultural production for low-cost producers is derived from cotton, compared with 40 percent for mid-cost producers and 31 percent for high-cost producers (table 3). If high-cost producers had achieved more normal cotton yields, their value of production attributable to cotton would have been closer to those for mid-and low-cost producers. The number of commodities produced per farm averaged 3.1 for low-cost producers, 3.8 for mid-cost producers, and 4.2 for high-cost producers. Greater commodity diversifi cation protects producers against large swings in net income if a commodity price or yield changes dramatically from the expected. Differences in commodity diversifi cation are due partly to the location of producers in the low-, mid-, and high-cost groups. Texas-a low-cost cotton production region-tends to be hot and dry, thus limiting the alternative crops that can be economically grown there. Mid-and highcost producers were more likely to grow soybeans, corn, peanuts, fruits, or vegetables. High-cost cotton producers had signifi cantly lower household incomes in 2007 compared with mid-and low-cost producers. Farm incomes for highcost producers were lower than those for low-and mid-cost producers, while the differences in off-farm income received by the producers' families in the different cost groups were not statistically signifi cant.

Like most crops, cotton is grown in several U.S. regions (see fi g. 1). Some of the diversity in cotton farms' production practices and characteristics is driven by location. Regional climatic and soil conditions infl uence the type of cotton grown, whether the cotton is irrigated, and the mix of agricultural commodities grown. Other factors, such as farmland availability and land costs, impact farm size in these regions. The Southwest is the major cotton production region, accounting for 42 percent of U.S. cotton farms and 48 percent of the planted cotton acres in 2007 (table 4 and  The percentage drop in cotton acres was less in the Southwest for several reasons. First, Southwest cotton producers had the highest average returns to upland cotton production per acre and the lowest average cotton production costs per acre, which encouraged cotton production in the region in 2007 (see box, \"Cotton Types\" and fi g. 3). 7 Because Southwest cotton yields per planted acre were similar to the U.S. average, their low per acre cotton production costs were largely responsible for high average returns. Their average per acre costs for seeds, fertilizer, chemicals, land, and general farm overhead matched or were signifi cantly lower than those for other regional producers. Southwest producer seed costs per acre were low because the region used more herbicide-resistant seeds than seeds with stacked genes.    Cotton lint produced, by region and cost groups, 2007 Southwest cotton farms produced more cotton than farms in any other region, and they produced most of the low-cost cotton. Southwest cotton producers used lower levels of fertilizer, gasoline, diesel, and insecticides per acre (table 5). The rate of decline in Southwest cotton acres was also slower due to climatic conditions. The Southwest climate is not as conducive to the production of other commodities, such as corn and soybeans, compared with the Southeast and Delta regions. Therefore, many Southwest cotton producers did not have the option of switching into corn or soybean production when demand for corn rose, pushing up corn prices and net returns for corn and soybeans. Cotton's importance to Southwest producers is refl ected in the average number of commodities produced per farm and in the percentage of cotton's production value to the farm's production value (table 6). The number of commodities produced is an indicator of the producers' fl exibility to shift commodity production should demand, prices, or local growing conditions change. Increased fl exibility may reduce long-term risks and lessen producers' dependence on a particular commodity. Cotton's production value as a share of agricultural production value indicates a producer's reliance on cotton. Higher percentages may indicate less diversifi cation and, therefore, higher risk for farm income variability should conditions for cotton change. Southwest cotton producers were the least agriculturally diversifi ed with an average of 2.9 commodities per farm, typically including sorghum and wheat. Cotton producers in the Southeast, Delta, and West averaged 3.6 or more commodities per farm. Soybeans and corn were grown on at least 45 percent of the Southeast and Delta farms, while peanuts were grown on more than half of Southeast cotton farms. Southeast cotton producers averaged 4.8 commodities per farm, the highest of all the regions. Cotton producers in the West often grew fruits, vegetables, or hay rather than corn, soybeans, or peanuts."}, {"section_title": "Cotton Types", "text": "Two major types of cotton are grown in the United States, with American Upland cotton accounting for 97 percent of the cotton acres planted and American Pima, or extra-long staple (ELS), accounting for the remainder of the acreage. Fiber from American Upland cotton is usually shorter than the fi ber from American Pima cotton. American Pima cotton is primarily grown in California, where it accounted for 57 percent of the State's planted cotton acreage in 2007 (USDA/ NASS, 2012). Small quantities of American Pima cotton are also grown in southwest Texas, southern Arizona, and New Mexico. In the United States, Pima cotton yields are, on average, signifi cantly higher than upland cotton yields. In California, however, where special varieties of upland cotton are grown, upland cotton yields exceed Pima yields. Producers receive higher prices for American Pima cotton compared with American Upland, partly refl ecting Pima's higher quality cotton lint and its higher production costs based on different ginning techniques and extra management needs. Pima cotton is more expensive to gin since it is roller-ginned to preserve the fi ber's length and quality, while upland cotton is saw-ginned or cut from the seed in the ginning process. Pima cotton is used mainly in higher value products, such as fi ner apparel, sewing thread, and fi ner home furnishings (Calcot, 2012). Southwest cotton producers' reliance on cotton is refl ected in the proportion of agricultural production value attributed to cotton. In 2007, cotton accounted for 58 percent of their agricultural production value, the highest percentage for all regions. These producers faced risks if cotton prices declined or if climatic events or disease signifi cantly reduced cotton yields. Cotton accounted for 45 percent of agricultural production value on Delta farms, 29 percent on Southeast farms, and 22 percent on West farms in 2007. Southwest producers were the most likely to purchase private insurance and Federal insurance on their cotton crop to mitigate risks imposed by the lack of crop diversity and reliance on cotton (table 6). Southwest cotton producers also were more likely to purchase Federal revenue insurance, 28 percent compared with 11 percent or less for cotton producers in other regions. Federal revenue insurance offers more fi nancial protection than insurance based on yields, since revenue insurance protects producers against both price and yield declines. Cotton production varies by region since they grow different cotton varieties. In 2007, about half of the West's cotton acres were planted with Pima cotton, with the balance of the region's cotton acres planted with upland cotton varieties not typically planted in other regions (see box, \"Cotton Types\"). While   cotton varieties grown in the West produce higher yields and garner higher prices for their lint, their irrigation needs and longer growing seasons tend to boost production costs per acre. In 2007, cotton yields in the West averaged 1,512 pounds per planted acre, more than 50 percent greater than the highest average yield for other cotton-producing regions. In 2007, all cotton acreage in the West was irrigated, while less than half the cotton acreage in other regions was irrigated (see table 5). The West's dependence on irrigation water for the cotton crop creates greater risk for producers should the supply or demand for irrigation water change signifi cantly in this region. Thus, signifi cant droughts, changes in irrigation water policies, and population growth in California, which would increase pressure to divert water supplies to California residents, may have signifi cant impacts on cotton producers in the West. In addition, irrigating usually raises per acre production costs for fuel, machinery and equipment, and land. The per acre costs for these items were highest in the West, pushing their operating, ownership, and economic cost of cotton production per acre above those for cotton producers in other regions (see table 4). Despite the high cotton production costs, producers in the West earned the highest average returns per acre after costs as a result of their above-average prices and yields. Cotton producers in the West owned more acres per farm and had the highest ratio of owned-to-operated farmland. Cotton farms in this region also were the most likely to have multiple operators (see table 6). Multiple partners in the farm operation may have boosted the percentage of farmland owned by the farm operation through the combined use of partner-owned assets. Cotton farms in the West generated the highest net cash income per farm in 2007, more than twice the average amount generated by cotton farms in other regions, even though cotton producers in the West operated fewer acres per farm than those in the Delta and Southwest. The above average net returns per acre from cotton production in the West, as well as their per acre returns from their fruit and vegetable production likely contributed to their high average net cash income per farm. Compared with cotton farms in other regions, Southeast cotton farms produced the lowest net cash income in 2007, partly as a result of the smaller number of acres operated and a widespread drought in the region."}, {"section_title": "Cotton Production, by Size of the Cotton Enterprise", "text": "The cost of production per acre and per pound of cotton did not vary signifi cantly by the size of the enterprise. Cotton played a larger role on farms with larger cotton enterprises. Producers on these farms were at a greater fi nancial risk if cotton yields or prices declined, but they also were more likely to take steps to mitigate their risks. The sizes and characteristics of cotton enterprises vary widely. Cotton farms were divided into fi ve classes based on the size of their cotton enterprise, where enterprise size was measured by the number of planted cotton acres per farm. At the extreme ends, cotton producers with more than 1,500 acres of planted cotton accounted for 11 percent of U.S. cotton farms and 36 percent of U.S. cotton production, while producers with fewer than 200 acres of planted cotton accounted for 25 percent of cotton farms and 4 percent of cotton production in 2007 (see box, \"Relationship Between Cotton Enterprise Size and Farm Typology\"). Most U.S. cotton production occurs on farms with 500 or more acres of planted cotton. In 2007, they accounted for 80 percent of planted cotton acreage and 46 percent of all cotton farms (table 7). In 2007, producers needed an average price of $0.49-$0.52 per pound, depending on enterprise size, to break even with the operating and ownership costs of cotton lint. These differences, however, were not statistically significant (i.e., due to chance). Cotton lint prices ranged from $0.56 to $0.58 per pound, well above the break-even price in each enterprise size category. In 2007, the average operating and ownership costs ranged from $540 to $582 per acre of cotton for the enterprise classes, but these differences were statistically insignifi cant. With economies of size, operators with larger cotton enterprises often have lower costs per unit because they can spread their fi xed costs over more units, and their larger size may allow them to negotiate better prices or receive discounts from bulk purchases. Average operating costs per acre ranged from $431 to $466 per acre and did not vary signifi cantly by the number of planted cotton acres per farm. Average ownership costs per acre were higher for farms with more cotton acreage (see table 6), contrary to what might be expected from economies of size. Capital recovery of machinery and equipment contributes most to ownership costs. In 2007, producers with 1,500 acres of cotton averaged $119 per acre in capital recovery costs compared with $93 per acre for those with fewer than 200 acres of cotton. ARMS data suggest that some producers with smaller cotton enterprises avoided purchasing large, specialized cotton machinery by relying on custom work, 8 which allowed small cotton enterprises to avoid capital recovery and repair costs for farm machinery. Custom costs per acre were higher for producers with smaller cotton enterprises, averaging $36 per acre for those with fewer than 200 acres of cotton compared with $16 per acre for those with 1,500 or more acres of cotton (table 7). Producers with smaller cotton enterprises made fewer trips over their fi elds, lending support to the fact that 8 Custom workers supply their own farm machinery. Custom work is not considered a component of the farming sector; rather, it is a component of the service sector. Therefore, the capital recovery costs for farm machinery supplied for custom operations are not included in ERS's production cost accounts and the number of trips over a fi eld does not include those for custom work."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Cotton Enterprise Size and Farm Typology", "text": "Commodity enterprise size and farm typology are related. The size of a crop enterprise is measured by the number of acres planted to the commodity, while farm typology is based on the annual gross sales of all commodities and the primary occupation of the operator. In many cases, farms with larger enterprises have higher sales unless there was a signifi cant crop failure. Because the ratio of unharvested cotton acres to planted cotton acres was low in 2007, producers with larger cotton enterprises generally had higher farm sales. For example, in 2007, 69 percent of the producers planting 1,500 or more cotton acres had annual sales of $1 million or more. Producers with higher farm sales may not always plant a large number of acres of the specifi c commodity. A signifi cant percentage of these producers had small-to mid-size cotton enterprises. In 2007, 29 percent of cotton producers with annual agricultural sales of $1 million or more planted 1,500 or more acres of cotton, while 26 percent of them planted fewer than 500 acres of cotton (see box table). There is a stronger relationship between small cotton farms and small cotton enterprises than there is between large cotton farms and large cotton enterprises. Only 1 percent of small family farms planted 1,500 or more acres of cotton, while 89 percent of small cotton farms planted fewer than 500 acres of cotton. Since very large cotton farms do not necessarily have large cotton enterprises, the characteristics of very large cotton farms can differ from the characteristics of cotton farms with large cotton enterprises. The most striking difference between these two groups is their commodity diversity and dependence on cotton production. Very large cotton farms have more commodity diversifi cation and are less dependent on cotton compared with farms with large cotton enterprises.  (table 8). In addition, 34 percent of the operators with the smallest cotton enterprises had their cotton custom harvested in 2007 compared with just 2 percent of the operators with the largest cotton enterprises. Higher repair costs per acre for producers with larger cotton enterprises indicate that they were more likely to use their own or leased machinery in fi eld operations."}, {"section_title": "Cotton farms, by cotton enterprise and farm typology, 2007", "text": "Cotton equipment often cannot be adapted for use on other crops. Hence, operators must have suffi cient cotton acreage to justify the purchase of machinery that can only be used on cotton. Cotton harvesters tend to be more expensive than other farm equipment designed for crop use. A four-row cotton picker with spindle cost $272,000 in 2007, second only to combines as the most expensive machinery based on the Agriculture Prices 2007 Summary (USDA/NASS, 2008a). In 2007, harvesting cotton also required module builders, which were expensive, although less so than cotton pickers. Only one of the return measures-the value of production less total costsshows a statistically signifi cant and positive correlation with the number of cotton acres per farm (see table 7). Including economic costs in total costs contributed to making these returns per acre statistically signifi cant since the economic cost per acre was lower on farms with more cotton acres in 2007.  Economic costs are the sum of the opportunity costs for land and unpaid labor and general farm overhead. All three of these economic costs were signifi cantly lower on a per acre basis for farms with more cotton acreage. Their opportunity cost of land was lower since cotton acres in the Southwest account for a larger share of their total cotton acres. The opportunity cost of cotton land is low in the Southwest, or $31 per acre compared with an average $62-$141 per acre for other regions (see table 4). Production practices and inputs do not vary greatly by enterprise size, with a few notable exceptions. Farms with larger cotton enterprises had a higher proportion of labor hours per acre supplied by paid laborers. The unpaid labor hours that can be provided by operators and their family members are often insuffi cient to meet the labor needs of larger enterprises. Nearly all farms with 1,500 or more acres of cotton (94 percent) used hired labor compared with half of farms with fewer than 200 acres of cotton (see table 8). In 2007, producers with more cotton acres per farm were less likely to rotate crops in their cotton fi elds, partly as a result of their lower levels of crop diversifi cation and cotton's dominance on their farm operations (fi g. 4). 9 Seventy percent of producers with 1,500 or more acres of cotton did not plant their 2007 cotton fi eld with other crops in 2006 compared with 37 percent 9 Note the defi nitional differences between farms with the largest cotton enterprises and the largest cotton farms. See box, \"Relationship Between Cotton Enterprise Size and Farm Typology.\" Many of the farms with the largest cotton enterprises will also be large cotton farms, but many large cotton farms will not have large cotton enterprises. of producers who grew fewer than 200 acres of cotton in 2007 (see table 8). More than half of the acreage on farms with 1,500 or more acres of cotton was planted to cotton in 2007 compared with 13 percent of the acreage on farms planting fewer than 200 acres of cotton. Cotton's production value to total production value averaged 15 percent on farms with fewer than 200 cotton acres compared with 62 percent for farms with 1,500 acres or more of cotton in 2007. As stated in the previous section, these higher percentages indicate increased risk for variations in farm income if conditions outside of a producer's control change the demand, yields, or prices for U.S. cotton. Farms with greater commodity diversity face less fi nancial risks since they often have greater fl exibility to shift production between commodities when supply and demand change, and they often rely less on income from any one commodity. Farms with 1,500 or more acres of cotton in 2007 averaged 3.1 commodities per farm, compared with 4.1 or more commodities per farm for farms with fewer than 200 acres of cotton. Producers with more cotton acreage also tend to have higher percentages of debt to assets. These producers are at greater risk of defaulting on their loans should their income levels drop. In 2007, producers with fewer than 1,000 acres of cotton had debt-to-asset levels averaging 9 percent compared with 16 percent for producers with 1,500 or more acres of cotton. Higher average debt-to-asset percentages are usually found on farms with large enterprises  Cotton's role on farms, by cotton enterprise size, 2007 Farms with larger cotton enterprises tend to specialize in cotton. They grow fewer commodities per farm, and cotton accounts for a higher percentage of their value of production. devoted to one crop. 10 These farms were the least likely to have operators who were 65 years or older. Older operators tend to have lower debt-to-asset percentages since they have had more time to repay their debt obligations. Cotton producers facing greater risk from farm income variability and loan repayment problems as a result of high percentages of cotton to total acres, cotton production value to total production value, and debt to assets were more likely to mitigate these risks. In 2007, 98 percent of operators with 1,500 or more cotton acres insured their cotton crop through Federal or private crop insurance compared with 77 percent of cotton producers with fewer than 200 acres of cotton (table 9). Producers with more cotton acreage also were more likely to purchase higher levels of insurance coverage for their cotton crop. According to Shields (2010), basic catastrophic and buy-up policies provided payments based on yield losses, with buy-up policies providing greater benefi t levels than basic policies. Federal revenue policies are based on both prices and yields, so they provide income protection to producers. In 2007, 22 percent of producers with the largest cotton enterprises obtained Federal revenue insurance policies on their cotton crop compared with 8 percent of producers with the smallest cotton enterprises (table 9). Producers can mitigate their fi nancial risks by share-renting farmland. In share-renting, the landlord often receives a percentage of the crop and, therefore, shares in the risks for price and yield changes. In 2007, producers with fewer than 200 acres of cotton per farm share-rented 23 percent of their total farm acres, while producers with 1,500 or more cotton acres per farm sharedrented 44 percent of their farm acres. Producers with the largest cotton enterprises are slightly younger, on average, and they are more likely to have a partnership arrangement on their farms compared with producers with the smallest cotton enterprises. Cotton producers with different sizes of cotton enterprises showed no distinguishable difference in their level of education. In 2007, the off-farm income received by cotton producers' families did not vary signifi cantly by the size of the cotton enterprise, even though considerable variation did exist in the average farm income received per farm family among these groups. 10 See http://www.ers.usda.gov/dataproducts/commodity-costs-and-returns/ readings.aspx for a series of bulletins on the \"Characteristics and Production Costs\" for crops and livestock. The Demand for Disaggregated Food-Away-from-Home and Food-at-Home Products in the United States / ERR-139 Economic Research Service/USDA  "}, {"section_title": "Cotton Production, by Farm Typology", "text": "The largest farms dominate cotton production. These farms were the most likely to irrigate their cotton acres and used more inputs per acre of cotton. On average, the largest cotton farms were more diversifi ed in their commodity production and less dependent on cotton production. Operators of these farms were slightly younger and were more likely to be in a farm partnership arrangement. While the number of cotton farms is spread somewhat evenly among the four ERS typology groups (table 10), 2007 ARMS data show that most cotton production takes place on the largest cotton farms. 11 Farms with $1 million or more of annual agricultural sales accounted for 26 percent of all U.S. cotton farms, but they produced just over 50 percent of the cotton lint. In contrast, small family farms accounted for 28 percent of all U.S. cotton farms and produced 8 percent of the cotton lint. Since the share of cotton farms in each farm typology class was roughly the same, differences in the number of planted cotton acres per farm and the proportion of planted cotton acres harvested contributed to the concentration of cotton production on very large farm operations. Small family farms averaged 254 acres of planted cotton per farm, while the largest family farms averaged 1,241 acres of planted cotton per farm (see box, \"Relationship Between Cotton Enterprise Size and Farm Typology\"). In 2007, small family farm operators abandoned a larger share of their cotton acres (5 percent) than operators of the largest cotton farms (less than 1 percent). Southwest cotton producers planted more cotton acres in 2007 than producers in any other region, and they dominated the cotton acres planted in each of the farm typology groups except for producers with $1 million or more in annual agricultural sales (fi g. 5). In that group, Delta cotton producers planted the most cotton acres. Most cotton production in the Delta region occurred on farms with gross annual sales of $1 million or more. For 2007, the average price received for cotton lint exceeded the average break-even price for three of the four farm typology groups. Producers with the largest farms-those with the highest annual sales-were the most likely to recover operating and ownership costs of cotton production from cotton revenue in 2007. For the fourth typology group-large family farms-the average price for cotton lint matched the break-even price. Half of the producers in this group recovered their operating and ownership costs for cotton production. In 2007, the average operating and ownership costs attributed to cotton lint ranged from $0.48 to $0.55 per pound among the typology classes, but the costs did not follow a straightforward pattern. Producers with very large cotton farms-gross annual sales between $500,000 and $999,999-had the lowest average cotton lint cost ($0.48 per pound), while producers of large farms-gross annual sales between $250,000 and $499,999-had the highest lint cost ($0.55 per pound). Since cotton lint costs per pound consist of two components-the cost per planted acre and the yield per planted acre-each will be examined in more detail. 11 See Glossary for a defi nition of farm typology classes. Also, see Appendix II for a comparison of Census of Agriculture and ARMS data on the distribution of cotton farms by typology classes. The average operating and ownership costs per planted acre of cotton were higher on farms with greater annual gross sales, even though more cotton acres were planted per farm. Differences in the average cost per acre among the typology classes were statistically signifi cant. In 2007, producers with gross annual sales of $1 million or more averaged $653 per acre in operating and ownership costs compared with $426 per acre for small family farms with gross annual sales of less than $250,000 (see table 10). This contradicts what one normally expects, since farms with more acreage devoted to a particular commodity often will have lower costs per unit due to economies of size. With economies of size, fi xed costs can be spread over more output units and operators are more likely to receive discounts for bulk purchases of inputs, which would lower the operating cost per unit. Farms with sales of $1 million or more had higher-than-average costs per planted acre for two reasons. First, they had higher average cotton yields per planted acre, so their ginning costs per acre were higher. In 2007, cotton lint yields averaged 689 pounds for small family farms compared with 1,005 pounds for the largest family farms. Second, operators of the largest farms were more likely to plant Pima cotton or specialized varieties of upland cotton that are more expensive to produce because of their longer growing season, irrigation needs, and, in the case of Pima cotton, more expensive ginning techniques. Operators of larger farms achieved higher cotton yields per planted acre based on a variety of factors. Larger cotton farms were more likely to irrigate their cotton, which reduces yield losses. In 2007, 48 percent of the cotton acres on cotton farms with sales of $1 million or more were irrigated compared with 23 percent on small family farms (table 11). Most Pima cotton, with its higher yields, was grown on farm operations with sales of $1 million or more. From 2003 to 2007, the weighted annual yield averaged 812 pounds of cotton lint per harvested acre for upland cotton compared with 1,260 pounds per acre for Pima cotton (USDA/NASS, 2011). Finally, operators of larger farms harvested 97 percent or more of their planted cotton acres compared with 95 percent for operators of small family farms. Cotton farms with sales of $1 million or more used more inputs per acre of cotton production in 2007 than farms in any other typology class. Diesel fuel and electricity consumption per planted cotton acre was signifi cantly higher on very large farms; these were the two most commonly used energy sources to operate irrigation pumps. Operators of the largest cotton farms were most likely to apply nitrogen, and just over 75 percent applied insecticide to their cotton acres compared with 50-61 percent of the producers of smaller cotton farms. Producers with the largest cotton farms made more trips over their cotton fi elds, 11.4 trips on average compared with 8.8 trips for producers with small family farms. In addition to being the least likely to use nitrogen and insecticides in 2007, small farms producers were more likely to abandon their    cotton acres and were nearly three times as likely to custom harvest their cotton acreage compared with the largest cotton farm producers. Total labor hours per acre for cotton production in 2007 did not vary significantly among the farm size classes. The ratio of paid labor hours to total labor hours per cotton acre, however, did vary signifi cantly over the same period. Paid labor hours per acre ranged from 25 percent to 67 percent of total labor hours per acre in 2007, with a higher share for those with larger farms. Operators with the smallest farms were the least likely to hire labor for cotton production (40 percent), while operators with the largest farms were the most likely to hire labor (91 percent). Because operators with the largest farms planted an average of 1,231 acres of cotton in 2007, these operators often hired workers to assist with planting, maintaining, and harvesting the cotton. In contrast, operators with the smallest farms planted an average of 254 acres of cotton per farm, and these acres could frequently be attended to by the operators and unpaid family members. Although more trips were made across cotton fi elds on the largest cotton farms in 2007, the labor hours expended per cotton acre were not significantly different based on the size of the cotton farm, partly as a result of the maximum width of machinery used in the cotton operation. On average, in 2007, operators with the largest farms used larger planters (29 feet wide), while operators with the smallest farms used smaller planters (23 feet wide). Operators with the largest farms are the least dependent on cotton production and rely on the greatest commodity diversity. 12 Cotton accounted for 33 percent of all agricultural production value on the largest farms compared with 53-61 percent on smaller cotton farms (table 12). Operators of the largest cotton farms produced an average of 4.4 agricultural commodities per farm compared with 3.7 or less commodities for operators in other farm typology groups. Operators of the largest farms were more likely to grow corn, soybeans, wheat, fruits, and vegetables and less likely to raise cattle. Operators with the largest farms were less likely to purchase Federal revenue insurance but more likely to purchase buy-up insurance on their cotton crop. 13 Crop revenue insurance provides income coverage for low prices or low yields, while catastrophic (CAT) and buy-up insurance provides coverage for low yields (Shields, 2010). The operators of the largest cotton farms may have been the least likely to purchase cotton revenue insurance because they were at the least risk from income fl uctuations caused by deviations in cotton prices or cotton yields. The characteristics of the largest cotton farms and their operators differed from those in the other typology classes. Principal operators of the largest farms tended to be younger and were more likely to list farming as their primary occupation than operators of smaller farms. In 2007, operators with the largest farms were more effi cient at generating gross cash income per dollar of cash expenses from the farm operation than operators of smaller farms. On average, the largest family farms generated an average of $142 in gross cash income for every $100 in cash production expenses, compared with an average of $109 in gross cash income by small family farms. The average annual net cash income earned per farm varied widely among the farm typology classes. Operators of small cotton farms earned an average of $11,600 per farm, while operators of large cotton farms earned an average of $637,700 per farm. Differences in farm size and fi nancial effi ciency contributed to differences in average income per farm. The annual household income of cotton operators varied considerably by farm size in 2007. Large and small family farm operators' household incomes averaged less than $60,000 in 2007, with most of their household income coming from off-farm sources. In contrast, household income for operators of very large farms averaged $175,000 or more, with farm income the major source of income. The average annual value of farm equity per farm was higher for larger farms. The equity in small farms averaged $864,000 per farm, compared with $3,618,000 per farm for the largest cotton farms in 2007. The largest cotton farms were more likely to have multiple farm owners and to be organized in a partnership arrangement. Partnership arrangements allow owners to pool resources (see the Glossary for a defi nition of farm organization). Although farm equity per farm was highest on very large farms, operators of these farms had higher average ratios of debt-to-farm assets, indicating that these operators are at a greater risk to default on loans should farm income drop for several years. 12 The largest cotton farms are not the same as farms with the largest cotton enterprises. The largest cotton farms are those farms whose operators planted at least 1 acre of cotton with the intention of harvesting the cotton for lint and whose operators had gross annual sales of $1 million or more from all commodities. See box, \"Relationship Between Cotton Enterprise Size and Farm Typology.\" Some of the largest cotton farms have small cotton enterprises. 13 In 2007, crop revenue insurance was unavailable for Pima cotton. The infl uence on the statistics presented here would be minimal because Pima cotton was grown on only 2 percent of the cotton acreage, according to 2007 ARMS data.  "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Cotton farms vary considerably in how much they rely on cotton. Cash receipts from the sale of cotton constitute a high percentage of total farm receipts for some cotton farms and a low percentage for others. The production practices and characteristics of cotton farms growing Pima cotton differ signifi cantly from farms growing upland cotton. Most cotton production takes place on large farm operations. In contrast, most food and feed grain production tends to be more evenly distributed among different size farms. Among all cotton farms, high-cost producers were the least likely to recover production costs due to low yields caused by poor growing conditions. The large gap in expected and actual yields suggests that these low yields resulted from temporary conditions. Less than 15 percent of 2007 cotton was produced by high-cost producers. In contrast, all producers with low operating and ownership costs per pound of cotton lint were able to cover their costs from the gross value of cotton production. These producers had higher cotton yields as well as lower production costs per acre than mid-and highcost producers. Low-cost producers, on average, applied less inputs per cotton acre than mid-or high-cost producers, typically because low-cost producers were not as likely to apply such inputs as fertilizer or insecticides. Southwest cotton producers dominated U.S. cotton production in 2007 because they lacked alternative crops and because they had relatively low cotton production costs. Southwest cotton producers had higher net returns from American Upland cotton production than producers in other regions in 2007. Southwest cotton producers are vulnerable to changes in cotton demand because they have less crop diversity and cotton accounts for more than half of their farm production value. Cotton farms in the West grew varieties of cotton that have different requirements than varieties grown in other regions. And because all cotton acres in the West were irrigated, farms in this region were vulnerable to factors that could affect their ability to obtain irrigation water, including droughts, changes in water policies, and rising demand for water from urban areas. Economies of size suggest that operators with more cotton acreage would have lower costs per pound of cotton lint or cotton acre. Cotton costs per unit, however, did not vary signifi cantly by the size of the cotton enterprises. Many operators with small cotton enterprises used custom work to avoid ownership and repair costs associated with expensive cotton harvesting equipment. Operators of farms with larger cotton enterprises were more dependant on cotton than operators of farms with smaller cotton enterprises. This put operators with larger enterprises at increased fi nancial risk should cotton prices or yields drop. Many of these operators recognized the risks, however, as they were more likely to purchase buy-up or crop revenue insurance on their cotton acreage. Not only did these operators face increased risk based on the size of their cotton enterprise, but they also faced relatively high debt-to-asset ratios for their whole farm operation. They offset some of this fi nancial risk by share-renting a high percentage of their operated land. Also, farm operators with larger cotton enterprises were younger, on average, which allows them more time to recover from fi nancial setbacks. One might expect there to be a signifi cant correlation of characteristics among farms with a large number of cotton acres and farms with a high level of gross annual sales because farms with more acreage tend to have higher sales. However, fi ndings show no evidence of a straightforward relationship between the number of cotton acres per farm and the annual value of agricultural sales from a farm operation. As such, the characteristics of farms with large cotton enterprises differ from those of large cotton farms (see box, \"Relationship Between Cotton Enterprise Size and Farm Typology\"). Our results also show that, on average, operators planting a greater number of cotton acres had less agriculturally diverse farming operations and were more reliant on cotton compared with farm operators with annual sales of $1 million or more in 2007. Operators with total farm sales of $1 million or more had the highest cotton cost of production per acre, even though these operators planted the most cotton acres per farm. These operators were more likely to use higher levels of inputs per cotton acre since they were more likely to irrigate their cotton and were more likely to raise Pima cotton. These latter two factors also contributed to higher cotton yields, which boosted ginning costs per acre. Although their cotton yields per acre were higher, higher production costs left these larger farms with net returns per acre from cotton production not signifi cantly different from those obtained by cotton producers with small family farms. Grasses are plants that require nitrogen for growth but cannot convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by the plants. Therefore, producers usually apply nitrogen to their grass crops. For our purposes, cotton was considered to be rotated with grasses if grasses are planted in summer 2006 and a second crop was not planted in the fall, or if grasses were planted in fall 2006 regardless of how the land was used during summer 2006. Winter wheat and rye are examples of two grasses frequently rotated with cotton. Oats are a grass that is sometimes rotated with cotton. Idled land was fallowed or in the Conservation Reserve Program during summer and fall 2006. Economic costs: the sum of opportunity costs for land and unpaid labor and general farm overhead. The opportunity costs for land are based on cash rental rates per acre, and unpaid labor is valued at off-farm wage rates. Expected yields: the yields farm operators reported that they expected to achieve when planting their cotton fi eld. Farm household income: computed based on ARMS data and equals the sum of farm income and off-farm income for farm households but excludes farm income earned by landlords and contractors. It also excludes farm income generated by farms organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives or by those operated by hired managers. For farms with multiple operators or partners, the farm income, off-farm income, and household income fi gures used in this report represent those for the household of the principal farm operator. Farm income of farm households is defi ned as net cash farm business income plus net income from farmland rental and earnings of the operator household from farming activities, minus the sum of depreciation, gross farmland rental income, and farm business income received by other households. Off-farm income consists of wages, salaries, net income from nonfarm businesses, interest, dividends, transfer payments, Social Security retirement, pensions, other retirement plans, gifts, net cash income from another farm operation, net income from farmland rental, and other off-farm sources. Farm organization: the legal status of the farm business. Sole or family proprietors have no legal partners or shareholders (USDA/NASS, 2008b). Under the sole or family proprietor arrangement, the operator(s), usually husband and wife, are regarded as self-employed and personally liable for all the farm's obligations. In legal partnership arrangements, the farm is owned by two or more people. Not all partners need to be operators. The partnership agreement defi nes who is responsible for daily decisions and designates how farm profi ts are shared. A corporation, created under Federal or State laws, is a separate legal entity distinct from its owners. The owners are share or stock holders in the corporation. Family corporations are corporations where family members are the owners. Farm typology: the grouping of farms into homogeneous classes to facilitate the analysis of a diverse farm sector. ERS has defi ned farm typology classes based on the gross annual value of farm sales of all agricultural products, the farm operator's main occupation, and the ownership of farm assets. The primary occupation of farmers was reported by the farmers in a response to an ARMS question. Under the farm typology classifi cation system, a farm is considered a family farm if half or more of the farm assets are owned by the farm operator or other individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Farms not meeting the family farm defi nition are classifi ed as nonfamily farms. All farms in the 2007 cotton version of the ARMS met ERS's defi nition of a family farm. Hence, no cotton farms in this report were classifi ed as nonfamily farms. Since cotton farms tend to be large farm operations, ERS farm typology classifi cations have been modifi ed for our purposes. Under the ERS farm typology classifi cation system, small farms-gross annual sales under $250,000-are divided into subgroups based on the farmer's primary occupation. There were not a suffi cient number of ARMS observations from small cotton farms to allow an analysis among the small farm subgroups. Hence, data on small farms were combined. ERS defi nes very large farms as those with annual sales of $500,000 or more. With 51 percent of the 2007 cotton farms falling into this group, the very large farms category was subdivided into two groups-farms with annual sales of $500,000-$999,999 and farms with annual sales of $1 million or more. For our purposes, farm typology defi nitions are as follows. \u2022 Small family farms: family farms with gross annual sales of less than $250,000 in 2007, regardless of the operator's primary occupation. \u2022 Large family farms: family farms with gross annual sales of $250,000-$499,999 in 2007. \u2022 Very large family farms: family farms with gross annual sales of $500,000 or more in 2007. This category of farms was subdivided into: -Family farms with sales of $500,000-$999,999; and -Family farms with sales of $1 million or more. Labor hours per acre: exclude the hours spent by workers performing custom fi eld operations. Lime: a soil additive normally applied once every few years to a fi eld to improve agricultural production. Amounts per acre shown in the tables here are the average prorated annual amount of lime applied to all planted cotton acres. The annual prorated amount applied on farms using lime is computed by taking the amount of lime applied and dividing it by the number of years between lime applications for each farm reported in ARMS. The annual prorated amount of the lime is then summed across all farms and divided by the sum of planted cotton acres to calculate the prorated amount of lime per acre on all cotton acres. Principal operator: the person who makes most of the daily decisions for the farm operation. Trips over fi eld: counts the number of trips made across the selected cotton fi eld. The number of trips excludes trips made by custom operators since the costs for labor, fuel, and machinery used in custom operations are included in the costs for custom operations for cotton. Tandem operations count as one trip over the fi eld. Partial trips over a fi eld are included in this calculation. For example, if a producer sprays pesticide over the entire fi eld and later sprays pesticide over half of the fi eld, then the number of trips over the fi eld would be recorded as 1.5 trips for pesticide applications. Width of farm machinery: the maximum width of farm machinery used on the cotton enterprise. The machinery used in custom operations is excluded from this calculation. Because small cotton farms are under-represented and large farms are overrepresented in the phase III cotton version of the 2007 ARMS, the percentages across the farm typology classes for total cotton farms, planted acres, cotton production quantity, and cotton production value (see table 10), as well as the U.S. aggregate estimates derived from phase III (see table 3) may be skewed. Per farm estimates taken from phase III and data derived from phase II of ARMS are the least likely to be infl uenced by the under-representation of small cotton farms and the over-representation of large cotton farms."}]
