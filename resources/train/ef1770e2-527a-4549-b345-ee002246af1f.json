[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Industrial policies that subsidize (often large) incumbent \u2026rms, either permanently or when they face distress, are pervasive. Many European governments have supported large \u2026rms with the aim of creating national champions (Owen, 2000;Lerner, 2012). The majority of regional aid also ends up going to larger \u2026rms because they tend to be more e\u00a4ective at obtaining subsidies (Criscuolo et al., 2012). This industrial aid has grown substantially with the onset of the recent recession, as exempli\u2026ed by the US bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in the Fall of 2008, which cost an estimated $82 billion (Rattner, 2010). The European Union also spent massive amounts on its bailouts, with e1.18 trillion (equivalent to 9.6% of EU GDP) going to aid in 2010 alone (European Commission, 2011). Despite the ubiquity of such policies, their e\u00a4ects are poorly understood. They may encourage incumbents to undertake greater investments, increase productivity and protect employment (e.g., Aghion et al., 2012). But they may also reduce economic growth by discouraging innovation by both entrants and incumbents and slowing down reallocation. The reallocation implications of such policies may be particularly important because the existing literature attributes as much as 70% or 80% of productivity growth in the United States to reallocation-exit of less e\u00a2 cient and entry of more e\u00a2 cient \u2026rms. 1 An analysis of industrial policy subsidizing incumbents \u2026rst needs to distinguish between different types of subsidies (e.g., subsidies to the operation of incumbents vs. those to incumbent R&D). More importantly, it also needs to build upon an empirical and theoretical framework with several crucial dimensions of \u2026rm-level heterogeneity and \u2026rm behavior. In particular: (1) this framework must incorporate meaningful \u2026rm heterogeneity in productivity, innovation behavior, employment growth, and exit behavior (including potentially between small and large, and young and old \u2026rms); (2) it must combine innovation by incumbents and by entrants; (3) it must link reallocation of resources to innovation; and (4) it must include an exit margin for less productive \u2026rms (so that the role of subsidies that directly or indirectly prevent exit can be studied). The \u2026rst part of the paper develops such a framework and provides a characterization of equilibrium innovation and reallocation dynamics. The second part of the paper estimates the parameters of the model and conducts policy experiments intended to shed light on the impact of di\u00a4erent types of industrial policy. Our model builds on the endogenous technological change literature (e.g., Romer, 1990, Aghion and Howitt, 1992, Grossman and Helpman, 1991 and in particular, on Klette and Kortum's (2004) and Lentz and Mortensen's (2008) models of \u2026rm-level innovation, and also incorporates major elements from the reallocation literature (e.g., Hopenhayn, 1992, Hopenhayn and Rogerson, 1993, Ericson and Pakes, 1995, Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008, Guner et al. 2008, Hsieh and Klenow, 2009, Jones, 2011, Peters, 2012. Incumbents and entrants invest in R&D in order to improve over (one of) a continuum of products. Successful innovation adds to the number of product lines in which the \u2026rm has the best-practice technology (and \"creatively\"destroys the lead of another \u2026rm in this product line). Incumbents also increase their productivity for non-R&D related reasons (i.e., without investing in R&D). Because operating a product line entails a \u2026xed cost, \u2026rms may also decide to exit some of the product lines in which they have the best-practice technology if this technology has su\u00a2 ciently low productivity relative to the equilibrium wage. Finally, \u2026rms have heterogeneous (high and low) types a\u00a4ecting their innovative capacity-their productivity in innovation. This heterogeneity introduces a selection e\u00a4 ect as the composition of \u2026rms is endogenous, which will be both important in our estimation and central for understanding the implications of di\u00a4erent policies. We assume that \u2026rm type changes over time and that low-type is an absorbing state (i.e., high-type \u2026rms can transition to low-type but not vice versa), which is important for accommodating the possibility of \u2026rms that have grown large over time but are no longer innovative. This selection e\u00a4ect is shaped by two opposing forces: on the one hand, old \u2026rms will be positively selected because low-type \u2026rms are more likely to exit endogenously (e.g., Jovanovic, 1982, Hopenhayn, 1992; on the other hand, old \u2026rms will be negatively selected because more of them will have transitioned to the low-type status. The balance of these two forces will determine whether young (and small) \u2026rms are more innovative and contribute more to growth. This feature also implies that the key dimension of reallocation in our model is that of skilled labor used for R&D and for \u2026xed operating costs. In particular, skilled labor is allocated for R&D across \u2026rms with di\u00a4erent types and between R&D and operating costs. Our focus on the reallocation (and misallocation) of R&D inputs is di\u00a4erent from that of much of the literature, which emphasizes the reallocation of production input. This focus is motivated by the importance of innovation activities for economic growth. Our model separates R&D and production inputs both for greater transparency and because the margin between R&D and non-R&D activities for production workers seems secondary for the issues at hand. Despite the various dimensions of \u2026rm-level decisions, heterogeneity, and selection e\u00a4ects, which will prove important in our estimation and quantitative exercises, we show that the model is tractable and that much of the equilibrium can be characterized in closed form (conditional on the wage rate, which does not admit a closed-form solution). This equilibrium characterization then enables the estimation of the model's parameters using simulated method of moments. The data we use for estimation come from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database and Census of Manufacturers, the National Science Foundation's Survey of Industrial Research and Development, and the NBER Patent Database. We design our sample around innovative \u2026rms that are in operation during the 1987-1997 period. As discussed in greater detail below, the combination of these data sources and our sample design permits us to study the full distribution of innovative \u2026rms, which is important when considering reallocation of resources for innovation, and to match the model's focus on R&D-based \u2026rms. Our model closely links the growth dynamics of \u2026rms to their underlying innovation e\u00a4orts and outcomes, and we quantify the reallocation of resources necessary for innovation. 2 Our sample contains over 98% of the industrial R&D conducted in the US during this period. which we use in our estimations below. They show R&D expenditures by shipments, employment growth and exit rates between small, large, young and old \u2026rms. Small and large are distinguished by the median employment counts in the sample by year; young and old are split by whether or not the \u2026rm is ten years old. A noteworthy pattern within our sample is that small and young \u2026rms are both more R&D intensive and grow more. 3 Thus, industrial policies that discourage the reallocation of resources towards newer \u2026rms might indeed be costly in that they slow the movement of R&D resources from less e\u00a2 cient innovators (struggling incumbents) towards more e\u00a2 cient innovators (new \u2026rms). We compute 21 moments capturing key features of \u2026rm-level R&D behavior, shipments growth, employment growth and exit, and how these moments vary by size and age. We use these moments to estimate the 12 parameters of our model. The model performs well and matches these 21 moments qualitatively (meaning that the rankings by \u2026rm age and size are on target) and on the whole also quantitatively. In addition, we show that a variety of correlations implied by the model (not targeted in the estimation) are similar to the same correlations computed from the data. Finally, we also evaluate the model by comparing the response of innovation to R&D expenditure and R&D tax credits in our model to various micro and instrumental-variables estimates in the literature and \u2026nd that they are in the ballpark of these estimates. We then use our model to study the e\u00a4ects of various counterfactual policies and gain insights about whether substantial improvements in economic growth and welfare are possible. We \u2026rst look at the impacts of di\u00a4erent types of industrial policies: subsidies to incumbent R&D, to the continued operation of incumbents and to entry. The main result here is that all these policies have small e\u00a4ects, and in the case of subsidies to incumbents, these are negative e\u00a4ects both on growth and welfare. For example, a subsidy to incumbent R&D equivalent to 5% of GDP reduces growth from 2.24% to 2.16% and welfare (in consumption equivalent terms) by about 1.5%. A subsidy equivalent to 5% of GDP to the continued operation of incumbents reduces growth by exactly the same amount, but welfare by less, by about 0.8%. A subsidy equivalent to 5% of GDP to entry increases growth and welfare, but again by a small amount (growth increases to 2.32% and welfare by 0.63%). 4 When we consider subsidies equivalent to 1% of GDP, all of these numbers are correspondingly smaller. These small e\u00a4ects might \u2026rst suggest that the equilibrium of our model is approximately optimal. Though they do indeed reveal that any deviation from optimality is not just related to insu\u00a2 cient R&D incentives (a typical occurrence in models with endogenous innovation), in reality they mask a very substantial ine\u00a2 ciency in equilibrium originating from the selection e\u00a4ect discussed above. This can be seen in two ways. First, we compute the socially optimal allocation chosen by a planner who controls R&D investments, and entry and exit decisions of di\u00a4erent types of \u2026rms. We \u2026nd that such an allocation would achieve a 3:8% growth rate per annum (relative to 2:24% in equilibrium) and a 6:46% increase in welfare. The social planner achieves this by forcing low-type incumbents to exit at a very high rate and reducing their R&D, and increasing Akcigit (2010), Akcigit and Kerr (2010), Cohen and Klepper (1996a,b), Corsino, Espa and Micciolo (2011), Lee and Sung (2005) and Tether (1998). See also Haltiwanger et al. 2013) on the role of small and young \u2026rms in job creation. 4 We report the implications of subsidies equivalent to 5% of GDP to make the numbers easier to understand. This underscores the limited magnitude of thehow small the growth and welfare implications of industrial policy. For comparison, note that R&D tax credits to incumbents, the main form of R&D subsidy in the United States, was about $8 billion in 2007, 2008 and 2009 (see http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Corporation-Research-Credit), so about 0.06% of GDP. the R&D of high-type incumbents, thus inducing a strong selection from low-type \u2026rms where the productivity of skilled labor is low to high-type \u2026rms. Second, we look at the e\u00a4ect of using optimal levels of incumbent R&D, entrant and operation subsidy/tax. We \u2026nd that with all three, or just with taxes on continued operation of incumbents and subsidies to incumbent R&D, growth can be increased to about 3.11% and welfare can be increased by almost 5%. This can be achieved by having a huge tax on the continued operation of incumbents ombined with a modest subsidy to incumbent R&D (between 12 and 17%). Such a policy strongly leverages the selection e\u00a4ect just like what the social planner was able to achieve directly. In particular, the high tax on the continued operation of incumbents encourages exit, but much more so for low-type \u2026rms, and the incumbent R&D becomes e\u00a4ectively directed towards high-type \u2026rms (since the low-type ones are exiting). If allowed, optimal policy also subsidizes entrants, but this is fairly marginal (about 6%, equivalent to about 1% of GDP). Though entry and incumbent R&D play pivotal roles, it turns out to be much better to support these by freeing resources from ine\u00a2 cient, low-type incumbents rather than subsidizing entry or incumbent R&D directly (and this is the reason why the incumbent R&D subsidy by itself was ine\u00a4ective). We also show that these conclusions are robust to a range of variations. First, they are very similar if we impose the elasticity of innovation to R&D from some of the micro estimates rather than estimating it by simulated method of moments. Second, they are similar if we shut down non-R&D productivity growth. Third, they are also fairly similar when we make the entry margin much more inelastic, which would be the case, for example, if there were a \u2026xed or limited supply of potential entrants. Overall, our policy analysis leads to a number of new results (relative to the literature and beliefs and practices in policy circles). First, industrial policy (support to existing \u2026rms and industries) is damaging to growth and welfare, and at best ine\u00a4ective. Second, the equilibrium is ine\u00a2 cient, but in contrast to other models of endogenous innovation, this cannot be recti\u2026ed by R&D subsidies. Third, the allocation of resources and growth can be signi\u2026cantly improved by exploiting the selection e\u00a4ect, which is only weakly utilized in equilibrium. This involves encouraging the reallocation of R&D resources (skilled labor) from low-type incumbents to high-tech incumbents and entrants, and if done e\u00a4ectively, it can increase growth and welfare by a signi\u2026cant amount. Our paper is related to a number of di\u00a4erent literatures. First, it bridges the works focusing on reallocation (e.g., Foster et al. 2000Foster et al. , 2006Foster et al. and 2008 which take productivity growth and innovation as exogenous and the parallel literature focusing on innovation (e.g., Romer 1990, Aghion and Howitt 1992, Grossman and Helpman 1991, Jones 1995 that does not examine reallocation. Second, it builds on the prior micro-to-macro innovation literature pioneered by Klette and Kortum (2004) and Lentz and Mortensen (2008). We extend this work in a number of important ways, in particular by introducing endogenous exit and time variation in the innovative capacity of \u2026rms. We also depart from all previous work in this area in terms of the questions we pose (in particular, the impact of industrial policy on selection and innovation) and the detailed estimation of the model on microdata on innovation and reallocation. Finally, our paper is related to the literature on the e\u00a4ects of industrial policies on innovation, R&D and growth. Goolsbee (1998), Romer (2001) and Wilson (2009) suggest that R&D subsidies may mainly increase the wages of inelastic inputs (such as R&D workers) rather than innovation, while Akcigit, Hanley and Serrano-Velarde (2012) argue that R&D subsidies may be ine\u00a4ective when other complementary investments, such as basic science, are not also subsidized. Our \u2026ndings, instead, show that these policies tend to be ine\u00a4ective when they fail-as they often do-to generate a positive selection across \u2026rm types. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 describes our data and quantitative framework. Section 4 presents our quanti\u2026ed parameter estimates, assesses the model's \u2026t with the data, and provides validation tests. Section 5 examines the impact of counterfactual policy experiments on the economy's innovation and growth. Section 6 reports the results from a number of robustness exercises.

The reason why not all products are active at each point in time will be made clear below. We assume that the economy is closed, and because R&D and production costs are in terms of labor, we have c j (t) = y j (t), where y j (t) is the amount of product j produced at time t. This also implies that aggregate output (GDP) is equal to aggregate consumption, or There are two types of labor in the economy, skilled and unskilled. Unskilled workers are used in the production of the active products (total labor demand denoted by L P ), while skilled workers perform R&D functions (total labor demand L RD ) and are also employed to cover the (\u2026xed) costs of operations, such as management, back-o\u00a2 ce functions and other non-production work (total labor demand L F ). In particular, we assume that the operation of each product, as well as the operation of each potential entrant, requires > 0 units of skilled labor.

Consider \u2026rm f 2 F that has the leading-edge technology in product j.

Upon successful entry into the economy, each \u2026rm draws its type 2 H ; L , corresponding to one of two possible types high (H) and low (L). We assume: where 2 (0; 1) and H > L > 0. Firm type impacts innovation as described below. We assume that while low-type is an absorbing state, high-type \u2026rms transition to low-type at the exogenous \u2021ow rate > 0. In addition to the transition from high to low type, each \u2026rm is also subject to an exogenous destructive shock at the rate '. Once a \u2026rm is hit by this shock, its value declines to zero and it exits the economy. Innovation by incumbents is modeled as follows. When \u2026rm f with type f hires h f workers for developing a new product, it adds one more product into its portfolio at the \u2021ow rate where 2 (0; 1) and n f is the number of product lines that \u2026rm f owns in total. Suppressing the f subscripts, this implies the following cost function for R&D where x X=n is the \"innovation intensity\" (innovation e\u00a4ort per product) and G (x; ) , de\u2026ned in (6), denotes the skilled labor requirement for a \u2026rm with innovative capacity to generate a per product innovation rate of x. We assume that research is undirected across product lines, meaning that \u2026rms do not know ex ante upon which particular product line they will innovate. This implies that their expected return to R&D is the expected value across all product lines j 2 [0; 1]. When a \u2026rm innovates over an active product line j, it increases the productivity of this product line j by q j . That is, where t+ refers to the instant after time t, and > 0 is the proportional incremental improvement in technology due to innovation. If the \u2026rm innovates over an inactive product line, it draws a new relative productivity from the (stationary) equilibrium distribution F (q). In addition to productivity growth driven by R&D, we also allow for non-R&D activity growth both to capture the fact that \u2026rms generate productivity growth for reasons unrelated to their research expenditures and to allow for the possibility that there are potential advantages for incumbents (e.g., due to their size) even if they do not perform R&D. We model this in the following tractable manner: each active \u2026rm receives a positive innovation shock at the rate % per (active) product line, and following this, it adds one of the inactive product lines into its portfolio (crucially, the likelihood of this innovation is independent of R&D e\u00a4ort).

Intuitively, the franchise value of a \u2026rm with relative productivityq can be solved out explicitly for the following reasons.

The option value includes an R&D component since the \u2026rm can undertake R&D building on the knowledge embedded in this active product line, and it also includes a non-R&D component since incumbents stochastically acquire new product lines without R&D investment. While operating this product line, the \u2026rm also incurs the \u2026xed cost of operationw s . Second, the relative productivity of this product line is declining proportionately at the growth rate of the economy, g, reducing pro\u2026ts at the rate (\" 1) g.

Fourth, if this product line is not replaced or the \u2026rm does not exit by the time its relative productivity reachesq k;min (for a \u2026rm of type k), it will be made obsolete, providing a boundary condition for the di\u00a4erential equation. Finally, for high-type \u2026rms there is an additional term incorporating the possibility of switching to low-type. The next proposition provides the solution to these di\u00a4erential equations.

Moreover, let Then, the franchise value of a product line value with relative productivityq for a low-type \u2026rm is and r + + ': Similarly, the franchise value of a product line with relative productivityq for a high-type \u2026rm is Proof.

Naturally, Then the labor market clearing condition for unskilled workers is Z Using 4, 12and 13; the previous labor market condition gives The labor market clearing for skilled workers, on the other hand, sets the total demand made up of demand from entrants (\u2026rst term) and demand from incumbents (second term) equal to the total supply, L S : To solve for the labor market clearing condition, we need to characterize the measures of active product lines k and the stationary equilibrium productivity distributions conditional on \u2026rm type. This is done in the next three equations and the next lemma. In each equation, the left-hand side expresses the in \u2021ows into product lines of type h, l or np (which are, respectively, controlled by high-type and low-type \u2026rms and inactive) and the right-side expresses the out \u2021ows: We next express the \u2021ow equations that determine the stationary equilibrium productivity distributions for the high-type and low-type product lines (which are di\u00a4erent but jointly determined). These distributions ensure that the \u2021ows into and out of any interval of productivity are equalized, so that in the stationary equilibrium, these distributions remain invariant.

See the Appendix. The intuition for the growth rate in (25) is as follows. The numerator has the contribution of entrants and di\u00a4erent types of incumbent \u2026rms to the productivity distribution, and the denominator adjusts for the improvements in productivity distribution due to obsolescence. Note that the growth rate expression is written for high-type \u2026rms. There exists an equivalent expression for low-type \u2026rms-the equivalence follows since in a balanced growth path, the productivity index of high-type \u2026rms Q h and low-type \u2026rms Q l must grow at the same rate. This is ensured by the adjustment of productivity ratio : Finally we summarize the equilibrium of this economy.  11; and [x] w s and w u are consistent with labor market clearing for unskilled and skilled workers as given by (17) and 19: Though the stationary equilibrium in this model is a relatively complex object, as we have seen the values for di\u00a4erent types of \u2026rms can be computed in closed form given the equilibrium wage. There are no closed-form solutions for the equilibrium wage rate and stationary distributions, but these can be computed numerically. We will also use this computation for the simulated method of moments estimation as outlined in Section 3.2."}, {"section_title": "Welfare", "text": "Recall that output and consumption are equal to the productivity index Q, so that at the initial date we have C 0 = Q 0 . The endogenous initial productivity index can be expressed as where q 0 denotes the initial average productivity level (speci\u2026ed as the initial condition), and h + l is the endogenous measure of active product lines. Welfare in the economy depends on this initial productivity index Q 0 and hence on q 0 and . In the rest of the paper, we normalize the average initial productivity level of all active products lines to 1, i.e., q 0 = 1, which thus gives us C 0 = Q 0 = 1 \" 1 . Then welfare can be obtained as e t e (1 #)gt e t i dt where the \u2026rst line simply repeats the de\u2026nition of discounted utility from (1), the second line uses the assumption that we are in stationary equilibrium (thus implying that we are not evaluating welfare implications of transitioning from one stationary equilibrium to another), and the third line solves the integral and uses C 0 = 1 \" 1 . In comparing welfare in two economies, say with subsidy policies s 1 and s 2 , and resulting growth rates g (s 1 ) and g (s 2 ) and initial consumption levels C 0 (s 1 ) and C 0 (s 2 ), we compute consumption equivalent changes in welfare by considering the fraction of initial consumption $ that will ensure the same discounted utility with the new growth rate as with the initial allocation. More formally, is given such that Note also that the decentralized allocation in this model does not maximize welfare or growth for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, monopoly markups, in and of themselves, are not a source of ine\u00a2 ciency because they are the same for all products. In models with endogenous technological change, there is typically insu\u00a2 cient R&D because \u2026rms do not appropriate the full value of new innovations (see, e.g., Acemoglu 2008, for a discussion). This channel is also potentially present in the current model and this is the \u2026rst reason for divergence between the equilibrium and the e\u00a2 cient allocation. In particular, it a\u00a4ects the allocation of skilled workers between R&D and operations because \u2026rms ignore two indirect bene\u2026ts of innovation: a higher productivity product increases the productivity of \u2026rms that innovate over it, and improvements over non-active product lines also bene\u2026t from innovation because these build on the existing knowledge stock. 6 The second reason for the ine\u00a2 ciency of equilibrium is that low productivity \u2026rms, especially low productivity low-type \u2026rms, remain active too long relative to what the welfare-maximizing social planner would choose. This is because the social planner would take into account that by freeing resources from the \u2026xed cost of operations for these \u2026rms, she can increase R&D, which is not fully internalized by the market because the skilled wage is depressed relative to its social value. These e\u00a4ects imply that policies that increase R&D and those that shift the composition of \u2026rms towards high-type \u2026rms will typically increase welfare and growth."}, {"section_title": "Estimation and Quantitative Analysis", "text": "To perform the policy experiments described in the Introduction, we \u2026rst estimate the parameters of our model using simulated method of moments (SMM). In this section, we describe our data set and estimation procedures, and the next two sections provide our results and policy counterfactual experiments."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We employ the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Census of Manufacturers (CMF), the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development (RAD), and the NBER Patent Database (PAT). The LBD and CMF are the backbone for our study. The LBD is a business registry that contains annual employment levels for every private-sector establishment in the US with payroll from 1976 onward. The CMF is conducted every \u2026ve years and provides detailed records on manufacturing plant and \u2026rm operations (e.g., output). Sourced from US tax records and Census Bureau surveys, these micro-records document the universe of establishments and \u2026rms, making them an unparalleled laboratory for studying our model of reallocation, entry/exit, and related \u2026rm dynamics. The Survey of Industrial Research and Development (RAD) is the US government's primary instrument for surveying the R&D expenditures and innovative e\u00a4orts of US \u2026rms. This is an annual or biannual survey conducted jointly by the Census Bureau and NSF. The survey includes with certainty all public and private \u2026rms, as well as foreign-owned \u2026rms, undertaking over one million dollars of R&D within the US. The survey frame also sub-samples \u2026rms conducting less than the certainty expenditure threshold. The certainty threshold was raised after 1996 to \u2026ve million dollars of R&D for future years (before subsequently being lowered after our sample frame). RAD surveys are linked to the LBD's and CMF's operating data through Census Bureau identi\u2026ers. These micro-records begin in 1972 and provide the most detailed statistics available on \u2026rm-level R&D e\u00a4orts. In 1997, 3,741 \u2026rms reported positive R&D expenditures that sum to $158 billion. Foster and Grim (2010) provide additional details. To complement the RAD, we also match patent data into the Census Bureau data. We employ the individual records of all patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark O\u00a2 ce (USPTO) from January 1975 to May 2009. Each patent record provides information about the invention and the inventors submitting the application.  provide extensive details about these data, and Griliches (1990) surveys the use of patents as economic indicators of technology advancement. We only employ patents (i) \u2026led by inventors living in the US at the time of the patent application; and (ii) assigned to industrial \u2026rms. In 1997, this group comprised about 77 thousand patents. We match these patent data to the LBD using \u2026rm name and location matching algorithms. 7 Our sample focuses on \"continuously innovative\"\u2026rms. We de\u2026ne a \u2026rm as \"innovative\"if it is conducting R&D or patenting within the US. Our operating data come from the years 1987, 1992, and 1997 when the CMF is conducted, and the data are speci\u2026c to those years. We develop our measures of innovation using \u2026ve-year windows surrounding these CMF years (e.g., 1985-1989 for the 1987 CMF). These local averages assist with RAD's biannual reporting when it occurs, and they ensure that we include two RAD surveys with the lower certainty threshold for the 1997 CMF group. The local averages also provide a more consistent measure of patent \u2026lings, which can be lumpy for \u2026rms with few patents. We describe the use of patents in further detail shortly. The \"continuous\"part of our sample selection is important and is structured as follows. We only include a \u2026rm in our sample if it conducts R&D or patents during the \u2026ve-year window surrounding each CMF year in which it is operating (i.e., has positive employment and sales in the CMF). Thus, a \u2026rm that is in operation in 1987 and 1992 is included in our sample if it is also conducting R&D or patents during 1985-1989 and 1990-1994. Similarly, a \u2026rm that is in operation in 1992 and 1997 is included in our sample if it is also conducting R&D or patents during 1990-1994 and 1995-1999. The \u2026rm does not need to conduct R&D or patent in every year of the \u2026ve-year window, but must do one of the two activities at least once. This selection process has several features to point out. First, the entrants in our sample (i.e., \u2026rms \u2026rst appearing in the 1992 or 1997 CMF) will be innovative throughout their lifecycle until the 1995-1999 period. Second, we do not consider switches into innovation among already existing \u2026rms. For example, we exclude \u2026rms that are present in the 1987 and 1992 CMF, patent or conduct R&D in the 1990-1994 period, but do not patent or conduct R&D during 1985-1989 (the probability that an existing, non-innovative \u2026rm commences R&D or patenting over the ensuing \u2026ve years, conditional on survival, is only about 1%). Third, and on a similar note, we do not include in our sample \u2026rms that cease to be innovative but continue in operation. Exits in our economy will be de\u2026ned over \u2026rms that patent or conduct R&D until they cease to operate. Finally, our sample does not condition on innovative activity before 1985-1989. Thus, the incumbents in our sample who were in operation prior to the 1987 CMF may have had some point in their past when they did not conduct R&D or patent. We only require that incumbents be innovative in every period when they are in operation during our sample. This choice allows us to construct a full distribution of innovative \u2026rms in the economy, which is important when considering the reallocation of resources for innovation. Of course, this choice is also partly due to necessity as we do not observe the full history of older incumbents. We discuss further below the aggregate implications for reallocation and growth measurement of this design. 8 We now describe the use of the patenting data. In accordance with our model, the moments below focus on R&D intensities (i.e., inputs into the innovation production function). We face the challenge that the RAD sub-samples \u2026rms conducting less than one million dollars in R&D. By contrast, the patent data are universally observed. To provide a more complete distribution, we use patents to impute R&D values for \u2026rms that are less than the certainty threshold and not sub-sampled. Thus, our moments combine the R&D and patent data into a single measure that accords with the model. As the R&D expenditures in these sub-sampled cases are very low (by de\u2026nition), this imputation choice versus treating unsurveyed R&D expenditures as zero expenditures conditional on patenting is not very important. Overall, our compiled dataset includes innovative manufacturing \u2026rms from the years 1987, 1992, and 1997 when the CMF is conducted. A record in our dataset is a \u2026rm-year observation that aggregates over the \u2026rm's manufacturing establishments. We have 17,055 observations from 9,835 \u2026rms. By abstracting from the extensive margin of entry or exit into innovation for continuing \u2026rms, all of our moments are consistently de\u2026ned and well measured in the data. At the same time, our selection procedures provide as complete a distribution of innovative \u2026rms as possible, which is important when considering reallocation. Our sample accounts for 98% of industrial R&D conducted during the period. When compared to a single cross-section of data, our sample is slightly more skewed towards larger \u2026rms. Speci\u2026cally, in the average year during our sample period, 22% of the \u2026rms conducting R&D or patenting have more than 500 employees. In our sample, 31.5% of observations have more than 500 employees. Our sample focuses on the reallocation of resources for innovation and thus excludes \u2026rms that do not report R&D or patents, which we de\u2026ne as \"non-innovative \u2026rms\". It is important to place our sample within the overall distribution of economic activity. When including non-innovative \u2026rms, our sample accounts for 2.1% of \u2026rms, 2.0% of \u2026rms with fewer than 5000 employees, 48% of employment, and 65% of sales within manufacturing. The greater share of employment and sales activity than \u2026rm counts is because the great majority of small \u2026rms are non-innovative. In a similar manner and due to the link of innovation to growth, our sample accounts for a substantial portion of reallocation occurring. Many small \u2026rms are not oriented for growth (e.g., Haltiwanger et al., 2013) and thus play a limited role in reallocation. As one statistic, our sample includes 58% and 65% of employment and sales reallocation, respectively, among continuing manufacturing \u2026rms between 1987 and 1997. As a second statistic, among \u2026rms that were either very small (fewer than 20 employees) or did not exist in 1987, we capture 94% of those that then grew to 10,000+ employees by 1997. We likewise capture 80% of small \u2026rms or new entrants that grow to one billion dollars in sales by 1997. Our central moments are \u2026rm entry/exit rates, the age and size distribution of \u2026rms, transitions across the \u2026rm size distribution over time, \u2026rm growth rates by age and size, \u2026rm innovation intensity by age and size, and entrants'share of employment in the economy. 9 Size distributions use the median employment in each CMF year to distinguish small and large \u2026rms. The age distribution is similarly separated into whether a \u2026rm is 0-9 years or 10+ years old. We assign initial ages through when the \u2026rm is \u2026rst observed in the LBD with positive employment. We de\u2026ne moments related to entry/exit, growth, and age-size distribution transitions as changes between CMF years expressed in per annum terms. 10 Shipments are de \u2021ated using the 2009 NBER Productivity Database. 11 9 Firm age is de\u2026ned from the birth year of the initial establishment of the \u2026rm. 1 0 We measure growth rates relative to base years over the \u2026ve-year period to allow a direct decomposition to per annum terms. These growth rates are winsorized at their 10% and 90% values. The patterns are similar when expressing growth relative to the average of base and end years. We then calculate geometric averages over these \u2026rm-level growth rates. We winsorize R&D intensities at their 99.8% value to be conservative (approximately a 10:1 R&D to sales ratio). 1 1 Prices in industries related to computers and semiconductors behave di\u00a4erently from those in other parts of manufacturing. We \u2026nd very similar moments when excluding these industries from our moment calculations."}, {"section_title": "Computational Algorithm", "text": "The model can be solved computationally as a \u2026xed point of the following vector of eight aggregate equilibrium variables nw Our characterization above shows that equilibrium innovation decisions can be determined given these aggregate variables.

First, we examine the correlation between exit probabilities and R&D intensity. These correlations are 0:04 and 0:05 in the model and data, respectively. The exit probabilities for \u2026rms with low and high R&D intensities are 0:32 and 0:34 in the data; these compare to 0:36 and 0:37 in the model. The correlation across \u2026rms between R&D growth and employment growth is 0:19 in the data, but more than twice as high, 0:48, in the model.

This last discrepancy not withstanding, the model performs fairly well with respect to these non-targeted correlations, which is reassuring. The R&D Survey collects a more detailed questionnaire from selected major R&D producers that we can use to compare the contribution of R&D activities to growth in the model to data. 16 First, the detailed questionnaire contains industry-level R&D breakouts. This disaggregation allows us to validate the share of growth coming from non-R&D activities versus R&D activities. During our sample period, we observe 160 \u2026rms that continually conduct R&D and have industry-level breakouts of their R&D expenditures. For these \u2026rms, the unweighted mean share of employment growth occurring within industries where \u2026rms are conducting R&D is 73%.

Griliches (1990) surveyed a prior literature and concluded that the elasticity of patents with respect to R&D, 1 in our model, is between 0:3 and 0:6 which implies 2 [0:4; 0:7]. Work since that time has continued to \u2026nd similar results. Using count data models, Blundell, Gri\u00a2 th, and Windmeijer (2002) report an elasticity of 0:5. Hall and Zeidonis (2001) \u2026nd similar results in a study of the semiconductor industry.

A second approach is to compare our estimate of to the \u2026ndings of the studies that considered the response of \u2026rms to changes in the cost of R&D driven by R&D tax credits. A growing literature examines the impact of R&D tax credits on the R&D expenditure of \u2026rms. One route uses the variation in the US tax code over time interacted with \u2026rms'tax paying and R&D status to generate time and \u2026rm variation in the tax-component of the user cost of R&D. These studies typically \u2026nd a tax elasticity of R&D around unity (e.g., Hall, 1992). A second approach followed by Bloom et al. (2002) exploits time-variation in cross-country R&D tax credits, while a third approach followed by Wilson (2009) exploits time-variation in cross-state R&D tax credits in the United States. Estimates in this literature also cluster around unity, as emphasized in the survey paper by Hall and Van Reenen (2000) who state in their conclusion that \"a tax price elasticity of around unity is a good ball-park \u2026gure\". In our model, the R&D elasticity with respect to scientist wage w s is: 18 % R&D % w s = 1 , so the unit elasticity would correspond to = 0:5. Our estimate, = 0:64, is again in the ballpark, about 20% higher. In Section 6, we show that re-estimating our model imposing = 0:5 leads to very similar results, particularly in our policy experiments."}, {"section_title": "Policy Experiments and E\u00a2 ciency", "text": "Our estimated model has an equilibrium growth rate of 2:24%. This is driven by the innovation e\u00a4orts of the high-type incumbents, low-type incumbents and entrants. Note: All numbers except wage ratio and welfare are in percentage terms, so for example, x h = 9.58 is equivalent to x h = 0.0958. Table 4 above summarizes some of the key endogenous equilibrium objects. In the baseline, hightype incumbents are almost three times as likely to innovate (per product) as low-type \u2026rms (x h = 0:096 vs. x l = 0:028). The total entry rate is 6.23% ( x entry m = 0:085 0:736). In equilibrium, 71:2% of the product lines belong to low-type \u2026rms and 24:5% to high-type \u2026rms ( h = 0:712 vs. l = 0:245).

In addition, the annual obsolescence rate for low-type \u2026rms, shown as drop l in the table, is 0:06%, while the obsolescence rate for high-type \u2026rms is very close to zero (for this reason and to save space, we do not report it in this and the subsequent tables). 1 8 To see this, substitute the equilibrium innovation choice (15) into R&D cost function (6) to obtain R&D = Figure 3 shows the productivity distribution across product lines among high-and low-type \u2026rms. An important point to note is that the cuto\u00a4 productivity for high-type \u2026rms is lower since the option value of operating in a product line is higher for them. "}, {"section_title": "Incumbent R&D Subsidy", "text": "Our \u2026rst policy counterfactual considers a popular type of industrial policy, subsidizing R&D e\u00a4orts of incumbents. In Table 5, we show the results when using 1% of GDP and then 5% of GDP for such subsidies. 19  Panel A considers a subsidy equivalent to 1% of GDP, which amounts to a 15% subsidy on R&D spending of incumbents. As should have been expected, the R&D subsidy to incumbents increases their R&D. In particular, low-type \u2026rms increase their innovation rate from 2:80% to 3:05%, and high-type \u2026rms from 9:58% to 10:56%-both of these are about 10% higher than the baseline. However, the overall impact on innovation and growth is less-much less-than this direct e\u00a4ect. This is for two reasons. First, at a given skilled wage, greater incumbent R&D would increase creative destruction and via this channel discourage entry. Second, and more important, the greater demand for skilled workers from incumbent R&D increases the skilled wage. In equilibrium, we see that there is a non-trivial (approximately 2%) increase in the skill wage, from 13.64 to 13.88, and this reduces R&D by entrants and incumbents su\u00a2 ciently that overall creative destruction does not increase. But the measure of entrants decreases from 0:74 to 0:68 and the total entry rate declines from 8:46 0:74 6:22 to 8:46 0:68 5:76. The overall result is a decline in growth 2:24% to 2:23%, and aggregate welfare also decreases by 0:14% (in consumption equivalent terms). Panel B shows similar results with a subsidy equivalent to 5% of GDP. The subsidy now rises to 39% on R&D spending of incumbents, and its impact on growth and welfare are more negative. Growth declines from 2:24% to 2:16%, and welfare declines by 1:5%. In summary, in contrast to expectations in the literature and in policy circles which, based on the view that there is underinvestment in R&D, consider R&D subsidies as growth and welfare enhancing, we \u2026nd that R&D subsidies to incumbents reduce growth and welfare because they reallocate resources from entrants to incumbents."}, {"section_title": "Subsidy to Operating Costs", "text": "We next consider an industrial policy subsidizing the continued operation of incumbents by subsidizing their \u2026xed costs of operations w s , which approximates policies that support large \u2026rms that are in economic trouble. 20 We suppose that the costs of operation by incumbents are subsidized with an amount equivalent to 1% of GDP (Panel A) and 5% of GDP (Panel B). The main impact of this change in policy is to lower obsolescence, which was, however, already low. The implications of this subsidy are presented in Table 6. Focusing on Panel A, we see that this policy, which corresponds to a 6% subsidy to operating costs, discourages obsolescence and increases the share of active product lines (from 95:69% to 95:81%) and raises the demand for skilled workers coming from the \u2026xed costs of operation. The general equilibrium implications of this is a reduction in R&D for all \u2026rms resulting from the higher skilled wage, which is about 2% higher (13.86 compared to 13.64). However, this subsidy also has a negative selection e\u00a4ect because low-type \u2026rms are overrepresented among those at the margin of obsolescence. As a result, the share of low-type \u2026rms in the economy increases from 71:16% to 71:30% (while the share of high-type \u2026rms declines slightly). As part of this, resources are reallocated from more-e\u00a2 cient to less-e\u00a2 cient product lines (since this subsidy directly helps only those product lines near the lower end of the productivity distribution). In consequence, the long-run growth rate declines from 2:24% to 2:22%, and aggregate welfare declines by 0:18%. The results in Panel B are similar, and the decline in growth is identical to what we saw in Table 5. Interestingly, however, the welfare decline is about half of that in Panel B of Table 5. The main reason for this is that with 5% of GDP spent on subsidizing operating costs, there is a more sizable expansion of the set of active products (from 95:69% to 96:21%), and having more products active bene\u2026ts consumers (recall footnote 6). Nevertheless, this bene\u2026t is more than outweighed by the selection e\u00a4ect, which is the reason why welfare declines. In sum, a subsidy to the operating costs of incumbents reduces growth and welfare because it causes a negative selection e\u00a4ect, increasing the share of product lines controlled by low-type \u2026rms, as low-type \u2026rms tend to bene\u2026t more from this subsidy which is directed to low-productivity product lines."}, {"section_title": "Entry Subsidy", "text": "Finally, for comparison, we also consider the implications of an entry subsidy equivalent to \u2026rst 1% and then 5% of GDP. The results are reported in Table 7. The direct e\u00a4ect of the entry subsidy is to increase entry. In Panel A, the measure of entrants increases from 73:6% to 75:3%, and there is a slight increase in their R&D intensity. The demand for skilled labor that additional entry induces raises the skilled wage by 3% (from 13:64 to 14:06). Table 7. Entry Subsidy Panel A. 1% of GDP (s e = 5%) x entry x As was the case with incumbent R&D subsidies, the overall impact of the entry subsidy on growth is less than that induced by the change in the entry rate because, this time, the implied increase in the creative destruction rate and the higher skilled wages discourage innovation by incumbents. In consequence, Table 7 shows that low-type \u2026rms reduce their innovation rate from 2:80% to 2:73%, and high-type \u2026rms reduce theirs from 9:58% to 9:30%. With these two o\u00a4setting e\u00a4ects, the aggregate creative destruction rate remains essentially unchanged. Another interesting general equilibrium e\u00a4ect works through obsolescence. The higher skilled wage increases the threshold for exit, especially for low types (which increases from 0:139 to 0:159). This raises the obsolescence rate for low-type \u2026rms, and generates a bene\u2026cial selection e\u00a4ects, also contributing to growth. Therefore, the overall e\u00a4ect of the entry subsidy in Panel A is to increase the long-run growth rate of the economy from 2:24% to 2:26%, and aggregate welfare by 0:15%. In Panel B, the overall pattern is similar, but the e\u00a4ects are somewhat larger. Growth now increases from 2:24% to 2:32%, and welfare increases by 0:63%. In summary, an entry subsidy has a positive e\u00a4ect on growth and welfare, but even with a subsidy amounting to 5% of GDP, this impact is small."}, {"section_title": "Social Planner", "text": "The results of the previous subsection might suggest that the equilibrium is close to optimal, and this is the reason why subsidies to incumbent R&D do not increase growth or welfare, and subsidies to entrants have a small e\u00a4ect. In this subsection, we will see that this is very far from the truth. We characterize the allocation that a welfare-maximizing social planner would choose. Since we are not interested in monopoly distortions per se, we restrict the social planner to the same production and pricing decisions as the equilibrium, and only allow her to control the entry, exit and R&D margins of di\u00a4erent \u2026rms. It is straightforward to see that the social planner will choose the same per product R&D rate for all high-and low-type \u2026rms. Then, we can represent the problem of the planner as choosing fq h;min ;q l;min ; m; x h ; x l ; x entry g to maximize representative household welfare (26) subject to the skilled labor market clearing condition (19). Table 8 summarizes the allocation implied by social planner's choices.  11 11.13 3.80 106.46 Several results are noteworthy. First, the social planner can improve growth and welfare greatly. Growth increases from 2.24% to 3.8%-a 70% increase in the growth rate. Welfare increases by 6.46%. This result clearly establishes that the equilibrium was far from optimal. It was just that the three policy variations we considered were not the right ones for moving the economy towards a better allocation of resources. Second, we can also see from Table 8 how the optimal allocation should look like. To start with, the obsolescence channel is now much stronger. Instead of 0:06% of low-type \u2026rms exiting this channel, we now have 1.11% doing so (q l;min increases from 13:9 to 118:6, and the share of obsolescences in total exits increases from 1% to 15%). Also important is that the social planner increases R&D by high-type incumbents relative to the baseline (from x h = 0:096 to 0:104), while at the same time reducing R&D by low-types (from x l = 0:028 to 0:026). The result of all these changes is a very signi\u2026cant selection relative to the equilibrium: the ratio of high-to low-type \u2026rms increases from 0.34 to 0.51). This selection e\u00a4ect is at the root of the very large increase in growth and welfare. To be able to achieve this positive selection, the social planner keeps active a smaller fraction of product lines (though this is costly for welfare, the cost is more than outweighed by the bene\u2026cial selection). The social planner also increases the entry rate relative to equilibrium (m increases from 0.73 to 0.81). We also computed the gains from the social planner's allocation relative to the equilibrium by shutting o\u00a4 the selection margin. The results reported in Table B1 in Appendix B show that, even though the social planner can again improve over the equilibrium, the extent of this improvement is more limited (less than half of that in Table 8), highlighting the critical role that the selection e\u00a4ect plays in our results."}, {"section_title": "Optimal Policy", "text": "The social planner's allocation discussed in the previous subsection relied on choosing the exit threshold and R&D rates of di\u00a4erent types of \u2026rms. In practice, this type of detailed intervention may not be possible (for instance, \u2026rm type might be private information). A more reasonable set of policies might involve using: subsidies and/or taxes on (i) incumbent R&D; (ii) costs of operation; (iii) entry. We analyze the optimal combination of these three policies in Panel A of Table 9. The results are interesting. With these three instruments, each of which appeared fairly ine\u00a4ective by itself, we can come quite close to the social planner's allocation. In particular, welfare can be increased by 4:56% and growth goes up to 3:12%. This is achieved again by leveraging the selection e\u00a4ect, and involves a very large tax on the continued operation of all incumbents (a 246% tax). 21 In addition, there is a modest subsidy to incumbent R&D and to entry (17% and 6%, respectively). The resulting allocation comes close to, but does not reach the social planner's allocation in the previous subsection. For example, the obsolescence rate is 0:77% instead of 1:11%, and the ratio of high-to low-types is now 41% (instead of 51% under the social planner's allocation). Furthermore, with these instruments, it is not possible to simultaneously increase R&D by high-type \u2026rms and reduce it by the low-types, and for this reason, we see that the R&D rate by both types is now higher than in the baseline. Though subsidizing incumbent R&D and taxing their operating costs (or subsidizing their exit) is in principle straightforward, subsidizing entry may be more di\u00a2 cult, because this corresponds, in our model, to the entry of innovative \u2026rms, and R&D subsidies to non-existing \u2026rms may not be feasible. Therefore, arguably, relying just on incumbent policies (subsidies to incumbent R&D and subsidies or taxes on operations) may be more reasonable. Panel B shows that just focusing on these two policies essentially generates the same bene\u2026ts. When thus restricted, it would be optimal to increase the tax on operations further, to 264%, and reduce incumbent subsidies to R&D to 12% (so as not to discourage entry too much). These policies achieve almost the same growth increases and essentially the same welfare increase. In summary, optimal policies can aggressively tax the operations of incumbents to encourage low-type \u2026rms to exit, thus exploiting the selection e\u00a4ect to increase the ratio of high-type \u2026rms to low-type \u2026rms. This can raise the growth rate of the economy to above 3:1% and increase welfare by more than 4:5%. Entry subsidies or subsidies to incumbent R&D do not achieve this objective, and this is the reason why we did not see major-or any-bene\u2026ts from these policies. But they can be combined with very high taxes on the continued operation of incumbents to achieve major growth and welfare gains."}, {"section_title": "Robustness", "text": "In this section, we report the results of a few robustness exercises, which illustrate that the main results reported so far-in particular, the ability of the model to match the broad patterns in the micro data and the contrast between di\u00a4erent types of industrial policies-are fairly robust.

In this subsection, we show that our main results are robust to imposing the central estimate of this more recent literature, = 0:5. For this purpose, we reestimated all of the parameters of our model, except that we imposed = 0:5. The remaining parameter estimates and the match between model-generated and data moments are a\u00a4ected relatively little, and as a result, the implications of di\u00a4erent industrial policies also remain broadly similar to our baseline. Analogous results to those in Tables 4 9 are contained in Tables B2 and B3 Industrial policies (subsidies to incumbents) again reduce welfare, and subsidies to entrants again have a very small positive e\u00a4ect on growth and welfare.

It is therefore informative to investigate whether the speci\u2026c value for this parameter plays an important role in our results. With this purpose, we reestimated the model's remaining parameters imposing % = 0 (an extreme value but in line with what is implicitly imposed in other models of this sort). Tables B4 and B5 show that the implications of this restriction on our policy analysis are relatively minor. Subsidies to incumbents again reduce welfare and subsidies to entrants again have a very small positive e\u00a4ect. The social planner can now increase welfare by even a more striking amount (11%), because R&D activities and selection become even more important. The combination of incumbent R&D subsidies and taxes on continued operations can now achieve quite a bit less than the social planner's allocation, but still signi\u2026cantly more than the equilibrium: growth increases to 3:3% and welfare can be increased by 5:9%."}, {"section_title": "Fixed Entrant Supply", "text": "Our results so far show that the entry margin is very elastic-policies leave the R&D rate of entrants, x entry , largely unchanged and impact mainly m. One might be worried about whether this exaggerates how elastic the entry margin is. To see if this very elastic entry margin is partially responsible for our results, we reestimated all of the model parameters by imposing m = 1, so that all variations in entry come from the intensive margin, x entry (which is less elastic because of the complex R&D technology in (5)). With this modi\u2026cation, the \u2026t of the model remains comparable to our baseline, and Tables B6 and B7 show that the results of the policy analysis are also broadly comparable. One di\u00a4erence is that in this case, subsidies to incumbent R&D have a small positive e\u00a4ect on welfare, rather than the negative e\u00a4ect we have seen in all the other cases so far. This re \u2021ects the fact that, with a less elastic entry margin, the cost of incumbent R&D in terms of reduced entry is less pronounced. The remaining results are very similar to those reported above. Subsidies to incumbent operations reduce welfare, and the social planner would be able to improve growth and welfare by leveraging the selection e\u00a4ect. In particular, the social planner can increase welfare by 2:6%, and just using subsidies to incumbent R&D and taxes on operations can increase welfare by 1:2%."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we build a micro-founded model of \u2026rm innovation and growth. The model enables us an examination of the forces jointly driving innovation, productivity growth and reallocation. We estimate the parameters of the model using simulated method of moments on detailed US Census Bureau micro data on employment, output, R&D and patenting. Our model \u2026ts the key moments from microdata reasonably well, and also performs well on non-targeted moments and is in line with the range of micro estimates in the literature. We use the model to investigate the implications of several types of industrial policies on longrun growth and welfare. We \u2026nd that industrial policies (subsidies to incumbent R&D or to their operating costs) reduce growth and welfare, while entry subsidies have a positive but very small e\u00a4ect. These small e\u00a4ects are not because the equilibrium of our model is approximately optimal. On the contrary, a social planner limited to a\u00a4ecting only R&D, entry and exit decisions can increase growth from 2:24% to 3:8%, and increase welfare by 6:46%. The social planner achieves this by strongly leveraging the selection e\u00a4ect. She forces low-type incumbents to exit at a very high rate, reduces their R&D, and increases the R&D of high-type incumbents. Interestingly, relying on just subsidies to incumbent R&D and taxes on the continued operation of incumbents comes close to achieving this welfare gain (by introducing a very high tax on the continued operation of incumbents). Our general equilibrium model which incorporates both reallocation and selection e\u00a4ects highlights the potential pitfalls of industrial policies supporting incumbents, particularly large incumbents. It also cautions against policies based on the prior that, because there is underinvestment in R&D all R&D-type activities should be subsidized. Entry does indeed play an important role in our estimated model, but it turns out to be much better to support entry by freeing resources from ine\u00a2 cient, low-type incumbents rather than subsidizing entry directly. Several further topics of inquiry are left for future research. First, it would be interesting to extend our analysis to incorporate an endogenous selection between non-innovation and innovation, and also to incorporate reallocation of other resources (unskilled labor and capital). Second, our analysis has been con\u2026ned to steady-state (balanced growth path) comparisons. It is likely that even our limited welfare gains from various types of industrial policy will be even more muted when transitional dynamics are taken into account (and it remains an open question whether the social planner can still signi\u2026cantly improve over the equilibrium allocation). Third, we have abstracted from costs of adjustment, which are important both for \u2026rms and workers, and may reduce the gains from reallocation. Fourth and related is a possible extension of this framework to model the joint dynamics of innovation, reallocation and unemployment, which can enrich the analysis of the e\u00a4ects of various policies, and also enable us to incorporate some of the potential unemployment bene\u2026ts of supporting incumbent producers. Fifth, we have also abstracted from political constraints. It would be important to consider the political economy of di\u00a4erent types of industrial policies, which have often been politically di\u00a2 cult to manage and prone to capture. Sixth, our model can also be used to study mergers between high-and low-type \u2026rms which might be able to make more e\u00a2 cient use of the existing knowledge stock of low-type \u2026rms in certain circumstances. Finally, supplementing our approach with more direct estimation of the costs and bene\u2026ts of di\u00a4erent types of policies targeted at R&D by incumbents is a major area for future research. This expression reduces to where we also use the fact that a \u2026rm can choose not to operate an individual product line.
