[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Cognitive aging (CA), also termed age-associated cognitive decline, describes the decrease in cognitive performance observed in otherwise healthy, cognitively intact individuals free of known neurodegenerative disorders. Three cardinal cognitive factors that decline are processing speed, memory, and executive function. In contrast, acquired skills, language, and knowledge about facts remain preserved relatively (Salthouse, 2010) .\nMuch previous work in CA may have included individuals that are cognitively intact but not normal. The relationship between CA and neurodegenerative disease, if any, has thus remained unclear. Excluding subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) or very early AD was impossible until recently-and remains difficult even today. AD is the most common dementing illness affecting one out of every three elders 85 years and older. Since AD begins 10-20 years before clinical presentation, a substantial fraction of seniors when enrolled in CA studies may have an evolving AD neurodegenerative process.\nExclusion of such individuals from CA research required traditionally prolonged follow-up with neuropsychological assessment. More recently, biochemical studies (e.g., amyloid, tau, phosphotau) of cerebrospinal fluid and as well as neuroimaging can identify individuals with preclinical (also known as asymptomatic) AD or early AD. Studies using positron emission tomography of glucose metabolism ( 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose; FDG PET), amyloid, and tau have become useful diagnostic adjuncts. Nevertheless, the specific biomarkers defining preclinical AD require further refinement. One approach considers the presence of fibrillar amyloid (A), tau 5 neurofibrillary tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N) (Sperling et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2018) .\nHowever, the degree (i.e., threshold for positivity); kind (e.g., diffuse vs. dense-cored plaques); localization (i.e., region of interest); concordance with CSF markers; and potential new biomarkers are perforce an evolving definition of preclinical AD and its continuum.\nThe earliest neuroimaging biomarkers for AD are hypometabolism, atrophy, and amyloid deposition in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus as well as in other parietal cortices (Minoshima et al., 1994; Rowe et al., 2007; Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2016) . With PET imaging, tau deposition often follows in the inferior and medial temporal lobes leading to hypometabolism and cortical atrophy in those areas as well (Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016; Sintini et al., 2019) . Of note, these neuroimaging findings can appear to diverge from those seen in some neuropathological studies (Braak and Tredici, 2015) .\nIn contrast, human CA is not associated with PCC hypometabolism but affects instead predominantly the ACC and immediately adjacent regions (Pardo et al., 2007; Vaidya et al., 2007) . The ACC is a central structure in human attention involved with many executive functions such as selective attention, resolution of conflict, multitasking, and adaptation to changing contexts (e.g., Pardo et al., 1991; for review, see Heilbronner and Hayden, 2016) . The aging-related decline in ACC glucose metabolism correlates with the decline in executive function based on scores from a cognitive acuity screen as well as a commonly used test of executive function such as verbal category semantic fluency (Pardo et al., 2007) . Separating effects of ACC hypometabolism on memory, as contrasted with effects on executive function, bears caution given the requirements for attention on memory (e.g., retrieval) and vice-a-versa (Norman, 1968; Downing, 2000; Chun and Turk-Browne, 2007) .\nHypometabolism and cortical thinning can occur where amyloid deposits, but not necessarily (e.g., Altmann et al., 2015) . In contrast, the later localization of tau deposits more closely correlates with regions showing hypometabolism or atrophy as well as clinical symptoms (e.g., Ossenkoppele et al., 2016) . In AD, amyloid frequently involves also the ACC but not typically without incipient AD (Scholl et al., 2016) .\nThe current study aims to examine the relationships between age; ACC metabolism; and cognitive functions such as memory and executive function. The study was motivated by the need to define pathophysiological mechanisms of aging-related phenomena within the ACC-a prerequisite to develop prevention strategies and treatments for the cognitive decline that occurs in aging uncontaminated by preclinical AD or early AD. Wechsler, 1987) . The rationale for these measures will be forthcoming in the discussion."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Additionally, any cognitively-normal subjects who were identified as amyloid positive by ADNI were excluded to examine the potential role of amyloid deposition in the observed results.\nThis provided a separate group of subjects (N = 155). Cortical-to-whole-cerebellum standardized uptake value ratios (SUVrs) were calculated for ROIs (frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus). A threshold of 1.1 defined amyloid positivity using as reference the value for whole cerebellum (Clark et al., 2011; Landau & Jagust, 2014; Joshi et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Imaging", "text": "FDG PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI@LONI) were downloaded. These were stereotactically normalized to standard Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) via the Neurostat program (S. Minoshima, University of Utah). The FDG data were normalized through proportional scaling to whole brain glucose uptake (1000 counts). An ROI analysis (11 mm diameter sphere centered on x = +3 mm (right), y = +17 mm, z = +36 mm; 8 i.e., the maximum from Pardo et al., 2007) for each scan was conducted. The PET imaging protocols are documented at the ADNI website (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/pet/)."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Design and Statistical Analyses", "text": "Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( Correlational analyses were performed between the following variables: age, ACC metabolism, animal fluency scores, and logical memory. To test whether ACC metabolism was significantly affecting the relationship between age and fluency scores, a mediation model was constructed with ACC metabolism as the mediator if three conditions were met: 1) age was correlated with ACC metabolism, 2) age was correlated with fluency scores, and 3) ACC metabolism was correlated with fluency scores. In the mediation analysis, age was regressed onto fluency scores (direct effect); then ACC metabolism as a predictor was added along with age in a second regression onto fluency scores (indirect effect). The total effect is the sum of the direct effect and indirect effect. The Sobel (1982) test assessed the significance of the difference between the direct effect and the total effect. A significant difference would indicate ACC metabolism was a mediator in the relationship between age and fluency scores. To increase rigor in testing for the significance of the mediating effects of ACC metabolism, a bootstrap (Preacher and Hayes, 2008 ) with 5,000 simulations was performed to estimate 95% confidence intervals for mediation\neffects. All pathways were tested simultaneously. Analyses and computations were performed using R, version 3.5.1 (http://www.R-project.org/). The mediating or regression effect was considered significant (i.e., different from 0) at the corresponding confidence level if the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval had the same sign. between Total Effect and ADE, Table 2 ). Additionally, there was a significant correlation between fluency and memory scores (Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mediation", "text": "-Insert Figure 1 and Table 1 "}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "-Insert Figure 2 and Table 2 about here-"}, {"section_title": "Associations with memory in cognitively intact seniors", "text": "No significant correlation was observed between logical memory scores and age (r = 0.08, p = 0.19; Fig. 3A ) or ACC metabolism (r = -0.01, p = 0.92; Fig. 3B ). Given the lack of a significant correlation, no mediation analysis was warranted. With regards to the control region, i.e., the right primary motor cortex (RMC), no significant correlation was observed between RMC metabolism and either age (r = -0.04, p = 0.51) or logical memory (r = -0.004, p = 0.96)."}, {"section_title": "-Insert Figure 3 about here-", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effects of amyloid positivity", "text": "As discussed previously, contamination of cognitively normal subjects by individuals with preclinical or very early AD can confound the study of CA. In the current state of knowledge, it is admittedly not possible to completely rule out preclinical AD. Nevertheless, the previous analyses were repeated using only amyloid negative, cognitively normal subjects from ADNI that included 155 subjects. This group had at least a lower likelihood of preclinical AD. ADNI's designation of amyloid positivity was SUVR 1.1 derived from critical ROIs.\nACC metabolism became a complete mediator of the relationship between age and fluency as the direct effect (c\u02b9) was no longer significant (as in Fig. 1 (Table 2 , \u03b2), the reanalysis using only amyloid negative subjects reached significance confirming ACC metabolism mediated the relationship between age and fluency (as in Table 3 : \u03b2 = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.2193, -0.02, p = 0.02). The reanalysis demonstrated once again no relationship between age and memory or between ACC metabolism and memory (r = 0.10, p = 0.12; r = 0.09, p = 0.16 respectively). In examination of the relationship between the metabolism in a control region (i.e., right motor cortex), age, fluency, and memory (i.e., analogous to Fig. 2 ), the only significant relationships were between age and fluency (as above) and between memory and fluency (r = 0.19, p \u2264 0.01). As expected, there was no significant correlation with the metabolism in the motor cortex."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "These results indicate ACC metabolism mediates the relationship between aging and executive function implicating some unknown pathophysiology in aging-related cognitive decline. In contrast, mnemonic dysfunction, a cardinal feature of AD, could not be implicated in the relationship between CA and ACC metabolism. The metabolic effects of age were specific to ACC as no relationship surfaced when examining the RMC indicating some regional specificity to the effects of age on metabolism."}, {"section_title": "ACC metabolism: Mediator between age and fluency in healthy older adults", "text": "Previous results that spanned a broad range of ages (18-90 years) with a more limited sample size of 46 subjects reported a decline in ACC metabolism that correlated positively with declining executive function as measured by the same animal fluency task (Pardo et al., 2007) .\nThe decline in ACC flow or metabolism with age had been reported previously by several groups; however, the relationship of ACC metabolism to executive function in CA had not been noted previously. The subset of the ADNI dataset used here has a much larger sample size (N = 231) but narrower age range (56-92 years) and does not include young adulthood. The ADNI data enabled enough power to show that ACC metabolism was a mediator of the relationship between age and fluency in more elderly, cognitively normal adults. These results support the idea that ACC dysfunction plays a crucial role in age-associated cognitive decline (AACD). As such, ACC hypometabolism could serve as a potential biomarker for CA."}, {"section_title": "ACC metabolism: Not a mediato between age and memory in healthy older adults.", "text": "Episodic memory is often tested using lists of words or recall of items from a story presented at an earlier time. Recall of story items takes advantage of semantic processes, while recall of word lists requires self-generation of mnemonic strategies. Memory of word lists taxes the executive system more than does story recall. For example, patients with frontal lesions and those with executive dysfunction do worse on recall of word lists than on recall of items from paragraphs presented previously (Kopelman and Stanhope, 1998; Brooks, Weaver, and Scialfa, 2006) . In contrast, memory for semantically-related information depends more on medial temporal processes (Tremont et al., 2000; Lezak, Howieson, and Loring, 2004 "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ROI definition and multiple comparisons", "text": "This research was motivated specifically by our prior results of ACC metabolism in CA (Pardo et al., 2007) . As such, an exhaustive search for other areas that might show a high correlation with age was not done. In part, problems in ROI definition and concerns about multiple comparisons tempered such an approach."}, {"section_title": "Preclinical AD", "text": "Another issue is concern about possible inclusion of preclinical AD in the cognitively intact elderly sample. The absence of memory changes with age in the cognitively intact seniors suggests minimal contamination with subjects having preclinical AD or early AD. However, complete exclusion of preclinical AD remains problematic even today."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "The exclusion of amyloid positive subjects made the results more robust. ACC metabolism moved from a partial to a total mediator of the relationship between age and fluency.\nA few individuals converted to AD shortly after the baseline evaluation identified them as normal-for example, elderly APOE4 homozygotes (Pardo and Lee, 2018) . Curiously, these elderly, cognitively intact APOE4 homozygotes did not show significant PCC hypometabolism or PCC amyloid deposition. Yet, the PCC shows the earliest signs of hypometabolism in AD (Minoshima et al., 1994) . It remains debated whether a patient with dementia and without any amyloid deposition (diffuse or fibrillar) can be diagnosed with AD. For example, Hyman et al.\n(2013) in an NIA/Alzheimer's Association consensus conference note \"\u2026a major point of discussion among committee members was the relative value of evaluating both Ab/amyloid plaque phase and neuritic plaque score \u2026in the assessment of AD neuropathologic change.\nBecause the relative independent value of these two parameters is not currently known, we suggest collecting data on both and evaluating their independent value in future analyses.\nCross-sectional neuropathological studies suggest that a significant number of demented individuals with extensive tau pathology have minimal fibrillar plaques (Braak & Tredici, 2015; Monsell et al., 2015) . Amyloid PET cannot detect diffuse plaques; so, this remains a possibility for those with negative amyloid scans. Even amnestic, amyloid-negative patients (mostly without APOE4) initially diagnosed as AD, whose clinical phenotype remained AD over a follow-up interval of four years, showed PCC hypometabolism and atrophy (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2016) . Of note, a negative amyloid scan in the IDEAS study prompted changing management in 2/3 of patients within 90 days of the scan. Ultimately, the precise criteria for exclusion of preclinical AD will need refinement: CSF criteria, pretangles, neurofibrillary tangles, diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, types and extent of neurodegeneration, and probably new forthcoming biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Atrophy and partial volume correction", "text": "The PET data were not corrected for partial volume effects (PVC). ACC hypometabolism could reflect focal atrophy without a change in grey matter metabolism. However, PVC can introduce noise especially when volume changes are small. Vaidya et al. (2007) reported that even with PVC, the decline in ACC blood flow (correlated with metabolism) with age could not be totally accounted for by atrophy. The correlations between flow and age were much larger than correlations between age and grey matter volume, and some regions showed strong correlation with age without a change in grey matter volume.\nWhether the ACC shows any atrophy with age remains controversial. Two large cross-sectional studies using scans at high resolution found thickening of the ACC grey matter with aging (Salat et al., 2004; Fjell et al., 2009 ). However, a longitudinal study also with a large sample size and high-resolution structural scans did not find ACC thickening with age over a three-year period, but neither did it show gross atrophy (Fjell et al., 2014) . Another longitudinal study of cognitively intact elders did not show significant ACC volume changes over 4 years but did find significant decreases in the ACC glucose uptake even with correction for partial volume effects (Catellanos et al., 2019) .\nThere is also evidence ACC thickness may be a trait or state marker. "}, {"section_title": "Correlation in cross-sectional studies", "text": "Correlational and cross-sectional studies can confound interpretation. Different pathophysiologies may participate in ACC dysfunction during different time intervals in the aging brain. For example, most loss in AG occurs before age 55 years (Goyal et al., 2017) . In contrast, decreased glucose uptake may occur later in life when peripheral insulin resistance arises (Castellano et al., 2019) ."}, {"section_title": "Association vs. causality", "text": "Association does not prove causality. Regional ACC effects could come from extrinsic regions;\ni.e., ACC dysfunction is an effect rather than a cause. However, no other brain region showed greater decline in metabolism with age. Nevertheless, the results highlight the ACC as a critical region to look for pathophysiology which will require an animal model.\nPreclinical models remain unsettled whether aging rodents show a correlation of mPFC hypometabolism with declining executive function. The human ACC/mPFC homologues in rodents are under refinement (Vogt and Paxinos 2014) . Furthermore, optimal probes of rodent executive function are unclear.\nSeveral paradigms probe executive function in rodents. Older rats perform poorly on the water maze task and show, among other regions, decreased ACC metabolism (Gage et al., 1984) .\nRepresentation of 3D-objects in remote memory recruits the ACC (Burke and Barnes, 2015) .\nIbotenic acid lesions targeting the PL ACC selectively impaired performance on extradimensional set shifting (Birrell et al., 2000) . Chemogenetic inhibition of the mouse dorsal ACC impaired sustained attention as indexed by a 5-choice serial reaction time task (Koike et al., 2016) . Selective lesions of different medial prefrontal regions (Cg, PL) affected preferentially different components of set shifting and probabilistic reversal learning (Ng et al., 2007; Newman and McGaughy, 2011; Dalton et al., 2016) .\nIn summary, ACC metabolism mediates the relationship between age and executive function while having no relationship to memory in cognitively intact elders. This relationship does not occur throughout the brain consistent with the known specialization of the ACC for executive functions. These findings motivate research on aging-related ACC pathophysiology and the need for animal models of CA."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "Figure captions "}]
