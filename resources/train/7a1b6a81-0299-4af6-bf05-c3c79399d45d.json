In this study, for early detection of AD and prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion, we develop an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework based on a merit-based feature selection method through a whole-brain voxel-wise analysis using baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We also explore the impact of different MRI spatial resolution on the voxel-wise metric AD classification and MCI conversion prediction. We assessed the proposed CAD framework using the whole-brain voxel-wise MRI features of 507 J-ADNI participants (146 healthy controls [HCs], 102 individuals with stable MCI [sMCI], 112 with progressive MCI [pMCI], and 147 with AD) among four clinically relevant pairs of diagnostic groups at different imaging resolutions (i.e., 2, 4, 8, and 16 mm). Using a support vector machine classifier through a 10-fold cross-validation strategy at a spatial resolution of 2 mm, the proposed CAD framework yielded classification accuracies of 91.13%, 74.77%, 81.12%, and 81.78% in identifying AD/healthy control, sMCI/pMCI, sMCI/AD, and pMCI/HC, respectively.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as a traditional phase between normal aging and AD, involves a slight but noticeable decline in memory and thinking [2] . Generally, MCI patients who later convert to AD are considered to have progressive MCI (pMCI), whereas MCI patients who have stable cognitive conditions are considered to have stable MCI (sMCI). One important clinical task is to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI in order to identify MCI patients who are at high risk of converting to AD in the foreseeable future. Consequently, early detection of this group of patients may help clinicians to effectively treat the condition.\nTo this end, different neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [3, 4] , positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3063 2 of 12 have been widely used in a variety of AD studies. In contrast to PET and SPECT modalities [10] , MRI does not require injection of a radioactive pharmaceutical and also provides excellent spatial resolution with good contrast images. Radiological studies have confirmed that MRI measures can be used as a robust procedure to track brain atrophy due to neuronal loss [11] . In the case of AD, various MRI studies have shown that structural brain alterations due to AD can be used to distinguish AD patients from healthy controls (HCs) as well as pMCI patients from sMCI patients [12, 13] . Furthermore, a recent study has documented that volumetric measures achieved from MRI data have the potential ability of detecting the biological heterogeneity patterns among amnestic MCI patients [14] .\nGenerally, in the case of feature extraction from MRI, the AD classification studies can be categorized into three main groups: (1) Vertex-wise metrics use cortical and subcortical features, such as volumetric, thickness, and area information. The performance of this method is highly reliant on surface registration [15] . (2) Region of interest (ROI)-based metrics use a nonlinear registration followed by a template to extract the features from each ROI [16] . Practically, the dimension of features in this method is a function of the number of ROIs considered. As a drawback, this method has difficulty in reflecting the minor abnormalities associated with brain diseases [17] . (3) Voxel-wise metrics use the voxel intensities extracted from MRI scans as a feature. Although the voxel-wise metric robustly reflects the minor changes occurring due to brain disease, this approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality, in which the number of extracted features (i.e., voxel intensities) is markedly higher than the number of samples. With respect to this point, a robust feature selection for high-dimensional space plays a crucial role in voxel-wise approaches.\nIn the present study, we aimed to use a voxel-wise metric followed by advanced pattern recognition methods to develop a robust computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for AD classification. We introduce a merit-based feature selection (MFS) method as part of a proposed CAD framework to select the most informative features (i.e., voxel intensities) from high-dimensional space extracted from whole-brain analysis. We will show how, by using the proposed MFS, we are able to classify AD patients from healthy individuals and predict MCI conversion with robust performance. We additionally investigate the effect of different MRI spatial resolutions on the proposed CAD framework. The efficiency of the proposed CAD framework is assessed using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier followed by 10-fold cross-validation.\nIn summary, we, therefore, propose the following contributions to four pairs of clinical groups (i.e., AD/HC, pMCI/sMCI, pMCI/HC, and sMCI/AD patients) based on whole-brain voxel-wise MRI features obtained at baseline:\n(a) An automatic CAD framework based on a new feature selection method, namely the MFS, to identify the most informative features (i.e., voxel intensities) from high-dimensional space.

Along these lines, the authors in Reference [16] proposed a multitask learning method based on multimodality data including MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). They reported accuracies of 84.8%, 73.9%, and 62% for MRI with AD/HC, MCI/HC, and pMCI/sMCI samples, respectively.

Using MRI, they reported accuracies of 81.6% in the classification of AD/HC, 66.9% in the classification of MCI/HC, and 55.1% for the prediction of pMCI/sMCI. In addition, they reported accuracies of 89.0%, 74.6%, and 58% for the classification of AD/HC, MCI/HC, and sMCI/pMCI groups by combining MRI with CSF, FDG-PET, and genetic data. The authors in Reference [23] investigated a Gaussian process approach using several combined multimodality data sources (i.e., MRI, PET, CSF, and APOE genotype). They stated balanced accuracies of 61.5% using MRI and of 74.1% using several combined multimodality data sources (i.e., MRI, PET, CSF, and APOE genotype) for sMCI/pMCI groups. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of gray matter (GM) as a feature followed by semi-supervised learning, the authors in Reference [13] presented a robust framework for MCI conversion prediction with accuracies of 74.74% based on MRI and of 82% by combining MRI features with age and cognitive measures in pMCI/sMCI samples.

In addition, they achieved accuracies of 92.4%, 74.9%, and 74.1% by combining MRI data with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in a classification of AD/HC, amnestic-MCI/HC, and nonamnestic-MCI/HC, respectively. The use of multiscale feature extraction based on baseline MRI data was presented in Reference [25] with accuracies of 84.13% and 76.69% for AD/HC and pMCI/sMCI, respectively. One study [3] used VBM and deformation-based morphometry (DBM) methods via MRI data for AD/HC classification with accuracies of 85%, 84%, and 79% on the basis of DBM, displacement magnitude, and Jacobian determinant feature extraction methods, respectively.\nThe researchers in Reference [26] presented a multivariate data analysis for AD detection using MRI data followed by independent component analysis, cognition data, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. They stated accuracies of 84.7%, 94.8%, 83.1%, and 80.3% for HC/MCI, HC/AD, MCI/AD, and aMCI/pMCI tasks, respectively. A multimodal imaging technique on the basis of multi-kernel learning followed by a Dartel algorithm was proposed for early detection of AD by means of MRI and PET data [27] , with prediction accuracies > 0.95% for AD/HC, MCI/HC, and AD/MCI tasks, receptively."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Image Acquisition and Participants", "text": "The T1-weighted MRI scans and clinical information were acquired from the Japanese-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) dataset.\nAll participants were assessed using neuropsychological assessment tools for AD, including the MMSE [28] and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [29] , and then divided into four groups according to the results: (1) HC individuals (N: 146, mean age \u00b1 sd: 68.28 \u00b1 5.61, mean MMSE \u00b1 sd: 29.11 \u00b1 1.20, mean CDR \u00b1 sd: 0.00 \u00b1 0.00); (2) sMCI individuals who were stable in MCI stage at least for 36 months (N: 102, mean age \u00b1 sd: 73.44 \u00b1 5.97, mean MMSE \u00b1 sd: 26.55 \u00b1 1.81, mean CDR \u00b1 sd: 0.50 \u00b1 0.00); (3) pMCI individuals who converted from MCI to AD was within 6-36 months after baseline (N: 112, mean age \u00b1 sd: 73.62 \u00b1 5.57, mean MMSE \u00b1 sd: 26.08 \u00b1 1.53, mean CDR \u00b1 sd: 0.50 \u00b1 0.00); and (4) AD individuals (N: 147, mean age \u00b1 sd: 74.07 \u00b1 6.57, mean MMSE \u00b1 sd: 22.55 \u00b1 1.80, mean CDR \u00b1 sd: 0.67 \u00b1 0.23).

The linear kernel (default settings) was chosen due to its better classification performances on our dataset. To validate the proposed MFS, we used k-fold cross-validation strategy (k = 10), because it has been widely used as a reliable validation process in a series of AD classification studies [39] [40] [41] [42] . Based on the 10-fold cross-validation strategy, the results of each task were averaged over 10 repetitions so that, in each iteration, one-fold (10% of samples) was considered the test set and the remaining folds (90% of samples) were considered the training set. Of note, the subjects were randomly divided into 10-folds for each task.

Among different neuroimaging modalities applied to AD, MRI is widely used because of its widespread availability and completely noninvasive nature [12] . Generally, AD classification studies using neuroimaging data suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Different dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches have been proposed to overcome this drawback and improve the classification performance. For instance, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was proposed for the reduction of data extracted from SPECT and PET modalities [49] . Various AD studies additionally used the Partial Least Squares technique to transfer the data from a high-dimensional space into a lower dimensional vector [50] [51] [52] [53] . Parallel to these approaches, a feature ranking-based strategy has been proposed for sorting the extracted features from high-dimensional space on the basis of their importance and then selecting the optimal subset of top-ranked features using Fisher criterion [54] and classification error [55] .\nIn this study, we developed an automatic CAD framework followed by voxel-wise MRI features for AD detection and MCI conversion prediction. Although the voxel-wise metric is widely used for AD classification and brain-age estimation [31] , it suffers from the curse of dimensionality (i.e., a high-dimensional feature vector compared with the number of samples). To address this limitation, we presented an MFS procedure that reduces dimensionality by eliminating redundant features (i.e., voxel intensities). The performance of the proposed CAD framework was assessed using 507 MRI scans taken at baseline from the J-ADNI data set. The experimental results indicated that the proposed MFS can identify the most informative features (i.e., voxel intensities) from high-dimensional space and that the proposed CAD system is highly competitive with state-of-the-art techniques using only MRI reported in the literature.\nLately, a comprehensive study was conducted in Reference [56] to explore the impact of different datasets (i.e., ADNI, AIBL, and OASIS), training set sizes, scanner protocols, preprocessing options, brain imaging modalities, classifiers, and feature types (i.e., voxel-wise and region-wise) on AD classification. In this study, we investigated the effect of different isotropic spatial resolutions on AD classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that spatial resolution may play an effective role in classification performance. Practically, the performance of the proposed CAD framework was improved by decreasing the spatial resolution. This may be because a lower spatial resolution (i.e., 2 mm) may help to trace atrophic regions in the AD brain. It is worth noting that a decrease in the spatial resolution increases the dimensionality and computational cost. For example, by decreasing the spatial resolution from 8 mm to 2 mm, the dimensionality increases from 3747 to 238,955 features for each individual. Consequently, a tradeoff between the spatial resolution and computational cost is needed. For future work, we suggest to use the MFS technique for classification of AD and prediction of MCI on the basis of ROI-based metrics. In this study, we used only GM images. Another future direction will be to integrate the GM, white matter, and CSF components (i.e., data fusion) followed by MFS procedure to improve the classification accuracy for AD studies."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study presents an automatic CAD framework for AD detection and MCI conversion prediction based on the voxel-wise metric.
