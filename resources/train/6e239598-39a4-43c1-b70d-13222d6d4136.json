Furthermore, due to their long wavelength, L-band microwaves have a good penetrability to adapt to complex surface conditions. L-band active microwave sensors are therefore widely-used in the measurement of ocean salinity and sea-surface wind fields, and have seen an increasing attention and development [2] [3] [4] [5] . The first space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) equipped on Seasat worked using L-band. Since then, several L-band active microwave sensors and missions have begun operation, which include the Japanese phased array type L-band synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) [6] , the Aquarius/SAC-D mission [7] and the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission [8] . The Aquarius/SAC-D and SMAP missions, which were both undertaken by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), have also used L-band microwave radiometers and combined active/passive L-band instruments for ocean research.\nCurrently, a number of geophysical model functions (GMFs) used to simulate ocean surface backscatter at L-band have been developed [5, 6] . GMF is the model used to denote the quantitative transformation relationship between marine physical parameters, satellite observation geometry and normalized radar backscattering cross sections (NRCSs). These models have a high simulation accuracy in practical applications; however, GMFs are empirical models which have no definite physical meaning.

Therefore, in order to simulate the ocean surface backscattering accurately, the establishment of a geometretical model of the rough sea surface generated by wind is the prime requirement; the accuracy of the sea surface geometry model determines the accuracy of the EM scattering model.\nCurrently, the sea surface morphology simulation methods are mainly based on the ocean wave spectrum. The elevation spectrum of ocean waves is defined as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the sea surface height field [21] . It is one of the two-order statistical properties of stochastic processes and describes the distribution of each harmonic component of the sea surface with respect to the spatial frequency and orientation directly. The two-dimensional elevation spectrum is also called the directional spectrum or vector spectrum. The integration of the direction spectrum over the azimuth is defined as an omnidirectional spectrum, which is a one-dimensional spectrum and describes the distribution of the sea surface height energy at different wavenumbers. Generally, the omnidirectional spectrum often needs to be used first to obtain the two-dimensional directional spectrum. The relationship between the directional spectrum and omnidirectional spectrum is illustrated as\nRemote Sens. 2017, 9, 776 3 of 17 where k and \u03d5 are the wavenumber and wave direction relative to the wind, respectively. S(k) is the omnidirectional spectrum and S(k, \u03d5) is the directional spectrum.\nOver the past few decades, scholars have proposed a number of sea wave spectra. These spectra can simulate the sea surface morphology in the specific wind speed and wave number range and find successful applications for the EM scattering models [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Some early wave spectra are empirical formulations which are statistical descriptions of wind-generated surface waves. These spectra offer a better description of the longer gravity waves with measured data, despite the relatively low accuracy in the high wavenumber regime, by taking a simple experiential extension from gravity waves. However, for the EM scattering from the ocean surface, the primary contribution of the scattering is from the short-scale waves [27, 28] . Therefore, an accurate description of short-gravity and capillary waves is also essential. To be consistent with the in situ observations of gravity-capillary waves, Apel [23] and Elfouhaily et al. [21] proposed a full wavenumber spectra based on the developed spectra. Kudryavtsev et al. derived a physical model of the short wind wave spectrum by analyzing the input and dissipation of sea wave energy based on the propagation theory of the spectral energy density [29] . Including scattering theory and radar data, the precise retrieval of short-wave spectral properties was implemented with active microwave observations [22, 25, 26, 30] . Based on the technique of stereophotography and image brightness contrast processing, the directional short wind wave characteristics were measured and modeled [28, 31, 32] . Compared to former empirical spectra, these spectra can better describe the sea surface morphology in the short gravity-capillary wave wavenumber range.\nTo drive the AIEM model for sea surface backscattering, the geometrical parameters of the sea surface should be calculated by the omnidirectional spectrum. Only the improved Fung-Lee spectrum [18, 22] and Elfouhaily spectrum [21] have been used to simulate the sea surface morphology and calculate the high-order spectra for this model. Nonetheless, the backscattering coefficient of the sea surface calculated by the IEM or AIEM model with the improved Fung-Lee spectrum was mainly at a high frequency; e.g., C-band and Ku-band. Meanwhile, although the IEM/Elfouhaily model was successfully used to simulate the L-band bistatic scattering of the sea surface [19] , the accuracy of the Elfouhaily spectrum is relatively low in the low wind speed range. Among the numerous spectra mentioned previously, the Apel spectrum that was developed for the EM scattering model has a high accuracy in the full wavenumber and wide wind speed range. In particular, it performs well in our simulations of ocean surface microwave backscattering with the AIEM model. Therefore, in this paper, we choose the Apel omnidirectional spectrum as the basis for establishing our directional spectrum [23] . Figure 1 shows the Apel omnidirectional elevation spectrum for the full wavenumber range and for wind speeds from 3 to 21 m/s. The three vertical lines represent the microwave wavenumber k 0 = 26.39 rad/m in 1.26 GHz, k 0 /10, k 0 *10, respectively. We believe that the sea waves in this range are the main waves which have interactions with the incident electromagnetic wave.\nThe two-dimensional directional spectrum is the Fourier transform of the bidimensional covariance of surface displacement, while the omnidirectional spectrum is one-dimensional [21] . To extend the one-dimensional omnidirectional spectrum to the two-dimensional directional spectrum, we multiply the omnidirectional spectrum by the angular spreading function (ASF) as\nwhere \u03a6(k, \u03d5) is the angular spreading function. The ASF describes the distribution of omnidirectional spectral energy in all directions under different wind speeds and different wave numbers so that it is the function of the wave number, wind speed and azimuth angle. The first commonly used ASF was put forward by Longuet-Higgins [33] which is a cosine-shape parametric function which was improved by Mitsuyasu et al. [34] . Over the following decades, continuous improvements were made by Donelan et al. [25] , Fung and Lee [22] , Nickolaev et al. [35] , Apel et al. [23] and Elfouhaily et al. [21] , etc. However, these ASFs have a different noncentrosymmetry, and different spreading functions have diversities of mathematical properties. This introduces a number of difficulties for the use of a directional spectrum in sea surface scattering modeling. To overcome these difficulties, Elfouhaily et al. [21] put forward an angular spreading function based on the first two order harmonics of Fourier series expansion. This solution offers useful mathematical properties; e.g., the normalization of azimuth integral and central symmetry. This improved ASF function can be written as\nIn Equation (3), \u0394(k) is upwind-crosswind ratio that can be calculated from an already developed ASF regardless of whether it is centrosymmetric. \u0394 ratio describes the anisotropy of the spreading functions and depends on wavenumber k.\nWith Equation (4), different spreading functions that are already developed can be unified in \u0394 ratios which are similar in form. Furthermore, these functions can be turned into the form as Equation (3) . For the sake of simplicity, we will not give the specific developed ASFs and their \u0394 ratios here, but the numerical curves of \u0394 ratios corresponding to the ASFs are shown in Figure 2a . The first commonly used ASF was put forward by Longuet-Higgins [33] which is a cosine-shape parametric function which was improved by Mitsuyasu et al. [34] .

For the sake of simplicity, we will not give the specific developed ASFs and their \u2206 ratios here, but the numerical curves of \u2206 ratios corresponding to the ASFs are shown in Figure 2a . Radar observation results indicate that the gravity waves have an obvious directionality, while the short-gravity waves lose their directionality gradually with the decrease of the wavelength. However, when the wave wavenumbers decrease into the gravity-capillary range, the waves become more directional again [21, 36] . Although it is generally believed that small-scale waves are almost isotropic, the directionality of the gravity-capillary waves observed by the radar can be explained by hydrodynamic modulation due to large-scale waves. Therefore, to better describe the directionality of ocean waves based on the developed ASFs, Elfouhaily et al. [21] suggested a \u0394 ratio formula in the hyperbolic tangent form for a full wavenumber range spreading function as \nwhere c is the wave phase speed and cp is the phase speed of the dominant long wave. a0 and ap are constants that equal ln(2)/4 and 4, respectively. am is expressed as\nwhere u* is the friction velocity at the sea surface and cm is the minimum phase speed at the wavenumber of the gravity-capillary peak. In Equation (5), the first two items of the hyperbolic tangent function describe the anisotropy of the gravity waves and short-gravity waves of the ocean surface while the third item determines the anisotropy of gravity-capillary waves. The Elfouhaily spreading function can appropriately describe the directionality of long gravity waves and short capillary waves. Thus, it was used in some microwave scattering models to simulate radar azimuth anisotropy [19] . However, for a special wavelength range, i.e., from short-gravity waves to capillary waves, the sea surface backscattering characteristics still cannot be explained and simulated by the existing ocean wave spectra and analytic approximate models.\nRecent observations and studies have discovered that in the 3-9 m/s range of wind speed, the L-band backscatter versus the relative wind direction has a NUC asymmetry. This means that the normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs) at the crosswinds are larger than those upwind or downwind, while the upwind-crosswind asymmetry at high-frequency bands or at above 10 m/s wind speed is positive [3] . This phenomenon has been verified by several operated space-borne L-band scatterometers equipped on ALOS, Aquarius and SMAP [2, 6] . However, there are thus far no theories or analytic models that can simulate this phenomenon [2, 3] . Some scholars have suspected that the phenomenon is caused by an unknown scattering mechanism which is different from Bragg and dominates at low winds [3] . In this paper, we believe the cause of this unusual phenomenon is the difference of wave directionality in the specific wavenumber range, while the scattering mechanism is still Bragg. Radar observation results indicate that the gravity waves have an obvious directionality, while the short-gravity waves lose their directionality gradually with the decrease of the wavelength. However, when the wave wavenumbers decrease into the gravity-capillary range, the waves become more directional again [21, 36] .

In Equation (5), the first two items of the hyperbolic tangent function describe the anisotropy of the gravity waves and short-gravity waves of the ocean surface while the third item determines the anisotropy of gravity-capillary waves. The Elfouhaily spreading function can appropriately describe the directionality of long gravity waves and short capillary waves. Thus, it was used in some microwave scattering models to simulate radar azimuth anisotropy [19] . However, for a special wavelength range, i.e., from short-gravity waves to capillary waves, the sea surface backscattering characteristics still cannot be explained and simulated by the existing ocean wave spectra and analytic approximate models.\nRecent observations and studies have discovered that in the 3-9 m/s range of wind speed, the L-band backscatter versus the relative wind direction has a NUC asymmetry. This means that the normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs) at the crosswinds are larger than those upwind or downwind, while the upwind-crosswind asymmetry at high-frequency bands or at above 10 m/s wind speed is positive [3] .

However, there are thus far no theories or analytic models that can simulate this phenomenon [2, 3] . Some scholars have suspected that the phenomenon is caused by an unknown scattering mechanism which is different from Bragg and dominates at low Remote Sens. 2017, 9, 776 6 of 17 winds [3] . In this paper, we believe the cause of this unusual phenomenon is the difference of wave directionality in the specific wavenumber range, while the scattering mechanism is still Bragg.\nIn fact, at moderate and low wind speeds, the directionality of waves generated by the wind changes in the short gravity-capillary wave wavenumber range. Consequently, the directionality of some small-scale waves is contrary to that in the large-scale wave wavenumber range. This means that the numbers of small-scale waves that propagate perpendicular to the wind direction are larger than those along the wind direction. This phenomenon has been confirmed by several observations. In the experiment of Banner et al. [37] , their two-dimensional spectrum for short gravity waves shows a greater power spectral density at crosswind than alongwind. Hara et al. [38] found that gravity waves (k = 49 rad/m) may exist and propagate against the wind from their observed spectra, and this can lead to a similar conclusion as Banner et al. [37] . Further, the fitting procedure of the \u2206 ratio showed negative values in the short gravity wavenumber range, which means that the energy of the spectrum in the crosswind direction can exceed the energy in the alongwind direction [28] . There are no convincing physical explanations for this phenomenon [37, 38] ; however, some scholars have illustrated a number of kinetic characteristics of small-scale waves that can be instructive. Elfouhaily et al. [21] demonstrated that a few of the shorter waves ridden on longer waves may travel perpendicular to the wind direction due to the interaction between wave. For the same reason, Donelan et al. [39] and Hara et al. [38] believe that some short waves even propagate against the wind direction. Mitsuyasu et al. [34] measured the wave characteristics by buoys under several steady sea conditions. According to the measurements, they found that in a steady wind direction, the wave directionality changes with the decreasing wavelength.\nSince most of the existing ASFs do not describe the peculiar directionality of the short gravity waves, we mathematically construct an improved angular spreading function based on Elfouhaily's \u2206 ratio formula. The \u2206 ratio formula of our spreading function is shown as\nwhere, different from Equation (5), the constant a 0 equals \u2212ln(2)/4. The second item of the hyperbolic tangent function describes the directionality of short-gravity waves which is contrasted with long-gravity waves with the constant a d = ln(2)/2. S d also has a hyperbolic tangent shape and a wind speed dependency that is expressed as\nwhere u* is the friction velocity. k x is a function of the wavenumber as\nwith the minimum phase speed, c m = 0.23 m/s. In Equation (7), the last two items of the hyperbolic tangent function are basically the same as those of Elfouhaily's \u2206 ratio formula. However, the constant a m in the last item equals 0.26 by multiplying a factor of two by Elfouhaily's a m = 0.13.\nThe core of our \u2206 ratio formula shown as Equation (7) is the second item in the square brackets, which produces the negative part in the range of short gravity waves. This item is constructed mathematically to simulate the directionality of the waves coupled with L-band microwaves. The hyperbolic tangent function is chosen to restrain the energy of the function body. The V-shaped part of our \u2206 ratio is produced by the \"hook function\", which has a general form as y = a \u00b7 x + b/x. When a > 0 and b > 0, the \"hook function\" has an extreme point at ( \u221a b/a, 2 \u221a a \u00b7 b) in the first quadrant. According to the relationship between scattering directionality and wind velocity, the V-shaped function is Remote Sens. 2017, 9, 776 7 of 17 constructed with a dependency on the friction velocity and the wavenumber of the spectral peak. The wavenumber of the spectral peak k p is expressed as wave phase speed with the relation written as\nThus, the V-shaped \"hook function\" is shown as the first two items of the hyperbolic tangent function in Equation (8) . The exponents defined in Equation (9) stretch the wavenumber k on the axis. Based on the properties of the \"hook function\", the last two items of the hyperbolic tangent function in Equation (8) are constructed to tailor the V-shaped part of \u2206 ratio to the directionality of L-band microwave backscattering. Further, the coefficients in Equations (8) and (9) are determined by fitting simulations of scattering model and the L-band radar observations (as shown in Section 3). Figure 2b shows the numerical curve of our \u2206 ratio formula in the full band range. The corresponding wind speed is from 3 to 15 m/s with a 2 m/s interval. The middle vertical line represents the microwave wavenumber k 0 = 26.39 rad/m in 1.26 GHz while the left and right vertical lines represent the waves wavenumber, 2k 0 sin(20 \u2022 ) and 2k 0 sin(60 \u2022 ), respectively. They are the wavenumbers of sea surface waves which resonate with the L-band microwaves (1.26 GHz) at 20 \u2022 and 60 \u2022 incidence angles, according to the Bragg scattering mechanism. As seen from the curves in Figure 2b , the value of the \u2206 ratio has both positive and negative aspects which represent opposite wave directionalities for different wavenumbers. In fact, by combining Equations (3) and (4), we may conclude that the absolute value of the \u2206 ratio decides the wave anisotropy, while the positive and negative of \u2206 ratio dominates the wave directionality. Therefore, as opposed to most developed spreading functions, the V-shaped part in our \u2206 ratio curve simulates the special directionality of the short-gravity waves that have been shown in the L-band scattering signals. The V-shaped part in our \u2206 ratio curve shifts towards the longer wavelength with the increase of the wind speed. During the wavenumber range (between the left and right vertical lines) with which we are concerned, the \u2206 ratio has negative values at low wind speeds and positive ones at higher speeds. This corresponds to the fact that the NUC asymmetry appears at low speeds while the PUC asymmetry appears at higher speeds. However, the \u2206 ratio values are almost positive at higher wavenumbers, which may be coupled with higher frequency microwaves; e.g., the C band and Ku band. This explains why the upwind-crosswind asymmetry is positive at high-frequency bands. In addition, the absolute value of the \u2206 ratio during the wavenumber range between the two vertical lines increases in the 3-5 m/s wind speed range, decreases in the 5-8 m/s wind speed range, and goes up above the 9 m/s wind speed again. This pattern agrees exactly with the change of peak-to-peak radar backscattering variations.\nHowever, it should be noted that the application of our ASF will only focus on the L-band and higher frequencies. With limited observations, our ASF puts more energy in the crosswind direction for gravity waves, which does not conform to the actual situation. Therefore, in the future extension of this study, more in situ measurements or radar observations at lower wavenumbers are needed to extend application range of this ASF [37, 38] . Figure 3a -f illustrates, in polar coordinates, the numerical curve of Elfouhaily ASF and our function at 5 m/s wind speed and different wavenumbers, respectively. We can see that the curve shapes of the two ASFs are almost the same in the long-gravity wavenumber range and are slightly different in the capillary wavenumber range. However, the difference between the two ASF curves in the short-gravity wavenumber range is quite large. Our ASF seems to simulate the special directionality during this band range better and is more suitable for an analytical model.\nBased on the modeling of sea surface morphology, the geometrical parameters of the ocean surface can be calculated and put into an EM scattering model as described in the following section.

In fact, the exploring microwave does not couple with all wavelength waves but a specific wavenumber range of waves which have comparable roughness scales to the microwave wavelength [19, 41] . It means that only a range of roughness scales is effective in generating scattering. Hence, the geometric parameters inserted into the AIEM model should represent the characteristics of the waves coupled with microwaves. According to the Bragg scattering theory, this wavenumber range is a function of exploring the wavelength and incident angle. In practical computations, this range also depends on the selection of scattering model and wave spectrum. The range for the IEM/Fung-Lee model was suggested by Xu et al. [20] and Marrazzo et al. [42] as (k 0 *0.4, k 0 *10). Accordingly, by comparing with the in situ measured sea surface geometric data and the satellite observations, we generally believe that the wavenumber range of waves coupled with microwaves is between k 0 /10 and k 0 *10, where the microwave wavenumber k 0 = 26.39 rad/m in 1.26 GHz (also shown in Figure 1) . Notably, this wavenumber range is only chosen to calculate the geometry parameter (\u03b4) for the AIEM model and has a different meaning from the spectrum cutoff used in TSM. Also, it is independent of the wind speed and exploring frequency. Additionally, the waves in this range are also believed to determine sea surface emissivity [4] .\nThe high-order surface spectrum w (n) (\u03ba, \u03d5) is defined as the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the nth power of the surface autocorrelation function.

For the sea surface, the wave spectrum is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the sea surface displacements. We can obtain the sea surface autocorrelation function by the inverse Fourier transform of the wave spectrum.

It was launched on 10 June 2011 and came into full operation on 25 August of that year. Unfortunately, this satellite ended its mission prematurely due to the failure of the power support system and attitude control system. During its period of operation, a large number of the ocean observation data was obtained, and its data at all levels were distributed by PO.DAAC at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\nThe Aquarius instrument has three antennas whose incident angles are 28.7 \u2022 , 37.8 \u2022 and 45.6 \u2022 , respectively [3, 43] . These antennas are shared by the L-band microwave radiometer operating at 1.413 GHz and the scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz. To validate the simulation of the L-band sea surface backscattering with our model, the Aquarius V4.0 L2 data from all of 2014 were collected.

The measurements of the scatterometer provided by the data set were used to validate the model calculation results.

The results were compared to the Aquarius observations. Specifically, in the calculation process, the dielectric constants needed by the AIEM model were obtained from the K-S model [44] . The model inputs were SST and SSS, which were provided by the ancillary data in the Aquarius L2 data set.\nIn Figure 4 , the VV and HH sea surface NRCSs at L-band versus the relative wind direction were compared to Aquarius observations for different wind speeds. Meanwhile, the mean biases between model simulations and satellite observations were calculated at multiple wind velocities, polarizations and incidence angles. Specifically, each row represents a different wind speed, i.e., 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 m/s, while the columns correspond to three antenna beams. In general, our model results have a good concordance with the satellite observations. Almost all mean biases are less than 1 dB, and most maximal biases are restrained in 1 dB. For an analytical approximate model, these indicate a good accuracy of our model at L-band [17, 20, 23, 24] . In the range of 3-8 m/s wind speed, the NUC asymmetry of the L-band sea surface backscatter, which may also be called \"M-shape\" feature, was simulated well. As is shown in Figure 2b , the sea waves show the most obvious NUC asymmetry in the concerned wavenumber range, due to the \u2206 ratios decreasing with wind speed increasing and the minimum of \u2206 ratios at 5 m/s wind speed. The peak-to-peak variations of NRCSs are up to 1 dB and 0.7 dB for VV polarization and HH polarization at beam 1. The peak-to-peak amplitude decreases in the 5-8 m/s range. For wind speeds above 8 m/s, the upwind-crosswind asymmetry turns positive, which we call the \"W-shape\" feature in model simulations and observations. The peak-to-peak amplitudes increase as the wind speed increases because the \u2206 ratios are positive and increase as the wind speed increases. It should also be noted that, in the 3-8 m/s range, the NRCSs have smaller peak-to-peak amplitudes at the larger incidence, while the opposite is true above the 8 m/s wind speed. This phenomenon can be explained by the absolutes of \u2206 ratios in the concerned range at different wind speeds. The absolutes of \u2206 ratios decrease in the 3-8 m/s range while increasing in the 9-15 m/s range, with wavenumber increasing; this corresponds to the increase of the incident angle. At a 15 m/s wind speed, the model simulations are larger than the observations at a crosswind while they are smaller than observations at upwind, which suggests that the peak-to-peak amplitude of the model result is smaller than that of the observation. In the analysis of the next section, this limitation is revealed and interpreted. It denotes that the \u2206 ratio of our angular spreading function should be larger at high wind speeds. In addition, the transition between the \"M-shape\" feature and \"W-shape\" feature can be noticed at an 8 m/s wind speed, which indicates the transition of the \u2206 ratio between the negative portion and positive portion. Our model simulations show a slightly stronger directionality than Aquarius observations at beam 2 and 3. Similarly, at 3 m/s, model results also show stronger directionality. These phenomena will be numerically analyzed in next section.\nDuring the 9-15 m/s wind speed range, however, our model simulations at beam 1 are slightly smaller than the observations, especially for HH polarization. Additionally, at beam 2 and beam 3, the NRCSs simulated by the model are larger than the observations in the downwind direction due to ignoring the skewness effect of sea waves [18, [45] [46] [47] . To further demonstrate the advantages of our improved spectrum in describing the wave directionality in the range of interest, we compared the azimuthal features of model simulations with Elfouhaily's ASF and our ASF at two specific wind speeds in Figure 5 . In reality, the difference of these two ASFs lies in the \u2206 ratio formulae, which are given in Equations (5) and (7). The wind speed at 5 and 12 m/s were chosen to represent low and high wind speeds, respectively. In general, the AIEM model with our ASF can simulate both the NUC asymmetry at low wind speeds and the PUC asymmetry at higher wind speeds, while it only shows PUC asymmetry at all wind speeds with Elfouhaily's ASF. At 5 m/s, it can obviously be seen that the model simulations with two different ASFs show almost opposite UC asymmetries. Clearly, by comparing with the satellite observations, model NRCSs calculated with our ASF simulate the NUC asymmetry of L-band ocean surface backscattering successfully, and the simulations with Elfouhaily's ASF lead to erroneous PUC at low wind speed. However, at 12 m/s, the model simulations with two ASFs are similar and describe the real azimuthal features of sea surface backscattering at all three incidences. Therefore, we may draw the conclusion that our improved ASF shows superiority for wave directionality description at lower wind speeds. This fact will be further illustrated in the following analysis.\nTo further demonstrate the advantages of our improved spectrum in describing the wave directionality in the range of interest, we compared the azimuthal features of model simulations with Elfouhaily's ASF and our ASF at two specific wind speeds in Figure 5 .

This fact will be further illustrated in the following analysis. In Figure 6 , the model NRCSs calculated with two different ASFs versus the wind speed were also compared to Aquarius observations in the upwind and crosswind direction. As the figures show, at all three beams, the model results using our improved ASF agree with the observations well, which indicate that our ASF has a better description of the directionality of the continuous gravity-capillary waves coupled with L-band microwaves. In addition, the model simulations with two ASFs show obvious gaps at low wind speeds, while they are close at high wind speeds.

This also expresses the advantages of our ASF in the low wind speed range. It should be also noted that the L-band sea surface NRCSs keep increasing as the wind speeds increase in the upwind direction. However, the NRCSs in the crosswind direction increase only during the low wind speed range and remain almost steady at higher wind speeds. This suggests that the energy remains conserved for waves during the wavenumber range which are coupled with the incident microwave. A comparison with Aquarius observations shows that model simulations with our spectrum describe this feature well.\nRemote Sens. 2017, 9, 776 13 of 17 also expresses the advantages of our ASF in the low wind speed range.
