[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, nonsegmented single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus comprising of 29,881 nucleotides in length. At genomic level, SARS-CoV-2 shares ~88% nucleotide sequence homology with previously reported SARS-like coronavirus strains from bats, indicating its potential origin and transmission route [1] .\nSARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global public health emergency since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2] . The current recommended testing method for patients exhibiting clinical features of COVID-19 is the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed on nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum or alveolar lavage fluid depending upon the sample processing local/international guidelines and available facilities [3, 4] . However, COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted several caveats of the PCR-based testing when it comes down to the point of mass-testing coupled with urgent reporting. For instance, PCR testing requires wellequipped centralized laboratories capable of handling respiratory pathogens, dedicated instruments such as PCR machines and skilled staff to ensure the smooth processing which isn't always possible particularly in less developed or resource limited communities. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 has pushed even the developed nations to levels where they are struggling to ensure rapid and effective testing for every suspected case, one can imagine how catastrophic the situation can be in countries with limited healthcare facilities and resources. In addition, falsenegative PCR results from several COVID-19 patients is also becoming a matter of concern raising questions about the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, a great deal of effort is shifting towards deployment of accurate yet rapid, cost-effective and point-of-care testing methodologies.\nAs the basic principle of PCR-based methods is to amplify the genomic content to the level of detection, alternative molecular amplification approaches can be of great value under crisis situations. One such method is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) which since its development became one of the highly popular and implemented isothermal method for the rapid detection of animal [8, 9] , plant [10, 11] and human pathogens [12, 13] . Unlike PCR, LAMP utilizes a combination of uniquely designed pair of four to six primers and a specialized version .

Recently, several LAMP assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and showed promising data [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .

As the aim is to mature this protocol as a point-of-care and on-field testing approach, therefore, the protocol was kept simple, quick and easily deployable.\nFor this purpose, ready-to-use master mixes and primer mixes were prepared. Multi-gene approach has previously shown to improve the performance of SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays. The same approach was applied here, and RT-LAMP was designed to simultaneously detect ORF1a and N genes. Recently, several studies have reported LAMP assays for COVID-19. Overall, all these studies highlight the strength of LAMP especially in situations where a rapid and reliable testing is required. Moreover, few commercially developed isothermal systems are already in pipeline for the approval by the relevant authorities however, majority of the reported SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays were evaluated on synthetic constructs and lack validation on actual samples. Theoretically, such assays shouldn't suffer from any drastic differences, however, the true sensitivity: specificity profile of an assay demands validation on clinical cohort. Therefore, one strength of our assay is validation on COVID-19 positive patients' samples. As given in Table 1 , dual-gene LAMP assay was able to detect 43 out of 45 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2 positive samples based upon consensus findings of ORF1a and N genes whereas, none of the non-COVID-19 samples were found to be positive indicating 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The two PCR-positive samples designated as sample A (ID#1112-4) and B (ID# 390-3) showed conflicting results. As shown in Figure 1 , sample A showed positive amplification in N assay whereas no amplification was noted with ORF1a assay. On the other hand, sample B showed positive amplification with ORF1a whereas negative according to the N assay. As we considered same output from both assays to assign samples as positive or negative, we concluded these samples as negative. The Cq value of sample B was 36.90 that is indicate of low viral load whereas, sample A had Cq value 31.30. As there was no additional viral RNA available for testing of sample A and B, the negative result of sample A for ORF1a is currently unclear. On the other hand, positive detection of low viral load sample B is indicative that LAMP ORF1a assay is more sensitive than N assay. Evaluation with additional samples is currently underway.\nOverall, the reported dual-gene LAMP assay is an effective and quick approach to handle masstesting of COVID-19 without the need of expensive equipment, access to centralized laboratories and highly trained staff. .
