DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Community-dwelling volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty men and 259 women with a mean age of 71.1 \u00b1 0.4 (range 55-96) and complete data on fasting plasma adiponectin and leptin, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (plasma glucose available at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 minutes), thigh computed tomography (CT), physical activity levels, and anthropometric measures. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were classified into eight groups according to the presence of global adiposity (body mass index > 27 kg/m 2 ), central adiposity (waist circumference > 88 cm for women and > 102 cm for men), and low muscle mass (CT thigh, lowest sex-specific tertile (93.8 cm 2 in women and 110.7 cm 2 in men) of adjusted thigh muscle area). Linear regression models were used to estimate the contribution of these eight groups to early glucose area under the curve (AUC) (t = 0-40 minutes), late glucose AUC (t = 60-120 minutes), and total glucose AUC (t = 0-120 minutes) from the OGTT. RESULTS: Regardless of muscle mass, individuals with a combination of central and global adiposity were more likely to have delayed glucose disposal rates (P < .05). A strong negative association was also found between circulating adiponectin levels and glucose disposal rates (early AUC, b = \u00c00.14; late AUC, b = \u00c00.20; and total AUC, b = \u00c00.20; P < .05 for all three AUCs) after adjusting for regional adiposity, muscle mass, circulating leptin levels, physical activity, age, and sex.\nCONCLUSION: Older individuals with global and central adiposity may be at risk of glucose intolerance unrelated to low muscle mass.

The lack of information on lean body or skeletal muscle mass limited previous studies that addressed this question, 2, 3 which may be problematic because changes in lean body mass and fat mass may not occur in parallel with aging. In some individuals, an accelerated decline in muscle mass with age accompanies a substantial increase in fat mass, leading to the syndrome of \"sarcopenic obesity.\" 4 In others, changes in fat mass are more variable; fat mass appears to increase, remain stable, or even decline in different individuals and at different ages. 5 Furthermore, fat tends to deposit preferentially in the visceral compartment in some individuals, whereas it assumes a more global and diffuse pattern in others. 6 It is still not understood how these complex patterns of body composition affect glucose metabolism.\nAdipose tissue and skeletal muscle may affect glucose homeostasis through different mechanisms. Adipocytes secrete adiponectin and leptin, which directly influence glucose homeostasis. Leptin stimulates energy expenditure and inhibits food intake, preventing excess adiposity. 7 Adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity, upregulates fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure, and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis. 8 High leptin 9 and low adiponectin 10 levels are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 85% of postprandial insulin mediated glucose disposal, 11 and changes in muscle mass may affect glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance has been associated with lower muscle strength in elderly adults even after controlling for adiposity, regardless of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, 12, 13 suggesting that agerelated sarcopenia could contribute to glucose intolerance in elderly adults.\nIn spite of the potential contributions that age-related changes in body composition may have on glucose tolerance, there is no study, to the knowledge of the authors, that has considered the collective effects of muscle mass, regional adiposity, and adipokines on glucose tolerance in elderly adults. The hypothesis that adipokines, muscle mass, and different patterns of regional adiposity independently affect glucose disposal in older persons was tested using cross-sectional data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The BLSA is an ongoing observational study of normative aging in community-dwelling volunteers conducted at and sponsored by the U.S. National Institute on Aging (NIA) since 1958.

Thirty-nine of the 60 participants were taking medication for diabetes mellitus (19 metformin, 6 dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 8 sulfonylureas, and 6 thiazolidinediones).\nThe characteristics of the participants according to the eight different body composition groups are summarized in Table 1 . Many participants (38%) were considered lean with normal muscle mass, followed closely by those with central and global adiposity (total 35.5%). Fewer than 10% of participants were considered to have central or global adiposity alone. Participants classified in groups with low muscle mass were significantly older (P < .05 for all groups) than those with normal muscle mass, so all statistical comparisons between groups were age adjusted.

Within the groups with central and global adiposity and in men and women, low muscle mass was associated with higher leptin.

Age was also a strong predictor of late (b = 0.18, P < .001) and total (b = 0.14, P = .003) glucose AUCs. Leptin was not a significant predictor of glucose disposal rate. To determine whether adiposity confounded this lack of association between leptin and glucose disposal, a separate backward regression analysis was run (data not shown). A significant direct interaction was found between leptin and glucose disposal rates, which was attenuated when the two groups with central and global adiposity remained in the model.

"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study attempted to identify the relationships between adipokines, regional adiposity, and muscle mass and glucose disposal rates in older adults. Evidence was found that individuals with a combination of central and global adiposity were more likely to have delayed glucose disposal rates during an OGTT, suggesting worse glucose tolerance regardless of the presence of low muscle mass than for the reference group. A strong negative association was also found between adiponectin and glucose disposal rates after adjusting for regional adiposity, muscle mass, leptin, age, sex, and physical activity. A recent study found that sarcopenia exacerbated obesity-associated insulin resistance in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey population. 20 Although a strong association between low muscle mass and glucose disposal rates was not found in the current study, the analysis was strengthened by further classifying adiposity into central and global adiposity to examine differences based on regional fat depots.\nThese findings using early, late, and total glucose AUCs revealed that these body composition traits, as defined in the Materials and Methods Section, correlate with glucose disposal across the spectrum, with no predilection for a specific glucose disposal phase. Age is a significant positive predictor of late and total glucose disposal rates after adjusting for body composition and adipokines. This is in agreement with previous findings that showed an age-dependent increase in 2-hour glucose values during OGTT. 21 Physical activity was a significant negative predictor of early glucose AUC but not of late or total glucose AUC.\nLeptin levels were found to be significantly higher in the group with central and global adiposity and low muscle mass after controlling for age (Table 1 ). Although a higher leptin level is expected with obesity, the added insult of low muscle mass appears to contribute to higher circulating leptin levels. This is consistant with two recent studies that reported a correlation with high leptin levels and low muscle mass in healthy elderly people after adjusting for adiposity. 22, 23 A significant inverse relationship between adiponectin and glucose disposal rates was found after controlling for age, sex, leptin, muscle mass, physical activity, and adiposity. An unexpected finding was the lack of an association between leptin levels and glucose disposal rates after controlling for the same covariates, which suggests that leptin may depend on a combination of factors in its relationship with glucose disposal. A previous study found that insulin sensitivity measured in euglycemic clamp studies strongly correlated with fasting adiponectin and leptin, but only adiponectin remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and waist circumference. 24 There are clinical implications from these findings. It was possible to identify a sizable number of elderly participants who did not necessarily have both central and global adiposity. Forty-four of the 272 participants (16.2%) were categorized as having only central adiposity, and 37 (13.6%) were categorized as having only global adiposity. Previous studies have shown that visceral fat is more predictive of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus 25 and cardiovascular disease. 26 Participants with a combination of central and global adiposity had significantly slower glucose disposal than lean individuals. Therefore, by using a single measure of BMI or waist circumference, there is a possibility of ignoring risks associated with specific regional fat distributions. Thus, in elderly adults, a comprehensive assessment may require the use of more than one measurement to determine regional adiposity and stratify metabolic risk.\nThis study has limitations. First, it might have been underpowered to examine the contributions of the groups with central or global adiposity alone because of the small sample size. Second, a single slice of CT mid-thigh image might not be representative of the muscle mass of the whole body. Similarly, the use of waist circumference as a measure of central adiposity can be questioned because of its inability to differentiate subcutaneous from visceral fat. In addition, the OGTT is used as a measure of glucose Body composition group coefficients are in comparison with the lean and normal muscle mass group. Glucose area under the curve (AUC) variables, leptin, and adiponectin were log transformed for analyses. b = standardized coefficient.\ndisposal without taking into account insulin levels, so no inference regarding insulin resistance can be made. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow for assessment of cause-and-effect relationships.\nIn conclusion, the study results indicated that elderly adults with a combination of central and global adiposity were more likely to have worse glucose tolerance, and the presence of low muscle mass did not profoundly magnify this relationship. With the projected increases in lifespan and incidence of obesity in older adults, it may help to identify measures aimed at quantifying specific regional adiposity patterns as potential risk factors of age-related glucose impairment."}]
