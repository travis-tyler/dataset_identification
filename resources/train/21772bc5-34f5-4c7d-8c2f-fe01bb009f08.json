Since x and q are both time-dependent parameters, exact integration of the above mentioned differential equations are difficult. Therefore, Odagaki divided the infection period into the four stages, first stage of the initial rise of the infection, the second stage of the rapid increase period, the third stage of the plateau with the maximum value, and the fourth stage of the convergence.

Then Odagaki analyzed the social distancing ratio and the isolation rate separately for 4 stages.\nIn this analysis, the same approximation method was adopted except Odagaki's classification of the 4 stages which was replaced with a day-to-day basis..

This procedure was carried out not in the 4 stages of Odagaki but in each day during the period, which leads to the dynamic capturing of variation of infection process.\nIn each of four groups of S, I, Q, and R, the degree of influence on infection spread may differ due to depopulation, regional differences such as age composition, and differences in countermeasures, even though, only the average behavior in each country was considered similarly with Odagaki's method.\nBoth the social distancing ratio x and the isolation rate q in eq.

In addition, the number of new cases was converted to per million population for comparison by country.\nIn the calculation of daily \u03bb value, the range of days for regression, 2\u0394 + 1 was varied from 7 days up to 31 days with varying \u0394 as of 3, 9, 15. The period of\u03bb analysis was from the day when the cumulative number of new cases exceeds 10 persons, to the day when the number of new cases reaches the minimum after peak.\nThe following seven countries with different countermeasures were chosen for the analysis.\nJapan with the social distancing policy, Taiwan and South Korea that quickly settled due to swift response, Sweden for mass infection, Italy, Germany and the United States suffering from explosive mass outbreak. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 7, 2020.

Hereafter, results for the range of \u03bb calculation at 19 days with moderate leveling effect is discussed and the effect of the range will be discussed later.\nCharacteristic variation of social distancing ratio x and isolation rate q for each country The variation in both of q and x for Japan are described in Figure 4 as an example.

In this way, the isolation rate q and the social distancing ratio x follow a complicated locus on the q-x plane corresponding to the variation in the daily \u03bb value after the start of infection. Figure 5 shows the q-x loci of 7 countries. In the figure, the day points for the peak are indicated by dots.\nKeeping in mind the common locus starting from on the q-axis as revealed in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 clearly shows the differences in q-x relationships between countries. In contrast to Japan and Taiwan, where the variation in isolation rates is small, the magnitude of the variation in isolation rates in Germany, Korea and the United States is noteworthy. In the cases of Sweden and Italy, \u03bbmax was reached on the first day of infection (Fig. 2b) , is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 7, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.04.20167882 doi: medRxiv preprint so their locus started from origin on the q-x plane. There is also a large difference in the straight line up to the right during the spread of infection to the convergence period. In Japan and Taiwan, the isolation rate remains low and the social distancing ratio increases, meanwhile in Germany and Korea the isolation rate increases significantly and the social distancing ratio also increases. The Since the calculated isolation rate and social distancing ratio are strongly influenced by the degree of variation in daily \u03bb values, care should be taken in setting the regression range of daily \u03bb values.\nTaking Japan as an example, Figure 6 shows the relationship between daily \u03bb value and the isolation rate and social distancing ratio when the regression range of daily \u03bb values is changed from 7 to 19 and 31 days. As the regression range expands, the fluctuation in daily \u03bb value becomes smaller, and the position of \u03bbmax shifts almost to the first day of infection (Fig. 6a) . The proximity of \u03bbmax day to the first day of infection means that the q-x locus curve starts near the origin, and this behavior is similar to those of Sweden and Italy, as described above. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 7, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.04.20167882 doi: medRxiv preprint Importance of the specific value \u03b2N for each country\nThe above analysis reveals that the magnitude of \u03bbmax affects the varying degree in q and x through the magnitude of the variation in the left-hand side of eq. (5). This suggests that the effect of the transmission coefficient \u03b2N (=\u03bbmax + \u03b3), which is specific value for each country, on the variable width of q and x, and thus on the degree of influence of the countermeasure differs. In Japan and Taiwan, where \u03bbmax (\u03b2N) is small, the spread of infection is slow, while in other countries where \u03bbmax (\u03b2N) is large, the spread of infection is rapid.\nIn order to examine the effect of \u03b2N on the spread of infection, the relationship between \u03bbmax and total cases for the other many countries was examined. The latter were determined at the convergence day, which is more than 1 week before the last day of the database. The relationship of both is shown in Figure 7a . The calculation of both parameters were performed for about 100 countries with more than 400 new cases or more than 1 million populations among all 211 countries/regions in the database. Although there is a large variation, the lower \u03bbmax, the lower the upper limit of the total cases. This means that even at the same \u03bbmax the total cases fluctuate widely, is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted August 7, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.04.20167882 doi: medRxiv preprint and the range of fluctuation increases with \u03bbmax. In fact, data for the seven countries were denoted in red in Fig. 7 , the total cases in five countries with \u03bbmax > 0. 3 "}, {"section_title": "increases from the smallest in South", "text": "Korea to the smaller in Germany, then Italy, Sweden, and the U.S., in the order in which the total cases increase according to the so-called national measures. The countries with lower total cases at fixed \u03bbmax, are considered to have taken effective measures within the range of \u03bbmax, that is, q and x, which are allowed by the specific value \u03b2N (\u03bbmax), and as a result, the total cases is considered to have been controlled at a low level.\nIn Fig. 7b , which is organized by \u03bbmin instead of \u03bbmax, the lower \u03bbmin (the larger the negative value), the lower the upper limit of the total cases. In other words, lower \u03bbmax and lower \u03bbmin are effective in reducing infection, which corresponds to the self-evident fact that the increasing rate of infection must be lower (low \u03bbmax) and the decreasing rate must be higher (low \u03bbmin).\nThrough the above examination on the relationship between the transmission coefficient \u03b2N and the total cases, the importance of the former was confirmed. As described in previous section, the transmission coefficient \u03b2N was closely related with \u03bbmax as a specific value for each country, which was assumed to be constant throughout the infection period. Although detailed examination of this coefficients is beyond the scope of this study, it can actually be interpreted as specific values that represent the unique characteristics of each country and society, including such as the lifestyle of interpersonal activities, and further research is needed."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "For the purpose of verifying the validity of the newly proposed SIQR model, in which the exponent \u03bb of the exponential function expressing the number of newly tested positive persons was defined as an linear equation explicitly with three important parameters, transmission coefficient, social distancing ratio x and isolation rate q, the trend of the number of isolated persons in publicly available database for COVID-19 epidemic were analyzed.
