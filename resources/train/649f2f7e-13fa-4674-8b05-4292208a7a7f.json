TAB presents findings about children's biological fathers from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative study of young children, their families, and their early care and education environments. The ECLS-B is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), in collaboration with several agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NCES and the other sponsors of the ECLS-B recognize the need to better understand the role that fathers play in promoting their children's health and education, and view the ECLS-B as an important tool to examine specific roles fathers play in children's development and well-being. The ECLS-B is one of the first nationally representative studies of children in the United States to collect information directly from fathers. Fathers are increasingly recognized as having an important influence on children's development (Marsiglio et al. 2000;Pleck 1997;Lamb 1997). Studies suggest that fathers interact differently with their young children when compared to mothers and such differences may have implications for children's development (Yogman 1982). Limited data exist, however, about what fathers think about being fathers and the types of activities they engage in with their children. In the ECLS-B, children's resident and nonresident fathers completed short self-administered questionnaires responding to questions about themselves, their attitudes about fatherhood, and their involvement with their children. The purpose of this E.D. TAB is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of selected descriptive information. The E.D. TAB is purely descriptive in nature. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based solely on the bivariate results presented in this E.D. TAB. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored here. The variables examined here are also just a few of the variables that can be examined in these data and were selected to demonstrate the range of information that helped shape the design and now is available from the study. The selected findings are examples of statements that can be made using the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. Release of this E.D. TAB is intended to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data, using more sophisticated statistical methods."}, {"section_title": "The ECLS-B and the Father Component", "text": "The ECLS-B is a longitudinal study designed to collect information on the early learning experiences of America's children born in 2001 and their families from birth to kindergarten entry. The sample of children for this study was selected from birth certificates through agreements with states. The 9-month data collection took place from fall 2001 through fall 2002 (when children born in January through December 2001 turned 9 months of age). Data were collected by computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) and self-administered questionnaires with parents/guardians (99 percent of whom were the biological mother) and direct child assessments during an in-person home visit. During the 9-month data collection, there were 10,688 primary caregiver interviews and 10,221 children who were directly assessed. Field staff observed children's behavior and home setting during the home visit. 1 The response rate for the 9-month data collection was 74.1 percent, based on weighted data, using the parent weight (W1R0). Resident biological fathers were identified during the parent interview. Resident fathers were defined as the spouse/partner of the parent respondent who lived in the child's household (99 percent of resident fathers were the biological father). Resident fathers were asked to complete a 20-minute self-administered questionnaire that included items that capture many dimensions of father involvement, including the types and frequency of activities that resident fathers engaged in with their children, their attitudes about their role as fathers, and selected questions about their attitudes toward fathering, as well their education and employment status. Biological fathers were asked whether the pregnancy resulting in the child was wanted at the time the mother became pregnant and about their involvement during the mother's pregnancy and delivery. During the 9-month data collection, data were collected from 6,321 resident fathers, of whom 6,270 completed the resident father self-administered questionnaire and 51 completed the main parent interview. In addition to the larger set of questions within the parent interview, the resident fathers who responded to the main parent interview were asked questions identical to those contained in the father self-administered questionnaire. The response rate for resident fathers, conditioned on the identification of a spouse or partner by the parent respondent, was 76.1 percent based on weighted data using the father weight (W1F0). 2 See appendix A for additional information about resident father response rates."}, {"section_title": "Focus of This E.D.

All resident biological fathers who responded to the parent survey or the resident father survey were included in these analyses (n = 6,188). The person identified as the resident father was typically the biological father of the study child (99 percent). There were circumstances, however, when the biological father was not the person who completed the resident father questionnaire. The types of respondents to the resident father questionnaire included biological fathers, adoptive fathers, foster fathers, stepfathers, boyfriends of the child's mother, or, in some cases, a same-sex partner of the mother. If the study child's grandmother completed the parent interview, the child's grandfather may have been asked to complete the questionnaire; if the child's aunt completed the parent interview, her spouse or partner was asked to complete the questionnaire. Such cases are not included in this report unless otherwise noted in a particular table. 7 Nonresident fathers. In cases where the child's biological father did not reside with the child, information was gathered from the biological mother about the biological father. A nonresident biological father may have been asked to complete a 10-minute nonresident father questionnaire. Whether he was asked depended on whether the biological mother was the respondent to the parent interview, the father's frequency of contact with the child or the birth mother, and whether the mother granted permission to contact the father. To be eligible for the questionnaire, the father must have (1) seen the child at least once in the last month; (2) seen the child at least 7 days in the last 3 months; or (3) been in touch with the child's birth mother at least once a month in the 3 months preceding the parent interview. The screening criteria were used for nonresident fathers in order to obtain reliable information on caregiving and involvement activities from nonresident fathers.

The response rate for the 9-month data collection was 74.1 percent, weighted for differences in the probability of selection between certain kinds of children and differential nonresponse across different kinds of children. The response rate is the number of completed parent interviews divided by the total eligible sample. To be considered complete, the first three sections of the parent interview had to be completed. These sections pertained to the introduction (Introduction-IN), information on the family structure in the child's household (Family Structure-FS), and basic information about the child's health and development (Child Development-CD). The response rate for the 9-month resident father questionnaire was 76.1 percent. This response rate is the number of completed resident father questionnaires received divided by the number of eligible resident fathers. The overall response rate for resident fathers, conditioned on the completion of the parent interview was 56.4 percent (76.1 percent times the parent response rate of 74.1 percent). The response rate for the 9-month nonresident father questionnaire (conditioned on the completion of the parent interview and based on (1) the identification of the biological father by the mother in the parent interview, (2) her consent to his participation in the study, and (3) the father meeting the criteria for frequency and recency of contacts with either mother or child outlined above) was 50 percent. It is the number of completed nonresident father questionnaires received divided by the number of eligible nonresident fathers. The overall response rate for nonresident fathers, conditioned on both the completion of the parent interview and the meeting eligibility requirements to receive the nonresident father questionnaire, was 37.1 percent (50.0 percent times the parent response rate of 74.1 percent). These response rates are too low to have confidence in reporting out the nonresident father data. 9 A nonresponse bias analysis which included data from the father component was conducted (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) Methodology Report for the 9-Month Data Collection (2001)(2002) Volume 2: Sampling (NCES 2005-147)). The evaluation consisted of the following elements: \u2022 Evaluation of response rates; \u2022 Comparison of frame data between respondents and nonrespondents to the parent component; \u2022 Evaluation of the effect of weighting nonresponse adjustments by comparing sample characteristics at different stages of weighting to the sampling frame; \u2022 Comparison of ECLS-B data with other surveys; and \u2022 Evaluation of the impact of substitution on nonresponse bias. The analysis benefited from the detailed information available on the frame. The birth record contains a number of important variables on the mother and the child that support many comparisons between respondents and nonrespondents. In accordance with National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) statistical standards, item response rates were examined for key variables from the parent questionnaire, child assessment, and resident and nonresident father questionnaires with unweighted item responses rates less than 85 percent. Response rates were computed excluding cases where the item was not applicable to the respondent. According to this item level response rate analysis, no variables used in this E.D. TAB were identified as having an item level response rate less than 85 percent."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Estimates produced using data from the ECLS-B are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. Nonsampling Errors. Nonsampling error is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations, as well as data collection, processing, and reporting procedures. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems like unit and item nonresponse, differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of the questions, response differences related to the particular time the survey was conducted, and mistakes in data preparation. In general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. In the ECLS-B, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them where possible. Another potential source of nonsampling error is respondent bias that occurs when respondents systematically misreport (intentionally or unintentionally) information in a study. One potential source of 9 For more information on the response rates for nonresident fathers see: National Center for Education Statistics. (2005). Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) Methodology Report for the 9-month Data Collection (2001)(2002) Volume 2: Sampling (NCES 2005-147). Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics. A-4 respondent bias in this survey is social desirability bias. An associated error occurs when respondents give unduly positive assessments about those close to them. For example, parents may give higher assessments of their children's motor accomplishments (like feeding themselves) than might be obtained from direct assessment. Readers should be aware that respondent bias may be present in this survey as in any survey. It is not possible to state precisely how such bias may affect the results. NCES has tried to minimize some of these biases by asking some of the same questions about the sampled child of both the mother and father (e.g., activities the father engages in with the child). Sampling Errors and Weighting. The sample of children born in the United States during 2001 was just one of many possible samples of 2001 births that could have been selected. Therefore, estimates produced from the ECLS-B sample may differ from estimates that would have been produced from other samples. This type of variability is called sampling error because it arises from using a sample of children, rather than including all children born in 2001. The standard error is a measure of variability due to sampling when estimating a statistic. Standard errors for estimates presented in this report were computed using a jackknife replication method. Standard errors can be used as a measure for the precision expected from a particular sample. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is 68 percent. The chance that the difference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that the difference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent. In order to produce national estimates from the ECLS-B data collected during the 9-month data collection, the sample data were weighted. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities at the child level and the weights are adjusted for unit nonresponse. The father weight (W1F0), which is the weight used to produce all estimates found in this report, is the weight that accounts for the child's probability of selection in the sample as well as nonresponse to the parent interview and to the father questionnaires. Separate weights were used to calculate response rate estimates, see chapter 4 of the ECLS-B 9-month Data File User's Manual for details. Weighting adjustments were made to the father weight using data from completed parent interviews, completed father interviews, and information for both respondents and nonrespondents that were available from birth certificate data. A parent interview is considered complete if the first three sections were finished (IN, FS, CD). Father-level completes were defined as cases where either the resident father questionnaire only or the nonresident father questionnaire only, or both component items were complete (i.e., provided one or more item responses in the relevant self-administered questionnaire), as appropriate for the case. The father weight sums to the population of children born in the United States in 2001 with fathers. The approach used to develop weights for the ECLS-B is described in chapter 4 of the ECLS-B 9-month  In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed, because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-B, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected if the sample were a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. \u2022 Resident father thinks holding and cuddling the child is fun.
