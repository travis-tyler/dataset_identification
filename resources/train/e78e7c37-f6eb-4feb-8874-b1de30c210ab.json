[{"section_title": "Perspective", "text": "The kindergarten year is important in establishing competencies critical to children's success and achievement in school. Kindergarten is a time for children to expand their interests and knowledge about the world, and improve their ability to get along with others. It serves as a training ground for learning the role of student, discovering the norms and precepts of school, learning how to get along with new peers and authority figures and mastering necessary academic skills (LeCompte 1980). In addition, research shows that success during this first year may predict later school success (Belsky & MacKinnon 1994;Ramey & Ramey 1992;Reynolds 1991). Successful adjustment to school is important for long-term success in school. Beginning kindergarten is a significant rite of passage from preschool and/or home to the primary grades for both children and their families. Teachers report that 52 percent of kindergartners make the transition to kindergarten without difficulty (Cox 1999). Some of the difficulties children experience while making this transition relate to their ability to follow directions and work independently. The transition to kindergarten can cause a mixture of feelings, including fear, concern, and excitement for both children and their families. Children who are fearful of their new surroundings may withdraw from fully participating in learning activities. What adults consider important about the transition to school differs considerably from what young children consider important. Parents and teachers emphasize the importance of different aspects of social adjustment. Parents place more emphasis on the importance of their children adjusting to other adults, interacting and responding appropriately with nonfamilial adults (Dockett and Perry 1999) while teachers stress following directions (Cox 1999). On the other hand, children place great importance on making friends and having friends at school (Dockett and Perry 1999)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Germino Hausken and Rathbun AdjusMlent to kindergarten: Child, family, and kindergarten program factors There is a paucity of information on how children make the transition to kindergarten (Pianta, Rimm-Kaufmann, and Cox 1999). To fully understand how well children adjust to kindergarten, information about the prevalence of behaviors that suggest avoidance or distress toward school is necessary. This paper examines whether certain child, family well-being and kindergarten characteristics increase the odds of children displaying early adjustment problems (i.e., child behaviors that suggest avoidance or distress toward school) in kindergarten. Knowing and understanding the relationships these characteristics have to early school adjustment can aid parents, teachers, schools, and policy makers in developing programs and providing resources to increase the potential for more positive first school experiences. This research examines differences in parental reports of children's adjustment behaviors for a large, nationally representative sample of beginning public school kindergartners. First, the research describes the prevalence of children exhibiting three types of negative behaviors. Next, bivariate relationships between the adjustment behaviors and a select set of child, family, and kindergarten program and school characteristics are examined. Finally, logistic regression analyses are used to further explore each of the adjustment behaviors and its relationship to these. Specifically, this research examines the following two questions: What is the prevalence of thme types of parent reported adjustment problems of firsttime public school kindergartners? Do some groups of children experience these three types of parent reported adjustment problems more than others? 4 children enrolled in about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year were chosen to participate in the study. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with parents of the sampled children in the fall of 1998 and spring of 1999. In addition, school administrators and kindergarten teachers of the sampled children were asked to complete a set of self-administrated questionnaires describing information about themselves, their students, and their classrooms in the fall of 1998 and the spring of 1999. The data used in this paper come from these three sets of respondents. The analyses in this paper use the subset of 13,602 children who were first-time kindergartners, who attended public school kindergartens that offered full-day and/or part-day programs, and whose parents completed an interview in the fall of 1998 (table   1). When appropriately weighted, the sample is representative of 3,147,000 children enrolled in public school kindergartens for the first time in the fall of 1998. All differences described in this paper are significant at the .05 level of probability, with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons. This paper examines the link between several child, family, and kindergarten program factors and children's early adjustment to kindergarten.

For the purpose of this paper, options 1 and 2 were collapsed to indicate 'Yes', that the child had exhibited behaviors at some point in the first two months of school that are indicators of a child having difficulty making the transition to school. Child factors. The frequency of negative adjustment behaviors was examined in terms of children's sex, racial/ethnic background, age at entry to kindergarten, disability status, and whether the child attended center-based care before kindergarten. Family factors. In addition to child characteristics, negative adjustment behaviors were examined in relation to family type (two-parent household vs. other household composition), primary home language, mother's highest education level, and family socioeconomic status2. Kindergarten classroom factors. School poverty level3(less than 50 percent subsidized meal eligible vs. 50 percent or higher subsidized meal eligible), kindergarten program type (part-day vs. full-day), and kindergarten class size were also examined in relation to negative adjustment. 2 The family socioeconomic status variable used in this paper is a composite variable from the ECLS-K-Base Year Public-Use Data File. The composite is derived from the following variables: mother/female guardian's education level, father/male guardian's education level, mother/female guardian's occupation, and household income. For more information on the composite, please see Chapter 7 of the NCES User's Manual for the ECLS-K Base Year Public-Use Data file and Electronic Codebook (NCES 2001-029, revised). 3 Children were identified as attending a high poverty school if the percent of free or reduced lunch-eligible students in the school was 50 percent or more. If data on the percent of free/reduced lunch-eligible students was missing, data on the school's receipt of school-wide Title I assistance was used to determine school poverty level. Schools receMng school-wide Title I assistance were also designated as high poverty schools.  Parents reported that the majority of first-time public school kindergartners (72 percent) did not show signs of having difficulty adjusting to school during the first two months of the school year. A minority of the first-time public school kindergartners, 13 percent was reported to demonstrate one adjustment difficulty and 15 percent exhibited two or more adjustment difficulties. Among those children who presented some difficulty, parents reported that 21 percent of the children had complained about school, 18 percent were upset or reluctant to go to school, and 8 percent pretended to be sick to stay home from school. All of these behaviors may be signs of early/transition adjustment difficulties (figure 1).  Child pretended to be sick to stay home from school.More children from the lowest socioeconomic status quintile pretended to be sick to stay home from school than children in the three highest SES quintiles (11 vs. 7 percent), and more children in the second lowest SES quintile pretended to be sick than children in the two highest SES quintiles (9 vs. 7 percent). Also, 13 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native children pretended to be sick to stay home from school, compared with 7 percent of White, non-Hispanic children. More children whose mothers had not graduated from high school pretended to be sick to stay home from school than children whose mothers had higher than a high school diploma/GED (11 percent with less than a HS diploma/GED vs. 9 percent with a HS diploma/GED vs. 7 percent with more than a HS diploma/GED). In addition, more children attending higher poverty schools (9 vs. 7 percent) and those in full-day kindergartens (9 vs. 7 percent) pretended to be sick to stay home from school than other kindergartners. Although bivariate analyses showed several characteristics of children and program characteristics that were related to behaviors that may be associated to early school adjustment, such characteristics often occur together. For instance, primary home language is correlated with racial/ethnic background. In oder to take this into account, logistic regression analyses were run and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for each adjustment behavior to determine which child, family and kindergarten program characteristics were significantly related to negative adjustment, after controlling for the effects of the other characteristics in the model. A series of logistic regression models were run to identify the child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics that were significant predictors of children's adjustment behaviors. For each adjustment behavior, an initial logistic regression model was run, including all variables examined in the bivariate analyses. Following the initial logistic regression model, backward stepwise regression procedures were used to remove the least significant variables from the model. In general, the multivariate findings were similar to those in the bivariate analyses. Tables 3 through 5 provide the results for the final logistic regression models, which only included significant predictors of each adjustment behavior."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "The multivariate analyses show the likelihood that kindergartners demonstrating adjustment behaviors in the first few months of school was associated with the following characteristics: Child complained about school (table 3). In terms of the adjusted odds ratios6, boys were 13 percent more likely than girls to complain about school. White children were 30 percent more likely than Black children, 16 percent more likely than Hispanic children and 41 percent more likely than Asian/Pacific Islander children to complain about school. Children who attended center-based care before kindergarten were 15 percent more likely to complain than those who did not and kindergartners in full-day programs were 31 percent more likely to complain than those in part-day programs. Children in the largest classrooms (25 or more children) were 24 percent more likely to complain about school than those in the smallest classrooms (less than 17 children). Child was upset or reluctant about going to school (table 4). Boys were 24 percent more likely to be upset or reluctant to go to school than were girls, and children less than five years old were 31 to 39 percent more likely to be upset than children who were 5 % years or older. Children with disabilities were 19 percent more likely to be upset or reluctant to go to school than those without disabilities, and children from the lowest SES quintile were 20 percent more likely to exhibit such behavior than were children in the highest SES quintile. White children were 19 percent more likely to be upset or reluctant than Black children, and American Indian/Alaskan Native children were 51 percent more likely to be upset or reluctant than White. Also, full-day kindergartners were 30 percent more likely than part-day kindergartners to be upset or reluctant about school. Child pretended to be sick to stay home from school (table 5).Children from the lowest SES quintile were 58 percent more likely and those in the second lowest quintile were 34 percent more likely to pretend to be sick to stay home from school than were children in the highest SES quintile. Also full-day kindergartners were 28 percent more likely to pretend to be sick than part-day kindergartners. _I 0 full-day programs, and those in classrooms with 25 or more children were more likely to demonstrate adjustment problems even after controlling for other child (e.g., race/ethnicity, attendance in center-based programs prior to kindergarten) and family (e.g., socioeconomic status) characteristic differences. This study has limitations. It only provides a snapshot of a very small set of behaviors reported by parents during the early months of kindergarten. It does not examine how these behaviors are associated with the children's social and emotional development or cognitive development at the end of kindergarten, or whether these behaviors are temporary or early signs of larger problems. Data from the ECLS-K, a longitudinal study, can be further analyzed to study these relationships at the end of kindergarten, first grade, and beyond. In addition, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), the sister study of the ECLS-K can be used to examine the relationship of these behaviors with children's experiences before making the transition to kindergarten. Despite these limitations, the findings in this paper suggest that some groups of children will have more difficulties making the transition to school than others. Some of the factors that relate to greater difficulties are associated with children's maturity, while others pertain to their living situation and to the kindergarten programs they attend. Information about the problems children may experience early in the school year and the relationships of these problems with child, family, and school/classroom characteristics may be useful to parents as they make decisions about their own children's schooling and to school officials and others as they design kindergarten programs. category.     21 20 Table 5.Adjusted odds ratios and logistic regression model for first-time public school kindergartners who pretended to be sick to stay home from school during the first two months of the school year, by child, family, and school characteristics: Fall 1998 "}, {"section_title": "12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DaieCD2", "text": "In order to disseminate as widely as possible timely and significant materials of interest to the educational community, documents announced in the monthly abstract journal of the ERIC system, Resources in Education (RIE), are usually made available to users in microfiche, reproduced paper copy, and electronic media, and sold through the ERIC Document Reproduction Service (EDRS).
