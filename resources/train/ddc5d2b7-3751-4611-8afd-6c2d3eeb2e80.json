The number of imperiled species is increasing and the acreage of degraded natural systems continues to rise. During the past twenty years the National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) has been working to provide data and analyses to help guide proactive conservation and management. Based on the assumption that the most effective time to manage for a species is before it becomes imperiled, GAP has been working with partners to develop a framework for conservation of all vertebrate species and the natural systems upon which they depend. My goal in this dissertation was to explore in depth the methods and analyses that can be employed to monitor natural systems and habitats through time. Specifically, I wanted to test the current approaches for land cover mapping and change detection and to use the results of that work in a conservation assessment that could be used by a variety of natural resource management agencies. Chapter one represents a review of the current literature with respect to vegetation mapping in the United States. It details a variety of approaches that are being used and includes a discussion of the national classification systems (National Vegetation Classification System, Ecological Systems Classification) currently in use. Chapter two details the mapping of vegetation of the Onslow Bight of NC. I used Landsat TM satellite imagery and a combination of ancillary datasets to map the Ecological Systems of the area. The change detection described in Chapter three allowed the creation of a two date time series (1992 and 2001) for the Ecological Systems of Onslow Bight. In chapter four I integrated the results of the land cover mapping and the change detection with datasets from the Gap Analysis Program in a conservation assessment. In that assessment we focused on two natural resource agencies, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (WRC) and Partners in Flight (PIF), to test the approach to conservation assessment and monitoring. That assessment involved the mapping of predicted vertebrate distributions for 139 species. We used lists of priority species from the two groups, the WRC State Wildlife Action Plan (123 species) and the PIF's list of priority avian species (38 species with 18 unique to this list) for the Southeastern Coastal Plain Bird Conservation Region. In chapter four I also summarized the changes in the extent of the Ecological Systems of the Onslow Bight, as well as the predicted distributions for the 123 species for 1992 and 2001. Finally, we compared the areas predicted by the models to be rich in priority species against the existing conservation network and a series of newly acquired easements and determined the level of overlap. This comparison formed the basis for creating \"scorecards\" characterizing the gains and losses for both Ecological Systems and the predicted distributions of priority species both within and outside the conservation network. The scorecards are proposed as an approach to objectively quantifying the conservation status for natural resource agency priorities. The priority species richness maps are proposed as an objective basis for assessing offered acquisition projects and for proactively identifying conservation actions for an area. between national mapping programs has greatly increased the efficiency of land cover mapping in the U.S. Finally, methods for large area mapping (e.g., image stratification, decision tree modeling, and pattern recognition) are providing a solid foundation for mapping the vegetation of the country. In this review we discuss the evolution of vegetation mapping methods during the past decade, describe some of the national programs involved in vegetation mapping, and provide an overview of the current status of vegetation classification systems in the U.S."}, {"section_title": "In a Nutshell", "text": "\u2022 The ability to map vegetation over large areas is the basis for effective land management and conservation. \u2022 The feasibility of vegetation mapping over large areas is rapidly accelerating."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 The National Vegetation Classification System and Ecological Systems", "text": "Classification are evolving to provide a much-needed framework for vegetation mapping in the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Vegetation mapping has undergone a considerable change in the last decade. In particular, integrating the perspective gained from space has made vegetation mapping of large areas possible. Changes in how government programs acquire and distribute remotely sensed data, and advances in computing power and mapping techniques, are removing some of the previously existing barriers to mapping large extents. The application of geographic information systems (GIS) science has also rapidly expanded, with agencies incorporating spatial data into their programs, and universities increasing opportunities for training. As a result, researchers and land managers are increasingly reliant on spatial data for inventory, management, and planning. Today, vegetation mapping is done from local to global scales, and those maps inform studies on global climate change (Freidl et al. 2003), deforestation (Skole and Tucker 1993), desertification (Hanan et al. 1991), habitat management (Scott et al. 1993 and wildfire planning (Falkowski et al. 2005) ( Figure   1.1). Recent innovations in data availability and mapping methodology have allowed the development of a global land cover map (Belward et al. 1999), a standard protocol for rapidly mapping general land cover of the U.S. (Homer et al. 2004), detailed large scale vegetation maps for some National Parks and Wildlife Refuges (Welch et al. 2002), vegetation maps for large regions , and land cover change maps for the coastal regions (NOAA CCAP 2006). Table 1.1 provides a summary of programs currently involved in national mapping efforts in the U.S. Just as important as the advances in mapping techniques, the standard vegetation classification systems that have been developed over the last decade are vastly improving the utility of the maps being developed. The National Vegetation Classification System (NVC; Grossman et al. 1998) was the first attempt at a nationally consistent system for all terrestrial vegetation. That classification and the Ecological Systems Classification  are the most broadly applied classification systems in vegetation mapping in the United States today. The goal of this review is to summarize the recent developments in mapping techniques and vegetation classification specific to current mapping programs in the United States and to discuss some of the common tradeoffs (e.g., among extent, spatial resolution, and thematic resolution) to be considered when planning or evaluating a mapping project. In this review we are aiming for two general audiences, the ecologist considering a vegetation mapping project, and land managers who need to evaluate the land cover and vegetation maps they encounter in the course of their careers."}, {"section_title": "Target Map Classes", "text": "The first step in a successful mapping project is the identification of the target map classes. The intended use of the final map and the limitations of the data being used to create it will determine and constrain the number and definition of these classes.\nWe adopted the NatureServe Ecological Systems Classification  as our target map legend. The goal for the Southeast Regional GAP is a regionally consistent land cover map and this classification was designed as an ecologically meaningful classification that could be mapped using mid-scale remotely sensed data.  . In that effort, the U.S. was divided into a series of mapping zones and each zone was mapped independently. The zones were delineated based on five criteria -size, physiography, land cover patterns, spectral patterns, and natural breaks in land cover that would facilitate edge matching of the map zones . This delineation method overcomes some of the issues of heterogeneity often encountered when the study area is defined using political (e.g., state) boundaries. For Ecological Systems level mapping, even these zones can be relatively heterogeneous. For example, the mosaic for mapping zone 58 (Atlantic Coastal Plain of North and South Carolina) includes a variety of vegetation types from maritime forests to Sandhills longleaf pine woodlands. We dealt with that variability by further dividing the study area into subzones. Preprocessing at EDC included identification of three target image dates using multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; to guide the selection of the imagery for three seasons (leaf on, leaf off and spring). Once the range of target dates was identified, the analysts created seasonal mosaics. In cases where the images from the target dates were of poor quality, imagery from the same season in an alternate year was selected. Portions of 14 Landsat TM images were used to create the image mosaics for Zone 58, with dates ranging from September 1999 to as late as June 2002 (Table 2.2). For each of the seasonal mosaics both the 6 reflectance bands and a three-band (brightness, wetness, and greenness) tasseled cap transformed images were used. This was the case in both the NLCD 2001 mapping effort for this zone, as well as for this study (Huang et al. 2002). For a complete discussion of the preprocessing steps taken at EDC see  Land Cover, Impervious Surface, and Canopy Closure  Table 2.3). We used the NLCD 2001 land cover both as an input layer for mapping some of the Ecological Systems, as well as for masking the anthropogenic types. Canopy closure was used as an input into modeling of managed evergreen cover as well as in the decision tree modeling for several of the Ecological Systems."}, {"section_title": "A priori vs. derived map classes", "text": "There are two general methods for determining the vegetation classes: selecting from an a priori classification scheme or deriving the classes from a study area-specific dataset. In many maps, photo-interpretation is used for gathering data to train image classification or for directly mapping land cover. In those cases, the legend is determined by the ability to distinguish the target classes consistently in the photography. In this case, the photo-interpretation key represents the a priori classification scheme. Other examples of a priori classification systems are the detailed vegetation classification systems (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968, Schafale and Weakley 1990) for areas where plant community ecologists have focused their work. Classification systems vary depending on their geographic extent and the resourcespecific objectives of the classification. It was not until 1998 that the U.S. had its first national-level classification of vegetation, the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS; Grossman et al. 1998). Because of the importance of this a priori classification to national programs we discuss recent developments in detail below. An alternative to a priori map classes is the use of detailed plot sampling and quantitative analysis of species composition to derive a classification scheme. The latter most often rely on cluster analysis and ordination techniques to determine the appropriate number and identity of vegetation classes in a study area. Each derived classification is a reflection of the dataset used in its development; as the datasets become richer with continued sampling, the spatial extent and thematic resolution of the derived classifications increase accordingly (Peet and Allard 1993, Reid et al. 1995, Newell et al. 1997, and Simon et al. 2005."}, {"section_title": "National vegetation classification systems", "text": "As the technology for mapping vegetation over large areas matured in the early 1990s, the lack of a standard classification system became increasingly problematic. The NVCS was developed as a hierarchical classification scheme in an attempt to address the need for a classification scheme that was national in scope and thorough (Jennings 1997). It was developed as a hierarchical classification scheme similar in concept to that used in the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization international classification of vegetation (UNESCO 1973). The NVCS hierarchy has 7 levels; in the upper five levels it includes physiognomic, structural, growth-form, phenological, and environmental information (Table 1.2). The lowest two levels incorporate species composition information. Dominant and/or indicator species of the uppermost or dominant layer (e.g., the canopy in a forest) determine the alliance classification, and additional subcanopy and/or ground layer species help define the associations. Currently, the Vegetation Subcommittee of the Federal Geographic Data Committee is drafting a revision of the NVCS standard (ESA Panel on Vegetation Classification 2004). If adopted, that revised standard may alter the structure of the hierarchy, while encouraging collaboration toward the evolution of the detailed content of the NVCS through a peer review process. Since 1998 many programs have attempted to implement mapping of the NVCS at various levels of the hierarchy. The most successful of these has been the National Park Service (NPS) Mapping Program (http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/). NPS has been systematically mapping many of the national parks at the association level, the finest level of the NVCS. The Park Service has been able to achieve a high thematic resolution with extensive field work and manual interpretation of large scale aerial photography (TNC and ESRI 1994). In the mid-1990s the USGS Biological Resources Division's Gap Analysis Program (GAP) selected the Alliance level of the NVCS as the basis for a state-by-state set of target map classes, but reliable (consistent and accurate) representation of these classes could not be achieved. This was due to an incompatibility between the spatial scale of the vegetation types on the ground and the scale of the available imagery and ancillary data. Scaling back to the Formation (the next highest level in the hierarchy) would have meant a loss of important ecological context. In the short-term this led to a shift in the target map legend for the individual state GAP projects (Pearlstine et al. 1998) and a broader call for an ecologically meaningful and \"mappable\" classification system. With support of groups like The Nature Conservancy and the National Gap Analysis Program, NatureServe ecologists were able to build on the extensive research and data of the NVCS to develop the first draft of this new classification, the Ecological Systems of the United States . Each system is intended to represent a group of associations tied together by landscape level ecological processes. It is important to note that this classification is not hierarchical and, while it is informed by the NVCS, it is a parallel system. The only direct link between the two classifications is at the finest level of the NVCS, the association (Figure 1.2). Because ecological processes (flooding, fire, wind) are central to the definition of the Ecological Systems, ancillary data are often necessary for mapping where spectral data alone would be insufficient."}, {"section_title": "Trends in satellite-based mapping", "text": "In their book \"Vegetation Mapping\", Kuchler and Zonneveld (1988) provided the first broad introduction to the field of satellite-based mapping. In 1994, Zhu and Evans published a forest map for the United States based on 1x1km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery, and, in 1997, Friedl and Brodley tested the use of decision tree modeling for satellite based mapping. By the mid-1990's, the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) and GAP state projects were making important advances in large area mapping. Below we present a summary of the traditional methods used in remote sensing and a discussion of recent innovations, including the use of multi-temporal imagery and the integration of ancillary spatial data and remote sensing."}, {"section_title": "Landsat imagery and vegetation mapping", "text": "Currently, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) sensors dominate the field with respect to large area vegetation mapping in the United States. The National Gap Analysis Program, NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP), and the Landfire Project all use Landsat imagery as the base for detailed vegetation mapping for large regions of the U.S. Landsat TM and ETM sensors acquire data for 6 and 7 spectral bands, respectively, at a spatial resolution of 30x30 m. Each of the Landsat sensors acquires data on a 16 day return cycle, although cloud cover and seasonal variability limit the number of those acquired images that might be suitable for mapping. The broad application and reliance on Landsat imagery for vegetation mapping in the U.S. is reflected in the following discussion. For a treatment of the use of Landsat in broader ecological applications see Cohen and Goward (2004)."}, {"section_title": "Manual interpretation vs. automated computer mapping", "text": "The general trend in satellite-based land cover mapping is from manual methods toward an increased reliance on computer assisted and automated mapping methods. Early uses of satellite imagery as the base layer for mapping involved manual delineating and labeling of polygons. For example, the first generation vegetation map for the Washington State GAP project was developed through visual interpretation of Landsat TM imagery and field visits to guide the labeling of polygons (Grue 1997). Similarly, in their assessment of coastal sage scrub, Davis et al. (1994) used Landsat TM to delineate patterns, combined with field reconnaissance, interpretation of aerial photographs, and reference to historic maps in the labeling stage. The success and feasibility of manually delineating patterns in vegetation depend on the skill of the interpreter, the quality of the reference data, and the complexity of the vegetation being mapped. The two traditional automated computer mapping approaches for image classification are unsupervised and supervised classification (Jensen 2004). In an unsupervised classification, each pixel in the image is assigned membership to an image cluster based on the statistical similarity of the pixel to a cluster. Similarity is determined by calculating the mean of all of the pixels currently assigned to a cluster for each band in the imagery. Clustering is an iterative process where pixels are sorted into a predetermined number of bins (clusters) based on the mean of the pixels currently assigned to each cluster. In each iteration, the membership of each pixel is re-evaluated based on the means of the clusters. Labeling of the imagery to generate a map is then done using training data to identify the most likely vegetation type for each cluster. In this case, the clusters represent groupings of the data that must then be interpreted and labeled relative to the map legend. In contrast to an unsupervised method, which requires that data for labeling classes be gathered after the membership of pixels has been assigned, a supervised method utilizes a training dataset, derived in advance and used to train the classification. The goal in developing the training dataset is to select homogeneous training areas that represent the range of variability for each target map class. In the classification stage, each pixel in the study area is compared to the groups of pixels in each area of the training dataset and the pixels are assigned a map class if they are statistically similar to one of the training signatures. With a small study site or a generalized map legend, either a supervised or unsupervised approach is likely to be adequate for mapping vegetation. The accuracy of an unsupervised classification will depend on the target map legend, input imagery, and the analyst's ability to discriminate the land cover classes in the imagery. Supervised classification is most sensitive to the quality of the training data and the algorithm (e.g., maximum likelihood, minimum distance) used to label the land cover classes."}, {"section_title": "Multi-temporal imagery", "text": "As access to imagery and processing power increased, references to the use of multitemporal imagery for mapping became more prevalent in the literature (Egbert et al., 1995;Wolter et al. 1995). A current example of the use of multi-temporal imagery for land cover mapping is the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD 2001;Homer et al. 2004). That database includes the creation of three seasonal image mosaics (spring, leaf on, and leaf off) for each mapping zone in the U.S. . Such mosaics are also being used for the Gap Analysis Program, NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP), and the Landfire Project, as well as in mapping for the NLCD 2001. For each of those efforts, the temporal variation is being used indirectly to assist in refining the land cover classifications and treat each date of imagery as an independent source of information. Other approaches use information from the multi-temporal images directly, either by incorporating information about the change vectors (Lunetta et al. 2001) or by selecting which image(s) to use in classifying specific vegetation types. For example, Townsend (1997) used a hierarchical approach in which coarse vegetation types were mapped and then refined by developing unique combinations of multi-temporal image bands and band ratios for refinement of the detailed wetland classes. Wolter et al. (1995) used a similar hierarchical approach with specific band combinations from various image dates to map forest types in northwestern Wisconsin. Incorporating multi-temporal imagery increased the thematic resolution of maps from both Landsat (Mickelson et al. 1998, Wolter et al. 1995, Slaymaker et al. 1996 and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer imagery (Stoms et al. 1998, Zhu and. Integrating ancillary data and remote sensing Methods for integrating ancillary spatial data and remote sensing can be generally categorized as image stratification (either pre-or post-classification; , Gao et al. 2004; preponderance of evidence decision rules (Sader et al. 1995, Lunetta et al. 2001, Felicisimo et al. 2002; generalized linear modeling (Moisen and Edwards 1999); gradient nearest neighbor (Ohmann and Gregory 2002); or evidential reasoning approaches, including decision tree modeling (Duguay andPeddle 1996, Homer et al. 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Image stratification by ecological region", "text": "In the Utah and Southwest GAP Projects , ecological regions were used to stratify the study area. In each case the assumption was that variability with respect to the target map classes would be lower within regions than among them. Similar logic was used in the development of the mapping zones for the NLCD 2001 . In that effort, the mapping zones were delineated based on five criteria -size, physiography, land cover patterns, spectral patterns, and the placement of the map zone edges that would later need to be mosaicked with adjoining zones. Large area mapping involved mapping across many satellite scenes. If each scene is mapped individually, adequate training data for each land cover class being mapped must be located within each of those scenes. If however, the imagery is mosaicked and then divided based on ecoregion, the mapper may be able to map the same classes with a lower number of training points overall. Another potential advantage is the reduction in edge matching, assuming the ecoregion boundaries do represent transition lines for the classes being mapped. The potential disadvantage is increased spectral variability within a region if the satellite scenes mosaicked to create a region have high variability in phenological or atmospheric conditions (Homer et al. 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Preponderance of evidence decision rules", "text": "Several projects have found they could improve the accuracy of their vegetation mapping by incorporating preponderance of evidence decision rules, also known as weighting criteria. A decision rule can be based on expert knowledge or can be derived from the data. For example, if floodplain forests only occur within 100 meters of a river, a rule can be established that floodplains can only be mapped within that distance. Similarly, if 95% of the training sites for floodplain forest occur within 100 meters of the river, a probability of 95% can be applied to pixels within 100 m of the river and a 5% probability for pixels at greater distances. Incorporating variables such as elevation, terrain type, and proximity to rivers improved the vegetation map for a site in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Joria and Jorgenson 1996). In that study, the application of GIS-based decision rules to an unsupervised classification produced a better vegetation map than either the unsupervised classification alone, or a supervised classification based on the same training data. Similarly, the Utah GAP Project adopted a two-phase mapping approach in order to improve its vegetation map . Summary statistics for the clusters from the unsupervised classification were used to determine weighting criteria used in ancillary modeling within each ecological region of the state.  found that the majority of cover classes (31 of 36) were improved with the use of this ancillary modeling."}, {"section_title": "Generalized linear modeling", "text": "An early example of using generalized linear modeling to integrate satellite imagery and ancillary spatial data for mapping vegetation is the study of Glacier National Park (Brown 1994). Generalized linear modeling, like traditional linear regression, relies on least squares criteria to model the response variable from the predictor variables. In this study, four vegetation types (open canopy forest, closed canopy forest, meadow, and unvegetated) were modeled from insolation potential, snow accumulation potential, and soil moisture potential. Moisen and Edwards (1999) also used generalized linear modeling to integrate topography, spatial coordinates, and spectral data with traditional forest inventory data for northern Utah, and they were able to improve the precision of forest timber volume estimates over methods based on the plot data alone. Ohmann and Gregory (2002) used gradient nearest neighbor to successfully map forest structure and physiognomy for Coastal Oregon. This method translates the results of traditional direct gradient analysis (Gauch 1982) into a spatial framework by assigning map labels based on nearest neighbor imputation. In Ohmann and Gregory (2002), Landsat TM spectral bands and derivatives were first integrated with ownership, topographic, geologic, and climatic data derivatives and then analyzed using canonical correspondence analysis to model forest types. The map was then created by assigning each pixel in the study site to the class of its nearest neighbor (minimum Euclidean distance) in gradient space. While Gradient Nearest Neighbor has been successfully applied to mapping structure and physiognomy, it had not been previously used to map vegetation type. Currently the approach is being tested with respect to mapping Ecological Systems in the Northwestern U.S."}, {"section_title": "Gradient nearest neighbor", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Decision tree modeling", "text": "Decision tree modeling is a supervised classification method that has been broadly applied in the social and medical sciences for decades. It was not until the 1990s that the potential for use in land cover applications became apparent (Michaelson et al. 1994, Duguay andPeddle 1996). Decision trees rely on recursive partitioning of the training dataset to create a hierarchical tree in which a series of nodes represent a binary split of the dataset into branches. The method for splitting the data depends on whether the response variable is categorical (discriminant analysis or logistic regression) or continuous (multiple regression). In keeping with the tree theme, the terminal nodes where the map classes are assigned are called leaves (Figures 1.3a and b). Friedl and Brodley (1997) examined the application of the decision tree process to land cover mapping at three scales (AVHRR at 1 x 1 o ; AVHRR at 1x1 km; and Landsat TM at 30x30 m) and found that, in each case, decision trees performed better than either the linear discriminant functions or the more traditional supervised classification approach (e.g., maximum likelihood classification). The adoption of the decision tree classification as a central component of the NLCD 2001 protocol (Homer et al. 2004) means that the approach is being applied throughout the U.S. for land cover mapping. The database includes three components -general land cover (NLCD 2001), canopy closure, and impervious surface estimations. Regression tree modeling is used to generate the estimates of canopy closure, and impervious surface , Homer et al. 2004 and decision tree modeling is used in the development of the 23-class land cover layer. The first large area mapping effort to incorporate decision tree modeling for mapping vegetation types in the U.S. was the Southwest GAP Project , see Case Study)."}, {"section_title": "Pattern recognition", "text": "An additional innovation in mapping is the use of pattern recognition, in which texture or context information for individual pixels is used in combination with the spectral information to create image objects (Figure 1.4). In their discussion, \"What's the matter with pixels? Some recent developments in interfacing remote sensing and GIS\", Blaschke and Strobl (2001) provide a thoughtful summary of the need to pay attention to pattern in land cover mapping. They proposed location and context as \"new paradigms\" in remote sensing. Some of their concepts can be related back to work by Ryherd and Woodcock (1996), who showed the importance of incorporating texture information into image segmentation. In that study, forests of various canopy densities and mixtures of tree canopy sizes were simulated to test the accuracy of forest pattern delineation with and without texture as an input. In southern Montana, Fisher et al. (2002) tested the application of two pattern recognition approaches to mapping. They were able to map 27 cover classes, using supervised classification based on image objects, with overall accuracies greater than 70%. In the same study they found they were able to map five sagebrush and greasewood species with over 90% accuracy using the same methods. The use of pattern recognition in large area vegetation mapping is limited (Fisher et al. 2002, Chapter 2 and 3 this volume). Current applications tend to involve highly structured land cover or land use classes (e.g., roads, buildings) with an emphasis on high resolution imagery (e.g., IKONOS, digital orthophotography; Elmqvist and Khatir 2007).

The substrate, either peat or clay-based, influences the plant communities they support (Schafale and Weakley 1990). Historically, many of these wetlands have been drained for conversion to agriculture or tree plantations.

These soils maps were developed by generalizing existing soils information. The Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) includes detailed county-level soil series maps developed at a scale of 1:24,000 (NRCS 2007). From the SSURGO data we calculated the average percentage organic matter for each soil series using the official soil descriptions. To account for the contribution of organic matter, we adjusted the percentage of each of the mineral fractions (sand, silt, and clay) by subtracting the percent organic matter from 100 percent to determine a correction factor. We derived the percentage sand, silt, and clays for each soil series by translating the soil texture (loam, sandy loam, clay) based on the soil texture triangle (Soil Survey Staff 1990). The adjustment to include organic matter in the soil texture calculation was then applied to the sand, silt, and clay percentages, making the combination of sand, silt, clay, and organic matter percentage total 100%. For each fraction a single data layer was generated (see below). Correction Factor for Mineral Fractions = 100 -Average % Organic Matter To develop the STATSGO data layers, we used the same process for determining the percentage organic matter and the adjusted percentages for sand, silt, and clay for each soil series. The proportional representation of each soil series in a STATSGO unit was then used to weight the contribution of that series to the larger unit. The compositional representation for soil series in each STATSGO unit is reported in the STATSGO database.

Object boundaries were determined through interactive calculations of homogeneity. In each step the homogeneity of an object after being merged with its neighbor was calculated; if the heterogeneity of the new object exceeds the predetermined threshold level, the objects were not merged. Two indices of homogeneity were used in image segmentation -color vs. shape and smoothness vs. compactness -and they could be weighted by the analyst. In this study we used a color parameter of 0.3 (scaled 0 to 1) and smoothness parameter of 0.5 (scaled 0 to 1). In other words, we weighted spectral homogeneity slightly higher than shape homogeneity and gave equal weighting to smoothness and compactness. The scale parameter determined the size of the objects that can be generated and therefore determined the threshold for the maximum heterogeneity allowed in an object (the higher the scale parameter, the more heterogeneous the objects). In this case we used a scale parameter of 30, which resulted in over 57,000 objects. For a technical discussion of homogeneity calculations for color and shape indices see Zhong et al. (2005). Those objects were used for delineating specific areas of interest, refining boundaries from other datasets so they matched the spectral data, and as input in decision tree modeling. Summary statistics for eight input variables were generated for each object for use in modeling (Table 2.4).\nThe change vector direction and magnitude images were combined to create a four-band image that we used to generate image objects using eCognition Elements 4.0 software (Definiens Imaging 2004). Objects were generated usin re assigned to a single objec subsequent iterations, the characteristics of each object were compared to those of its neighboring objects and if a threshold of similarity is met, the objects were merged (Benz et al. 2004). More specifically, a size threshold (scale) and homogeneity characteristics of the object (shape index and compactness) determined when two neighboring objects are merged. Those objects were used as our analysis unit for detecting change in the non urban areas. The derived image objects represented homogeneous patches w respect to the four bands of data used as input. For change areas, the type of change and the \"from\" and \"to\" categories within an object would be homogeneous as well, as long as the objects being generated were the sam size or smaller than the scale of the land cover changes.

One exception would be the shift from the Atlantic Coastal Plain ( Southern Tidal Wooded Swamp \"to\" or \"from\" ACP Central Salt and Brackish Tidal Marsh. At the same time, many combinations between the anthropogen types and shifts from Ecological Systems into anthropogenic types were likely. For that reason we chose to label change for each land cover class separately. To remove the image objects with little spectral change between 1992 and we used a threshold based on the mean magnitude. We compared the obj represented \"potential\" change areas. In this study, the potential change areas represented a significant proportion of the landscape. In order to characterize the \"true\" change and to label the 1992 land c for those areas, we ran unsupervised classifications for each of the 2001 land cover classes within each of the sub-zones. While this approach meant that many classifications were required, it was necessary in order to capture the level of detail sought. For each unsupervised classification, from 10 to 20 clusters were generated with the pixels from the four-band magnitude and cosine imagery. The fact that we used the cosine imagery in the clustering meant that the inherently contained data on the direction of change between the two dates. For example, for pixels with the same magnitude of change, the direction of chang such as a loss of greenness v each pixel within an image object meant that each pixel within an im within the same cluster in the unsupervised classification. Therefore we were classifying patches of change as opposed to pixels for the non-urban areas. For each cluster, the 1992 imagery, 2001 imagery, and Digital Ortho-Photo Quarter Quads (DOQQs) from 1993 and 1998 were used to identify whether that cluster represented change. For the change clusters, the 1992 land cover classification was assigned if it could be photo-interpreted. For changes from natural vegetation type in 1992 to an anthropogenic type in 2001, the clusters were flagged for mapping with either ancillary data or using the decision tree modeling process described below. Therefore, we had three ways to label the The same thresholds used in the NLCD 2001 process were then applied to map the urb those pixels were identified as change in post-classification ch Areas with less than 20% impervious surface in the 1992 map had to be tr differently.

We generated four hundred assessment points within the change areas based on the proportions of the 1992 land cover classification, with a minimum sample of 3 samples per class. Similarly, a stratified random sampling of the no change was done but with fewer points, in this case 150. For each of the assessment points, we used the 1993 black and white DOQQs and 1998 color-infrared DOQQs as reference.

The object generation was done for the entire study area so the patterns derived from the imagery would be consistent for the entire length of a river or stream. Final editing was done manually to add objects missed by the NHD stream data and to remove objects that were dominated by successional or anthropogenic vegetation types (clearcuts, plantations). Pixels representing non-vegetated types (urban, agriculture, barren) were then removed, leaving only the vegetated pixels within the stream or river corridor. Once the floodplain areas had been mapped, the hydrology data were used to classify the Ecological Systems based on flow accumulation and water type. Using the DEM and NHD data, the flow accumulation for each stream segment was calculated in ArcGIS. In order to \"force\" the modeled flow to follow the NHD stream network, the streams were \"burned\" into the DEM prior to calculating the flow accumulation. More specifically, the elevation for any grid cell that intersected a stream was lowered by 100 meters. A threshold based on the number of grid cells contributing to the flow at each point along the stream network was then used to create three categories of streams: small stream (< 100,000), river (100,000 -1,000,000), and large river (> 1,000,000). Finally, streams and rivers were characterized by water type, blackwater or brownwater. Streams originating in the coastal plain tend to be black water, while those originating in the Piedmont tend to be brownwater, with a higher sediment load (Schafale and Weakley 1990). A blackwater/brownwater classification of streams was done for the entire Coastal Plain, with all streams or rivers originating in the coastal plain being classed as blackwater, and those with origins in the Piedmont being classed as brownwater. In a few cases, sufficient flow contributed from coastal streams overcomes the fact that a river originated in the Piedmont. We used the literature and expert review to reclassify portions of these rivers as blackwater. By intersecting river size with water type, five riverine systems were mapped: issues between the coarse scale ecoregional linework and the imagery were minimized. At the same time, the image objects tied the new line work and boundaries to the base imagery, which was important along the coast, where the shapes of the islands are changing over time. For example, barren land and grassland herbaceous pixels along the outer coast were recoded to the Atlantic Coastal Plain Southern Dune and Maritime Grassland, while inland barren land was mapped as either bare sand, bare soil, or mines (see Inland Barren Classes).

A stratified random sample of 750 points was then generated based on those clusters for photointerpretation. The stratification by clusters was done to ensure even coverage of interpreted points throughout the different images in the mosaic and throughout the range of conditions for evergreen forests. Each of the 750 points was located on 1998 DOQQs and interpreted as managed or natural. In cases where the cover class in the DOQQ was not evergreen or the point was near a boundary with a non-evergreen type, that point was discarded.

In this study it is impossible to tease apart the influence of stratifying the study area directly, but the assessment of the individual classes mapped and the natural vs. managed pine models give an indication of the utility of the approach.

Decision tree modeling -Managed vs. Natural Decision tree modeling was a useful approach for two of our critical mapping steps, discriminating managed vs. natural evergreen, and for modeling the evergreen and nonriverine wetlands. In the managed vs. natural evergreen modeling we found that, by incorporating the x,y coordinates in the decision tree model, the accuracy of the final binary map was improved by removing date band artifacts. While both models performed equally well according to the cross-validation, the distribution and type of the errors warranted the selection of one model (XY) over the other (NOXY). While we have not specifically tested differences in the spatial configuration of the mapped cover classes with and without image objects as a model input, when we examined preliminary models we saw that speckling within the patches of managed or natural stands was reduced.

It is possible that results could be improved using a stepwise modeling approach, perhaps using evergreen types as a single model and nonriverine as its own model. We felt we had segmented the image to such an extent already that running two levels of models would be overly complicated. Also we thought the differences in the types (upland/wetland, evergreen/deciduous) should be distinguishable given the input data. One potential improvement to our process would be to address the commission error of the Other Herbaceous class in the three longleaf pine Ecological Systems. In this effort we did not post-process the Other Herbaceous pixels in order to assign them to an Ecological System as a modifier. The commission error indicates that we should develop an approach to accurately assign herbaceous and shrub pixels to an Ecological System based on context or proximity. Comparing the impact of including a variety of input datasets into the decision tree modeling, removing the SSURGO data had the highest negative impact on Kappa. Interestingly, removing all soils related information (SSURGO and STATSGO) resulted in a higher Kappa value than when either soil layer was used alone. This indicates an interaction between the large scale SSURGO data and the small scale STATSGO data in the modeling. When STATSGO was excluded, the Peatland Pocosin System was less accurately mapped, and, given the extent of that class, its influence on the Kappa statistic was high. Even with the relatively unbalanced set of training data for these systems, the decision tree model did well. While the ideal would be to have a more even distribution of training data, that ideal is often not feasible when mapping land cover. In this study, we had an excellent source of high quality training data for the natural vegetation communities of the Onslow Bight; however, even then the number of points (9) for the high priority ACP Upland Longleaf System was limited, due to the few known occurrences in the study area."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Given the complexity of land cover and vegetation in the Onslow Bight, we chose to take a hierarchical approach to mapping. Pattern recognition allowed us to incorporate some contextual information in our classification steps and was successfully integrated with decision tree modeling for mapping the managed stands of the Coastal Plain. Decision tree modeling was successful for mapping five of the six Ecological Systems, once the areas to be mapped and the number of cover classes were reduced. As we discovered, decision tree modeling did not map all of the target map classes well and the choice of input data greatly influenced the accuracy and spatial patterning of the final map. For this area, the interaction between the county-level and state-level soils data is especially important, and we found it was best to remove both from the model rather than include one or the other, an important finding given the fact that the county-level soils data are not yet available nationally. The map developed using our approach will serve as a good baseline for assessing most of the Ecological Systems and for modeling the predictive distributions for vertebrate species of the Onslow Bight. Some types will require further work, specifically the Atlantic Coastal Plain Upland Longleaf.

Land cover mapping and change detection are one set of tools that provide both the content (spatially explicit land cover) and the context (land cover changes). Our goal was to develop an approach to change detection that could be used with a thematically rich land cover map. We used the 2001 Ecological Systems map developed by the Southeast Gap Analysis Project as our baseline dataset. Our study area was the Onslow Bight in the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain of North Carolina. The method combined Change Vector Analysis (CVA), image segmentation (image objects), and regression tree modeling to back cast to a 1992 era land cover map. The overall accuracy based on marginal frequencies was 95% with a Kappa of 0.78. There was a 21% probability that a point that did not change was misclassified as one that had changed, and a 17% probability that a change was missed. Thirteen percent of the study area was mapped as having changed. Most of the land cover changes were between anthropogenic land cover types, but the approach provided the context necessary to map the changes in the Ecological Systems of the Onslow Bight. Using this approach we were able to accurately map change in a complex landscape and to avoid a common mistake of over-mapping change in the agricultural classes. In future work we hope to find methods for automating portions of the process, specifically: (1) setting the initial change thresholds based on the magnitude of change between image dates; and (2) classifying the class-specific types of change.  Analysis (CVA). In PCA a linear transformation of the data is performed and the derived components represent the major axes of variability in the dataset. In change detection applications, the first PCA axes generally represent the variability across the study area, while the higher order axes tend to represent subtle variations. The goal is to use those higher order components to identify the change areas. For example, Mas (1999) used a Selective Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) in which the bands from two dates of imagery were combi (stacked) to create a single image and the principal components derived for that image. Band 1 of the SPCA image represented the majority of the variation in imagery and therefore explained variability common to the two dates of imagery, while band 2 captured variation between the two dates and was used to identify change areas. In Change Vector Analysis the direction of chang magnitude of the difference between two images are used to classify change (Chen et al. 2003, Hayes and Sader 2001, Johnson and Kasiscke 1998. For t case of a two band image, the vector represents the line that connects a common point on the ground in two-dimensional space (Figure 3.1). The directio line can be used to identify the type of change that has occurred and the length o the line represents the magnitude of the change. For example, in Figure 3.1 line represents a large difference in band 1 and a moderate difference in band For the (n Post classification change detection is most appropriate when the two land cover maps are developed with a common methodology. If that is not the case, differences in approach often overwhelm true differences in land cover (Lunetta 1998, Singh 1989).\nThe National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) has as its mission \"keeping common species common\". In support of that mission the program has conducted and funded research during the past decade with the goal of providing three key datasets used to assess conservation status: detailed land cover, predicted distributions of terrestrial vertebrate species based on application of habitat models, and land stewardship. We explored the use of these datasets in combination with a change detection analysis to assess the conservation status of Ecological Systems and vertebrate species of the Onslow Bight Landscape. We modeled predicted distributions for 141 priority vertebrate species identified in the North Carolina State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) and by Partners in Flight (PIF) as the basis for our conservation assessment. We were specifically interested in three general questions: \u2022 Were there gains or losses in the extent of Ecological Systems and species predicted distributions between 1992 and 2001? \u2022 When translated to a spatial framework, was there agreement on the ground between agency priorities? \u2022 How well did the conservation network do with respect to capturing priority areas? By integrating species models from the two dates, we were able to quantify the gains nd losses of the priority species for the two programs. Using the 2001 version of the redicted distribution models, we mapped richness hotspots for the two agency lists. The h nd areas with at least 13 of the PIF priority species, included nearly one-third (32%) of the landscape. Forty-seven percent of the area did not meet the hotspot criteria for either list and twenty-one percent met the criteria for one agency or the other. When we compared the hotspot maps to the existing conservation lands and new acquisitions, we found that both existing conservation lands and the newly acquired easements were biased toward the hotspots, with 70% of the existing conservation network on lands that met the hotspot criteria for both agencies, and 50% of the new acquisitions doing the Once listed, the cost to maintain a species can be high and long-lasting. As Scott et a (2005) summarized, recovery is best described as a continuum; once endangered, a species may be \"conservation -reliant\", requiring constant intervention. Unfortunately, for many species an accurate understanding of their status is impossible to assess. Wilcove and Master (2005) suggest that the data for 85% of the species (plants, animals, and fungi) in the United States are insufficient to determine their status accurately. Without a complete inventory, conservationists rely on surrogates for biodiversity (e.g., indicator species, keystone species, and species guilds) to identify conservation priorities. ster 005) suggest one alternative favored by many conservation biologists -the use of a n. nty years, the National Gap Analysis Program has been advocating a Scott et al. saw the power of is two dicators of biodiversity (Scott et al. 1993, Scott and.
