It has been documented that clinical symptoms result from the deposition of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau pathology in brain, and A\u03b2 has been observed to mainly aggregate and accumulate in the brain in non-dementia AD until a critical threshold is reached in AD, which exhibits a sigmoidal trajectory characterized by a rapid progression and finally a plateau. A\u03b2 deposition can be measured by cortical amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) ligand binding (1, 2) or low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 (3) (4) (5) .\nATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 7 (ABCA7) has been found to be expressed abundantly in brain microglia, implying a role of ABCA7 in amyloid clearance and fibril *Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).\nAs such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in the analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_ apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf formation (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . ABCA7 loss-of-function (LOF) was reported to contribute to AD by promoting A\u03b2 processing and pathology in cell culture and mouse models (1) . In addition, our group identified that ABCA7 variants were associated with A\u03b2 deposition on amyloid imaging but were not related to A\u03b2 levels in CSF test (6) . Recently, ABCA7 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) length was observed to correlate with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 (5) . Therefore, the relation between ABCA7 polymorphisms and CSF A\u03b2 1-42 was still inconsistent across these studies, and it's necessary to further identify the association, especially in the nondementia AD stage in which A\u03b2 is mostly deposited.\nTo date, ABCA7 rs3764650 has been identified to be significantly associated with AD susceptibility in genomewide association studies (GWAS) and following studies (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . To explore the functional consequences of the rs3764650 in ABCA7 and its possible effect on AD pathogenesis, we attempted to analyze its associations with CSF proteins (A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau) in non-dementia AD subjects."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI dataset", "text": "ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

The application of a normal/abnormal cut point for each amyloidosis biomarker divided the non-dementia subjects into amyloid group (non-dementia A\u03b2+) and nonamyloid group (non-dementia A\u03b2\u2212) and subdivided the former into preclinical AD and prodromal AD from CN and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group respectively."}, {"section_title": "Genotyping", "text": "ADNI samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human 610-Quad Bead Chip array (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), including 620,901 SNP and CNV markers which were employed for genotyping.

For all the tests, we claim that ABCA7 rs3764650 is significantly associated with the levels of CSF biomarkers when P values are below 0.05. Moreover, our subjects were restricted to non-Hispanic and white people to avoid genetic stratification across ethnicities."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Finally, 410 non-dementia A\u03b2+ subjects (231 male vs. 179 female) consisted of 104 preclinical AD subjects (47 male vs. 57 female) and 306 prodromal AD subjects (184 male vs. 122 female). The demographic characteristics and distributions of the genotypes are shown in Table 1 . Prodromal AD had the higher frequency for the APOE \u03b54 allele and performed worse than did preclinical AD on MMSE. As expected, the levels of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau and p-tau were different between the two groups, and prodromal AD had lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , higher t-tau and p-tau levels than did preclinical AD. We used the dominant model in our analysis because the number of homozygotes (GG) was too small. Finally, GG + GT genotypes (77, 138.38\u00b131.95 pg/mL) showed lower A\u03b2 1-42 level when compared to TT genotype (333, 143.55\u00b128.12 pg/mL) in the non-dementia A\u03b2+ group. Moreover, GG + GT genotypes (61, 135.11\u00b130.81 pg/mL) had lower A\u03b2 1-42 level than did TT genotypes (245, 141.66\u00b127.73 pg/mL) in the prodromal AD group, while they did not differ in CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level in the preclinical AD group. In the multiple linear regression model, GG + GT genotypes significantly decreased the level of CSF A\u03b2 in non-dementia A\u03b2+ group (\u03b2=\u22128.8043, P<0.05), and a negative correlation between rs3764650 polymorphisms and CSF A\u03b2 1-42 was also found in the prodromal AD group (\u03b2=\u22129.9756, P<0.01) (Figure 1) . No significant relationships between the levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau and ABCA7 rs3764650 were observed at baseline in all diagnostic groups (P>0.05) ( Table 2) .\nFurthermore, we used a linear mixed effects model to test this association in longitudinal studies. The significant negative association of the rs3764650 polymorphism with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 was also present within non-dementia A\u03b2+ group (\u03b2=\u22120.3328, P<0.005) and within prodromal AD group (\u03b2=\u22120.3567, P<0.01) (Figure 2) . However, the associations of rs3764650 with other CSF proteins (t-tau and p-tau) were also not detected in longitudinal studies (P>0.05) ( Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of ABCA7 SNP rs3764650 on CSF proteins (A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau and p-tau) in non-dementia AD, including preclinical AD and prodromal AD. In non-dementia AD, rs3764650 was detected to correlate with low CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level rather than CSF tau proteins (t-tau and p-tau) at baseline, and the correlation between ABCA7 and CSF A\u03b2 1-42 was further verified in the prodromal AD group. As we further extended these findings in longitudinal studies, the significant associations still existed in non-dementia AD and prodromal AD. Therefore, our study detected that ABCA7 increased AD risk through involving in A\u03b2 deposition but not in tau pathology, which was consistent with the previous findings. ABCA7 was identified as a known risk factor for AD in genetic analyses. Former studies have found that ABCA7 variants contributed to AD by altering the clearance of microglia or the phagocytosis of macrophages, resulting in A\u03b2 accumulation (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . In addition, ABCA7 variants have been observed to be associated with A\u03b2 deposition on amyloid imaging, but not associated with the level of A\u03b2 1-42 in CSF (6) . Different from previous studies, our study explored the correlation between ABCA7 and the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level in the non-dementia AD stage (from preclinical AD to prodromal AD), which may explain the inconsistency between our result and those of other studies."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, our study showed that ABCA7 genetic variants altered CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level in non-dementia AD to modify the AD risk, which provided new evidence for the hypothesis that ABCA7 may contribute to the AD risk by altering A\u03b2 deposition rather than tau pathology."}]
