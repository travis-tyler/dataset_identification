[{"section_title": "", "text": "reduce working hours by 12 percent, compared to fathers who reduce by 6 percent. Mothers return to the labor force when their children reach school-age but shift away from tenure-track positions, leading to a 10 percentage point gender gap among tenure-track faculty with six-year-old children. However, mothers do not leave research occupations with closer to standard forty-hour work weeks, such as industry and non-tenure track positions. I conclude that short-term reductions in work to focus on childcare combined with a competitive profession requiring long hours leads to long-term reductions in promotions, increasing the gender gap at the top levels of academia. birth years for each of a Ph.D.'s children by tracking how the number of children in select age bins changes over time. I then construct the Ph.D.'s career path by creating indicators for each post-Ph.D. year that an individual spends any time working in four job types (postdoctoral researcher, tenure-track academic, non-tenure track academic, and for-profit industry) or is out of the labor force. 3 Among individuals who remain in the labor force, I investigate how job characteristics such as self-reported weekly work hours, work activities, and salary change with the timing of their first child's birth. I find that the trajectories of female biological science Ph.Ds.' careers are significantly altered after their first child's birth. There is no gender gap in tenure-track persistence or salary among individuals who never have children or among individuals prior to having children. Starting two years before the birth of their first child, a growing number of female scientists temporarily leave the labor force -peaking at 9 percent out of the labor force by the time their first child is four years old -and return around the time their first child reaches elementary school age at six years old. This dip in labor force participation occurs at any point in a woman's career she chooses to have children, whether it's during graduate school to ten years after receiving her Ph.D. Mothers who remain in the labor force reduce their work hours by approximately 12 percent of pre-child hours; comparatively, fathers reduce their work hours by half that amount. This temporary work reduction leads to permanent promotion and salary losses. After the first child's birth, the previously negligible tenure-track gender gap starts to widen: by the time their first child is six years old, mothers are 10 percentage points less likely to be in tenure-track positions and have a $5,000 lower annual salary than fathers with children of the same age. 4 These gender gaps persist even as their children grow older and mothers return to the labor force. The child penalty observed on the tenure-track does not appear in other job types, even within the academic sector, indicating the mechanism is specific to tenure-track positions. Men and women take on postdoctoral and for-profit industry positions at the same rates before and after having children. Among non-tenure track academic positions, the gender gap is the reverse of the tenure-track: men and women start off in non-tenure track positions at the same rates before having children, but mothers are 4 percentage points more likely to be in these positions than fathers with children of the same age. The permanent positions have a similar focus on research activities: approximately 20 percent of tenure-track, non-tenure track, and industry positions spend the most work hours on basic research. There is no evidence of a lower quality research environment off the tenure-track: although women are concentrated in non-tenure track positions, they are as likely to be in a Carnegie-classified \"high research activity\" institution as male academics. 5 Rather, higher work hours sets tenure-track positions apart, particularly as non-tenure track positions are in the same academic environment. 6 On average, individuals in tenure-track positions work 51 hours per week; individuals in industry and non-tenure track positions work 47 hours per week. The former aligns with women's average pre-child working hours, and the latter aligns with women's average post-child working hours. Thus, the high hours-intensity of the tenure-track may be pushing off mothers who are time-constrained by childcare. Consistent with the prior literature, mothers then move into occupations like industry and non-tenure track that offer greater worker flexibility and standardized hours. 7 Building on previous literature that relies on cross-sectional variation, this paper isolates the impact childcare has the academic tenure-track gender gap by linking the precise timing of a child's birth to parental career trajectories. I demonstrate that women's reduced labor force participation in their thirties and preferences for standardized work schedules directly ties into time allocations between work and childcare: although women work in occupations with long hours like the tenure-track at the same rate as men prior to having children, greater childcare responsibility leads mothers to significantly reduce their work hours until their children reach school age. Losing this work time pushes mothers out of the pipeline for career promotion and salary increases. Mothers then move into industry and non-tenure track positions, which offer similar work activities but are closer to a standard forty-hour work week; by providing amenities valued by mothers, these occupations are better able to retain their female workforce. This paper also serves as a cautionary tale for job sectors seeking to improve their gender parity: although the biological sciences were successful in dramatically increasing the number of female trainees, structural issues can stopper persistence at any point in the career pipeline. By requiring long hours for promotion as women are dedicating time to childcare, the gender gap on the biological sciences tenure-track persists today. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the NSF SED-SDR dataset and its advantages in constructing as complete of a description of biological science Ph.D. careers as possible. Section 3 summarizes how to exploit the data's longitudinal structure to estimate a Ph.D.'s child birth years 5 The Carnegie Classification system groups academic institutions by the number of doctoral degrees conferred and amount of research funding utilized each year. A \"high research activity\" institution (e.g. Harvard University, Stony Brook University) confers at least fifty doctoral degrees each year and has at least $40 million in federal research support. 6 Postdoctoral appointments are an anomaly to the permanent positions, with a higher share dedicated to basic research and higher work hours. The lack of a postdoctoral gender gap may be due to their temporary nature, which would have a smaller effect on biological science Ph.Ds. who are already delaying childbirth to finish schooling. 7 Randomized wage experiments and hypothetical choice surveys find that women are willing to pay twice as much as men to avoid irregular work schedules, particularly if they have children under the age of four (Mas and Pallais 2017). Historically, professions (e.g. medicine, pharmacy, veterinary science) that have restructured to better offer flexible hours and standardized schedules have dramatically increased their gender parity (Goldin and Katz 2008, Goldin and Katz 2011, Goldin and Katz 2016, Goldin, Kerr, et al. 2017. and construct their post-Ph.D. career paths. 8 Section 4 presents the main results and evidence for long work hours as the driving mechanism. Section 5 discusses potential avenues for future research and concludes. 2 Data: NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) Linked to Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) This paper draws on the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) linked to the 1993-2015 waves of the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). This is the largest, nationally representative sample of individuals receiving first-time research doctorates from accredited U.S. institutions in science, engineering, and health fields. The survey starts following individuals the year they apply for their Ph.D. graduation in the SED, then checks in with respondents on a roughly biennial basis in the SDR waves until they reach the age of 76, emigrate from the U.S., 9 or are otherwise unable to respond. 10 Each survey collects extensive information on the doctoral recipient's individual demographics, family structure, and job characteristics. Respondents give the number of children living in their household as part of their family in the following age bins: \"under 6\", \"6-11\", \"12-17\", and \"18+\" (1993 wave); \"under 2\", \"2-5\", \" 6-11\", \"12-17\", and \"18+\" (1995-2001 waves); and \"under 2\", \"2-5\", \"6-11\", \"12-18\", and \"19+\" (2003-2015 waves). Thus, a single wave may only narrow a Ph.D.'s children ages between two to seven years; however, the survey's longitudinal structure can follow the children's ages over time. The survey also asks respondents about their employment status and -if employed -their start date, job sector, most common work activities, average hours worked, and annual salary. This allows for the tracking of job characteristics over time, building a detailed picture of the Ph.D.'s career. Overall, the response rate for a SDR wave is relatively high at approximately 70 percent (Foley 2015). Individuals who do not respond to a specific SDR wave remain in the sample and continue to be contacted for future waves until they are no longer eligible (as defined by the conditions in Footnote 10). Thus, it is possible for individuals to miss multiple waves but respond later. For the 1993-2015 SDR waves, Table 1 gives a comparison between the number of waves an individual is expected to have responded to the SDRbased on their Ph.D. graduation year and age -to the actual number of waves an individual is observed in the SDR. The fewer waves contributed to the SDR, the less accurate a STEM Ph.D.'s children's birth years can be estimated and the less complete of a career path can be constructed. an error in which the estimated range start year is later than the end year. As previously stated, this can occur if a younger child leaves the household before their older sibling -thus incorrectly contributing their age indicator to another child. The larger birth year ranges at four, six, and seven years correspond with the range of the age indicators \"2-5\", \"6-11\", \"12-17\", and \"12-18\" respectively; in these cases, the respondent may have only answered one survey wave in the time they have children in the household. Without further survey information, I am unable to reduce the range below those given by the age indicators. For analysis, I take the median year (rounding down) of each birth year range to give the birth timing. 12 I combine individuals by the timing of their first child's birth into the following groups: those who never have children, those who have their first child before their Ph.D. graduation, those who have their first child in the first five years post-Ph.D. graduation, and those who have their first child six to ten years post-Ph.D. A small percent of individuals have their first child more than ten years post-Ph.D., which I consider outliers in the main analyses.  (Lean et al. 2017). Table 4 gives additional demographics comparing never-parents to parents. For both parents and never-parents, there are no significant differences in race, citizenship, and education that would explain the gender gap. I then compare how the timing of a Ph.D.'s first child year of birth corresponds to the parental employment type and job characteristic paths. In previous work, I construct career paths across six job types and two non-employed statuses by identifying each post-Ph.D. year in which a respondent spends any portion of the year in such a position (Cheng 2020 for-profit industry, and out of the labor force. Table 5 gives summary statistics by gender on experience in each job type and employment status. The gender gap in tenure-track positions among parents is more than twice the gender gap among non-parents. The gender gap in labor force participation is nearly three times as large among parents than among non-parents. Table 6 gives summary statistics on job characteristics held in survey years by gender and parental status. 14 The salary gender gap is more than three times larger among parents than non-parents; parents also see larger gender gaps in benefits than non-parents. Mothers work fewer hours and are less likely to work full-time than fathers and individuals who never have children. In addition to raw comparisons of the timing of one's first child birth and their career paths, I examine the effect when controlling for a wide range of individual characteristics. 15 I run logit regressions on the full STEM sample to estimate the impact of children on the probability an individual is in each job type or employment status, allowing for flexibility in the coefficients of years before the first child and years after the first child. I then run regressions with a similar functional form to estimate the impact of children on 13 This methodology is an expansion of Ginther and Kahn (2017)'s measurement of postdoctoral incidence, which similarly identifies each post-Ph.D. year that an individual spends any time in a postdoctoral position. 14 Light interpolation of the individual and job characteristics has been done in between survey years, as described in Appendix B.2. However, the job characteristics given in Table 6 are not interpolated and only use information from survey waves. 15 The controls are race, quadratic age, marital status, marital status interacted with gender, U.S. native citizenship, U.S. naturalized citizenship, time in graduate school, educational prestige (as measured by the Carnegie Classification of one's Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral institutions), Ph.D. field of study, and reference year. job characteristics; in these regressions, I additionally control for job type and employment status."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Children Derail Mothers' Time on Tenure-Track But Not Other Positions", "text": "The gender gap in tenure-track persistence lines up with the timing of the first child's birth. Women who never have children have the same probability of being in a tenure-track position as men who never have children in the first ten years post-Ph.D. graduation, as demonstrated in Figure 1. Among individuals who are observed having children, Figure 2 gives no gender gap in the percent holding tenure-track positions in the ten years before the first child's birth. 16 Shortly after the first child's birth, a sizeable tenure-track gender gap of 3.4 percentage points appears and widens to 10.6 percentage points by the time the first child is ten years old. Figure 3 shows that this tenure-track gender gap is largest among individuals who have their first child within the first five years post-Ph.D., though a smaller delayed gender gap is also observed among individuals who have their first child six to ten years post-Ph.D. This timing lines up with the transition from assistant professorship to full professorship: given that the majority of biological science Ph.Ds. spend nearly three years in postdoctoral positions, this transition typically occurs three to eight years after their Ph.D. (Cheng 2020). These results remain when controlling for individual characteristics in the second column of Table 7. Consistent with the literature, this regression finds that having children slightly increases fathers' likelihood of being in tenure-track positions compared to their childless peers but does not benefit mothers (Mairesse et al. 2020). A gender gap is not observed in other job types, as shown in Figure 4. There is generally no significant gender difference among postdoctoral researchers or among for-profit industry positions in the ten years prior to the ten years after an individual's first child birth. 17 Among individuals in non-tenure track positions, the gender gap is reversed from tenure-track positions: when their first child is four years old, mothers are four percentage points more likely than fathers to be in non-tenure track positions. This gap widens to six percentage points by the time the first child is ten years old. As demonstrated in Figure 5, these trends hold regardless of the point in a woman's career she chooses to have children, whether that is before obtaining her Ph.D. or ten years out. Controlling for individual characteristics in Table 7, there is still no gender gap present among for-profit industry or non-tenure track positions. There is evidence of a temporary gender gap in postdoctoral positions: when their child is first born, mothers are less likely than fathers to be in postdoctoral positions -who in turn are less likely than their childless peers -but they return as their first child gets a couple years older. Given the lack of a gender gap in other job types, this indicates that a particular characteristic of the tenure-track is contributing to its gender gap that is not present in industry jobs or other academic jobs."}, {"section_title": "Mechanism: Short-Term Reduction in Work, Long-Term Effects on Promotion and Salary", "text": "The gender gap observed in tenure-track stems from mothers' temporary reduction in work, which conflicts with the job's high pressure and long hours. Again, among individuals who never have children in Figure   6, there is no gender gap in percent out of the labor force or hours worked. 18 Individuals who are observed with children in Figure 7 do not have a gender gap in percent out of the labor force or hours worked prior to the birth of their first child. However, women begin to leave the labor force approximately two years before the birth of their first child. Despite their high levels of training -suggesting high attachment to the labor force -8.9 percent of scientist-mothers leave the labor force in the first four years of their first child's life. Like the \"sagging middle\" described in Goldin and Mitchell 2017 Table 7: mothers are more likely to be out of the labor force than their childless counterparts when they first have children, but this gap closes as their first child gets older. Individuals who remain in the workforce also reduce their work hours after their first child is born. As shown in Figure 7, mothers reduce their hours by twice the amount of fathers. This reduction in hours persists through the first ten years of the child's life.  Table 8: both fathers and mothers reduce their working hours when they have children, but mothers reduce by approximately 3 times as much as fathers. Tenure-track positions have the highest average weekly work hours of the permanent job types, as shown in Figure 9, and thus are the most affected by the reduced working time. Postdoctoral positions also have high average work hours, which may explain the temporary gender gap observed when controlling for individual characteristics. However, because of their temporary nature, long postdoctoral work hours may not be as burdensome to parents as they would be in a permanent position. Comparing tenure-track to the other permanent positions, non-tenure track positions and for-profit industry work 4 and 6 fewer hours per week respectively. Their average weekly hours are similar to the reduced work hours after the first child birth given in Figure 7, suggesting that these positions may better align with the schedules of working parents. Working hours is the most striking difference between tenure-track jobs and other permanent job types in explaining the gender gap. As shown in Figure 10, a similar percent (20 percent) of individuals holding tenure-track jobs, non-tenure track jobs, and industry jobs spend the most work hours on basic research. A larger percent of individuals holding non-tenure track jobs spend the most time on applied research than individuals in tenure-track jobs, who split time between basic research and teaching. Additionally, nontenure track jobs are also in the academic sector and thus share a similar environment as tenure-track jobs. Women do not appear to be switching to lower quality research environments in non-tenure track positions: conditional on being in an academic position, Figure 11 finds no gender gap in the fraction of individuals in Carnegie-Classified \"high research activity\" institutions before and after having children. These results indicate that the mechanism driving the gender gap present in tenure-track positions is not generalizable to the entire academic sector or to research jobs. Rather, the intensity of the tenure-track requires longer work hours that may not be amenable to mothers whose time is taken up by childcare. Mothers' selection into occupations with lower hours is at the cost of fewer promotions and raises. A raw comparison of salary in Figure 12 masks the gender gap from selection into different job types after having children. In particular, parents are more likely to be in for-profit industry positions that pay a higher salary but mothers are more likely to be in non-tenure track positions that pay a lower salary (Cheng 2020). Once controlling for job type and individual characteristics, a persistent and significant gender gap in salary due to the timing of first child birth appears in column 2 of Table 8. There is no gender gap in salary among individuals who do not have children. Fathers face no child penalty in their salary compared to their childless peers. However, mothers experience a $5,000 lower annual salary than fathers and their childless peers. This salary gap persists even as their children get older."}, {"section_title": "Discussion & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, I examine how having children contributes to the academic tenure-track gender gap through the mechanism of reduced working time. Using the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) linked to the 1993-2015 waves of the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), I estimate the birth years of 71,060 Ph.Ds.' first children, then match this birth timing to the parent's career path in four job types (postdoctoral researchers, tenure-track academic, non-tenure track academic, and for-profit industry) and one employment status (out of the labor force). Bolstering the cross-sectional correlations found in previous literature, this linkage between the precise timing of child birth years and synchronous job type isolates the impact that having children has on the biological sciences tenure-track gender gap. I find that having children shifts female but not male scientists' career trajectories off the tenure-track and into less hours-intensive occupations, leading to an over 10 percentage point tenure-track gender gap. Among individuals who never have children, I find no significant difference in the percent of male and female biological science Ph.Ds. holding tenure-track positions in the first ten years after finishing graduate school. Among individuals who have children, there is no tenure-track gender gap prior to their first child birth. After their first child is born, mothers temporarily leave the labor force and reduce their working hours to care for their children. This \"sagging middle\" in labor force participation occurs at any point in a mother's career she chooses to have children: a growing percentage of scientist-mothers leave the labor force starting when their first child is born, peaking at 9 percent when the first child is four years old, before declining around the time the first child reaches school-age at age six. However, this short time out of work has long-term effects on mothers in highly competitive occupations with long hours. After the first child's birth, a gender gap in the percent of individuals holding tenuretrack positions appears: by the time their first child is six years old, mothers are 10 percentage points less likely to be in tenure-track positions than fathers. This gender gap does not appear among individuals holding postdoctoral positions, for-profit industry positions, or non-tenure track academic positions. The temporary nature of postdoctoral positions may not significantly affect mothers' choices, as the majority of these individuals have already put off having children until after they finish schooling. For the permanent positions, the lower weekly work hours of industry and non-tenure track positions may provide a more family-friendly environment than tenure-track academia. Particularly in comparing tenure-track and nontenure track positions, requiring long hours stands out as the most likely mechanism for the tenure-track gender gap. There is no evidence that non-tenure track provides a lower quality research environments than tenure-track, given there is no gender gap in the fraction of academics in Carnegie-Classified \"high research activity\" institutions. Given that tenure-track and non-tenure track share the same academic sector and have a similar focus on basic research, the high-intensity work hours of the tenure-track stands out as the most likely mechanism for pushing mothers off the pipeline. When mothers take time off work to care for their children, they lose out on the few available tenure-track promotions. Consistent with the literature that women value work flexibility and standardized schedules, non-tenure track and industry positions offer working hours that align with mothers' schedules after having children. Thus, mothers returning to the labor force move away from tenure-track into occupations that offer closer to a standard forty-hour work week. However, this more flexible schedule comes at the expense of salary cuts. The gender gap in salary does not close, even as the mothers' children grow up. This results in a permanent reduction of women in tenure-track academia and a persistent salary gap, counteracting the many efforts to improve gender equality in the STEM labor force. Future research will strengthen the causal link between time allocated to childcare and persistence in tenure-track positions. This may be done by examining the impact of policies -such as the availability of childcare, access to family planning services, and changes in parental leave -that allow scientist-mothers to more easily balance their children and their careers. 19 Note that prior research examining gender-neutral policies, such as pausing the tenure clock for all parents, have not been effective in reducing the tenure-track gender gap (Antecol et al. 2018). This further indicates the friction stems from the uneven distribution of childcare duties and thus requires a correction geared towards lowering mothers' loads. By examining what factors differentially affect the persistence of women -especially mothers -on the tenure-track, policymakes can better correct the leaks in the STEM pipeline and improve diversity in the STEM workforce.

Careers Versus Children: How Childcare Affects the Academic Tenure-Track Gender Gap Stephanie D. Cheng"}, {"section_title": "Data Appendix", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Child Birth Years Algorithm", "text": "This appendix details the methodology used to identify a SDR individual's total number of children and estimate their children's birth years. It performs the methodology on the example individual Ph.D. whose child age bins across survey waves are given in Appendix Table A.1. Note that this data has been constructed for example purposes and does not represent an actual individual in the SDR data. To track a Ph.D.'s number of children over time, I construct a \"ticker\" system that tracks the number of children passing each age bin (see Appendix Table A.2). The example individual in 1995 has one child between ages 6-11 and one child between ages 12-17; thus, the ticker reads two for the \"under 2\", \"2-5\", and \"6-11\" age bin and one for the \"12-17\" age bin. Across survey waves, these tickers would only decrease if a child leaves the household; the largest decrease gives the number of children who leave in that year. 2006 and 2008 see tickers decrease by no more than one; this indicates one child has left in each of those years. birth is given in 2008 and thus attributed to the fourth child; in that same year, the oldest child is in the running total of children who have left the household. Working two children at a time from the outer to inner indicators, I thus identify the Nth oldest and Nth youngest child's age indicators with each cycle through the algorithm. This process can be repeated indefinitely for families of any size, but the vast majority (99%) of the sample has fewer than five children. I keep the process to Ph.Ds. with fewer than five children to reduce computational time. For each child in each year, I calculate the range of possible birth years from the extreme values of the age range (see Appendix Table A.4). Because a child's actual birth year must fall within all ranges given by their age indicators, I reduce the estimated birth year range to {max(range start years), min(range end years)}. This narrows the first child's birth years to 1982-1983; the second child's birth years to 1984-1985; the third child's birth years to 2003-2004; and the fourth child's birth years to 2006-2008. If the end of one child's birth range is after the start of their nearest younger sibling, I further reduce the older sibling's end range with their younger sibling's start range. This does not occur in the example; however, if the first child's birth year had instead narrowed down to 1982-1985, it could have been reduced to 1982-1984 based on the start year of the second child.

To construct the career paths, I modify Ginther and Kahn (2017)'s methodology for measuring postdoctoral incidence over time to expand to different employment sectors. From the SED, I identify STEM Ph.D.s' immediate post-graduation status using the variables pdocstat. Individuals are considered to be in a particular job type the year of their graduation if they indicated they are returning to employment, have a signed contract, or are in negotiations for that job type. From the SDR, I utilize variables on their current job, 20 comparison to their previous job, 21 and retrospective postdoctoral experience asked of respondents in 1995 and 2006. 22 Because some variables impart more information about one's job type than others, I use the following hierarchy to fill in indicators for each job type in each year from 1945-2015: 1. New job: Individual is starting a new job (given by start date) in that year. In the case of unemployed or out of labor force, the last year worked was the previous year. 2. Postdoc retrospective: Individual stated they were in a postdoctoral position in the retrospective 1995 and 2006 data, as given by the postdoc start and end dates. Fill indicators for all years between the start and end years. 3. Current job: Individual is currently in this job type; fill indicators for all years up through starting year. In the case of unemployed or out of labor force, fill indicators for all years just up to the year last worked. 4. In same job type last survey: Individual states they were either 1) in the same job and same employer, 2) in the same job but had a different employer, or 3) had the same employer but different job as the last survey. Denote these as case 4, case 4.1, and case 4.2 respectively. Fill indicators for current job type up to last survey year. 5. Expected post-graduation job: Fill in job type for an individual's graduation year from their expected post-graduation job type, as given by the SED. 6. No other information, expected transition: If steps 1-5 have not given any information on an individual's job type in a particular year but have given information in the previous year, assume that individuals were in the same job type as the year had information."}, {"section_title": "No information expected:", "text": "For years before completing the Ph.D. and after the last year surveyed, the individual contributes no further information about their job type, so replace indicators with missing. The example individual's indicators given in Appendix Table B.3. I consider the highest step in the hierarchy as the most accurate representation of whether an individual was in that job type in that year. Appendix Table B.4 gives the percent of indicators determined by each step. To estimate the number of years an individual is in a particular job type, I count one year for each year an indicator's most definitive step is steps 1-5 and a half year for each year an indicator's most definitive step is step 6. Transitions are defined by the new job type within two years of the last year spent in a different job type. As shown in Appendix Table B.3, the example individual is considered to have spent four years as a postdoc, four and a half years as a tenure-track academic, one year in non-tenure track, two years in non-profit, five and a half years in industry, two years not in labor force, and five and a half years in government. They have switched from a postdoc to tenure-track, tenure-track to non-tenure track, non-tenure track to non-profit, non-profit to industry, industry to government, and not in labor force to government. This methodology is able to capture the majority of the true career path; however, the example also illustrates limitations when individuals switch principal jobs between survey years or have employment gaps for a year or less. The 1999-2000 non-tenure track and the 2009-2012 government positions are underestimated, as the individual switched to a different job type in a non-survey year. The 2007 unemployment gap is missed due to being in a non-survey year. The 2004-2006 for-profit job is overestimated due to a lack of job type information in 2007. Since transitions are defined by the last time an individual is observed in a job type, this methodology also misses the transition from government to not in labor force (as the individual returns to government later on)."}, {"section_title": "B.2 Individual and Job Characteristic Interpolation", "text": "Once I have constructed the full career path, I pull additional information on worker and job characteristics from the SDR data. I calculate age as the difference between the birth year given in the SED and the year of interest. I construct indicators for marital status; any children living in the household; US native citizen; and US naturalized citizen. I fill in between SDR survey years by assuming that if individuals have not changed their status for consecutive survey years, they kept that status. If they have changed status, I fill in the intervening year indicators with 0.25/0.75 to denote a transition a negative/positive transition respectively. 23 Between the SED and SDR years, I fill in the US naturalized citizenship indicator only if it does not change between the SED and their first SDR survey year; no other interpolation is done between the SED and SDR.   (3) Notes: This table gives the constructed SDR individual's responses to the SED and the 1993-2015 SDR waves, based on their true career path in Table B.1. Column 1 gives the survey type (SED or SDR). Column 2 gives the reference year for the survey, refyr . Column 3 reports the Ph.D. graduation calendar year, phdcy_min; note that there is a typo in the 1999 SDR response. Columns 4-5 gives the individual's post-graduation status, pdocstat, and post-graduation planned employment, pdocplan, reported in the SED. Column 6 gives the starting year, strtyr , for the reported principal job. Column 7 is an indicator for whether the principal job is a postdoctoral position, pdix . Column 8 gives the labor force status, lfstat. Column 9 gives the employment sector, emsecdt. Columns 10-11 describe the faculty rank, facten, and tenure status, tensta, for employment in academic institutions. Column 12 describes whether the individual held the same job and/or employer during the last survey, emsmi. Column 13 gives the last year worked if unemployed or out of the labor force, lwyr. Columns 14-17 give retrospective start and end dates for the two most recent postdoctoral positions, pd1syr-pd2eyr ; in this example individual, they did not have a third postdoctoral position, so pd3syr and pd3eyr are empty for all surveys.
