[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from Wuhan, China across the globe, with nearly four million confirmed cases and two-hundred and fifty thousand deaths as of May, 2020, receiving designation as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization [1, 2] . A novel betacoronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the infectious agent responsible for COVID-19 [3] . Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a wide variety of clinical syndromes primarily involving the respiratory tract, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [4, 5] . While many clinical trials are ongoing, there are currently minimal established therapies to prevent or treat COVID-19, highlighting the urgent need for further mechanistic insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMuch like other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus that uses its viral spike glycoprotein (S protein) to bind to specific target-cell surface receptors and initiate viral entry [6] . Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds specifically to host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), after which host serine protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the S protein to facilitate membrane fusion [7] [8] [9] [10] . Several recent analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets have demonstrated that co-expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 occurs in only a minority of cells, primarily secretory epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract [11] [12] [13] , suggesting that cell type-specific mechanisms may be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation. Similarly, commonly used human cell lines have demonstrated varying degrees of infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 [14] , although the mechanisms governing cell line-specific phenotypes remain unknown. Identifying host factors that influence ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression may provide crucial insights into cellular mechanisms that might be therapeutically exploited against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-conserved, short (20-22 nt) non-coding RNA molecules that regulate a broad array of cellular functions at the post-transcriptional level. Cellular miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Canonical gene regulation by miRNAs involves the binding of miRNAs to the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, promoting translational repression and mRNA degradation [15] . As a post-transcriptional gene expression regulatory molecule, miRNAs act as key effector molecules in the complicated interaction network between virus and host. Both virus and host can encode miRNAs [16] . Virus miRNAs can resist human cell antiviral immune defense systems by changing various host gene expression to control cell growth and development [17, 18] . In contrast, cell-encoded miRNAs can directly affect viral entry and replication cycle [19] . In addition, miRNAs can affect viral infectivity indirectly by regulating host factors involved with viral pathogenesis [19] . Therefore, studies on host cell-derived miRNAs can contribute to the further understanding of mechanisms underlying the interactions between virus and host cells and provide a framework for the discovery of novel antiviral agents and strategies. For example, miRNAs have been shown to target and regulate viral gene expression by targeting different regions of the viral genome, including structural (membrane, envelope, nucleocapsid), non-structural proteins, or the non-coding (untranslated) regions [19] . However, the role of miRNAs in dictating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is unknown.\nTo address these knowledge gaps, we investigated potential interactions between host miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2. The goals of our study were 2-fold: (1) identify host miRNAs that may directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and thus affect viral infectivity; and (2) identify host miRNAs that may regulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, or their upstream interferon (IFN) regulators, and thus control the susceptibility of cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2. By utilizing bioinformatic prediction algorithms to predict miRNA binding to viral and host RNA transcripts in combination with RNA-sequencing data in cell lines with known resistance or susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we provide an atlas of miRNAs that are predicted to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly and thus potentially affect genomic stability, translation, or replication. We also describe host miRNAs that may regulate ACE2, TMPRSS2, or IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, or -\u03b3 expression. Finally, we use miRNA profiling from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to investigate changes in expression of predicted miRNAs following infection. These data establish a detailed framework for future mechanistic studies investigating the relationship of these important miRNA host cell-SARS-CoV-2 interactions and provide a foundation for potential new targets for therapy."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Analysis", "text": "National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Virus was queried for SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes deposited with NCBI through 19 April 2020.

We therefore conducted semi-quantitative analyses in which we divided miRNAs into terciles of relative expression within each cell line, allowing comparison across all four cell lines.

Phylogenetic analysis of the 820 included SARS-CoV-2 genomes demonstrated detectable deviation from the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence ( Figure 1A ). However, when compared to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence using BLAST, there was remarkably little sequence variation in all included sequences (mean percent sequence identity = 99.97%, standard deviation = 0.02%; Figure 1B ). To investigate the impact of the small degree of genetic variation between SARS-CoV-2 genomes on potentially important miRNA binding sites, we selected three genomic regions-the 5 UTR, S protein, and 3 UTR-of the five sequences with the lowest sequence identity compared to the reference sequence (Table 1 ). These sites were selected based on previously described interactions between host miRNAs and 5 and 3 UTRs of RNA viral genomes [41] [42] [43] as well as the critical importance of the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity [7, 9, 10] . Overall, the genetic sequences were highly conserved compared to the reference sequence. Four of these samples originated in the United States, three of which were from Washington state. The fifth sample was from Punjab, Pakistan. The most common cause of sequence deviation from the reference sequence was short \"N\" repeats (indicating unknown nucleotides due to unreliable sequencing). Point mutations (C->T) were identified in the 5 -UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Washington (MT345855.1) and California (MT258382.1), USA, but overall sequence identity remained at 99.85% and 99.87%, respectively (Table 1) .

Additionally, one United States sequence (MT293170.1) contained a 9 nt poly-A insertion within the poly-A tail of the 3 UTR.

A total of 288 predicted miRNAs binding to the SARS-CoV-2 genome were overlaid on the miRNA expression profile sets of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptible (Calu-3, Huh7) and resistant (A549, human primary lung fibroblast) cells. As a result, we identified 115 miRNAs binding to the 5 -UTR and ORF regions that were expressed in A549 (resistant) and Huh7 (susceptible) cell lines ( Figure 4A ,B and Suppl. Figure S2A ).

Utilizing several miRNA expression profiles of 4 different cell types (2 resistant and 2 susceptible), we applied our predicted miRNAs to identify certain miRNAs that are expressed in cells resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity ( Figure 6A ). Similar to the human lung tissue database, we set a criterion of >10 CPM for each cell type, followed by grouping miRNAs into terciles (highest third, middle third, and lowest third). The list of predicted miRNAs for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 vary slightly between cell types ( Figure 6B,C) . Similar to analyses of Huh7 and A549 miRNA profiles, we performed differential expression analysis on predicted miRNAs with certain criteria (p < 0.05 and >log2-fold change) to identify miRNAs more unique to a particular cell type. MiR-9-5p and miR-218-5p, predicted miRNAs binding to ACE2 mRNA, are expressed higher in resistant A549 cells, while miR-483-3p is expressed higher in susceptible Huh-7 cells ( Figure 6D ).

These miRNAs identified to be expressed higher in A549 cells would suggest a potentially important role in providing resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by reducing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA. Furthermore, we expanded our query by incorporating Calu-3 (susceptible) and human primary lung fibroblast (LF, resistant) to identify favorable miRNAs to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figure 6E ). Because the miRNA expression profiles were generated by different groups, we therefore limited our analysis to semi-quantitative expression comparisons between cell types. MiRNAs that are in the same tercile group between all four cell types were excluded from the analysis (i.e., miR-452-5p and let-7e-5p targeting TMPRSS2 mRNA). Here we confirm that miR-218-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-494-3p, miR-382-3p, and miR-181c-5p are favorably expressed in resistant cells. Furthermore, we also identified that miR-214-3p targeted TMPRSS2 mRNA predominantly in resistant cells. Finally, we conducted tissue expression analyses of miRNAs targeting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNAs in various human tissues including lung, kidney, lymph node, and liver (Suppl. Figure S4A )."}, {"section_title": "Identification of Predicted miRNAs to IFN Genes in SARS-CoV-2-Resistant and -Susceptible Cells", "text": "IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 are upstream drivers of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression [11] , key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. Similar to our efforts in finding candidate miRNAs for targeting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNAs, we applied our workflow to identify miRNAs to target IFN mRNAs in resistant and susceptible cell lines ( Figure 7A-C) . Notably, predicted miRNAs targeting IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNAs were found less in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cells compared to resistant cell lines, suggesting there might be an overall greater amount of maintenance of these key mediators of ACE2 at the post-transcriptional level. Interestingly, when using differential expression analysis of Huh-7 and A549 cells, all the miRNAs identified are predominantly expressed in the resistant cells A549. Specifically, IFN-\u03b3-targeting miRNAs included miR-655-3p, miR-31-3p, miR-656-3p, miR-495-3p, miR-9-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-24-3p; IFN-\u03b2-targeting miRNAs included miR-138-5p, miR-323a-3p, and miR-9b-1-5p; and IFN-\u03b1-targeting miRNAs included miR-361-5p and miR-410-3p ( Figure 7D ). Furthermore, additional analysis with Calu3 (susceptible) and lung fibroblasts (resistant) cells also confirmed many of these captured miRNAs and revealed several new candidates ( Figure 7E ). Particularly, miR-1277-5p is shown to target both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNAs, but was difficult to capture due to it being lowly expressed in Calu3, Huh-7, and A549 cells. Lastly, we highlight expression of IFN-\u03b1-targeting miRNAs miR-361-5p and miR-410-3p in different tissues (lung, kidney, lymph node, and liver) (Suppl. Figure S4B) . Collectively, these findings highlight key miRNAs predicted to target ACE2, TMPRSS2, or IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3 mRNAs and enriched in SARS-CoV-2-resistant or -susceptible cell lines, potentially providing new insights for potentially modulating viral entry. Moreover, some of selected miRNAs targeting ACE2, TMPRSS2 and IFN mRNAs from the above analyses were dysregulated in the recent RNAseq data from lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, differential expression analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells showed upregulated expression of miR-483-3p (targeting ACE2 mRNA) and let-7d-5p (targeting TMPRSS2), while miR-450b-5p (targeting IFN-\u03b3 mRNA) expression was downregulated (Table 3) . \nIFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 are upstream drivers of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression [11] , key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.

In addition, we further analyzed available RNA-seq datasets to uncover miRNA profiling from Calu-3 cells directly infected with SARS-CoV-2 to explore whether infection resulted in altered expression profiles of the miRNAs of interest.\nThe single-stranded, positive-sense RNA composition of the SARS-CoV-2 genome makes it susceptible to binding and regulation by host miRNAs. Indeed, host miRNAs likely play key roles in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses across species [51] . Additionally, several miRNAs that directly target viral genomes have been described previously. For example, binding of miR-122 to HCV promotes protein translation by specifically stabilizing the secondary structure of the internal ribosomal entry site in the 5 UTR of HCV [41] . Binding of miR-122 is necessary for viral propagation and has been successfully exploited therapeutically by the pharmaceutical miravirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that sequesters and inhibits miR-122 to reduce HCV viral load [52, 53] . Here, we have identified three miRNAs-miR-298, miR-7851-3p, and miR-8075-that are predicted to bind with high affinity to the 5 UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly, the binding sites of all three miRNAs are within or in close proximity to stem-loop structures that are highly conserved within the Coronaviridae family ( Figure 2D ) [44] . However, it is difficult to predict in silico how endogenous miRNA binding might regulate viral genomes. For example, in contrast to miR-122 and HCV, miR-548g-3p binds to the 5 UTR and inhibits the translation and replication of dengue virus, another positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus [42] . Similarly, other miRNAs have been shown to bind throughout the viral genome to inhibit the translation and/or promote the degradation of many other disease-causing RNA viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, enterovirus, human T cell leukemia virus, and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) [43, [54] [55] [56] [57] . Future studies investigating the resulting changes to genomic secondary structure following miRNA binding may shed light on the potential regulation of SARS-CoV-2 by these miRNAs.\nThe polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) is a unique sequence in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike protein and absent in SARS-CoV and other bat and pangolin coronaviruses. A leading proline results in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678 and S686, which flank the cleavage site (PRRA) ( Figure 3B ) [25, 58] . As previously suggested, this allows effective cleavage by furin and other proteases and has a role in determining viral infectivity [59] . We show that miR-151a-5p, -151b and miR-4707-3p may target the novel PRRA region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and assessment of the secondary structure in this region supports accessibility for miRNAs binding. The enriched expression of miR-151-5p and 151b in the lungs and lung primary fibroblasts suggests a potential implication of these miRNAs in the spike protein stability and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability. Additionally, Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp12 have also recently been identified as important proteins in viral replication and are targeted by the investigational therapeutic remdesivir [60, 61] . Here, we also show that miRs-320a-3p, -320b and -3149 were predicted to bind to the Nsp8 and Nsp12 genomic regions of the replicase polyprotein 1ab (PP1ab), a region that is important in transcription and replication of viral RNAs [46] . MiR-320 family was implicated in a number of viral infections. MiR-320a-3p was shown to inhibit mink enteritis virus (MEV) replication [62] , whereas miR-320b was significantly increased in human plasma samples following Ebola infection [63] . The relevance and applicability of these findings to SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be further delineated.\nRNA viruses can quickly mutate their genomes in response to evolutionary pressure due to the lack of proofreading activity from virally-encoded polymerases [64] . MiRNA binding sites, particularly the 6 to 8 nt seed regions, are therefore likely evolutionarily conserved due to strong positive selection. As noted previously, it is difficult to predict how miRNA binding may regulate viral translation or replication in vivo. Moreover, even miRNAs that negatively regulate genomic stability and limit viral replication may paradoxically result in increased viral infectivity at the organismal level due to cell type-specific miRNA expression. For example, miR-142-3p is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells and is necessary for proper hematopoietic cell differentiation [65, 66] . Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV), another single-strand, positive sense RNA virus, contains three highly-conserved miR-142-3p binding sites in its 3 UTR, and viral replication is potently inhibited in cells expressing miR-142-3p [43] . Trobaugh et al. demonstrated that repression of EEEV replication in myeloid cells is alleviated upon deletion of miR-142-3p binding sites, and infected myeloid cells contribute to potent type I IFN response [43] . However, despite increased viral replication in myeloid cells and lymph nodes, disease severity was reduced in mice infected with EEEV containing deleted binding sites due in part to the limited capacity for activation of the innate immune system. In this way, there is a strong positive selective pressure for the maintenance of miR-142-3p binding sites in the 3 UTR of EEEV due to cell-specific miRNA expression. Interestingly, in addition to miR-142-3p, miR-29a has also been identified as a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell differentiation, and loss of hematopoietic cell miR-29a expression has been associated with the development of myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemias [65, 67, 68] . We also predict that many other potential miRNAs target the 5 UTR, coding regions, and intergenic non-coding regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 2) , and cell-specific expression of these miRNAs may considerably impact the regulatory control over SARS-CoV-2 replication and infectivity on both the cellular and organismal level.\nSeveral independent analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets demonstrated that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in only a limited subset of cell types, primarily secretory cells of the upper and middle airways [11] [12] [13] . Because SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, it does not require host-cell lysis for viral release, leading to speculation that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially infects secretory cell types to promote the rapid release of viral particles. In this context, viral mechanisms that promote host-cell survival would likely be advantageous in enhancing viral replication and propagation. MiR-29 has recently emerged as an important regulator of cell survival and apoptosis by targeting several components of pathways critical to cell proliferation and survival including p53 inhibitors p85\u03b1 and CDC42 as well as Bcl2, CCND2, and c-Myc [69] [70] [71] . Similarly, miR-15a -15b, and miR-16 have been shown to play critical roles in these processes by targeting a similar cassette of genes such as Bcl2, CCND1, CCNE, and Mcl1 [72] [73] [74] , and miR-23b regulates lungs cells proliferation by targeting Cyclin G1 (CCNG1) [75] . Here, we show that miR-29a, -15a, b, -16, and -23a,b have several high-probability predicted binding sites throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome and exhibited high expression in human lungs (Figures 2 and 3) . By binding these miRNAs at multiple high-affinity sites, SARS-CoV-2 may functionally sequester their cytosolic pool [76] and promote the survival of infected cells through the de-repression of cell cycle and apoptosis target genes. Data from SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells may support this paradigm, demonstrating a decrease in miR-23a and miR-23b following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3) .\nWe also show that several miRNAs may directly play a role in regulating viral infectivity using established miRNA profiling datasets of both Huh7 (high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity) and A549 (low SARS-CoV-2 infectivity). Our correlative results suggest that several miRNAs may be of potential interest as therapeutic targets. For example, miR-23a, -23b, miR-29a, -29c (-3p) and -29b-1-5p are predicted to bind several regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including the regions encoding ORF1ab (miR-23a and miR-29a, -29-c, -29b-1), the Nucleocapsid (miR-29a, -29c) proteins (Figure 2 ). At the same time, we observed that miR-29a, -29c and miR-23a, -23b are highly expressed in the cell lines that show low SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (A549 and primary lung fibroblasts), while showing much lower expression in cell lines with high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Calu-3 and Huh7; Figure 4 ). As previously observed, miRNA binding to different genomic regions that code for viral proteins can interfere with the viral replication, translation or infectivity [19] . Whether the increased expression of miR-23a and miR-29a, -29c in non-permissive cell lines may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity needs to be further assessed by miRNA loss-and gain-of function studies in respective cell lines. Moreover, the two miRNA families (-23 and -29) are highly expressed in healthy lungs (Figure 3 ). Future analysis of these miRNAs in the lung tissues or plasma of COVID-19 infected patients will be informative for their potential regulation and correlation with increasing severity of disease.\nOur study builds upon previous computational analyses that predict interactions between host miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2. Similar to our analytic strategy, Fulzele et al. recently utilized miRDB (a cut off of target score \u226595) to predict miRNAs that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 genome [77] . Because miRNA target prediction algorithms are not specifically designed to predict miRNA-viral genome interactions, we utilized a more liberal cut off of target score \u226570 along with verification by a second prediction tool, RNAhybrid. Using this strategy, we identify many of the same miRNA targets such as miR-15a-5p and miR-15b-5p in addition to a host of other potentially pathogenically important host miRNAs. Chow and Salmena utilized RNA22 to predict miRNAs that may bind the SARS-CoV-2 genome and analyzed their expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected versus uninfected Calu3 cells [78] . By utilizing more robust miRNA-binding prediction methods through two independent prediction tools (miRDB and RNAhybrid), our analysis builds on that of Chow and Salmena and provides additional candidate miRNAs for future in vitro and in vivo investigation.\nIn addition to potential regulation by host miRNAs, SARS-CoV-2 may encode viral miRNAs or other non-coding RNA transcripts that impact its infectivity [79, 80] . For example, SARS-CoV encodes several small viral RNAs 18-22 nt capable of silencing target mRNA expression through non-canonical miRNA regulatory pathways [81] . Treatment of SARS-CoV-infected mice with small viral RNA inhibitors resulted in reduced infection severity, lower levels of inflammation, and higher mRNA expression of antiviral proteins. To date, there have been no confirmed SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNAs, although several studies predict the existence of such virally-encoded miRNAs [82, 83] . It will be important to determine in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 encodes miRNAs capable of altering viral infectivity and whether they are candidates for therapeutic intervention."}, {"section_title": "MiRNAs Targeting Viral Entry Proteins and IFNs", "text": "Ziegler et al. [11] recently established ACE2 as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), primarily in response to IFN-\u03b1 stimulation [11] . We therefore investigated potential miRNA regulators of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3 that may play indirect roles in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures 5 and 7) . Strikingly, all miRNAs predicted to bind the 3 UTR of IFN genes are more highly expressed in cell lines resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found three miRNAs that were co-expressed in both the SARS-CoV-2-resistant cell line A549 and human lung tissue: miR-361-5p targeting IFN-\u03b1 mRNA and miR-24-3p and miR-143-3p targeting IFN-\u03b3 mRNA. In qualitative analyses including additional Calu3 and LF cell lines, miR-361-5p maintained a consistent pattern of high expression in those resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and low expression in those permissive to infection, making this an intriguing target for further study. Furthermore, miR-495-3p, which targets the ORF1ab region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and is highly expressed the resistant cell lines A549 and human primary lung fibroblasts, is also predicted to target IFN-\u03b3 3 -UTR. MiR-495-3p expression was significantly upregulated in mouse lungs infected with H5N2 virus [84] and in human serum following Hepatitis C infection [85] . Whether such upregulation is also valid in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as a possible protective mechanism to inhibit ACE2 induction via IFN-\u03b3 remains to be determined in subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies.\nImportantly, dedicated in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that ACE2 induction by IFN was considerably weaker in immortalized cell lines and absent in mouse primary tracheal epithelial cells, suggesting a substantial degree of cell and species specificity to this previously unrecognized regulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE2 [11] . We have identified several candidate miRNAs that may offer an additional level of regulation of ACE2 with a similar degree of cell specificity. Using several established bioinformatic miRNA target prediction tools, we provide a collection of miRNAs that may target mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as upstream regulators IFNs with high-probability ( Figure 5A ). By evaluating the expression of these miRNAs in RNA-sequencing datasets of human lung tissue, we predict 7 miRNAs targeting ACE2 mRNA (e.g., the top 3 are miR-141-3p, miR-4270, miR-331-3p) and 25 miRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 mRNA (e.g., the top 9 are miR-4763-3p, let-7d-5p, miR-4530, let-7e-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-762, miR-338-3p, miR-4505, miR-575) to be abundant in human lung tissue, establishing biologic plausibility for these miRNA-mRNA interactions ( Figure 5B ).\nWe found ten total miRNA-three targeting ACE2 mRNA (miR-9-5p, miR-218-5p, and miR-483-3p) and seven targeting TMPRSS2 mRNA (let-7d-5p, miR-494-3p, miR-382-3p, let-7e-5p, miR-181c-5p, miR-452-5p, and miR-1226-3p)-that demonstrated statistically significant differential expression favoring either resistance (i.e., higher expression in A549) or susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., higher expression in Huh7; Figure 6D ). We also found that of these eight, miR-218-5p (targeting ACE2 mRNA), miR-382-3p, miR-494-3p, let-7d-5p, let-7e-5p, and miR-181c-5p (targeting TMPRSS2 mRNA) are also expressed in human lung tissue. Importantly, miR 382-3p and miR 494-3p also demonstrated higher expression in SARS-CoV-2-resistant LF cells. Additionally, both miR-218 and let-7d were previously shown to be expressed in bronchoalveolar stem cells, which are susceptible to SARS-CoV expression in part due to surface ACE2 expression [86, 87] . Further dedicated miRNA profiling and target gene expression analyses will be insightful regarding the impact of these miRNAs on the relative susceptibility or resistance to infection in cells expressing these miRNAs.\nUsing RNAseq data from Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs targeting the genes involved in virus entry. Interestingly, several miRNAs targeting mRNAs of viral entry proteins were upregulated following infection such as miR-483-3p targeting ACE2 mRNA and miR-181c-5p and let-7d-5p targeting TMPRS2 mRNA. Although we found that miR-483-3p is expressed higher in cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, its upregulation (4.46-fold) along with the upregulation of miR-181c-5p and let-7d-5p after infection in Calu-3 cells may represent compensatory responses of host cells to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by targeting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA. Indeed, ACE2 expression levels were found downregulated in mouse lungs after SARS-CoV infection [88] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Overall, in this study, we establish a framework for future investigation of miRNAs regulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in human cells. Leveraging miRNA profiling from cells resistant or susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we provide a preliminary resource of high-probability miRNAs governing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through two potential mechanisms: (1) the direct binding of host miRNAs to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which have the potential to both promote and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection; and (2) regulation of the mRNAs of viral entry proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 including regulation via their upstream IFN modulators. Further studies are needed to validate potential miRNA binding sites in both SARS-CoV-2 and mRNAs of entry proteins. Similar to other host miRNA-virus interactions, these miRNAs may represent targets for potential therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 patients.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/11/11/1354/s1, Figure S1 : Secondary structure of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and lung expression of miRNA binding in the PRRA region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Figure S2 : Differential expression of miRNAs binding the SARS-CoV-2 genome between resistant versus susceptible cell lines.
