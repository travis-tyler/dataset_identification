[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background Differences in medication use by geographic region may indicate differences in access to specialist medical care, especially in the case of prescriptions for psychotropic medications. We assessed the effect of more or less urbanized residence on likelihood of psychotropic medication use in a large cohort of older adults in Pennsylvania, USA. Methods Community-dwelling older adults were recruited from senior centers across Pennsylvania. Participant residences were geocoded and categorized according to US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. We used the codes to identify respondents who live in relatively urban counties with 250,000 or more residents (n = 1,360) or less urban counties with fewer than 250,000 residents (n = 401). Participants reported prescription medications in a clinical interview. Psychotropic medications were categorized by class. Logistic regression models were estimated to assess the independent effect of residence on likelihood of psychotropic medication use. Results Geographic region was significantly associated with use of psychotropic medications. Psychotropic medication use was higher in less urban areas (19.7 %) relative to more urban areas (14.2 %), p = 0.007. In adjusted models, degree of urban residence was a significant correlate in models that adjusted for sociodemographic features and medical status (odds ratio 1.62; 95 % confidence interval 1.13-2.31, p \\ 0.01). Use of psychotropic medications on the Beers list also increased with less urban residence (13.0 vs. 8.3 %, p = 0.005). Conclusions Older adults living in less urbanized areas are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs. This difference may indicate a health disparity based on access to geriatric specialists or mental health care."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Prescriptions for psychotropic medications are common among older adults. A large Danish study showed that older age was associated with a higher probability of longacting benzodiazepine use as well as use of three or more psychotropic drugs [1] . According to a Finnish study, two out of three community-dwelling older adults are prescribed at least one CNS medicine [2] . In the USA, nearly one in five community-dwelling elderly use psychotropic medications, primarily antidepressants followed by antianxiety agents [3] . Although psychotropic medications may help in the management of mental health conditions in older adults, the medications also carry risks for deleterious effects. For example, use of sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines may be associated with falls [4] . Adverse effects of anxiolytic and tricyclic medications may include psychomotor retardation, postural hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, which may cause blurred vision and cognitive impairment [5] .\nEpidemiologic studies suggest that psychotropic medication use is more common in whites [6] , women [3, 7] , and individuals who report poorer health [3] . In this research, we ask if location, in particular, degree of urban residential status, may also play a role in prescribing patterns for psychotropic medications.\nIn the USA, access to medical services varies by place. Geriatric and mental health services are less available in rural areas [8] [9] [10] . For example, the number of geriatricians per 10,000 older adults is lower in rural areas (from 1.48 in the most urban areas to 0.80 in the most rural). Similarly, board-certified internal medicine physicians are more plentiful in urban counties and not as accessible in less urban areas (27.29 vs. 3.85 per 10,000 older adults). The presence of family physicians varies less across the rural-urban continuum (ranging from 22.02 to 14.27 per 10,000 older adults) but still suggests less access to medical care in the rural sector.\nVariation in psychotropic medication use may also reflect differences between older adults living in more and less urban areas, such as differences in medical status or sociodemographic features, or perhaps differences in the kinds of psychotropic medications prescribed. This research sought to determine (i) if differences in psychotropic medication use were evident across the more urbanless urban continuum, (ii) whether differences in psychotropic medication use persist in analyses that adjust for potential differences between more and less urban populations, and (iii) whether these differences were apparent for all classes of psychotropic drugs or only particular classes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "In 2010-2011, we enrolled a large group of communitydwelling seniors in Falls-Free PA, a research study comparing falls incidence among older adults completing Pennsylvania's Healthy Steps for Older Adults, a falls prevention program (n = 814), and a comparator group of older adults from the same senior services sites who did not complete the program (n = 1,015). Both groups completed baseline interviews by telephone after providing informed consent, and all participants were followed up to a year in monthly automated or in-person telephone interviews to track falls. Exclusion criteria included inability to provide informed consent, language other than English or Spanish, and inability to participate in telephone follow-up; otherwise all seniors attending PA Department of Aging programs were eligible.\nDetails of recruitment and follow-up for Falls-Free PA are reported elsewhere [11] . Briefly, the Falls-Free PA study enrolled participants in 19 counties. A total of 2,459 older adults were ascertained at Healthy Steps senior center sites and agreed to give contact information to the research team. 90.5 % (n = 2,219) signed informed consent, and 1,835 subsequently completed baseline assessment and were eligible for follow-up. We excluded 74 participants who did not provide medication information or addresses that could be geocoded. A total of 1,761 were included in analyses.

The rural-urban classification scheme distinguishes metropolitan counties by population size and nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metropolitan area. Each county in the USA is assigned to one of nine categories. This detailed residential classification permits researchers to analyze patterns that may be related to degree of residential density and proximity to more populous areas. While nine categories are available in the USDA classification, the Falls-Free PA sample was limited to residents mostly in the four most populous categories. The final distribution of participants included the following: highly urbanized county, ''county in metro area with 1 million or more'' (n = 872); urbanized county, ''county in metro area of 250,000 to 1 million'' (n = 488); less urbanized county, ''county in metro area of fewer than 250,000'' (n = 207); and rural county, ''non-metro county with urban population 20,000 or more, adjacent to metro area'' (n = 194). For analyses, we dichotomized the sample to define more urban (counties with 250,000 or more residents, n = 1,360, ''highly urbanized'' or ''urbanized'') and less urban (counties with fewer than 250,000 residents, n = 401, ''less urbanized'' or ''rural'') regions."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Respondents reported birth date, race-ethnicity, gender, education, marital status, living arrangement, and adequacy of monthly income.

We calculated the total number of prescription medications each respondent reported. Psychotropic medications mentioned by respondents were coded as antidepressant, anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, or antipsychotic, as categorized by a clinical pharmacist.

Models included sociodemographic indicators and two approaches to disease conditions. Models 1 and 2 included history of depression or anxiety because of the strong association between these mental health conditions and use of psychotropic medication. Model 3 included a count of all reported disease conditions. We also varied urban residence status. Model 1 included the dichotomous indicator, and Models 2 and 3 the four-level continuum indicator.\nIn logistic regression models, women were significantly more likely to report psychotropic medication use [odds ratio (OR) = 2.43-2.66, p \\ 0.001]. Older age and living alone were independently associated with lower risk of psychotropic drug use, which achieved significance in models that included a count of medical conditions. Marital status and years of education were not significant as correlates of psychotropic use, and living alone was a significant correlate only in one of the three models. Strong associations were evident for medical correlates, most notably history of depression and anxiety. The very high ORs suggest that this measure identified a subset of respondents with current treatment for psychiatric conditions. For each additional medical condition reported, respondents were about 20 % more likely to report use of a psychotropic medication (Model 3).\nUrban residence status was a significant correlate of psychotropic drug use in each of the multivariate models. Using the dichotomous measure in Model 1, older adults living in counties with \\250,000 people were significantly more likely to report psychotropic medications [OR = 1.62, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.31, p \\ 0.01] after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and presence of reported mental health conditions. Model 2 included the full continuum of more urban-less urban residence and showed that this effect is driven mostly by greater use of psychotropic medications in people at the least urbanized end of the continuum. ORs were higher in ''less urbanized counties'' [county in metro area of fewer than 250,000; OR 1.56 (95 % CI 0.95-2.55)] and in ''rural counties'' [non-metro county with urban population 20,000 or more, adjacent to metro area; OR 1.68 (95 % CI 1.03-2.72), p \\ 0.037].

Overall, 2.5 % of respondents reported prescriptions in more than one class of psychotropic medication, which did not differ by location. As shown in the ''Appendix,'' 26 of the 35 medications tracked in this study appear on the 2012 Beers list as potentially inappropriate medications for patients aged 65 years or older [13] .

Prescriptions for psychotropic medications on the Beers list increased across the more urban-less urban continuum: 8.1 % in highly urbanized counties, 8.6 % in urbanized counties, 9.7 % in less urbanized counties, and 16.5 % in the least urbanized counties (p = 0.004). "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this sample of older adults ascertained in senior centers, prescriptions for psychotropic medication prescriptions ranged from 13.3 % in the most highly urbanized counties to 22.2 % in less urban areas. Using the threshold of 250,000 people to separate counties, we found that 19.7 % of older adults in less urban areas reported a psychotropic medication compared with 14.2 % in more urban areas. These figures are in accord with findings from other studies [3] . Despite growing awareness of the potential risks of psychotropic medication use, about one in five older adults in less urban areas receive prescriptions for these classes of medication. We found that gender, age, and medical conditions, both psychiatric conditions and total count, were associated with use of psychotropic medications. Consistent with other studies, women were twice as likely to report use of the medications [3] . Participants under age 75 were more likely to report use of psychotropic medications than people over age 75. This finding contradicts findings of Nordic studies showing that older age is associated with greater use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hypnotics [14, 15] . A possible reason for these differences may be sources of data. The Nordic studies relied on administrative pharmacy claims, while medication information in the Falls-Free PA sample was established in an interview.\nAfter controlling for sociodemographic and disease status measures, urban residence was still significantly associated with use of psychotropic medications. Residents of less urban counties were nearly twice as likely to report use compared with residents of more urban counties. We did not find as strong a trend for polypharmacy. As noted earlier, the mean number of prescription medications was only marginally higher among less urban residents: 4.0 versus 3.7.\nPossible explanations for the greater use of psychotropic medications in less urban areas include less access to geriatricians, psychiatrists, and mental health care specialists generally [10, 16] . In less urban settings, family physicians and general internists are more likely to address mental health among older adults than specialists [9] . One study found that medical generalists score lower than geriatricians on appropriate prescribing and proactive assessments for geriatric and psychologic syndromes, which may help explain the greater rates of psychotropic medication prescriptions in these areas [17] . More generally, medical generalists are unlikely to receive geriatrics training [18] .\nRecognizing this problem, interventions have been developed to help lower inappropriate prescribing for older adults [19] .\nLimitations of our study should be noted. The use of a senior center sample does not allow us to generalize results to older adults as a whole, nor does it provide an accurate representation of the entire older US population. Importantly, the Falls-Free PA sample does not adequately represent the most rural localities. We relied on participants' self-reports on prescription medications and co-morbidity, which might be less accurate than collecting pharmacy claims or other data from participants' medical files. Finally, we were unable to collect information on sources of medical care, and, most critically, who prescribed psychotropic medications."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study confirms the high prevalence of psychotropic medication use, with less urban residence as a risk factor for psychotropic medication use. Our findings highlight the need for a proactive approach that involves assessment of the appropriateness of psychotropic medications. Findings regarding psychotropic medications in this sample raise two key concerns. First, while 15.4 % of respondents were taking a psychotropic medication, 2.5 % were taking medications involving two or more classes of psychotropic medication. Use of multiple classes of psychotropic drugs is a concern, since the effectiveness of combining different types of psychotropic medications is questionable [20] . Second, of the 35 medications tracked in this study, 26 appear on the 2012 Beers list as potentially inappropriate medications for patients aged 65 years or older (''Appendix'') [13] , and less urbanized residence was associated with greater use of these Beers-list medications. Our results suggest that residents of less urbanized areas may be at higher risk for potentially inappropriate prescribing of psychotropic medications."}]
