[{"section_title": "CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Currently, there is a plethora of studies addressing human capital investment within the context of education. Much of the literature bridging local labor market conditions and education outcomes focuses on high school dropout rates and college enrollment in relation to unemployment rates and local wages. Historically, few studies have attempted to link growth within specific labor markets to the type of degree residents earn, i.e., a high school degree/G.E.D., an Associate's, and a Bachelor's. In other words, do potential degree earners consider the types of jobs available to them when making decisions concerning their human capital investment? Are students more likely to pursue a college degree if there has been substantial growth within occupations requiring a college education? Corollary, are they less likely to pursue a college degree if employment growth has primarily occurred with secondary market occupations? What about high school graduation and earning an associate's degree? Are students more likely to graduate high school if locally available jobs only require a high school degree? Are they more likely to finish high school if locally available jobs require an Associate's or Bachelor's degree? The purpose of this study is to gauge the influence of local/regional labor market conditions on educational outcomes, using human capital and dual labor markets as guiding theories. To gain an understanding of how growth in multiple labor market tiers and various occupation types influence local human capital development as well as students' decisions to invest in their own human capital; two modeling approaches are utilized. First, the association between local employment growth by labor market tier and aggregate human capital development is evaluated. Here, the percentage gain in counties stock of high school graduates, Associate's degree earners, and Bachelor's degree earners between 2000 and 2014 is regressed against employment gains within primary, mid-level, and secondary labor markets within the same timeframe. Second, occupations found to significantly influence local human capital development are transferred to models gauging the educational attainment of individual respondents. In both sets of models, \"educational attainment\" is measured by the type of degree earned as a means of testing whether growth in primary, secondary, and mid-level labor markets have measurably different magnitudes of effect on the type of degree earned. Factors such as parents'/guardians' educational background and socioeconomic status are commonly held as influential elements affecting students' educational attainment. Overlooked is the fact that these elements too, are potentially influenced by the local/regional markets they were raised in, much like their children. In isolated, rural pockets of the USparticularly central Appalachia-generations of family members have participated in the same local labor markets, never \"settling down\" too far outside of their place of origin. In these locations, parents and children often share similar labor-market experiences and may make similar decisions when it comes to human capital investment. If most available jobs are primarily within secondary markets, additional education beyond high school (or less than a high school in many cases) may not be considered a sound investment. The proposed influence of locally available occupations on educational attainment is somewhat intuitive and in line with Becker's theory of human capital. In the early stages of the \"career path,\" most people are faced with the decision of entering the job market after/during high school or to postpone entry and invest in additional training via postsecondary school or trade school. In the traditional model, wages that could be earned throughout the duration of the training period (often years) are forfeited in favor of higher wages later. It follows, if high-skilled occupations are scarce both locally and within a [subjectively] reasonable commuting distance, financing additional training and/or education may be viewed as a bad investment by recent graduates. As such, a higher proportion of graduates may enter the labor market immediately after high school graduation-or during high school-compared to areas with a more diverse labor market or where more high-skill occupations are available. In addition, the proposed influence is an extension of Bozick's research on the warehouse hypothesis linking perceived job opportunities to college enrollment, though with a few caveats. Bozick's analysis focuses on the propensity of recent high school graduates to enroll in college based on the unemployment rate and the volume of locally available jobs that do not require a college degree. Whereas Bozick's study examines unemployment and job availability during the year that high school seniors graduate, this study examines employment growth by labor market tier and occupation type over a period of 10 years; beginning when respondents were sophomores in 2002, and ending in 2013-when respondents would have been roughly 25-27 years old. Additionally, this study examines the likelihood of graduating high school and earning an Associate's or Bachelor's degree based on perceived job opportunities as opposed to college enrollment. This study attempts to answer six questions. 1. Does employment growth in primary market occupations stimulate growth in the number of high school graduates and college degree earners? 2. Given (1) is verified, how does the impact of employment growth in primary occupations compare to the impact of growth in lower-tiered occupations? 3. Does employment growth in primary market occupations influence the probability of respondents graduating high school and/or earning a college degree? 4. Given (3), how does the impact of employment growth in primary occupations compare to the impact of growth in lower-tiered occupations? 5. Does employment growth in primary, mid-level, and secondary market occupations influence the high school graduation and/or earning a degree when controlling for network/homophily effects? 6. Do occupations illustrated to affect growth/decline in the number of degree earners translate to an increased/decreased probability of earning a degree among individuals? Academic literature thus far has not linked labor markets to educational outcomes in the manner I am proposing. Often, the causal relationship addressed is usually the opposite, i.e., the role of educational outcomes on career choices and/or local labor markets. To ascertain the influence of local/regional labor markets on educational outcomes, both human capital and dual labor markets will be guiding theories; the former for its emphasis on incentives, the latter for its structural account of the American labor market. Due to data and theoretical limitations, however, this study does allow for the assessment of individual mechanismsoutside of background factors such as parents' socioeconomic status and level of educationwhich may influence students' decisions on their human capital investment. Here, the primary independent variables of interest focus on change in aggregate employment opportunities within an 8 to 10 year time frame. As such, individual mechanisms associated with occupational and educational outcomes-parental involvement in students' education, network ties leading to information about local employment opportunities, cultural capital, etc.-will not be addressed in this analysis. The remainder of this chapter is laid out as such; section 1 identifies key literature pertaining to human capital theory and the use of token measures of labor-market health-such as business-cycles-as explicates of high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates. Section 2 details literature on dual labor market theory as a response to neoclassic economic models of human capital. Section 3 highlights literature on the role of networks/homophily on education outcomes. Section 4 discusses the limitations of Human Capital and Dual Labor Market Theories in their assessment of educational outcomes and what it means for the current study. The final section provides a roadmap for the dissertation."}, {"section_title": "Human Capital, Labor Markets, and Educational Outcomes", "text": "Human Capital Theory falls under the umbrella of Ration Choice Theory which characterizes humans as self-interested (though, not necessarily selfish) rational actors whose decisions are governed by \"utility maximization\" (Hechter & Kanazawa, 1997;Green & Shaprio, 1994;Little, 1991). Individuals are assumed to have a set of interests/goals for which they evaluate appropriate courses of action to obtain. Agents then rank each course of action on the perceived ability to maximize their preferences. Human capital theory is moreorless Rational Choice Theory applied to the development of advanced/nuanced skillsets to maximize wages, benefits, etc. and/or advance in one's current occupation. In general, human capital is accrued in the same matter as other forms of capital; most require some degree of monetary or time investment, with the general expectation of returns exceeding the initial cost. Human beings invest in their health, education, vocational training, etc. with the expectation of greater returns on their investment over the course of their lifetimes (Becker, 1964;Shultz, 1961). Within the context of education, students \"invest\" in additional education to develop a more refined skill set with the expectation that their future earnings will offset the cost of training as well as wages lost during the training process. In situations where; A) there are very few locally available high-skill occupations; or B) recent graduates are not embedded in networks containing information about available high-skill, high-wage occupations; pursuing additional education/training may not be seen as an appropriate avenue for maximizing income or job satisfaction. Human capital theory is pervasive in studies of education. Much of the literature on human capital investment focuses on the influence of markets on high school dropout rates (Rees & Mocain, 1997;Black, McKinnish, & Sanders 2005;Duncan, 1965;Rumberger, 1983;Neumark & Wascher, 1995;Goldin & Katz, 1997), college attendance (Betts & McFarland, 1995;Fuller, Manski, & Wise, 1982;Manski & Wise, 1983;Becker, 1994;Schultz, 1961;Perna, 2000), choice of college major (Altonji, Blom, & Meghir, 2012;Song & Glick, 2004;Davies & Guppy, 1997) and returns to education (Becker, 1964;Shultz, 1961; Kane & Rouse, 1995;Morgenstern, 1973;Mincer, 1958;Blaug, 1972;Rouse, 2005;Roksa & Levey, 2010). In addition, economic boom and bust cycles have also been linked to high school dropout rates and college enrollment rates (Bedard & Douglas, 2007;Light, 1996). For the purposes of this study, the incentives for finishing high school and/or earning a college degree will be the focus."}, {"section_title": "High School Dropouts", "text": "The consequences of not finishing a high school degree are immense; hence noncompletion seems counter-intuitive in the contexts of human capital theory. Compared to people with a high school degree, dropouts experience lower lifetime earnings (Rumberger, 1987;Rouse, 2005;Sum, Khatiwada, & McLaughlin, 2009), contribute significantly less to the tax base (Rouse, 2005;Sum, Khatiwada, & McLaughlin, 2009;Catterall, 1987), are more dependent on social welfare (Rumberger, 1987;Catterall, 1987;Levin, 1972) and more likely to be unemployed (Rumberger, 1987;Sum, Khatiwada, & McLaughlin, 2009;Rouse, 2005;Catterall, 1987). On a related note, Brenner (1976) found that unemployed persons are more likely to experience poor mental and/or physical health, increased mortality, suicide, and admission to state mental hospitals. Indirectly, this suggests earning a high school degree not only increases employability, lifetime earnings, etc.; but also, increases overall health as well. Despite negative outcomes routinely associated with dropping out of high school, both labor market conditions and long-term wage increases have been illustrated as influential on high school dropout rates. Using reconstructed data from the 1960 Census, Duncan (1965) examined the relationship between high school graduation and unemployment rates from 1902 to 1956. She found that during periods of high unemployment, a larger percentage of students remained in school. When unemployment was low, high school completion rates decreased. Partitioning out high school completion rates by race and gender, Rumberger (1983) found both black and Hispanic students were more likely to dropout when local unemployment rates were low. However, white males where more likely to dropout during periods of high unemployment. When queried as to why they left school, nearly a quarter of male respondents cited \"economic reasons\" as the main catalyst for dropping out. Comparatively, 15 percent of female respondents left school for early entry into the labor force. Noted by Black et al (2005), the Duncan study suffers from variable omission bias (does not include family background variables) and the Rumberger study does not account for local labor market characteristics other than unemployment. Utilizing panel-data estimation techniques and district-level data to account for variable omission bias and unobserved environmental characteristics, Rees and Mocan (1997) illustrated that both White and Hispanic students are less likely to leave school when local unemployment rates are high. In fact, a 1 percent increase in New York State's unemployment rate was associated with a 2 percent decrease in district dropout rates. This effect remained significant even when controlling for factors such as teachers' education and years of experience. Black students, however, are more likely to leave school when economic conditions are turbulent (suggestions as to why was not given). Though Rees and Mocan adjust for variable omission bias and include locational characteristics, they do not account for the variation of industries within local labor markets. Three studies address the effect of wage increases in low-skill occupations on high school completion rates. Neumark and Wascher (1995) used a conditional logit model to analyze state-year data from 1977 to 1989. They found that increases in states' minimum wages significantly increases high school dropout rates and is inversely related to the proportion of teens that are neither employed nor enrolled in school. Wages in the manufacturing industry have also been illustrated as influential on high school completion (Goldin & Katz, 2008), though results may not be applicable to present markets given the dated time frame of the study (1910 to 1940). Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005) provide a more contemporary study of the coal industry in Pennsylvania and Kentucky during the 1970s and 1980s. They found that the high wages accompanying the coal boom of the 1970s decreased high school enrollment rates in coal-producing counties. Corollary, high school enrollment increased during the coal bust of the 1980s. In addition, they illustrated that a 10 percent increase in wages for low-skill labor decreased high school enrollment by 5 to 7 percent. Though studies by Goldin and Katz (2008) and Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005) take wage differentials and industry-type into account; examining a single industry is too restrictive-results are not applicable to other industry types."}, {"section_title": "College Enrollment/Completion", "text": "High school graduates opting for additional education and/or training are essentially making several investments with the expectation of returns exceeding expenses. First, there is the cost of attendance which includes tuition, books, supplies, room, board, etc. Per data pulled from the National Center for Education Statistics (2014), the average cost of obtaining a Bachelor's degree at a 4-year public institution (including room and board) exceeded $67,000 1 for the 2011-12 academic year-an increase of over 80 percent since 2001-02. Even if potential college students were eligible for the maximum Pell Grant amount, the cost of a degree would have still averaged $45,000. Other than the expenses directly associated with college attendance, there are also indirect costs. This includes less leisure time, the cost of transportation to and from the university, as well as forgone wages and opportunities that come with full-time employment (Becker, 1993). In short, pursuing a post-secondary education is an expensive endeavor. For recent high school graduates, the expense may be viewed as excessive if they [recent graduates] live in areas where homogeneous, low-skill occupations dominate the local job market. Despite the increasing expense of a college education, many benefits are associated with earning a degree. Of those benefits, perhaps the most notable is a substantial increase in wages (Jaeger & Page, 1996;Becker, 1993, Belman & Heywood, 1991. Among persons 25 and over, bachelor's degree holders out earn high school graduates by $22,000+ annually (2012 American Community Survey, 3-year estimate). Over the course of a lifetime, the additional income translates to an estimated $660,000 2 more than high school graduates. Other benefits of a college degree include a more fulfilling work environment, better health and health care, and a decreased likelihood of unemployment (Baum & Payea, 2004;Bowen, 1996;Leslie & Brinkman, 1988). The benefits of a college education are not limited to the bachelor's degree, as several studies have indicated significant increases in pay among Associate's degree earners (Kane & Rouse, 1995;Belman & Heywood, 1991;Jaeger & Page, 1996;Marcotee et al, 2005). In addition, Kane and Rouse (1995) found that community college attendees who did not obtain their Associates degree still out earned those without a college education by 10 percent. The benefits of a degree are not limited to individuals. Societal benefits include an increased tax base, lower incarceration rates, higher voter turnout, increased blood donations at local clinics, decreased likelihood of smoking, and a locally reduced strain on social welfare programs (Baum & Pyea, 2004, Bowen, 1996. Other than studies which examine economic returns to a college degree, there is very little research connecting labor market conditions to obtaining an Associate's or Bachelor's, though several examine its link to college enrollment. Morissette, Chan and Lu (2014), for example, found that college enrollment in Canada was linked to global oil prices from 2001 to 2008; as global oil prices decreased, college enrollment increased. As with research on high school completion, several studies link college enrollments to unemployment rates (Betts & McFarland, 1995;Hillman & Orians, 2013;Pennington, McGinty, & Williams 2002;Bozick, 2009). Largely, an increase in unemployment coincides with an increase in college enrollment, particularly at community colleges. Indeed, increased unemployment rates have also been illustrated to influence the decision to enroll part-time or full-time (Stratton, O'Toole & Wetzel, 2004). Utilizing the warehouse hypothesis-which holds that students are more likely to remain in school when labor market conditions are unfavorable and more likely to exit school for employment when market conditions are favorable- Bozick (2009) illustrated that recent high school graduates where more likely to enroll in college when unemployment was high and the availability of jobs that do not require a Bachelor's degree is low. Corollary, students were more likely enter the job market when unemployment was low and the number of available jobs that do not require a Bachelor's degree is high."}, {"section_title": "Dual Labor Market Theory", "text": "During the 1960s, government-funded occupational training programs were sprouting up in central cities to combat what was perceived as \"supply-side\" deficiencies within the workforce (Doeringer et al, 1972) as part of a Lyndon Johnson's \"War on Poverty.\" The consensus, and a view in line with human capital theory, was that regionally high unemployment and underemployment rates were the byproduct of an uneducated and unskilled workforce, thus making them \"unemployable.\" In response, the Concentrated Employment Project (CEP) was established to aid government programs in educating and training workers to increase \"manpower,\" thus producing more employable workers and reducing underemployment and poverty, or so the logic went. In an 18-month study of a CEP program established in Boston, Doeinger et al. (1972) found that high unemployment was not related to the employability of the workforce so much as the quality of the occupations they had access to. Most trainees who participated in the CEP-sponsored program were placed in low-wage occupations that did not offer a career ladder. As such, many employees quit their jobs. Stemming from neoclassical economic theories' inability to explain occupationallybased differences in labor market experiences, skepticism of human capital theory's efficacy became prevalent. Additionally, human capital theory did not address occupational clustering or segregation as well as wage differentials across racial, gendered, and spatial divides (England, 1982;Poire, 1972Poire, , 1975Zellnar, 1972;Weisskoff, 1972;Gordon, 1971). In short, human capital theory was criticized for its failure to take structural processes into account. Instead of focusing on differences between occupations and the markets they are embedded in, the primary focus of human capital theory is investment in one's own skill set-people who are unemployable or have low-skill jobs have not developed the expertise adequate to obtain a quality occupation. Subsequently, and in response to the deficiencies of neoclassical economic theories, Dual Labor Market/Labor Market Segmentation Theory was developed. Born from the  research on internal labor markets, dual labor market theory conceptualizes the American labor market as divided into good jobs and bad jobs, each type clustering together to form two separate markets. Good jobs are located in the primary market while bad jobs are located in the secondary market. Jobs within the primary market share several characteristics including \"high wages, good work conditions, employment stability, chances of advancement, equity, and due process in work rules\" . In contrast, the secondary market consists of jobs that: are low paying, unstable, offer limited benefits (if any), provide a poor working environment, offer little chance of advancement, and high turnover. Regarding the primary market, early proponents of dual labor market theory realized many occupations fell somewhere in between primary and secondary. As such, the primary market was eventually broken up into upper and lower tiers (Piore, 1973(Piore, , 1975Osterman 1975), each with their own unique set of characteristics. Upper tier occupations offer more job control and autonomy; are often more complex in nature; \"encourage and require creative\u2026.self-initiating characteristics;\" are less routinized; have higher turnover rates due to advancement; and are more \"closely related to formal education and personal achievements\" (Harrison & Sum, 1979;Reich, Gordon, & Edwards, 1973;Hudson, 2007). Examples of upper tier occupations include management, professor, doctor, lawyer, etc. Lower tier jobs within the primary sector are \"more routinized, and encourage personality characteristics of dependability, discipline, responsiveness to rules and authority, and acceptance of a firm's goals\" (pg. 360. Reich, Gordon, & Edwards, 1973). In addition, turnover is slow in low-tier occupations as employees become \"locked in a career pattern\" or a specific internal market Anderson, Butler, & Sloan, 1987). Some examples of low-tier occupations within the primary market include factory work, clerical work, and most blue-collar occupations in general. Another characteristic of dual labor market theory is the limited mobility to move from the secondary to the primary market ). In many cases, \"work\" is not the primary focus of persons employed in the secondary market. The income derived from these occupations could be supplemental, as employees' households may have a primary market breadwinner (Hudson, 2007). Other research suggests that workers initially employed is in the secondary labor market will continue to work in this sector throughout the course of their life (Gordon, 1972;Piore, 1970;as cited in Hudson, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Previous Research", "text": "As with human capital theory, much of the literature on dual labor market theory has been mixed. Supportive studies focus on the segregated nature of the labor market (Oster 1979;Kaufman, Hodson, & Fligstein, 1979;Gittleman & Howell, 1995); differences between primary and secondary markets (Graham & Shakow 1990); and groups that are more frequently segregated to occupations within the secondary market--specifically women, immigrants, and nonwhites (Boston, 1990;Zellnar, 1971;Weisskoff, 1972;Hiebert, 1991;Sakamoto and Chen, 1991;Sakamoto & Powers, 1995;Leontaridi, 1998). Studies more critical of dual labor markets cite the theories ambiguity (Heckman & Hotz, 1986;Leontaridi, 1998) and question the \"limited mobility\" tenant (Griffin, Kalleberg, & Alexander, 1981;Anderson, Butler, & Sloan, 1987). Several studies have implemented a factor analysis approach to illustrate distinct groupings of occupations based on a number of characteristics. Analyzing 83 3-digit 1960 Census code industries, Oster (1979) found evidence supporting dual structuralism within the job market. Industrial characteristics associated with the primary markets-characteristics such as a concentration of firms with sales over $100 million, total industrial assets, and total industrial income-significantly \"loaded\" to create a single factor. An additional PDF (population probability density function) test both confirmed and partitioned 55 of the 83 industries into the secondary (or peripheral) market and 28 into the primary (or \"core\") market. Using a combination of both factor and cluster analysis, Kaufman and company (1979) classified the American labor market into 16 distinct sectors. Dimensions used to distinguish differences between sectors included concentration (the extent to which industries are dominated by a handful of companies), size, capital/labor intensity, foreign involvement, government intervention (i.e., regulation), profit, autonomy, unionization, productivity, and growth. In an assessment of 621 occupations, Gittleman and Howell (1995) grouped occupations into 6 job categories using a cluster analysis. Here, occupations were clustered based on 17 measures of job quality. Studies of the American labor market have also highlight gender-and race-based occupational segmentation (Zellnar, 1972;Weisskoff, 1972;Hiebert;1991;Leontaridi, 1998). In 1900, roughly one-third of employed women were concentrated into a single occupational category, namely \"private household worker\" (Weisskoff, 1972). As of 1969, the distribution of women across occupations increased though the \"type\" of occupations women were concentrated in were similar. Utilizing 1960 census data, Zellnar (1972) demonstrated that roughly 50 percent of employed women held occupations in which they made 80 percent or more of the employees. Only 2 percent of employed men where in these occupations. Indeed, 90 percent of men held jobs where they made up more than a third of all employees. The effects of this segmentation process were shown to drive down the overall wages of women. Regarding immigration, studies suggest many immigrant workers form and participate in enclave markets and/or remain in the secondary labor market (Wilson & Portes, 1980;Mata & Pendakur, 1999). It is not uncommon for immigrants new to the U.S. labor market to start their own small businesses and employ other immigrants (Wilson & Portes, 1980). Mata & Pendakur (1999) suggest that immigrant entrepreneurship may be a response to the nature of a dual labor market economy. Due to education and/or language barriers, immigrants may choose self-employment over working in the secondary labor market. Indeed, Alcobendas and Rodriguerz-Planas (2010) show that immigrants to Spain are disproportionately funneled into the secondary labor market despite the skill and education of the workforce. The authors suggest that several occupations requiring a high degree of education also require some form of certification-certification which may be specific to the host country. As such, many immigrants choose self-employment or seek work in immigrant-owned businesses. Previous studies also show minorities tend to be segregated to the secondary labor market (Rosenberg, 1976 as cited in Dickens and Lang 1985;Carnoy, & Rumberger 1980;Dickens & Lang, 1985;Boston, 1990;Hudson, 2007). Rosenberg (1976), Carnoy, and Rumberger (1980) found that minority workers are more likely to begin their careers in the secondary labor market and also more likely to remain there compared to whites. Boston (1990), shows that 58.8 percent of black men and 47.3 percent of black women were employed in the secondary sector in 1983-a time when all workers in the secondary labor market accounted for a quarter of all citizens in the labor force. Extrapolating from a series of studies, Dickens and Lang (1985) hold that there are barriers to primary sector jobs for minorities that do not exist for whites. Hudson (2007), using a multinomial hierarchical modeling technique, found that both black men and women, noncitizen Hispanic men and women, and Native American men are more likely to be employed in the secondary labor market. Studies examining the spatial dimension of dual labor market theory tend to focus on \"spatial mismatch,\" or what occupations are spatially accessible to whom. Dubbed the Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis (SMH), researchers have utilized the theory to explain income, opportunity, and employment differentials between urban and suburban spaces; primarily focusing on inner-city poverty among African Americans (Kain, 1992;Ihlanfeldt & Sjoqusit, 1998). McLafftery and Preston (1992), for example, found that African American and Hispanic women in northern New Jersey are more dependent on public transportation and thus have poorer spatial access to jobs compared to white women. Latina women were shown to have better access to jobs within the local labor market but also earned considerably less than African American and White women. This suggests that there was not a lack of occupations in the area, but a lack of decent-paying occupations. Doeringer et al (1972) also concluded that the number of occupations available in urban centers was not an issue so much as the lack of well-paying jobs. Venti (1975) reach similar conclusions in his study of welfare recipients in Massachusetts. Research critical of dual labor market theory cites its ambiguity and the supposed inability of workers in secondary markets to move to primary markets. Analyzing labor market earnings and inequality among Panamanian males, Heckman and Hotz's (1986) income model of persons above the poverty line did not explain earnings of the poor, even when controlling for selection bias. They cite a number of reasons why their results do not support to dual labor market theory including: the potential existence of two or more sectors in the labor market, yet all are lumped into \"primary\" or \"secondary'; workers as utility maximizers rather than earning maximizers; the inability to separate the cost associated with moving between secondary and primary sectors from barriers to entry; and false distributional assumptions. The authors conclude that in order to test for the existence of a dual market, a \"true functional form of the earnings equation under the hypothesis of no dualism\" is assumed to be known (pg. 529). As such, Heckman and Hotz hold dual labor market theory as untestable. Leontaridi (1998) also cites the presupposed existence of two labor sectors as an inherent weakness of dual labor market theory. Extrapolating from previous studies, the author concludes that while the use of cluster and factor analysis solves the issue of \"a priori segment determination,\" the number of proposed sectors resulting from these studies are dependent on both the number and type of variables used. This suggests there is not an agreed-upon methodology to test dual labor market theory. Regarding mobility between secondary and primary sectors, several studies have found that rigid barriers between markets do not exist. 3 Anderson, Butler, and Sloan (1987), using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, develop indices of job traits which are used to characterize occupations as good or bad. Their results indicate that job groupings based on jobs traits (wages, layoffs, unionized, unemployment, etc.) did not conform to dual labor market theory. Given that occupations could not be clustered based on their characteristics, rigid barriers between sectors do not exist. In a previous study examining the determinants of early labor market entry; Griffin, Kalleberg, and Alexander (1981) found \"considerable inter-sectoral mobility\" and few characteristic differences in the employees working in each sector. Mayhew and Roswell (1979) and McNabb (1987) found that the education of workers was highly correlated with their place in the \"occupational hierarchy,\" thus the existence of rigid barriers between primary and secondary sectors are questionable."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Peers on Academic Achievement", "text": "For well over half a century, the role of peers on students' educational, occupational, and long-term life outcomes has been a topic of interest among education researchers. Much of the literature on peer-group effects has focused on the role of social cliques as a means of establishing class boundaries (Hollingshead, 1949), peer influence on academic performance (Coleman, 1961;Hanushek et al, 2003;Calvo-Armengol et al 2009;Hoxby, 2000;Zimmerman, 2003;Angrist & Lang, 2002), student tracking (Duflo, Dupas, & Kemer, 2011); the likelihood of dropping out of high school (Cairns, Cairns, & Neckerman, 1989;Jimerson et al, 2000:Carbonaro & Workman, 2013, 2016; selection bias in peer-effect studies (Zimmerman, 2003;Sacerdote, 2001;Hoxby, 2000); college major (Sacerdote, 2001); and student aspirations (Haller & Butterworth, 1960;Alexander & Campbell, 1964;Cuncan, Haller, & Portes, 1968;Carbonaro and Workman, 2016;Martin, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Social Cliques and Academic Achievement", "text": "Regarding social cliques, in a field study of 735 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 residing in a Midwest community, Hollingshead (1949) found that teenager's behaviors were linked to their position with the towns stratified social structure. The youths of Elmstown, Illinois predominantly interacted with and dated those within the same social strata, with the occasional deviation. In addition, Hollingshead noted that students within the lower strata generally did not engage in any social and/or community events; high school students did not attend athletic events, join school clubs, etc. In short, youths and their families within the lower strata did not have strong ties to their community. Studies have generally been mixed on the influence of peers when it comes to students' academic achievement. Some illustrate a connection between peer groups and achievement as early as elementary and middle school. Utilizing a series of models that control for student, school, and school-by-grade fixed effects, Hanushek et al (2003) illustrated that peer achievement among 3 rd through 6 th grade students had a positive influence on students' achievement growth. Results indicated that a .1 standard deviation increase in peer achievement leads to a .02 increase in student achievement. When the distribution of math scores were parsed, results were similar, though students in the uppermost quartile were not as responsive to peer achievement. In a study of 3 rd , 5 th , and 7 th graders enrolled in Boston's Metco program, Angrist and Lang (2002) found that lower-scoring Metco participants did not significantly influence the reading scores of their non-Metco peers. On the other hand, they did find evidence of an intragroup effect based on racial composition. Specifically, there was an inverse relationship between the proportion of Metco students and the reading test scores of Non-Metco students among minority girls. As the former increased, the latter decreased. In a study which examined peer effects, teacher incentives, and student tracking in Kenya; Duflo, Dupas, and Kemer (2011) found 1 st graders who attended schools with an achievement-based tracking system outperformed their peers at non-tracking schools. Utilizing a unique experimental design, 60 randomly selected schools assigned students to sections based on initial test scores on a standardized exam given at the beginning of the academic year. The remaining 61 schools randomly assigned students to one of two sections, regardless of their initial achievement. At the end of an 18-month period, 1 st graders who attended tracking schools scored 4 .14 standard deviations higher than students in nontracking schools. One year later, the difference had increased to .16 standard deviations. When examined by section, students in both tiers benefited from tracking, the bottom tier 5 gaining .16 standard deviations and the upper tier gaining .19 standard deviations. In a separate analysis of friendship networks, Calvo-Armengol, Patacchini, and Zenou (2009) highlight the importance of peer influence on education outcomes. Using the Katz-Bonacich measure of network centrality, the authors show a standard deviation increase equates to an achievement gain of 7% of one standard deviation. It is worth noting, however, that parental education accounted for a gain of 17% of one standard deviation per unit increase. Results of their study indicate that students' location within friendship networks has a significant impact on their educational outcomes, though the effect size is small. Several studies have also indicated that peer influence plays a significant role in high school graduation. A study of early school dropouts by Cairns, Cairns, and Neckerman (1989) showed a positive correlation between students' friendship networks during 7 th grade and leaving school by their junior year. Among both male and female cliques, there was a positive association between dropping out school and having friends who had dropped out of school. In a separate longitudinal analysis of high school dropouts, Jimerson and company (2000) illustrated peer competence at age 16 influences students' graduation status at age 19. In fact, the Wilks's Lambda score for peer competence was slightly higher than the score for students' academic achievement. By themselves, these studies do not necessarily illustrate a peer effect on the probability of graduating high school and/or dropping out. Instead, the results may illustrate students' tendency to affiliate with those having similar academic aspirations. In a study carried out by Carbonaro and Workman (2013), however, a distinction is made between types of friendship networks; specifically, close and distant friendships. The authors conclude that while the volume of close friendship ties is negatively associated with dropping out of school, the characteristics of close friends did not influence the likelihood of dropping out. In contrast, the characteristics of distant ties was positively associated with dropping out. A later study by Carbonaro and Workman (2016) illustrated the characteristics of friends' friends was at least as strong of a predictor as friends' characteristics on dropping out of school and expectations of college enrollment. Here, a homophily effect would dictate that the characteristics of close ties be more influential than those of distant ties, yet the works of Carbonaro and Workman show that distant ties are at least as important as close ties."}, {"section_title": "Selection Bias", "text": "As one may infer from the studies covered so far, selection bias is a pervasive issue when analyzing peer-influence on academic achievement, as it difficult to determine if the effects are, in fact, due to the influence of peers, or merely a reflection 6 between students and their peer groups. In other words, students' academic outcomes are not influenced by their peers so much as students with similar aspirations are more likely to interact with each other. Their associated outcomes may still be a product of individuals' background factors such as aspirations, interests, socioeconomic background, etc. Results from several studies illustrate why homophily is so problematic when peer effects are of concern. Early models of peer influence on educational and aspirational outcomes note the effects are potentially overshadowed by homophily effects (Haller & Butterworth, 1960;Alexander & Campbell, 1964;Duncan, Haller, & Portes, 1968). Additionally, many studies highlight the proclivity of youths to befriend other youths who share similar characteristics, such as race/ethnicity (Moody, 2001;Joyner & Kao, 2000), gender (Shrum, Creek, & Hunter, 1988), and behavior (Kandel, 1978;Cohen, 1977). In Kandel's (1978) study of adolescent friendships, for example, similarities in attitudes and opinions among youths were due to friendship choice, not peer influence. Utilizing longitudinal data on 957 \"best-schoolfriend dyads,\" the author illustrates students tend to \"coordinate their choices of friends and their behaviors\u2026so as to maximize congruency within friendship pairs.\" Dyads in which members shared similar frequencies of marijuana use, political identification, educational aspirations, and \"minor delinquent activities\" were more likely to remain intact at the end of the school year. Members of new dyads which formed during the school year also shared similarities in recreational drug use, political leanings, educational pursuits, and delinquent behaviors. Flashman (2012) also links educational aspirations and achievement to changing dynamics within friendship networks. In her study of high school students, results indicated that high-achieving students were more likely to develop friendship ties with other highachieving students. Corollary, low-achieving students were more likely to develop ties with low-achieving students. The link between educational achievement and choice of friends remained significant after controlling students' socioeconomic backgrounds, race/ethnicity, and proximity to other students. Taken together, these studies illustrate a seemingly endogenous relationship between student behavior and peer group influence. Several methodological approaches have been implemented by scholars as a means of isolating peer effects from homophily effects. Utilizing the Texas Schools Microdata Panel, Hoxby (2000), for example, used two separate strategies for measuring peer effects in the classroom, both of which control for school policies, school location, parental influence on classrooms/schools, student tracking by achievement, and a series of other factors that may introduce selection bias. The first strategy involved measuring the variation in adjacent cohorts' (groups who are in the same grade, in the same school, within the same academic year) share of gender and racial groups. In the second approach, the author measures idiosyncratic variation in achievement between student groups and tests whether classroom variation in race and gender is correlated with the variation in achievement. Results supported the \"peer effect\" hypothesis; students who were surrounded by high achieving peers earned higher reading scores. A 1-point increase in peers' test scores generated a .10 to .55 increase in students' test scores, depending on model specifications. Studies by Zimmerman (2003) and Sacerdote (2001) attempt to control for the selection bias, via quasi-experiments involving randomly assigned, first-year college roommates. In both studies, the authors examined students' achievement outcomes based on the achievement of their roommates. Zimmerman found that students who were assigned high achieving roommates earned a higher cumulative and first-semester GPA. Additionally, results indicated \"mid-level\" achievers who shared a room with \"low-level\" achievers had lower GPAs compared to their \"mid-level\" peers with middle and high achieving roommates. Sacedote 2001also found a link between freshmen GPAs and that of their roommates, though there was not an association between roommates' college majors or decisions related to the job market. In both Zimmerman's study of Williams College students and Sacedote's study of Dartmouth freshmen, students' academic achievement was significantly influenced by the achievement of peers, but the effect size was small."}, {"section_title": "Limitations to Human Capital Theory and Dual Labor Markets", "text": "Despite their usage in studies of educational attainment, human capital theory and Dual Labor Markets are not without limits. In both instances, there is the assumption of rational actions on the part of potential degree-seeking persons while neglecting several individual mechanisms which may also hold sway on the decision to pursue a degree. Specifically, background variables such as parents' highest level of education, parents' socioeconomic status, parental involvement in children's education, quality of home life, and cultural capital have been routinely illustrated to influence educational outcomes. As such, these factors may influence students' interpretation of available job opportunities as well as their decisions regarding human capital investment. It is entirely possible for students who grow up in areas with an abundance of diverse occupations requiring an Associate's or Bachelor's degree to opt out of college for employment at a local car dealership, product distribution center, etc. based on information and/or expectations of their parents, close relatives, friends, and peer groups. The fact that Human Capital Theory and Dual Labor Markets does not account for this is limiting. Several studies have illustrated parents' education and income influences both their children's educational attainment and occupational outcomes (Jimerson, Egeland, & Teo, 1999;Halle et al. 1997;Luster, Rhoades, & Haas,1989;Davis-Kean, 2005). Utilizing the 1997 Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Davis-Kean (2005), illustrated that parent's education and income directly the educational expectations they have of their children; hence indirectly affecting children's reading ability as well as their standardized math and reading scores. Additionally, Parent's education and income had a positive effect on parental warmth within the home environment which, in turn, has also been linked to higher educational outcomes (Glasgow et al, 1997). Dimaggio (1983) and Dimaggio and Mohr (1985) illustrate that cultural capital plays a significant role in education. Measuring several dimensions of cultural capital (attitudes towards the arts, cultural interests, etc.) on the academic performance of junior-year high school students, Dimaggio (1983) found cultural capital had a positive effect on math, English, and history grades among both male and females. In a latter study, Dimaggio and Mohr (1985) found cultural capital to not only improve grades during high school, but to also influence the likelihood of college enrollment. Additionally, cultural capital has also been illustrated to facilitate entry into high-wage, high-skill, professional occupations (Egerton, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Synthesis of the Literature and Road Map", "text": "Research utilizing human capital theory illustrates a strong, positive association between obtaining a high school and/or college degree and overall lifetime earnings, contributions to the local tax base, lowered unemployment, decreased dependency on social welfare, increased lifespan, better health and health care, and increased job satisfaction. In addition, previous studies show the incentives for earning a high school degree/GED and/or pursue a college education outweigh the loss of potential wages earned. Despite the incentives, many persons reside in areas void of the types of jobs which provide the above-mentioned incentives. What research has not addressed thus far is if and to what degree the composition of local markets incentivizes residents to complete high school and/or earn a college degree. While studies by Rees and Mocan (1997) and Rumberger (1983) include local employment characteristics as predictors of high school dropout rates, they do not account for the variation of local job opportunities. Whereas some studies have link high school dropout rates and college enrollment to boom and bust cycles within specific industries (Black et al, 2005;Morissette, Chan & Lu, 2014), research thus far has not assessed the influence of local job opportunities in multiple fields. In situations where; A) there are very few high-skill occupations locally/regionally; or B) recent graduates are not embedded in networks containing information about available high-skill, high-wage occupations; pursuing additional education/training may not be an appropriate avenue for maximizing income or job satisfaction. Dual labor market theory holds that the American labor market is essentially divided into good and bad jobs, the former found in primary markets and the later in secondary markets. Characteristics of jobs within primary markets include high pay; benefits such as paid vacation, sick leave, maternity leave, a retirement plan, etc.; and in most cases, are allocated to persons with an advanced skill set. Jobs in the secondary market are characteristically the exact opposite of jobs in the primary market (low pay, little or no benefits, does not require an advanced skill set, etc.). Within the context of the US; women, minorities, and immigrants are often relegated to the secondary labor market while white males occupy the primary market. Perhaps most salient to this study, however, is that primary jobs may be spatial inaccessibility, thus creating a roadblock to better incomes, increased benefits, etc. As such, if most occupations within local/region markets are low paying jobs that do not require an advanced skill set, fewer people within the area will have graduated high school and/or earned a college degree. On the other hand, if high paying occupations are readily accessible, people will be more likely to graduate high school and/or earn a degree. Studies of peer influence on educational outcomes have routinely illustrated a positive association between the \"company students keep\" and their academic performance, whether the effect is a product of influence or homophily. Thus far, research addressing educational outcomes has not compared/contrasted the influence on local labor markets to network/homophily effects. Lastly, several factors which are routinely associated with educational attainment and occupational outcomes are not included in this analysis due to data limitations. Specifically, data on cultural capital, individual mechanisms associated with parents' SES and education level, parental involvement with children's education, and connections to persons with information about potential job openings are not included in this study. As such, results cannot speak to how the occupational background of parents effect the occupational outcomes of their children; or how parental involvement in the local PTA and/or other school activities affects their children's educational prospects; or how network connections to persons working in high-wage, high-skill occupations may or may not influence students to earn a college degree so that they too may work within a similar industry; etc."}, {"section_title": "Roadmap", "text": "In Chapter II, I detail the methodological approach used to answer questions 1 through 5, and introduce a \"desirability\" index, utilized to divide 23 American Community Survey occupational categories into three distinct tiers.

Occupations for which employment growth has a significant impact on aggregate human capital growth are used in a second series of models examining their influence on the educational outcomes of individual respondents. In the final chapter, concluding remarks and a discussion of the study's implications are provided."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER II METHODOLOGY", "text": "The purpose of this study is to gauge the influence of local/regional labor market conditions on educational outcomes, using human capital and dual labor markets as guiding theories. To gain insight as to if and/or how labor market development influences local human capital development via high school completion and/or earning postsecondary degree, two modeling approaches are utilized. First, the influence of local employment growth with primary, midlevel, and secondary labor markets and individual occupations on the volume of high school graduates and college degree earners is assessed. Second, occupations found to significantly influence local human capital growth are transferred to a model gauging the educational attainment of individual respondents. When assessing the role of local job markets on educational outcomes, it is important to determine if growth in specific labor markets and occupations increase local human capital development prior to examining their role on individual outcomes. For the sake of parsimony, this study works under the assumption that if a specific job type does not generate an increase in regional human capital, it will not sufficiently motivate young adults to continue their education beyond necessity. 7 For example-and speaking hypothetically-if growth in sales occupations is associated with a proportional increase in the number of high school degrees but does not influence growth in the number of bachelor's degrees, then growth in sales occupations will positively influence the probability of graduating high school/earning a G.E.D., but have no bearing on postsecondary education. In this scenario, if a student wanted to pursue a career in sales, there would be no need to continue his/her education beyond high school, thus growth in sales occupations would not encourage the pursual of an Associate's or Bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Data", "text": "All data used to assess the influence of local employment growth by occupation on educational gains is culled from the 2000 decennial census and the 2014 American To measure growth over time in the dependent and independent variables, logged differences were calculated such that: where 1 is added to the total of each variable to prevent taking the log of 0 which is undefined. In the unlikely event that the volume of high school graduates, college degree earners, or employed persons in occupation \"X\" is 0 for in any given county, adding 1 to the total will still reflect the absence as; Log(0 + 1) = Log(1) = 0. Occupations are measured at two levels of aggregation, the first of which is as defined by the ACS. Second, all occupations are collapsed into three categories to reflect three distinct job markets; more precisely, the primary job market, a midlevel job market, and the secondary job market. As a means of collapsing occupations into one of three categories, a \"desirability\" index was constructed using data pulled from the 2014 ACS microdata set, provided by IPUMS. Data on individuals' income and educational attainment was standardized and summed across each occupation. Afterwards, an overall \"desirability\" score was generated by averaging the summed values for each occupation and ranking them in descending order. The top eight occupational categories were grouped together as tier-1 jobs and are intended to reflect occupations in the primary job market; the seven middle occupations represent the midlevel job market, and the bottom eight reflect the secondary job market. Table 2.1 lists all occupational categories, their corresponding education distribution, average income, desirability scores, and corresponding ranking. A brief description of the occupations is provided in the appendix. 8 In addition to employment changes by occupation, rural-urban continuum codes are also included to test for differences in earned degrees between rural and urban counties. Also, this will partially address differences between rural and urban labor markets, as the latter tends to be less developed than the former. Maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), rural-urban continuum codes range from 1 to 9 and detail counties' population size and proximity to a metro area. For the present analysis, the 2013 continuum codes are used as they are the most up-to-date. A detailed description of rural-urban continuum codes is located in table 2.2. Several race/ethnicity factors are included as control factors, as many studies have identified a racially-based education gap (Ladson-Billings, 2006;Reimers, Cordelia, 1983;Farkas, 2003). In addition, Rumberger (1983) and Rees and Mocan (1997) found that young white, Hispanic, and Black men respond differently to local labor market conditions. Previous labor market research has repeatedly illustrated that minority groups are overwhelming excluded from primary market occupations and often reside in areas with limited access to high-wage employment. As such, growth in the Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander, White, and Multiracial populations are accounted for. Ideally, this will allow for better assessment of the relationship between local job markets and human capital development. Metro -Counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population 3 Metro -Counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population 4 Nonmetro -Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area 5 Nonmetro -Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area 6 Nonmetro -Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, adjacent to a metro area 7 Nonmetro -Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area 8 Nonmetro -Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area 9 Nonmetro -Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area For example, Blau, Khan, and Waldfogel (2000) showed that the marriage rate of women are influenced by better female labor markets and worse male labor markets within 111 MSAs. In an analysis of 72 MSAs, Marquis and Long (2001) illustrated that employers are more likely to offer their employees health insurance at a higher contribution rate in tighter labor markets with greater unionization. McCall 2001 units as geographic labor market proxies as they are smaller than MSAs and take commuting patterns into consideration (Smith, 2012;Tolbert & Sizer, 1996). As such, results are more relatable to areas of the country other than metropolitan spaces. An additional method of measuring local labor market conditions-and implemented in this study-is to use counties as the geographical unit of interest. Though they typically do not constitute the entirety of a local labor market, the relatively smaller size of counties compared to MSAs or PUMAs allows researchers to gauge the influence of market conditions at a micro-level. Whereas employment opportunities may be plentiful in the east end of town, this does not mean they are plentiful in the western portion. Within the context of job opportunities and college enrollment, Borzick (2009) tied the high school location of graduating seniors to county-level unemployment rates and the availability of jobs that did not require a college degree. Thompson (2009) uses both county and state-level data to examine the influence of the minimum wage on teenage employment. Overall, there is not a single \"go to\" geographic unit that is used as a proxy for local labor markets."}, {"section_title": "Data for Model of Individual Outcomes", "text": "To measure the effect of local/regional labor market conditions on high school graduation, occupational employment shifts were measured at the county level over a period of 10 to 14 years. Employment-by-occupation data was culled from the 2000 US Census and the 2014 American Community Survey's (ACS) 5-year estimate. As with the aggregate models of human capital development, employment growth within primary, midlevel, and secondary labor markets are the main independent variables of interest. Growth in individual occupations, though of interest, is a secondary concern and their inclusion is more exploratory in nature. While this study aims to assess the influence of primary markets relative to midlevel and secondary markets, hypothesizing the influence of individual occupations goes beyond the scope. The primary dependent variables of interest were pulled from the 2002 Educational Longitudinal Survey (ELS). Collected in four waves, ELS provides nationally representative panel-data detailing students' \"trajectories from the beginning of high school into postsecondary education, the workforce, and beyond. 9 \" During the base year 10 in 2002, ELS surveyed high school sophomores, collecting data on where they went to high school, their class schedules, grades, standardized test scores, relationships with peers and school faculty, home life, etc. Respondents were surveyed again in 2004, 2006, and 2012 with questions ranging from whether they graduated high school to their current job prospects. In total, ELS contains more than 8,000 variables pertaining to respondents' education, high schools, colleges, occupations, etc. Several other measures were pulled from the ELS database to use as controls or to create new variables of interest. Regarding the former, respondents' demographics as well as their parents' educational attainment and income are routinely illustrated as influential on high school graduation (Sewell & Shah, 1968;Dubow, Boxer, & Huesman, 2009;Roscigno, 1998;Astone & McLanahan, 1991;Krien & Beller, 1998). Specifically, underrepresented minority students are less likely to graduate or earn a G.E.D. compared to their white peers (Dubow, Boxer, & Huesman, 2009;Roscigno, 1998). In addition, parent's education and income are positively associated with students' academic success (Sewell & Shah, 1968;Astone & McLanahan, 1991); the higher the degree obtained or income earned, the more likely respondents will graduate. Six variables are used to gauge the influence of social networks/homophily on degree attainment and labor market entry. Regarding the former, this study works with assumption that respondents are more likely to graduate high school if they are surrounded by friends and/or peers who plan to attend college after graduation, whether it's a product of influence or homophily. As for the latter, the line of reasoning is similar; respondents who are surrounded by friends and/or peers who plan to enter the labor force after high school are less likely to graduate and/or pursue a college degree. Two variables are used to gauge how many of the respondents' friends planned to attend a community college or a 4-year university after high school graduation. For both measures, four categories were provided: \"None,\" \"Some of them,\" \"Most of them,\" and \"All of them.\" Here, it is important to note that these were the responses available to respondents, and that data pertaining to these two survey items were not relabeled, categorized calculations based on the proportion of respondents' friends who planned to attend college, though it would be preferable. In addition, two index variables are used to gauge respondents' subjective views as to the desire of others. Specifically, they measure whether respondents believe their ties want them to go to college and/or get a job after high school graduation. Here, each index variable is the sum of responses to six dichotomous variables, creating two measures ranging from 0 to 6. Specifically, each survey item queries whether respondents felt as though they were expected to continue their education or enroll in college by their mother, father, other relatives, friend, favorite teacher, and school guidance counselor. A seventh survey item pertaining to respondents' favorite coach was also available, but not used since it severely restricted the pool of respondents (a considerably small proportion of high school students participate in sports compared to those who do not). Lastly, two school-level survey items were included as additional measures of peer influence and/or homophily, each measuring the percent of graduating seniors from the previous year 11 who entered the labor market/military or went to a 4-year university. All network/homophily survey items are located in the appendix. As with the aggregate model, the 2013 USDA rural-urban continuum codes 12 are used to gauge both the rurality and population size of counties. This will allow for the assessment of high school graduation differences based on students' proximity to urban areas."}, {"section_title": "The Aggregate Model", "text": "To assess whether employment gains by occupation influences individual students' educational attainment, I first assess local employment growth on local human capital development. This intermediary step is carried out for two reasons. First, as a means of data  Bachelor's degree earners will be used in a series of models assessing individual outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Models of Individual Outcomes", "text": "To gauge the influence of local labor markets on individual high school graduation outcomes, a step-wise logistic regression is utilized. Given that data used in the proceeding models are measured at three levels of aggregation, the structure is inherently hierarchical (students in schools in counties). In the preliminary stages of model construction, hierarchical modeling was attempted but ultimately abandon due to time constraints and a lack of convergence. Though a hierarchical model would have been preferable as it adjusts for the overestimation of individual-level factors and the underestimation of aggregate-level factors (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992); clustering the error terms in a logistic model is a viable alternative as it adjusts the standard error terms of coefficients based on the clustering units of interest. In the present study, the cluster units are county-level FIPS codes. In total, the model includes the responses of 12,670 respondents within 750 schools within 710 counties. 13 The labor market models take the form: where y is the probability of graduating high school, earning an Associate's degree, or earning a Bachelor's degree (three separate models), \u03b2 1 through \u03b2 3 represents one of three job markets, X1\u03b2 is the matrix-vector product of control variables, X2\u03b2 is the matrix-vector product of networks/homophily variables, and \u0454 is the error term. In addition to the model above, a second model with job types collapsed into their respective tiers will also be evaluated. The model is specified as: where y represents the outcome variables, \u03b2 1 through \u03b2 24 are the independent variables of interest, X1\u03b2 is the matrix-vector product of control variables, X2\u03b2 is the matrix-vector product of networks/homophily variables, and \u0454 is the error term.

Within the context of this study, counties are used as proxies for \"local. In addition to issues of defining the boundaries of \"local\" labor markets, having more information about the occupations would be ideal. Specifically, what type of benefits do they offer? How much variation is there in the distribution of education credentials among persons employed in Occupation X? Do all jobs in Occupation X require a specific degree? Most of them? Are certain jobs in Occupation X more or less similar to jobs in Occupation This, in turn, could still incentivize county residence to invest in their education."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "This study attempts to answer six questions. 1. Does employment growth in primary market occupations stimulate growth in the number of high school graduates and college degree earners? 2. Given (1) is verified, how does the impact of employment growth in primary occupations compare to the impact of growth in lower-tiered occupations? 3. Does employment growth in primary market occupations influence the probability of respondents graduating high school and/or earning a college degree? 4. Given (3), how does the impact of employment growth in primary occupations compare to the impact of growth in lower-tiered occupations? 5. Does employment growth in primary, mid-level, and secondary market occupations influence the probability of graduating high school and/or earning a degree when controlling for network/homophily effects? 6. Do occupations illustrated to affect regional growth/decline in the stock of degree earners translate into an increased/decreased probability of earning a degree? Regarding question 1, previous research illustrates students are more likely to graduate high school, enroll in college, etc. if there are strong incentives to do so. Black et al (2005) found students were more likely to remain in school when employment in coal-mining regions were low but were likely to drop out if wages were high. Other researchers highlight a similar linkage between college enrollment and local employment rates as well as fulltime/part-time enrollment status and employment rates. Taken  Similar to logic used for hypothesis/question 1, employment growth within primary market occupations will increase the probability of graduating high school, earning an Associate's degree, and/or earning a Bachelor's degree (question 3). If a prerequisite for access to local, primary market occupations is education beyond high school, respondents will be more likely to graduate high school and/or earn a college degree. As for question 4, growth in primary job markets are hypothesized to induce a higher probability of earning a college degree compare to growth in mid-level and secondary job markets. Regarding networks/homophily, question 5 proposes a direct comparison of employment effects and social network effects on earning a degree. While it is hypothesized that networks/homophily will have a positive impact on educational outcomes, it is beyond the scope of this study to address whether it will be larger or smaller than growth in primary, mid-level, and secondary job markets.  "}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Results", "text": "High School Graduation/G.E.D independent variables to the base model as opposed to just 3. Indeed, the partial F-statistic confers that the additional variance explained in model 3-compared to model 2-has more to do with the number of variables used instead of the explanatory power of the variables themselves. This indicates that the error of model 3 is slightly higher than model 1 and substantially higher than model 2. Overall, this suggests regressing human capital development against employment growth by labor market tiers is more parsimonious than regressing over individual occupations. Summary: Occupational Employment Growth and High School Graduation more high school graduates than primary market growth. Here again, this is likely due to the alignment of the skill set required in these occupations and the skill set provided by a high school education compared to a college education. In other words, the skills necessary to function as a personal care giver, for example, are more in line with the skills learned in high school whereas those learned in college would seldom be used. To gain better insight into which occupations exert the most influence on high school graduation, the standardized beta coefficients for all occupations were calculated, sorted, and color coded to designate the labor market they are categorized into (red = primary market; green = midlevel market; blue = secondary market). Jobs which proved uninfluential are not Associate's Degree Comparing growth within the primary and midlevel markets, the slope-effects are statistically the same when the standard errors are taken into account. This suggests job growth in both markets may incentivize local and regional residents to invest in their human capital. In addition, it also suggests the need for an education beyond high school is not confined to primary market occupations despite the average education of persons employed in midlevel market being slightly more than a high school degree. Regarding fit, the percent of explained variance increases by 10.7% when labor market tiers are introduced into the model. Further, the increased F-ratio informs us of a decrease in the mean of the squared residuals, thus a decrease in error compared to the null model. to the \"niche-like\" character of these occupational sectors and the number of available positions there within, relative to job types such as \"management,\" \"business,\" \"education,\" etc. In short, these findings support the hypothesis that job growth within the primary market will increase the volume of Bachelor's degrees earned. Overall, job growth within midlevel occupations does not stimulate as much growth in the number of residential Bachelor's degree earners, though the influence was stronger than expected; particularly within sales and office/administrative support. Comparatively, the influence of growth within these two occupational sectors is nearly on par with management. Employment growth in sales, for example, is projected to increase the volume of collegeeducated residents by 9.5% -14.8% if the number persons working in the sector doubles. As noted, the projected influence of management ranges between 11.7% and 17.0%, thus there is a sizable overlap. The projected influence of job growth within other midlevel occupations is significantly smaller than both sales and administrative support, stimulating less than 5% growth of Bachelor's degree holders. Examined as an occupational tier, the expansion of medium-wage job opportunities is illustrated to exert far more influence on human capital development than any individual midmarket position. For example, the volume of residential college graduates is projected to increase by 2.7% -3.7% in counties where midmarket job growth reaches 10%. At 25% growth, the volume of graduates increases by 6.8% -9.2%. Here again, this indicates that diversity within job markets matters more than individual occupations themselves. in the midlevel markets, as a whole, is slightly smaller. This is likely due to the varied educational requirements of jobs nested within the subcategories of mid-market occupations. Many jobs within sales and administrative support, for example, may require employees to have an Associate's or Bachelor's degree before considering them for employment. Only two mid-market occupations did not significantly contribute to counties' stock of Bachelor's degree earners; specifically, protective service jobs and installation and repair jobs. This suggests a large proportion of jobs within these industries do not require a college education, hence employment growth within these occupations generally would not provide incentive to pursue a postsecondary degree. Lastly, four secondary market occupations were illustrated to impact the volume of residential college graduates, three of which negatively so. While employment growth in personal care has a small, positive influence on human capital growth, gains in production and construction/extraction, and farming were negatively associated with human capital growth. This suggests that most jobs grouped into these categories do not require their employees to have earned a 4-year degree for employment, thus job opportunities in these fields do not incentivize continuing one's education beyond high school. As illustrated, all labor market tiers and many individual occupations are associate with local human capital growth via increases in the number of high school graduates, Associate's degree earners, and Bachelor's degree earners. The caveat is that the extent of those gains is dependent on the type of occupations available. Comparatively, expansion in primary markets generated more growth than mid-level or secondary market occupations in terms of 4-year degree earners, yet did not increase the number of high school graduates as much as mid-level markets. This pattern becomes more apparent when considering labor market tiers. For example, counties' stock of high school graduates was predicted to increase by 8.3% -14.10% for each doubling of employment within primary market occupations, 29.3% -36.0% within mid-market occupations, and 9.0% -15.2% within secondary market occupations. As such, primary market job opportunities are about as influential as secondary job market opportunities when it comes to growth in the number of high school graduates; midlevel markets are far more influential in this respect. As for the second hypothesis, \"growth in primary market occupations will generate a larger increase in college degree earners, compared to the mid-level and secondary job markets;\" is partially supported. Specifically, expansion of primary market employment increased counties' stock of Bachelor's degree earners yet midlevel market growth generated more Associate's degree earners."}, {"section_title": "Implications for model of individual outcomes", "text": "Results from this chapter dictate which variables are used to assess the relationship between county-level job growth and individuals' educational attainment outcomes. Only those occupations which have a significant impact on counties' human capital growth are included, thus job growth in \"Architecture & Engineering,\" \"Production,\" and \"Transportation\" will not be used to assess the probability of graduating high school; \"Protective Services,\" \"Healthcare Support\", \"Personal Care,\" \"Food Preparation,\" and \"Maintenance\" will not be used to assess earning a 2-year degree; etc. That said, a model with all 23 ACS occupations grouped into their respective tiers will be utilized to evaluate the aggregate influence of growth within primary, mid-level, and secondary markets. In addition, results from this model will be used to support or refute hypotheses 3, 4, and 5.         Results indicate employment growth plays a small yet significant role in respondents' education outcomes. Networks, however, play a much larger role. As illustrated in table 4.1, the average number of respondents' friends who planned to attend community college after high school falls between \"Some\" and \"Most.\""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics of Individual Outcomes", "text": "Comparatively, respondents reported that \"Most\" to \"All\" of their friends had plans to attend a 4-year college. It's difficult to ascertain how representative these figures are of the general populous circa 2004, the year most ELS participants would have graduated. According to the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) 23 , 55.7% of graduates enrolled in college the following semester (in 2004). This would roughly correspond to \"Most.\" On average, respondents reported about two-thirds of persons with whom they have close ties encouraged them to enroll in college. Here again, the purpose of this measure is to gauge the degree to which respondents feel they are expected to pursue a college degree; the more encouraged they feel to continue their education beyond high school, the more likely they will actually graduate high school. The average of this index variable suggests that over half of respondents' close ties wanted them to continue their education. In comparison, very few respondents reported their close ties preferred them to get a job instead of pursuing a postsecondary degree. In fact, of the 12,670 respondents, less than 10% believed any of their ties wanted them to seek employment immediately after graduation. Corollary, and at the school level, an average of 44.5% of the previous year's graduating class enrolled at 4-year universities the following semester, and 11.33% entered the job market. By and large, most respondents attended high school in metro counties with a population nearing 250,000, as suggested by an average rurality score of 2.95. Regarding primary market occupations, there was growth among all job types, from a low of 1.23% in architecture and engineering to a maximum of 36.39% in healthcare practitioner jobs. Compared to the descriptive statistics for the aggregate model (table 3.1), employment gains in the logistic model differ substantially, likely due to the smaller number of counties included in the model as well as repeated observations. For example, average employment gains in management and education, educational training, and library occupations were 9.46% and 9.71%, respectively, when all 3,142 counties are included. When the sample is reduced to 710-the number of counties corresponding to respondents' high school locations-employment gains increase to 18.14% and 19.74% respectively. In addition, the spread in employment growth by occupation is not as pronounced. This suggests that respondents' counties of origin may fundamentally differ from counties not included in the logistic model. Overall, job growth in primary labor markets averaged 22.2%. From 2000 to 2014, there was 4.2% employment gain in mid-level market occupations, with a large degree of variation by job type. For example, employment in installation & repair as well as office and administrative support positions decreased by 8.4% and 2.4%, respectively. At the other extreme, employment in healthcare technologies, protective services, and community & social services increased by an average of 41.7%, 28.2%, and 26.2%, respectively. There were modest expansions within art, design, & entertainment as well as sales occupations, each experiencing 11.6% and 6.3% growth. Average county growth in the majority of secondary market occupations was substantial, with the only decline occurring in production. Positive growth in both healthcare support and personal care, coupled with employment gains in healthcare technologies and healthcare diagnoses suggest a general upward trend in demand for health-related occupations; a pattern most likely attributable to an aging baby-boom population, many of which are approaching retirement. Average employment growth in maintenance as well as food preparation and service jobs was considerably larger compared to growth in the majority of occupations in all three tiers. This suggests a continued increase in service based occupations. Comparing average employment gains within each occupational tier, there was more growth within primary labor markets at 22.2%. Additionally, growth within each individual tier-1 occupation exceeds 15%, and three exceed 20%. This suggests an increasing demand for skilled workers among employers, which is hypothesized to have a positive impact on the likelihood of graduating high school, earning an Associate's degree, and earning a Bachelor's degree. Job growth within the mid-level market was substantially smaller at just 4.2% between 2000 and 2014. Growth within the secondary market was more than three times that of mid-market occupations at 13.8%."}, {"section_title": "Logistic Model Results", "text": "High School Graduation/G.E.D. Table 4.2 highlights the odds of earning a high school degree or a G.E.D. based on assessed independent variables across three models. Model 1 details the influence of rurality and information access about college via network/homophily effects. Model 2 introduces employment growth within primary, midlevel, and secondary labor markets. The final model accounts for all three tiers, rurality, and network/homophily effects. Of note, the influence of control variables is not displayed in any of the models. Indicated in model 1, networks/homophily have a significant impact on the probability of graduating high school. Respondents who reported their friends planned on attending college were more likely to graduate compared to their counterparts. Here, the magnitude and significance is dependent on the type of college respondents' friends want to attend. Participants were projected to be 10.2% more likely to graduate high school if some of their friends planned to attend a 2-year community college and 51.2% more likely if they planned to enroll at a 4-year university. Corollary, those who reported nearly all of their friends planned to attend a 2-year or 4-year college are projected to be 30.6% and 153.3% more likely to graduate. Students believing their family, friends, peers, etc. wanted them to enroll in college were more likely to graduate high school. Respondents who reported that at least one close family member, peer, or school faculty member encouraged them to attend college were nearly 30% 24 more likely to graduate or earn a G.E.D. This suggests the average student would more than likely graduate, since participants reported receiving encouragement from about 3 close ties. High school graduation was not effected by encouragement to enter the job market though. This is likely due to most occupations requiring potential employees to have at least earned a high school degree. The percentage of the previous year's graduating class that enrolled in college or entered the job market had a positive effect on the likelihood of graduation. In both instances, respondents were 2.4% more likely to graduate for each percentage increase in the number of the previous year's cohort that went to a 4-year university. The location of respondents' high schools also influenced whether they graduated, with rural schools outperforming urban and suburban schools. The constant for model 1 indicates that, on average, students have a fairly high likelihood of finishing high school-predicted to be about 80%. Regarding fit, two test statistics will be utilized to gauge whether the addition of labor market and occupation variables improve the base model. The BIC is used to determine if the inclusion of additional variables offers more explanatory power, controlling for the number of factors used. Ideally, the BIC value should decrease the more complex the model becomes, indicating a better fit. Tjur's-R 2 will be used in conjunction with the BIC, though it is not based on the percent reduction of the negative log likelihood. Instead, it is the difference between the predicted mean likelihood of an event occurring and the predicted mean likelihood of the event not occurring. In model 1, for example, the predicted mean likelihood of respondents graduating high school was 95.5% while the predicted mean of not graduating was 4.5%. The difference between the two values is 91%. 25 Whereas the BIC should ideally decrease with the addition of occupational variables, the Tjur's R 2 should increase, indicating the gap between the predicted mean of graduating, earning a Associate's etc. and the predicted mean of not graduating, etc. has widened. In model 2, the influence of employment growth within primary, midlevel, and secondary labor markets are added to the model. Whereas the influence of job growth in individual occupations may be too small to measure, collapsing occupations into their respective tiers may illuminate labor market influences on high school graduation that are otherwise invisible. Results indicate that employment gains within primary labor markets are a significant predictor of finishing high school/earning a G.E.D. Here, a 1% increase in employment is predicted to generate a 2.37% increase in the likelihood of graduating. Attending high school in counties where primary market job growth was extreme would heavily influence respondents' educational outcomes. If primary market employment were to increase by 10%, respondents are predicted to be 23.7% more likely to graduate; at 25% it increases to 59.3%, and so on. In short, employment growth in high-skill, high-wage occupations begets an increased likelihood of finishing high school, thus it may function as an incentive for students to invest in their education. Regarding model fit though, the Tjur's R 2 (still .911), BIC (increased from 3253.03 to 3276.62), and network/homophily factors are virtually unchanged compared to model 1. This suggests the inclusion of job growth by occupational tier does not add any additional explanatory power to the base model, despite the significance of growth within primary markets. Model 3 parses out occupations within each labor market tier which were found to significantly affect local human capital growth. As with models 1 and 2, respondents who attended high school in rural and suburban counties were more likely graduate, all other factors being equal. Additionally, the predicted magnitude of effect was roughly the same as in previous models, or about a 12.8% increased/decreased chance of graduating per unit change. Among primary market occupations, employment growth within management and business & finance are illustrated to increase the odds of obtaining a degree. Regarding management, the impact is substantial, predicted to increase the likelihood of graduation by 1.9% for every 1% increase in employment. This suggests the availability of jobs within management may incentivize students to finish high school as they may not be considered for As for model fit, the Tjur's R 2 remains unchanged when all occupational factors are incorporated into the model. Additionally, the BIC increases from 3253.03 in the base model to 3366.29 in the full model. This suggests that county-level predictors did not add any additional explanatory power to the networks/homophily model despite the influence of employment gains in primary labor markets, management occupations, and the food and service industry. As with models 1 and 2, network/homophily factors are virtually unchanged. Summary: Networks/Homophily, Employment Growth, and High School Graduation Table 4.3 summarizes influential factors of high school graduation as well as a few nonsignificant factors for added context. Broken up into four sections, the table converts odds ratios to percentages and details how a unit change in \"x\" affects \"y\". The unit of change is unique in each section, thus each has its own designated heading. Here, the purpose is to better compare and contrast the roles of social networks/homophily and job growth on earning a high school degree/G.E.D. Overall, networks/homophily are more influential on respondents' educational outcomes compared to local job growth. Regarding \"Networks & Homophily 1,\" students who reported at least a few of their friends had college aspirations were more likely to finish high school. If most of their friends planned to attend college, the likelihood of graduation was amplified. It is important to note, however, the extreme range associated with each network factor. For example, if a few friends planned to attend community college, respondents are projected to be 2.2% -18.4% more likely to finish high school. If most of their friends planned to attend community college the range increases to 6.6% -55.2%. Another way of interpreting this is having connections to people with minor college ambition may influence one's education a little or a lot. What can be said with more certainty is the difference of influence between having friends who want to go to community college vs. having friends who want to go to a 4-year college is substantial. Having just a few Bachelor's-seeking friends is projected to increase the likelihood of graduation by 41.1% -63.4%. The expectations of others also exert a substantial influence as to whether respondents finished high school or earned a G.E.D. Having at least one contact who harbors college aspirations for the respondent is projected to increase their odds of graduating by 24.2% -35.5%. The strongest network/homophily predictors, however, were the actions of the previous graduating cohort. For example, if students were enrolled at an institute in which 25% of the previous cohort attended a 4-year college; they were 50.0% -72.5% more likely to graduate. If 25% of the previous cohort entered the job market, respondents were 42.5% -87.5% more likely to graduate. Job growth within counties can substantially impact the odds of finishing high school. As with a few networks/homophily effects, however, there is some uncertainty as to just how impactful it actually is. For example, employment growth within management was predicted to have a positive influence on the odds of high school graduation. From table 4.3, the projected likelihood of graduating increases by .39% -4.9% for each 1% increase in employment. Of the 710 counties included in this analysis, the volume of persons employed in management increased by 100% or more in 4 of them. So, in those four counties the likelihood of finishing high school is projected to have increased by at least 39.0% -490.0%. Similarly, employment growth within primary markets is projected to increase the likelihood of high school graduation by .33% -7.52% per 1% increase. Within the same four counties, growth in primary market employment also exceeded 100%, equating to an increased likelihood of 33.0% -752.0%. Collectively, this indicates very few counties experienced extreme growth in the number of management and/or primary market positions, and among those that did, the impact could have ranged from extreme to minimal. As such, all that can be said is that perceived job opportunities within management and/or primary market occupations potentially incentivizes students to finish high school. Associate's Degree Table 4.4 details the log-odds results of obtaining an Associate's degree based on employment growth within county labor markets and network/homophily effects. Several network/homophily measures significantly influence the odds of earning a junior college degree. First, respondents were more likely to earn an Associate's if at least some of their friends planned to attend a 2-year college after high school and less likely if they planned to attend a 4-year college. Regarding the former, students were predicted to be 26.1% more likely to obtain a degree if at least some their friends planned to attend community college. If all of their friends planned to enroll, this figure increases to 78.3%. As for the latter, respondents were 12.1% less likely to earn a 2-year degree if some of their friends planned to attend a 4-year university and 36.3% less likely if all of them planned to enroll. Whether respondents believed they were expected to go to college and/or enter the labor market after high school is also illustrated to affect their educational outcomes. Those who felt their parents, friends, peers, etc. wanted them to go to college were more likely to continue their education and earn an Associate's. Those who felt expected to enter the job market were less likely to earn a degree, though it is unclear whether this means they were also less likely to pursue a postsecondary degree, and/or more likely to get a job immediately after high school. Respondents who felt that at least one of their close ties (mother, father, other relative, friend, school counselor, etc.) wanted them to enroll in college were projected to be 5.8% more likely to do so, eventually earning a degree. If all measured ties encouraged them to continue, the predicted odds increased to 34%. Comparatively, believing friends and relatives prefer labor market entry to college enrollment is a stronger incentive; on average, respondents were projected to be 15.3% less likely to earn a 2-year degree for each tie they believed would prefer it if they [respondents] would get a job after graduation. If respondents believed this of all measured ties, it is projected to decrease the odds by 91.8%. From model 2, employment growth in primary and secondary labor markets significantly impact the likelihood of earning an Associate's. Regarding primary labor markets, job growth positively influences on education outcomes predicted to increase the odds of earning a degree by about 1.5% for each 1% increase in employment. Growth within secondary markets has the opposite effect, reducing the likelihood of degree obtainment by about .56% per 1% gain in employment. Mid-level market occupations do not influence degree attainment. Taken together, this supports the assumption that access to higher paying and higher skilled jobs increases the likelihood of local residents investing in their education. Likewise, respondents are less likely to pursue education beyond high school if it is not requirement for local employment. Regarding fit, a slightly larger BIC statistic for model 2 indicates the addition of labor market effects to network/homophily factors does not add additional explanatory power to the model despite the significant influence of primary and secondary market growth. In addition, the Tjur's R 2 remains static at .87. This suggests that while occupational opportunities may incentivize respondents to pursue a 2-year degree, the educational preferences of persons within their networks is more influential. In the full model, employment growth in four occupations significantly impacts respondents' educational outcomes. Within the primary market, growth in the healthcare industry increases the likelihood of earning an Associate's; suggesting local development within the medical field may incentivize students to pursue a postsecondary education. Within local midlevel labor markets, job creation within art, design, and entertainment is negatively influential, predicted to reduce the likelihood of degree attainment by an average of .28% per 1% of employment growth. This suggests students are less likely to consider a career in the entertainment industry when deciding whether they should enroll in college. Further, this likely indicates students believe a high school education is sufficient enough for most entertainment-related occupations. Among secondary market occupations, an increased availability of production and farming jobs reduces the likelihood of earning an Associate. Employment growth within production, for example, is predicted to decrease the odds by an average of about .4% per 1% increase in persons employed within the industry. Bachelor's if their friends attend 4-year schools. We can only surmise that being surrounded by Bachelor's-degree-seeking friends decreases the probability of earning an Associate's. Additionally, students' decisions on their own human capital investment is shaped and molded by to the desires and expectations of family, friends, peers, etc. For example, the likelihood of students continuing their education beyond high school is projected to increase by 1.7% -9.7% for every person within their network who wanted them to go to college. Further, respondents were 4.4% -25.1% less likely to earn a degree for each network tie that preferred they enter the labor market after graduation. The actions of the previous graduating cohort is also influential, slightly decreasing the odds of earning an Associate's if they enrolled at a 4-year institution in mass. As with several occupations mentioned thus far, the projected range of influence of job growth is fairly broad. For example, employment gains within healthcare is predicted to increase degree attainment by .05% -1.07% per 1% growth. If the number of employed persons were to double, the range would increase to 4.6% -107.0%. As such, it is difficult to pin down how attractive local careers in medicine are to potential college students. Likewise, it is hard to say anything concrete as to the size of the impact of growth within the entertainment, manufacturing, and farming industries-only that the impact is indeed negative. Similar to growth within individual occupations, the predicted range of impact associated with job development within primary and secondary labor markets is rather large. Within primary markets, the degree of influence ranges from .27% -4.2% for each 1% of employment growth. In counties where primary market employment has doubled, the range increases to 26.8% -416.0%. As for secondary market growth, each doubling is projected to reduce the odds of degree obtainment by 18.7% -76.5%. Collectively, this suggests that while the local availability of high-wage and low-wage occupations significantly impacts students' human capital investment decisions, the magnitude of influence ranges from \"a little\" to \"a lot.\" Bachelor's Degree Table 4.6 highlights the influence of networks/homophily, high school location, and job growth on the likelihood of earning a Bachelor's degree. In the base model, all network/homophily variables are illustrated to significantly impact the odds of earning a Bachelor's degree. For example, respondents were less likely to earn a 4-year degree if their friends planned to enroll at a junior college after high school, yet more likely if their friends planned to attend a 4-year university. Here, the difference in projected influence is substantial, suggesting that network ties to Bachelor's-seeking friends many outweigh the negative influence of ties to Associate's seekers. On average, respondents were projected to be 39.5% more likely to earn a Bachelor's if a few of their friends (compared to none of them) planned to enroll at a 4-year university. Ties to a few Associate-seeking friends is projected to decrease 4-year degree attainment by about 12%. Despite the negative association, the relative influence of friends attending a 4-year university is more influential. If respondents had an equal number of friends planning to enroll in community college and a 4-year university, they themselves were more likely to earn a Bachelor's degree. The desires of respondents' parents, other family members, friends, peers, etc. has a strong impact on earning a 4-year degree. For example, the projected likelihood of students continuing their education beyond high school increased by 14.5% for each person wanting the respondent to go to college. Further, projected degree attainment is reduced by 31.1% for each tie who preferred they enter the labor market. Similarly, an increase in volume of the previous graduating cohort who enrolled in a 4-year college was positively associated with earning a degree while entering the job market or military was inversely related. Collectively, this highlights the importance of social networks/homophily in respondents' decisions regarding their own human capital development. From model 2, job growth in midlevel labor market occupations is negatively associated with Bachelor's degree attainment. Here, the odds of graduating college are projected to be reduced by roughly .5% for each 1% of employment growth within medium-wage occupations. Oddly though, job growth in the primary markets does not influence college completion, yet from table 4.4 and 4-5, both affect the likelihood of earning an Associate's. This suggests respondents are able to find jobs within the primary market despite not having a 4-year degree and/or many jobs within the primary market do not require a BA. As such, respondents invest as much as necessary in their own human capital to earn a 2-year degree. Further, job growth within secondary markets marginally influences 4-year degree attainment-a finding that seems somewhat counterintuitive. Here, a local overabundance of low-wage jobs may incentive students to finish college and seek employment outside of the region. Additionally, it may reflect services typically used in college town by current students, i.e., fast food, recreational activities, etc. As the demand for student-oriented services increases, so too does the volume of persons required to provide these services. Regarding fit, the addition of employment growth within local labor markets increases the BIC statistic by 20, indicating the inclusion of network/homophily factors along with control variables is more parsimonious. degree. If they planned to attend a 2-year college, respondents were less likely to earn a 4year degree. On the other hand, if they planned to attend a 4-year college, respondents were more likely to earn a 4-year degree. Coupled with an increased probability of earning an Associate's if friends planned to attend community college (tables 4-4 and 4-5), we can now assert respondents tend to pursue the same type of degree (2-year, 4-year, professional, etc.) as their friends, be it a product of peer influence or the tendency to associate with persons similar to themselves. Again, the desires and expectations of others seemed to impact students' decisions in relation to their own human capital development. For example, the likelihood of respondents continuing their education beyond high school is projected to increase by 11.7% -17.6% for every person within their networks who wanted them to go to college. Further, respondents were .2% -.3% less likely to earn a degree for each network tie that preferred they enter the labor market after high school graduation. The human-capital related decisions of the previous cohort impacted respondents' decision making in a similar fashion. As the proportion of graduates who enrolled in a 4-year college increased, so too did the likelihood of earning a Bachelor's degree. As the proportion of graduates entering the labor market increased, the probability that respondents would earn a Bachelor's decreased. As with high school completion and Associate degree attainment, job growth is not as influential on respondents' education outcomes. Here again, the projected ranges of influence are substantial. For example, development within the farming industry is projected to increase the odds of earning a Bachelor's degree by .01% -.2% for each percent of employment growth. If farming employment were to double, the projected increase in odds ranges between 1% and 20%. The impact of job availability within local secondary labor markets can range from a .01% -1.2% increased likelihood at 1% growth to a 1.0% -120.0% at 100% growth. In short, while employment growth within midlevel and secondary markets is influential, the magnitude of effect can range from miniscule to large. Perhaps the most counter-intuitive finding however is that job growth within local primary markets did not influence Bachelor's degree attainment. This suggests those who finished college did not consider employment in local, high-wage occupations as a reason to pursue their degree. Further, growth in mid-level occupations negatively impacted the likelihood of earning a 4year degree. This may be due to the fact that the majority of mid-level occupations do not require a Bachelor's as a prerequisite to employment, thus job growth in these industries decreases the likelihood of finishing college. Table 4.8 summarizes factors found to influence the likelihood of finishing high school,"}, {"section_title": "Discussion/Conclusion", "text": "earning an Associate's degree, and earning a Bachelor's degree. Overall, county-level employment growth in just a handful of occupations influenced respondents' educational outcomes, and the occupations which proved influential varied by degree. Among high school graduates, growth in a single primary market occupations significantly influences the odds of earning a degree or a GED. Specifically, growth in management occupations significantly influenced the probability of graduation, though; A) growth must be substantial to have a sizeable effect; and B) the projected impact can range from minute to substantial, thus it is difficult to say anything concrete about the availability of management-oriented occupations as an incentive to graduate high school. When primary market occupations are aggregated together however, the association is positive thus lending partial support to hypothesis 3; employment growth in primary market occupations will have a positive impact on degree attainment. Again, however, it is important to note the projected range of influence is broad. Growth in mid-market occupations proved non-influential whereas job growth in a single secondary market occupation-food preparation and service-was negatively associated with graduation. Here again though, the effect size was small, equating to a .13% -.84% decline in the odds of graduation per 1.0% employment growth. This, coupled with the fact that the aggregate effect of secondary market occupations was not influential-it is difficult to say anything concrete about the relation between low-skill, lowpay jobs and high school graduation. Job growth in primary market occupations was also shown to affect the likelihood of earning an Associate's degree. Specifically, job growth in management and healthcare improve the likelihood of earning 2-year degree, the former considerably more so than the latter. In addition, the aggregate influence substantially improves the odds, projected to increase them by as much as 5.2% per percentage of employment growth. From this we can inferred that local job growth within primary markets incentivizes students to finish high school as well as pursue additional education. Strangely though, local growth with primary markets did not affect the likelihood of earning a Bachelor's degree. This may suggest those pursuing a 4-year degree look beyond local markets for job prospects, hence local economic conditions do not factor into their decision to attend college. Respondents have likely considered a plethora of potentially job opportunities before attending a 4-year university. Job growth within mid-market occupations is not as influential on educational outcomes when considered as an aggregate whole. In fact, growth within individual mid-market industries did not influence the likelihood of finishing high school or earning a Bachelor's degree, though growth in the entertainment industry reduced the odds of earning an Associate's. As an aggregate labor market, however, it is projected to reduce influence the probability of earning a Bachelor's by as much as .63% per percent of employment growth. In addition, job growth in the arts and entertainment industry is negatively associated with earning a 2-year degree, though does not affect the likelihood of graduating high school or earning a Bachelor's. Regarding secondary market occupations, growth within food service and farming industries are illustrated to influence the educational outcomes of respondents, thus here too, the type of jobs locally available may affect peoples' decisions on their own human capital investments. Job growth within the food preparation industry-an industry dominated by fast food jobs which do not require employees to have a high school degree-decreased the likelihood of graduating high school, but was not associated with earning a college degree. Growth in the farming industry negatively impacts the odds of earning a 2-year degree, yet increases the odds of earning a Bachelor's. When aggregated, employment growth within secondary labor markets are illustrated to negatively affect the odds of earning an Associate's degree yet positively affect the likelihood of earning a Bachelor's. Perhaps the most illuminating, though unsurprising aspect of this study is the strong association between network/homophily factors and degree attainment. By and large, networks not only have a great deal of influence on educational outcomes-thus decisions regarding human capital-they also exert a stronger impact compared to local labor market conditions. For example, respondents who reported having friends with college aspirations were more likely to graduate high school and earn an Associate's or Bachelor's degree, depending on the type of college they wanted to attend. Having friends who wanted to attend a 2-year college increased the likelihood of earning an Associate's but had a negative effect on earning a Bachelor's. Likewise, having friends who wanted to attend a 4-year college increased the odds of earning a Bachelor's but was negatively associated with earning a 2year degree. Additionally, students who felt as though their parents, relatives, friends, teachers, etc. expected them to enroll in college were more likely to finish high school as well as earn a college degree. If they felt as though they were supposed to get a job after high school, they were less likely to earn an Associate's or Bachelor's. Even the post-high school graduation plans of the previous senior cohort influenced whether respondents themselves graduated high school and/or earned a 4-year degree."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses Revisited", "text": "Support for hypotheses three, four, and five has been mixed. Regarding hypothesis 3 (Employment growth within primary market occupations will increase the probability of graduating high school, earning an Associate's degree, and/or earning a Bachelor's degree), job growth within primary market occupations was positively associated with graduating high school and earning a 2-year degree, but had no effect on earning a 4-year degree. When disaggregated, job growth in management occupations had a positive effect on finishing high school and earning an Associate's degree. Growth in the healthcare industry increased the odds of earning an Associate's but had no effect on high school or college graduation. Overall, results offer partial support to hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 4, Employment growth in primary job markets will induce a higher likelihood of earning an Associate's degree and earning a Bachelor's degree compared to job growth in the mid-level and secondary job markets, is partially supported. First, employment growth in midlevel job markets had a negative impact on the odds of earning a Bachelor's degree, yet primary market growth affected the odds of earning an Associate's but not a Bachelor's. Oddly though, growth in secondary markets was positively associated with earning a 4-year degree. Here again, this may suggest local labor markets are not a consideration for those who decide to pursue a college degree. They may in fact, \"casting a wider net\" so to speak, i.e., take regional, state, and national markets into account. Further, employment growth within secondary labor markets may reflect services solicited by students in college towns. Hypothesis 5, Social Networks/Homophily will positively impact students' education outcomes; is also confirmed, and it should be noted that the influential difference between job growth and network/homophily factors is quite large, and in favor of the latter. In addition to the large cleavage in magnitude, the Tjur's R 2 statistic remained static between all models of high school graduation, earning an Associate's degree and earning a Bachelor's degree. In conjunction with the ever-increasing BIC value between models; one can conclude that while local job growth within high-pay, high-skill occupations plays a role in respondents' education outcomes, it takes a back seat to the company they keep.   3-2, 3-5, and 3-8, the potential impact of employment growth varies by labor market, occupation type, and degree of interest. Also of note, the amount of employment growth required to produce sizable increases/decreases in the volume of residential degree earners is substantial. Regarding high school, a doubling of employment in management, for example, was predicted to increase the volume graduates by 5.7% -9.4%. For reference, recall from table 3.1 the mean growth in employment within management positions between 2000 and 2014 was 9.5%. This translates to about a .2% -1.0% increase in degree earners. A similar pattern occurs when considering other degree-types. A doubling of employment in office/administrative support was projected to increase the volume of Associate's degree recipients by 14.9% -22.7%, yet average growth for the industry stood at -1.6%; a doubling of employment in education was projected to increase the volume of Bachelor's degree earners by 15.6% -19.5%, yet average growth was 9.7%. Collectively, this suggests that while employment growth within primary, midlevel, and secondary labor markets-and the jobs there within-may influence the type of degree local/regional residents ultimately earn, the effect size can be quite small. After accounting for the effects of employment growth on aggregate human capital development, occupational tiers as well was the job types found to be significantly influential were transferred to a series of logistic models as a means of analyzing the influence of local labor markets on individuals' education outcomes. In addition, the influence of social networks/homophily was also included such that the impact of local market conditions and social ties could be compared. Overall, job growth in primary market occupations increased the probability of respondents graduating high school and earning an Associate's degree, but had no bearing on Bachelor's degree attainment. The influence of social networks/homophily on high school graduation was readily apparent. If respondents' friends had college ambitions, they were more likely to finish high school. In addition, if students felt as though their family, friends, peers, etc. expected them to go to college, they were more likely to do so. Further, if members of the previous graduating cohort enrolled in college or entered the labor market, respondents were again, more likely to graduate. Regarding Associate's degree attainment (table 4.4), job growth within primary and secondary markets were significantly influential factors; with the former associated with increased odds, the latter with decreased odds. When labor markets were parsed out by occupations found to influence aggregate human capital development, job growth within the healthcare industry was positively associated with earning a 2-year degree, projected to increase the odds by as much as 1.07% for each percent of employment growth. Further development of the arts & entertainment industry, production, and farming reduced the odds. Once again, networks/homophily were found to be substantially influential, though unlike their impact on high school graduation, a few factors had a negative impact. For example, the odds of earning a 2-year degree increased if respondents' friends planned to enroll in community college, but declined if they planned to enroll at a 4-year university. Similarly, the odds decreased if the previous graduating cohort tended to enroll at 4-year universities. The same affect occurs in regards to the desires and expectations of others, with the odds of earning a degree increasing if respondents felt as though they were expected to go to college, yet decreased if they believed their family, friends, peers, etc. expected them to get a job after graduating high school. From table 4.6, employment growth within midlevel and secondary markets were found to influence the odds of earning a Bachelor's degree, yet only one occupation was found to be influential. Regarding midlevel markets, job growth had a net negative effect on college graduation, projected to decrease the odds by an average of .494% for each percent of job growth. Counterintuitively, development of secondary markets was found to be positively influential while primary market growth did not have an effect. These two phenomena may be linked, however. Bachelor's seekers maybe incentivized by perceived job opportunities outside of their local region due to the overabundance of low-wage occupations. Bachelor's degree attainment was also shown to be affected by respondents' social networks. If a respondent's friends planned to enroll in community college, (s)he was less likely to earn a Bachelor's degree, yet if they planned to enroll at a 4-year university, (s)he was more likely to earn a Bachelor's. The same pattern occurs when considering the desires and expectations of others as well as the actions of the previous graduate cohort. If respondents believed their family members, peers, etc. preferred them to go to college; they were more likely to attain a 4-year degree. If they felt they were expected to enter the job market, they were less likely to finish college. Likewise, if the previous graduating cohort went to college, respondents were more likely to go to college; if the cohort entered the work force, respondents were more likely to enter the workforce. Across all logistic models, the influence of job growth was shown to fluctuate to a large degree. From table 4.5, for example, development within primary markets was projected to increase the odds of earning an Associate's by .28% -5.2% per percentage increase in employment. Secondary market development is projected to decrease the odds by .18% -.74%. Held at the county average, this means the projected odds of a respondent earning 2year degree increases by 6.2% -115.4% due to employment growth in the local primary market. Corollary, the odds are reduced by 4.0% -16.4% due to employment growth in the local secondary market. As such, nothing concrete can be said about the influential magnitude of primary and secondary markets on earning an Associate's; only that the former is positively influential, while the latter is negatively influential. This pattern is pervasive across all models of educational attainment. Overall, it is difficult to say whether the expansion of job opportunities is as influential on individuals' human capital decisions as the company they keep. The volume of growth required to increase respondents' prospects of finishing high school and/or earning a college degree can be substantial and the magnitude of effect can range considerably. A 1.0% increase in employment within local primary markets, for example, is projected to increase the odds of earning an Associate's degree by .28% -5.2%. Network factors obviously play a large role, yet the extent of their potential effect is artificially limited by the number of persons in respondents' networks they were asked about. If we consider \"Networks & Homophily 2\" in tables 4-3, 4-5, and 4-7 the upper limit is 6 ties. Further, the range of persons in ego's network is limited to parents, close relatives, close friends, favorite teachers, and the school guidance counselor. The number and variety of potentially influential persons within respondents' networks is likely greater than 6. That said, the odds of earning a 2-year degree are projected to increase by 1.67% -9.4% for each tie respondents felt expected them to enroll in college. If changes in Tjur's R 2 and the BIC are used as the yardstick to determine whether perceived opportunity or networks/homophily have a greater impact on respondents' human capital decisions; the latter would be preferable. Across all models measuring their association with high school graduation, earning an Associate's degree, and earning a Bachelor's degree; the R 2 value remained static while the BIC increased when market and occupation variables were added. In addition, the value and significance of coefficients for all network variables remained virtually unchanged when labor market characteristics were included. This suggests that while local job growth may play a small role in respondents' education outcomes, it does not provide any additional explanatory power compared to network/homophily effects.\nEvidence for the first hypothesis-that job growth in primary market occupations will generate more high school graduates, Associate's degree earners and Bachelor's degree earners-was confirmed via models of aggregate human capital growth in Chapter III. By and large, Employment growth within primary labor markets was positively associated with human capital growth. In addition, the amount of growth with which they were associated generally increased monotonically with the type of degree assessed. Whereas the overall influence of job growth was positively related to high school graduation, the amount of human capital growth it accounted for was somewhat larger for 2-year and 4-year degree earners. This suggests that job growth in high-wage, high-skill jobs are a catalyst for regional human capital growth, whether it stems from the local populous furthering their education or migrants. The second hypothesis-job growth in primary market occupations will generate a larger increase in Associate's degree and Bachelor's degree earners, compared to the midlevel and secondary job markets-was partially supported. Whereas increased employment opportunities in primary markets generated more human capital growth via the number of 4year degree holders, it generated fewer Associate's degree earners compared to midlevel markets. In hindsight, this makes sense as primary market jobs generally require \"primary market degrees,\" as illustrated in table 2.1. This too, suggests people tend to strike equilibrium between their own human capital investment and the types of occupations available to them. If local job growth predominantly occurs within mid-level market occupations, employment seekers will adjust their time and money investments to compensate, i.e., obtain the degree of education required by most jobs available to them. Whereas the first two hypotheses tested the relationship between local job growth and aggregate human capital development, hypotheses three through five tested the effects of local job growth on the probability of graduating high school and/or earn a college degree. Evidence for hypothesis three-employment growth within primary market occupations will increase the probability of graduating high school, earning an Associate's degree, and/or earning a Bachelor's degree -was partially supported. Whereas primary market growth was positively associated the odds of graduating high school and earning an Associate's, it did not influence Bachelor's degree attainment. This may suggest local labor markets are not the only consideration taken into account when deciding to pursue a 4-year degree. Regional, state, and nation job opportunities may also be c. Hypothesis four-employment growth in primary job markets will induce a higher likelihood of earning an Associate's degree and Bachelor's degree compared to job growth in the mid-level and secondary job markets-is partially supported, though with a few caveats. First, employment growth in midlevel job markets were not significant predictors of Associate's degree attainment and was negatively associated with earning a Bachelor's degree. Second, while primary market growth did not significantly impact the odds of earning a Bachelor's, secondary market growth was positively associated though the effect was marginal. It is also worth noting that primary market growth had a positive impact on the odds of high school completion while midlevel and secondary markets where not influential. Hypothesis five-Social Networks/Homophily will impact students' education outcomes -is also supported. Overall, the majority of network variables significantly influenced the likelihood of graduating high school, earning an Associate's degree, and earning a Bachelor's degree. Respondents were malleable to the influences and/or desires of the people around them regarding decisions on their own human capital. In addition, the company respondents kept proved more influential than local employment growth in high-wage, high-skill occupations. In fact, adding employment variables did not increase the predictive power of the base model, as indicated by the Tjur's R 2 statistic and the increased BIC. This suggests that local employment changes by occupation, at best, play a minor role in individuals' decisions pertaining to human capital development. Finally, how does the association between aggregate primary market job growth and aggregate human capital development compare to the behaviors of individuals? Overall, primary market growth was illustrated to affect growth in the number of residential high school graduates, Associate's degree earners, and Bachelor's degree earners. At the individual level, it only affected the odds of high school completion. Additionally, whereas growth within mid-level and secondary job markets where found to positively influence counties' stocks of high school graduates, neither affected the likelihood of residents graduating high school. This suggests the bump in human capital was primarily due to migration. Local job growth in midlevel markets was shown to positively affect the number of college degree earners, yet did not affect the odds of respondents earning an Associate's and a negative effect on earning a Bachelor's. This too, suggests much of counties' increase in human capital between 2000 and 2014 was primarily due to migration, not the conditions of local markets themselves."}, {"section_title": "Improvements & Discussion", "text": "Several steps could be taken to strengthen the results of this analysis. Concerning data, it would be beneficial to include measures of parental involvement in respondents' educational trajectories. If parents' involvement in the education process effects whether their children finish high school, enroll in college, earn an Associate's or Bachelor's, it may also affect what respondents view as incentives to enter the job market. Further, data as to whether any of the survey respondents' network ties have leads on job opportunities would also be beneficial. It is entirely possible that respondents who opt out of college still have access to well-paying jobs despite local market conditions. In addition, the present study would likely benefit from changes to the modeling procedure. First, instead of measuring the impact of employment change from time A to time B, it may be more beneficial to assess the impact from A to B to C to D, etc. The assessment of market influences on respondents' educational outcomes at multiple points in time would be ideal as it would allow for the inclusion of factors which may be time sensitive and/or \"life events.\" For example, respondents may not immediately enroll in college after high school graduation and opt for employment instead. Should the job be lost, respondents may pursue a college degree to increase their chances of obtaining a better occupation and decrease the likelihood of unemployment in the future. In addition, life events such as marriage, child birth, etc. may delay college entry and degree attainment once enrolled. Further, market conditions may interact of life events to drastically increase or decrease the likelihood of earning a degree. For example, persons living in rural areas with limited work options may choose to enroll in college as a means of supporting themselves and their dependents, whereas new parent(s) in areas with diverse job options may choose to work instead. This study could also benefit from hierarchical nesting which would permit the assessment of market conditions at multiple levels of aggregation. This could illuminate \"which\" job opportunities in \"what\" markets incentivize college attendance and/or the pursual of a degree. For students pursuing a Bachelor's within highly specialized fields, job opportunities in the county might not matter as much as those within county groups, the region, the state, or the US. If students from rural, landlocked areas want to go into oceanography, they would not consider the local market as a viable option. In a hierarchical time-series model, the market conditions at each level of aggregation could be modeled overtime. Results of this study carry some education policy implications, particularly when it comes to the phenomenon dubbed \"brain drain,\" the tendency of young, college educated persons to leave rural, underdeveloped areas. Results indicate growth in primary market occupations has a positive effect on the likelihood of finishing high school and earning an Associate's degree yet growth in secondary markets had a negative impact on the later. This suggests local governments should be mindful of the industries permitted to enter the area. If the goal is to develop and improve market conditions such that young, educated youths will remain in the county, region, state, etc.-further generating the manpower and skills necessary to improve the local economy-emphasis should be placed on increasing job opportunities in primary labor markets. Further, less emphasis should be placed on secondary market industries such as production and farming. Policy makers should be wary of giving tax incentives as a means of attracting car assembly plants, textile mills, warehouse distribution centers, etc. and instead opt to recruit companies dedicated to healthcare, the sciences, and education. Ideally, this would reduce the degree of regional brain drain and increase the overall quality of residential life. and Mathematical Occupation.\" Architecture and engineering jobs received a desirability ranking of 5th.
