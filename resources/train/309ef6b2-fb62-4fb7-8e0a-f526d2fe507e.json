[{"section_title": "", "text": "On the basis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data for 1966-2005, Goldenwinged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) populations have been declining for \u226540 years (annual average decline: -2.5% year -1 , P < 0.01, n = 274 routes; Sauer et al. 2005) . Because of these population declines, the species is listed as \"threatened\" by the Commi ee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, is a \"species of management concern\" in the United States (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), and is on the Partners-in-Flight Continental Watch List (Rich et al. 2004 ). Golden-winged Warblers are state-listed as \"endangered\" in Indiana, Ohio, and Massachuse s, \"threatened\" in Kentucky and Georgia, and \"of management concern\" in Tennessee, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Wisconsin. Golden-winged Warblers are also listed as \"extremely high priority\" on the Audubon Society's Watch List (National Audubon Society 2002) . A recent status review was conducted for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the species that included data on trends, distribution, and threats for the species' range (D. Buehler et al. unpubl. data) . The purpose of the present paper is to summarize the key results of the status review and to report on the recommendations of the Golden-winged Warbler Working Group to heighten awareness of the conservation needs of this species."}, {"section_title": "Distribution, Habitat Use, and", "text": "Breeding Biology\nGolden-winged Warbler is a NearcticNeotropical migratory species that breeds from Georgia to Massachuse s in the eastern United States, extending westward through the Great Lakes states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) and northward into the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba (D. Buehler et al. unpubl. data) . The species' range has generally been shi ing northward over the past 40 years, with recent westward advances into aspen (Populus spp.) parklands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, though the population size in these areas is very small (several hundred birds). Range contraction has occurred along the southern edge of the range in the Midwest (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio), in New England, and in lower elevations in the southern Appalachians (D. Buehler et al. unpubl. data) .\nGolden-winged Warbler nesting habitat has a characteristic gestalt of open patches of shrubs [Auk, Vol. 124 of diff erent heights interspersed with young trees or set on a forested edge-either a forest edge feathered by shrubs into a grassy fi eld or a patchy mosaic of grasses, shrubs, and trees (Confer 1992) . These habitat conditions can be found in upland or lowland se ings, including overgrown fi elds or pastures; along ungroomed power-line rights-of-way; on recovering coal surface-mine lands; along the edges of or in openings in alder (Alnus spp.), tamarack (Larix decidua), or willow (Salix spp.) swamps; in small islands of deciduous trees; a er forest blowdowns or burns; or in clearcuts densely stocked with young trees and shrubs and broken by herbaceous logging roads and landings. Nests are typically built on or near the ground, in a clump of forbs (o en Solidago spp.), grasses, or sedges, and are constructed out of herbaceous materials (Confer 1992) . Habitat availability is a key factor limiting Golden-winged Warbler populations, because many of the habitat a ributes required by this species are ephemeral in nature. These disturbance-dependent habitats have, in general, been declining in extent across many parts of the species' range, as old fi elds succeed to forest, as young forests grow into later seral stages, and as wildfi res are prevented and controlled (Askins 2001) . Many other disturbancedependent species are experiencing signifi cant population declines (Hunter et al. 2001) , presumably because of habitat limitations.\nThe species' breeding season is generally short, lasting only about six weeks. Goldenwinged Warblers are single-brooded (Confer 1992) . Nest initiation occurs within days of their arrival on the breeding grounds; starting dates range from early May in Georgia to early June in Ontario. Nests are usually built within two to three days, and egg laying ensues shortly therea er, with an average clutch size of fi ve eggs across the range (range: 3-6 eggs). Nest success is variable across the Golden-winged Warbler breeding range. Excellent success was reported in North Carolina (72.5% of nests successful; Mayfi eld [1975] method), where predation rates were low, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) nest parasitism was not reported, and hybridization with Blue-winged Warblers (V. pinus) was rare (Klaus and Buehler 2001) . Poorer nest success has been reported from New York (e.g., 38%; Confer and Larkin 1998), where predation rates were greater, Brownheaded Cowbird parasitism aff ected 33% of nests, and competition and hybridization with Blue-winged Warblers were more common. On the basis of demographic analyses of reproduction and survival (L. Bulluck and D. Buehler unpubl. data), the North Carolina population may be a source, limited by habitat availability, whereas some upland New York and Pennsylvania populations may be sinks, limited by nest predation, parasitism, competition, and hybridization."}, {"section_title": "Hybridi ation", "text": "Signifi cant research has been conducted on the eff ects of hybridization on Golden-winged Warbler populations (Short 1963; Confer and Knapp 1977, 1981; Gill 1980 Gill , 1997 Shapiro et al. 2004; Dabrowski et al. 2005) , though signifi cant issues remain unresolved. Gill (1980) reported on the tendency for Blue-winged Warbler populations to replace Golden-winged Warbler populations within 50 years of fi rst contact (Gill 1987 (Gill , 1997 . In West Virginia, replacement of Golden-winged Warblers by Blue-winged Warblers appears to be occurring more rapidly (R. Canterbury unpubl. data). Although this pa ern was noted in several areas of sympatry, documented a population in New York (Sterling Forest) where co-existence has occurred for >100 years.\nIn the southern Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, and in the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee, associations between Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers follows a more complex pa ern (Welton 2003 , Klaus 2004 ). The two species are generally isolated by elevation, with Golden-winged Warblers generally occurring at >600 m elevation and Blue-winged Warblers occurring at <600 m (Welton 2003) . Contact between phenotypically pure Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers is minimal, though a few hybrids (\u223c5% of the breeding Goldenwinged Warbler population) occur in sympatry and mate with Golden-winged Warblers (L. Bulluck and D. Buehler unpubl. data). It is unknown whether these hybrids were produced locally or represent dispersing individuals from other regions.\nCross-matings of phenotypically pure Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers reduces the productivity of both species, both of which would otherwise mate with conspecifi cs, though such pairings are only infrequently observed. Genetic introgression of Blue-winged Warbler genes into Golden-winged Warbler genomes and vice versa is a more insidious process, because it can occur without detectable phenotypic eff ects. All introgression studies to date have been based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); pa erns of nuclear gene fl ow are unknown. Nuclear DNA is responsible for plumage characteristics. Furthermore, given the lack of Golden-winged Warbler \u00d7 Bluewinged Warbler pairs and the preponderance of backcrossing, it is not surprising that there are birds with phenotypes of one species with mtDNA haplotypes of the other. Recent work by Shapiro et al. (2004) and Dabrowski et al. (2005) suggest that, contrary to the fi ndings of Gill (1997) , introgression of mtDNA is occurring symmetrically between Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers. Documenting the extent of introgression across the range and drawing the long-term implications of introgression on population viability of both species remain important research priorities."}, {"section_title": "Population Status", "text": "Although populations are declining across most of the Golden-winged Warbler range, signifi cant diff erences exist in terms of the rates of decline and the apparent underlying causes. In the southeastern region (Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky), apparent steep population declines (-6.7% year -1 ; P = 0.13, n = 11 routes; Sauer et al. 2005 ) are most likely linked to loss of early-successional habitat. Breeding Bird Survey data are insuffi cient for monitoring populations at the state level, because Golden-winged Warblers occur on too few routes for reliable analysis. Golden-winged Warblers in this region are generally restricted to elevations of >600 m. Availability of earlysuccessional habitat on these sites has declined because of forest maturation in general, reduced timber harvest, and eff ective wildfi re prevention (Klaus and Buehler 2001) . Judging from the success of experimental forest management in Cha ahoochee National Forest, Georgia, habitat restoration using prescribed fi re may lead to reversal of population declines in this region (N. Klaus pers. comm.).\nIn the northeast (West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Massachuse s), population declines have been very steep (-8.6% year -1 ; P < 0.001, n = 127 routes; Sauer et al. 2005) . The greatest declines have occurred in West Virginia (-10.2% year -1 ; P < 0.001, n = 31; Sauer et al. 2005) ; recent declines (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) appear to be even greater (-27% year -1 ; P < 0.01, n = 14; Sauer et al. 2005) . Golden-winged Warblers have been extirpated from large areas of New England that were fi rst occupied a er 1900 (Gill 1980 , Confer 1992 . Habitat availability has undoubtedly declined for similar reasons, as has been found in the Southeast (Litvaitis 1993) . However, in the Northeast, populations appear to be demographically limited as well, because of poor reproductive success, owing in part to Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism, high rates of nest predation, and greater rates of hybridization and competition associated with Bluewinged Warbler presence (Confer et al. 2003) . Restoration of habitat without addressing the underlying demographic limitations may not prevent further decline of the species.\nIn the north-central region, populations have declined slightly over the past 40 years (-1.4% year -1 ; P = 0.03, n = 104 routes; Sauer et al. 2005) . Over the past 15 years, populations have even begun to decline in Minnesota (-4.5% year -1 ; P < 0.01, n = 23; Sauer et al. 2005) , where Goldenwinged Warblers have been relatively common in appropriate habitat. Demographic data on Golden-winged Warbler populations is lacking in the north-central region, so it is diffi cult to assess the underlying cause of the decline. Loss of early-successional habitat to forest maturation, human development, and wetland loss may be contributing factors.\nPopulations in Ontario have increased with the northward expansion of the Golden-winged Warblers' breeding range. This northward expansion appears to be limited by the distribution of suitable forest types; Golden-winged Warblers appear to be limited to deciduous forests and tamarack swamps and are not expanding into the spruce (Picea spp.) and fi r (Abies spp.) forests associated with the Canadian Shield. Despite the northward expansion into Ontario, populations in this region appear to be declining sharply over the past 15 years (-6.6% year -1 ; P = 0.08, n = 27; Sauer et al. 2005) , which is similar to the trend reported for Minnesota. The Ontario population north of Lake Erie has been extirpated. Farther west, populations in Saskatchewan and [Auk, Vol. 124 Manitoba may be increasing into the aspen parklands; however, current BBS data are too limited to defi ne population trends because known populations are composed of only several hundred individuals (D. Buehler et al. unpubl. data)."}, {"section_title": "Threats", "text": "Habitat loss has been identifi ed as a signifi cant threat range-wide for this species (D. Buehler et al. unpubl. data) . On the breeding grounds, habitat loss is occurring because of old-fi eld and forest succession and because of human development, including loss of wetlands. On the wintering grounds, habitat loss is linked to deforestation in montane oak forests of northern South American and in Central America. In addition, hybridization has been identifi ed as a signifi cant threat to population viability in northeastern populations and potentially in other regions, as the Blue-winged Warbler continues to expand its range and as hybrid individuals become more common in the Appalachians and Canada. Clutch size has also been shown to decline with proximity to Blue-winged Warblers, possibly refl ecting a competitive interaction (J. Confer unpubl. data). Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism is also contributing to population declines in northeastern populations inhabiting agriculture-dominated landscapes.\nNorthward range expansion may be linked to global warming, but the relationship with population declines is unclear. Southern Appalachian populations appear to be retreating to higher elevations but have yet to reach elevational or physiological limits. Range expansion northward in Ontario has reached the Canadian Shield, an area dominated by coniferous forests as opposed to the northern hardwood forests occupied in southern Ontario. Further expansion northward is unlikely, even with additional warming, because Golden-winged Warblers generally do not use these coniferous forests."}, {"section_title": "Golden-winged Warbler Working Group", "text": "The Golden-winged Warbler Working Group was formed out of a meeting held in conjunction with the annual American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) conference in Champagne-Urbana, Illinois, in 2003. On the basis of this initial meeting, a symposium on Golden-winged Warblers was held at the 2004 AOU annual meeting in Quebec City, Quebec, and a conservation workshop was held in 2005 in Siren, Wisconsin. Workshop objectives were to (1) increase awareness of the Goldenwinged Warbler's conservation status throughout its range; (2) identify gaps in knowledge and develop priorities for coordinated Goldenwinged Warbler research and management; (3) develop and implement a conservation plan for Golden-winged Warblers that includes research, education, management, regional coordination, and monitoring; and (4) develop a mechanism for information sharing and conservation-action follow-through. The workshop a endants split up into commi ees assigned to identify specifi c priorities for action within three main topics:\n(1) breeding-grounds research and monitoring, (2) breeding-grounds management, and (3) wintering-grounds research, monitoring, and management. Professional facilitators assisted these commi ee meetings and promoted eff ective and timely consensus.
