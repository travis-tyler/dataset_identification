[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Medicare program provides health care coverage, including coverage for physician services, for more than 35 mil lion of America's most vulnerable citizens. A central program concern is the extent to which there are barriers that may impede beneficiaries' access to needed care. Such barriers can come from a variety of sources, including incentives implicit in payment policies.\nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 enacted important changes in the way Medicare pays for physician services. Specifically, beginning in 1992, this legisla tion (1) mandated a fee schedule that was designed to shift payments from procedur al services to evaluation and management services; (2) set limits on the amount physicians could charge above the fee The author is with the Office of Research and Demonstrations, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of HCFA.\nschedule; and (3) established a process to set target growth rates for expenditures for physician services (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1994) .\nThese changes produced a complex set of new incentives for physician services. On the one hand, increasing fees for evalu ation and management services should encourage physicians to provide ambulatory care. On the other hand, increasing copayments for these same services could dis courage patients from seeking care.\n1 The latter effect may be mitigated in part, how ever, by the availability of supplemental insurance coverage. The limits on balance billing could increase access by reducing beneficiary liability for charges above the fee schedule or decrease access by dis couraging physician participation.\nBecause of such complexity, it is import ant to monitor the effect of PPR on access to physician services for Medicare bene ficiaries. Of particular concern is whether PPR has inadvertently reduced access to important ambulatory care services.\nThere are a number of approaches to monitoring access. One approach is to study \"indicator\" conditions (Billings et al., 1991; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 1993; Rutstein et al., 1976) . These are medical conditions on which one would expect the effects of PPR, if present, to be most apparent. In examining access to ambulatory care services, one important indicator condition for the Medicare popu lation is CHF.\nThe appropriate management of conges tive heart disease requires consistent and 'Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for a copayment of 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount With an increase in Medicare fees, the copayment amount will also increase.\nongoing monitoring of the condition by a physician. If a patient does not receive adequate monitoring, adverse health events are more likely to occur. For exam ple, if a patient does not receive appropriate evaluation and management services, a hospitalization for CHF becomes more like ly (Institute of Medicine, 1993; Physician Payment Review Commission, 1995) .\nThis study focused on patterns of hospi talization for CHF in the Medicare popula tion to determine possible effects of PPR on access to primary care services. If there was a decrease in access, one would expect to see an increase in hospitalizations for CHF following the implementa tion of PPR (i.e., if Medicare patients were less able to obtain the required monitor ing, the adverse event would be more like ly to occur). On the other hand, if there was equal or greater access to ambulatory care services with PPR, one would expect to see no change or a decrease in hospitalizations for CHF. This study analyzes the trend in rates of hospitalization for CHF from 1987 through 1993, to see if there is a discontinuity associated with the implementation of PPR.\nA few prior studies have examined the early effects of PPR on access (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1993, 1994; Physician Payment Review Commission, 1993 . However, these studies largely provide descriptive analyses of changes in access measures occurring around the implementation of PPR. They have not sufficiently estimated the extent to which the policy change produced a discon tinuity in existing trends, as is required for a thorough evaluation. The present study begins to fill this gap.\nA number of subgroups in the Medicare population may be particularly vulnerable to changes in access to physician services. Beneficiaries who tend to be physically frail or socioeconomically disadvantaged, or who live in areas where the supply of physi cians tends to be low may be especially vul nerable to changes produced by PPR. An evaluation of PPR therefore needs to be especially concerned with decreases in access for such vulnerable groups. Thus, the results of this analysis are presented not only for the overall Medicare popula tion, but also for subgroups that would be expected to be especially vulnerable to changes in access, including very old bene ficiaries, beneficiaries living in non-metro politan areas, and black beneficiaries."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Rates of Hospitalization for CHF", "text": "To calculate rates of hospitalization for CHF in the Medicare population, data from Medicare administrative files were used. Data for the numerator of the rates (i.e., the number of hospitalizations for CHF) came from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files. MEDPAR contains a summarized record of hospital claims for all Medicare hospitalizations in a given calendar year. These records include up to five diagnosis codes.\nNumerators of rates were obtained by extracting and counting all MEDPAR records for which the principal diagnosis was CHF. As suggested by the Institute of Medicine (1993) , the following codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were used to identify CHF cases: 428, 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, and 518.4 . Cases with the following surgical proce dure codes were not included: 36. 01, 36.02, 36.05, 36.1, 37.5, and 37.7.2 Only hospitalizations for beneficiaries 65 years of age or over were included in the counts. The counts were restricted to this population because it represents the bulk of all Medicare beneficiaries (approximate ly 90 percent), and issues of access to care for the Medicare population under 65 years of age are often quite different from those for the aged. Records for members of health maintenance orgnizations (HMOs) were also eliminated from the counts because the reporting of hospitalizations of this group is known to be incomplete.\nAt the time of this writing, complete data for Medicare hospitalizations were only available through 1993. There is a lag between the discharge of a Medicare ben eficiary from a hospital and the submission and final adjudication of the hospital claim. The MEDPAR file used to obtain the count of hospitalizations for 1993 included all claims processed through September 1994. HCFA estimates that 98-99 percent of all claims for a calendar year are processed and included in MEDPAR by 9 months after the end of the calendar year.\nThe denominators for the rates used were obtained from Medicare enrollment files. These files contain a separate record for all beneficiaries entitled to Medicare benefits at any time during a given calen dar year. The records include information on the demographic characteristics of the beneficiary, monthly flags on Part A and Part B entitlement and HMO enrollment, and the like. For the denominator counts, Medicare beneficiaries on the enrollment files were differentially weighted by the proportion of the unit of time (in this case calendar quarter, explained later) that they were (1) alive and age 65 or over, (2) enti tled to Part A benefits, and (3) not a mem ber of an HMO. Population counts for the denominators were formed by summing the weighted beneficiary records.\nRates of hospitalization for CHF were calculated by dividing the number of hos pitalizations obtained from MEDPAR by the population counts obtained from the enrollment files.\nA pooled cross-sectional and time-series data base was used for the analysis of the change associated with PPR.\n3 Thus, rates of hospitalization for CHF were calculated on a quarterly basis for the period 1987 through 1993 separately by geographic area of the United States. To obtain stable rates, particularly for potentially vulnera ble subgroups, it was necessary to use census division as the geographic area. Thus, for this analysis, quarterly data on rates of hospitalization for CHF by census division for a 5-year baseline period and for 2 years following the imple mentation of PPR (1992-93) were used. This yields a total of 252 observations for analysis (7 years x 4 quarters x 9 census divisions). There are 180 pre-PPR obser vations and 72 post-PPR observations."}, {"section_title": "Model Specification", "text": "As already noted, the purpose of the analysis is to determine if there is a change in the rate of hospitalization for CHF associated with the implementation of PPR. To estimate this effect, we speci fied a model that attempts to account for rates of hospitalization for CHF in terms of PPR implementation and a number of additional covariates.\nIn brief, the dependent variable in the model is the rate of hospitalization for CHF. The focal independent variable is a term that identifies observations before and fol lowing the implementation of PPR The parameter estimate associated with this term indicates the difference in the average rate of hospitalization for CHF before and after implementation of PPR The model also includes a number of terms that stat3To statistically detect an effect of PPR, it is necessary to have a sufficient number of unique data points. To obtain a reasonable number of observations, a pooled cross-sectional and timeseries data structure was adopted.\nistically adjust for effects that could con found the estimate of the impact of PPR. First, the model includes a term that rep resents the linear trend in rates of hospitalization for CHE Without controlling for the existing trend, one could mistakenly attribute a difference in rates before and after PPR to the impact of PPR, when in fact the difference simply represents a con tinuation of the existing trend. For exam ple, prior research indicates that older beneficiaries have particularly high rates of hospitalization for CHF (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992) . The concentration of older beneficiaries in the Medicare popula tion is becoming more pronounced over time. Because of this long-term demo graphic change, one might expect hospital ization for CHF to be increasing over time. Without statistical control, one could mis takenly attribute a difference in the rate of hospitalization for CHF to the effect of PPR, when in fact the difference simply reflects an ongoing demographic trend.\nSecond, hospitalizations for CHF are more likely to occur during certain periods of the year (e.g., winter). Therefore, to appropriately account for rates of hospital ization for CHF, it is necessary to include a series of terms in the model that account for seasonality.\nFinally, it is widely recognized that there is often pronounced geographic variation in rates of hospitalization for many medical conditions. This variation may reflect factors such as geographic differences in practice patterns, environ mental factors, concentrations of highuse subgroups, etc. Therefore, to appro priately account for variation in rates of hospitalization for CHF, it is also neces sary to include a series of terms in the model that represent geographic areas. The data base used includes quarterly rates of hospitalization for CHF by census division. An examination of the data indi cated that rates for census divisions are roughly comparable within census regions. Thus, for purposes of parsimo ny, the model includes a series of terms designed to capture variation between census regions.\nThe parameters of the model were esti mated from the pooled cross-sectional and time-series data already discussed, using weighted least-squares regression. The size of the Medicare population varies by census division and, to a much lesser extent, by quarter. Weights were used in the regression to allow for these differ ences. The weight applied to each obser vation was the ratio of the denominator of the rate for that observation to the average denominator across all observations. This weighting was used to give appropriate emphasis to areas that represented larger portions of the Medicare population. Standard errors of the estimates were gen erated by a Taylor-series approximation that accounts for potential serial correla tion in the error terms of the time series (Shah et al., 1993 ) A The focus is to see if there is a discontinuity in the time series of hospitalization for CHF associated with the implementation of PPR. likely to experience a hospitalization for CHF. The rate of hospitalization for bene ficiaries 65-74 years of age is 1,309 per 100,000, compared with 2,767 per 100,000 for beneficiaries 75-84 years of age (rate ratio of 2.11), and 4,612 per 100,000 for beneficiaries 85 or over (rate ratio of 3.52). Third, black persons are more likely than white persons to be hospitalized for CHF. The rate for black beneficiaries was 3,164 per 100,000, compared with 2,100 per 100,000 for white beneficiaries (rate ratio of 1.51). Fourth, rates varied by geograph ic area. In particular, rates for census divi sions in the West Region were substantial ly lower than for other areas. Finally, dif ferences in rates by sex and metropolitan status tend to be relatively small. As for the temporal trend in hospitaliza tion for CHF, Table 2 provides data on quarterly rates of hospitalization for 1987-93 for the total United States. sents these data graphically. Several points for the overall Medicare population are apparent. First, there is a strong seasonal component to hospitalization for CHF."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overall Medicare Population", "text": "Rates were consistently high in the first quarter, dropped in the second and third quarters, and then rose again in the fourth quarter (though not as high as observed in the first quarter). In addition, there appears to be an over all upward trend in hospitalizations for CHF. With some exceptions, there was an increase in the rate of hospitalization from the rate observed in the same quarter of the previous year. This trend appears to accelerate somewhat beginning around 1990. This corresponds roughly with the introduction of techniques (e.g., wide spread use of thrombolytic agents) that improved the probability of survival of patients suffering acute myocardial infarc tion (AMD-One partial interpretation of the acceleration in CHF hospitalizations could be that since more patients are sur viving AMIs, the population at risk of later hospitalization for CHF may be increasing during this period. In general, rates of hospitalization for CHF were higher after implementation of PPR than before. In the first year after implementation, rates of hospitalization for CHF increased by 2.8 percent, 5.1 percent, 7.9 percent, and 2.2 percent, for quarters one through four, respectively. In the sec ond year after implementation, rates lev eled off in three of the four quarters (the first quarter of 1993 was 2.1 percent higher than 1992, the second and fourth quarters were about the same as 1992) but were still higher than in the year prior to implemen tation. However, there was a marked decline in the third-quarter rate in 1993 (9.1 percent below the corresponding 1992 rate); this rate is slightly lower than the cor responding rate in the year before imple mentation of PPR (a rate of 448 per 100,000 in the third quarter of 1993, compared with a rate of 457 per 100,000 in 1991).\nAs to the question of whether the dif ferences associated with the implementa tion of PPR represent a significant discon tinuity from the existing trend in hospital ization for CHF, Table 3 presents the regression results for the model based on the cross-sectional time-series data dis cussed previously. 5 The model includes rates of hospitalization for CHF as the dependent variable. As already noted, the overall trend in hospitalization accelerat ed in 1990. To obtain a linear form for the trend for estimation purposes, the depen dent variable was transformed by taking the natural logarithm of the rates. The model attempts to predict the log rates on the basis of terms representing implesCorrelations, means, and standard deviations for the variables included in the model are available from the author upon request differences in practice patterns, environmental factors, con centrations of high-use subgroups, and so on are captured in part by the terms representing the trend and geographic areas. An anonymous reviewer asked why an urban-rural variable was not added to the regression model. I estimated a model that included the \"percent of the population living in non-metropoli tan areas\" as a covariate, and the effect of this variable was not statistically significant To address the issue of the separate effect of PPR in rural areas, I estimated the model separately for beneficiaries living in non-metropolitan areas. A discussion of the results of that analysis can be found in the section \"Medicare Beneficiaries Living in Non-Metropolitan Areas.\" mentation of PPR, a linear trend, season ality, and geographic area. 6 In this form, the regression coefficients can be inter preted as percentage differences in the rate of hospitalization for CHF. 7 First, note that the model does a good job of fitting the data. Slightly less than threefourths of the variation in rates of hospital ization for CHF is accounted for by the vari ables included in the model (& = 0.74).\u00ab Most importantly, though, the regres sion indicates a very small effect associated with the implementation of PPR. The regression coefficient estimating the effect of PPR is 0.024. This coefficient represents the degree to which the rate after imple mentation of PPR deviates from what would have been expected based on the existing trend. The estimate indicates that, control ling for the existing trend, the rate of hospi-7 An anonymous reviewer correctly pointed out that because of the semilogarithmic form, to interpret the regression coefficient as percent change, one should take the antilog of the regression coefficient (to the base e) minus 1. For small percent changes, the values of this computation will not differ from the regression coefficient, but for larger ones, they will. Because the focal esti mates in this analysis are small, I simply present the actual regression coefficients, with the interpretation that they repre sent a percent difference. talization for CHF after implementation of PPR was, on average, only 2.4 percent high er than before implementation. This differ ence is not large enough to be statistically significant 9 Indeed, the term representing the implementation of PPR contributes little to the predictive power of the model. The inclusion of this term only increased the explained variance by 0.1 percent, com pared with a model including only the trend, seasonality, and geographic areas.\nIt is also interesting to note that the model confirms other patterns observed in the descriptive analysis. There is a statistically significant, positive trend in hospitalizations for CHF. Coefficients estimating seasonality indicate that rates of hospitalization are sig nificantly higher in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter (the fourth quarter was the reference group for the seasonality effects), second-quarter rates were not dif ferent from the fourth quarter, and thirdquarter rates were significantly lower than for the fourth quarter. Rates were higher in the Northeast, Midwest, and South than in the West (the West Region was the refer ence group for the geographic effects).\nIn sum, the estimates derived from the regression suggest that the implementa tion of PPR on average did not have a sub stantial impact on hospitalization for CHF in the overall Medicare population."}, {"section_title": "Very Old Medicare Beneficiaries", "text": "For the most part, the demographic pat tern of hospitalization for CHF observed in the overall Medicare population also applied for beneficiaries 85 years of age and over (Table 1 ). Differences in rates of hospitalization for CHF by gender and met-9 It can be argued that statistical inference is not necessary in this context because there is a census of Medicare hospitaliza tions for CHF in this period. I chose the more conservative approach of doing inference because I adopted the view that I was attempting to estimate the parameters of an underlying probabilistic process, and these data represent one realization (i.e., sample) of that process.\nropolitan status also tend to be relatively small in this older age group, and rates for census divisions in the West Region were lower than for other areas. The pattern by race was different, however. In the overall Medicare population, hospitalizations for CHF for black persons were about 50 per cent higher than for white persons (rate ratio of 1.51); in the Medicare population age 85 or over, rates were roughly compa rable for both races (rate ratio of 1.05). The higher rate among black persons in the total population thus largely reflects a higher rate among younger beneficiaries (ratio of black to white persons is 2.03 for those aged 65-74 years, and 1.41 for those aged 75-84 years).\nThe general pattern of quarterly rates of hospitalization for CHF noted previ ously for the overall Medicare population is also apparent in the very old Medicare population (Table 2 and Figure 2 ). There is a strong seasonal component to hospi talization for CHF that is even more pro nounced than in the overall population, and there appears to be an overall upward trend that seems to accelerate somewhat beginning around 1990. Rates following the implementation of PPR are higher than observed before implemen tation, with the exception of the third quarter of 1993. Table 4 presents the regression results, using the same model specification described previously. The model does a good job of fitting the data for Medicare 2 values for these models are extremely high (generally 0.9 and greater), so even small differences can be sig nificant The issue of area-specific effects of PPR is discussed in the summary.

Thus, after adjusting for the existing trend, the rate of hospitalization for CHF after implementa tion of PPR was only 1.0 percent higher than before implementation. This differ ence is not large enough to be statistically significant. As was the case for the over all Medicare population, the term repre senting the implementation of PPR con tributes little to the predictive power of the model.

This coding system subdivides the standard Bureau of the Census metropolitan/non-metro politan county coding system into 10 sub divisions (Butler, 1990) . There are six non-metropolitan categories, based on population size and proximity to a metropolitan area. Previous research on access to physician services in Medicare has distinguished non-metro politan areas that are adjacent to a metropolitan area from those that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1993, 1994) . The concern is that access especially may be a problem for beneficiaries who live in non-metro politan areas that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area.

This result held for the overall Medicare population, as well as for the very old, for beneficiaries living in non-metropolitan areas, and for black beneficiaries. At least for this indicator condition, there is not evidence that the implementation of PPR had a serious impact on access to physician services for Medicare beneficiaries.\nSeveral limitations of this analysis should be kept in mind. First, the results presented here focus on a single condition. It is possible that hospitalization for CHF is unusually resilient to changes in payment policy. Future work needs to expand mon itoring efforts by examining trends in rates of hospitalization for other conditions that would be expected to be sensitive to the adequacy of ambulatory care.\nSecond, PPR has been in effect for a short period of time. Thus, it is not yet pos sible to draw final conclusions about the impact of PPR, because it is too early to fully model possible intervention effects. For example, one cannot currently capture delayed effects or long-term changes in the trend of hospitalizations. Only through long-term monitoring can we fully evaluate the effect of payment reform on access to physician services. In addition, as data on more post-PPR time periods become avail able, it will be possible to reduce the effects of collinearity and more clearly sep arate potential reform effects from the existing trend.\nThird, in a pre-post trend-adjusted analysis as used here, much depends on how well the model captures the unknow able \"true\" trend. It is not certain that the specification used reflects the optimal functional form. Similarly, the model included a fairly simple set of covariates. It is always possible that omitted variables could influence the magnitude and/or statistical significance of the estimate of the effect of PPR.\nFinally, note that the present analysis focused on whether, on average, there was a decrease in access associated with the implementation of PPR. There may be larger or smaller effects in specific geo graphic areas. Future monitoring efforts need to thoroughly explore potential areaspecific effects of payment reform."}]
