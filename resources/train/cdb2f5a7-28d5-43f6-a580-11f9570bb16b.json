We assessed the presence of HSCs, and their cross-sectional association with demographics, vascular risk factors and cognitive functioning in two study samples. Within a random sample of 92 patients with vascular disease from the SMART-Medea study (mean age = 62, SD = 9 years) and 83 primary care patients from the PREDICT-MR study (mean age = 62, SD = 12 years) one rater manually scored HSCs at 1.5 T 3D T1-weighted coronal images blind to patient information. We estimated relative risks of age, sex and vascular risk factors with presence of HSCs using Poisson regression with log-link function and robust standard errors adjusted for age and sex. Using ANCOVA adjusted for age, sex, and education we estimated the association of the number of HSCs with memory, executive functioning, speed, and working memory. In the SMART-Medea study HSCs were present in 65% and in 52% in the PREDICT-MR study (\u03c7 2 = 2.99, df = 1, p = 0.08). In both samples, no significant associations were observed between presence of HSCs and age (SMART-Medea: RR = 1.00; 95%CI 0.98-1.01; PREDICT-MR: RR = 1.01; 95%CI 0.99-1.03), sex, or vascular risk factors. Also, no associations between HSCs and cognitive functioning were found in either sample. HSCs are frequently observed on 1.5 T MRI.

Volume reduction of the hippocampus is a common finding on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is part of normal aging as well as of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Small et al. 2011) . Apart from volume reduction, hippocampal sulcal cavities (HSCs) are frequently observed on MRI, which appear as small changes in signal intensity, isointense to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It has been estimated that HSCs are observed as frequent as 47% in healthy persons and in 66% of patients with impaired memory (Maller et al. 2011) . Also, the prevalence of HSCs may be positively correlated with age (Maller et al. 2011) .\nThe etiology and clinical relevance of HSCs is not well understood. Several studies observed that HSCs are normal variations originating from embryonal folding of the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-018-9916-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nhippocampus (Kier et al. 1997; Hayman et al. 1998 ). According to others, HSCs are dilated perivascular spaces (dPVS), also known as dilated Virchow-Robin spaces (dVRS) (Kwee and Kwee 2007) . Previous studies found a higher number of HSCs with an increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) (Van Veluw et al. 2013) , and with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Yao et al. 2014 ), suggesting that the etiology of HSCs may be related to vascular factors. However, a review reported that the relation between HSCs and hypertension has been questioned and that some studies excluded patients with hypertension (Maller et al. 2011) . Another hypothesis is that HSCs are due to an underlying ischemic process, consistent with studies that found that small cavities in the hippocampus were small infarcts (Donnani and Norrving 2009) . Recently, when we used 7 T MRI and histopathology, we found indications that some HSCs may be of an ischemic subtype, while other HSCs are filled with CSF and are not presumed to be due to ischemia (Van Veluw et al. 2013) .\nClinical relevance of the presence of HSCs is unclear. The number of HSCs may influence cognitive functioning in people with cognitive complaints, as one study that included subjects with subjective progressive memory loss found an effect on a speed-task (Bartr\u00e9s-Faz 2001) . However, other studies with participants from the community did not find an association with cognitive functioning (Maclullich et al. 2004; Yao et al. 2014) .\nTo further unravel the etiology and clinical relevance of HSCs, we aimed to 1) estimate and compare the occurrence of HSCs in patients with a history of vascular disease from the SMART-Medea study and in primary care attendees from the PREDICT-MR study; 2) estimate the cross-sectional associations of age, sex, and vascular risk factors with presence of HSCs; and 3) estimate the cross-sectional association of HSCs with cognitive functioning."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study populations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SMART-Medea study", "text": "The Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Memory, depression and aging (SMART-Medea) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study aimed to investigate brain changes on MRI, late-life depression and cognitive decline in patients with a history of vascular disease (Grool et al. 2011) . The SMART-Medea study started in 2006 as an ancillary study to the SMART-MR study, of which rationale and design have been described previously (Geerlings et al. 2009; Geerlings et al. 2010) . In brief, from 2001 to 2005, 1309 middle-aged and older adult patients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta were included in the SMART-MR study. Between January 2006 and May 2009, 754 participants had follow-up measurements for the SMART-MR cohort. From April 2006, measurements were added as part of the SMART-Medea study including depression assessment, psychosocial risk factor questionnaires, saliva sampling for stress hormones, and a 3-dimensional T1-weighted MR image to assess hippocampal volumes. During a one day visit to the University Medical Center Utrecht participants underwent a physical examination, ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, sampling of blood and urine, neuropsychological and depression assessment, and a 1.5 T brain MRI scan. Questionnaires were used for assessing demographics, risk factors and medical history, medication use, functioning, psychosocial vulnerability and stress factors, and depressive symptoms.\nThe SMART-MR and SMART-Medea studies were approved by the ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nOf the 710 patients that were included in the SMART-Medea study, 636 had volumetric measurements of the hippocampus at MRI. For the present study, 100 patients were randomly selected (Knoops et al. 2009 ), of whom 92 had HSCs data available.

This border was kept until the last slices where the hippocampal grey is mainly surrounded by the splenium and is separated from its medial aspect which is not included in the segmentation. Additionally, because the alveus and fimbria are difficult to separate from the hippocampal grey matter at 1.5 T, they were included in the segmentation following the EADC-ADNI Harmonized protocol for hippocampus segmentation, except for the first one or two slices where the alveus was difficult to discern on the coronal slices (Boccardi et al. 2015) .

We did not measure size or rate small or large size when scoring HSCs. The minimum size is expected to be around 1 mm because HSCs can be visually detected from about one voxel size on the 3D T1 images we used, which was 1 mm 3 . Smaller HSCs cannot be detected due to the partial volume effect, which makes the HSCs undiscernible from the surrounding tissue.

Next, using Chi-square tests, we tested if the presence (yes/no HSCs) or number (three groups: 0, 1 or 2 or more HSCs present) of HSCs differed between both study samples. All further analyses were performed for both samples separately. First, using ANCOVA we explored if total hippocampal volume and ICV differed according to HSCs groups, adjusting for age, sex and education when ICV was the dependent variable, and additionally for ICV when hippocampal volume was the dependent variable. Assumptions of homogeneity for the ANCOVA were tested initially with a Levene's test of equality of error variances; there were no violations of these homogeneity assumptions. Second, using Poisson regression models with log-link function and robust standard errors we estimated relative risks (RR) of age, sex, education and vascular risk factors (cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, overweight, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking in pack years) with presence or absence of hippocampal cavities. Relative risks (RR) instead of odds ratio's (OR) are recommended to prevent overestimation of the true risk when an outcome is common (>10%). (Knol et al. 2012) . A Poisson regression analysis with log-link function and robust standard errors provides RR and therefore we used these analyses in this study, as cavities were common. In the first model, no adjustments were made, and in the second model we adjusted for age and sex. Last, using linear regression analyses, we estimated cross-sectional associations between categories of numbers (0, 1, 2 or more) of HSCs as the independent variable, and the continuous z-scores of the different cognitive domains as the dependent variable. Analyses were performed unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex and educational level.\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Baseline characteristics of both study populations are displayed in Table 1 . Participants were of similar age (mean 62 years). In the SMART-Medea sample, 21% were female, 71% had hypertension, and 28% had a history of cerebrovascular disease. In the PREDICT-MR study 56% were female, 54% had hypertension, and none had a history of cerebrovascular disease.\nWithin the SMART-Medea study 65% (median 1; range 0-8) of the patients had HSCs and within the PREDICT-MR study 52% (1; 0-7) participants had HSCs (Table 1) (\u03c7 2 = 2.99, df = 1, p = 0.08). Categories of HSCs numbers (0, 1 or 2 or more) did not differ significantly between the cohorts (\u03c7 2 = 3.79, df = 1, p = 0.15).\nThere was no significant difference in intracranial volume between subjects with 0, 1, and 2 or more HSCs in either study sample (Table 2) .

There was also no significant association between presence of HSCs and sex, educational level, and vascular risk factors. Cognitive performance was not influenced by categories of number of HSCs in either study sample (Table 4 ).

In patients with a history of vascular disease HSCs were observed in 65% while this was somewhat lower (52%) in the PREDICT-MR sample. In both study samples, no significant associations were observed between age, sex, vascular risk factors and the presence of HSCs, and no significant associations were observed between HSCs and cognitive functioning.\nPrevious studies with 1.5 T and 3 T MRI found similar frequencies of HSCs as we observed in the present study, with exception of our 7 T MRI study in which we found an occurrence of 97% of HSCs (Van Veluw et al. 2013) . A review found a prevalence of 66% in patients with memory dysfunction and 47% in controls (Maller et al. 2011) . Within other populations similar frequencies of HSCs were found (Maller et al. 2013) ; (Yao et al. 2014 ).\nHowever, observed relationships of HSCs with risk factors and cognitive functioning are less consistent. We did not find a relationship between HSCs and age, which is consistent with other studies in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease (Van Veluw et al. 2013) ; (Li et al. 2006) , but in contrast with other studies that included cognitively healthy elderly (Barboriak et al. 2000) , adult volunteers of all ages (Yoneoka et al. 2002) , or a mix of participants with (Chen et al. 2011) ; (Barboriak et al. 2000; Yoneoka et al. 2002) ; (Chen et al. 2011) . It is possible that the relationship with age is weak and only visible when there is a large variation in age in the population studied. It is also possible that over the course of life HSCs become more visible due to atrophy of the brain tissue surrounding the cavity. We also found no relationship with hypertension, which is in agreement with another study that included older persons without dementia (Barboriak et al. 2000) . In contrast, another study with community-dwelling elderly (Yao et al. 2014 ) did find that hypertension and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with an increased number of PVSs. Some other studies lacked information on vascular status of their control participants and patients with AD (Li et al. 2006) , or included only healthy volunteers without hypertension (Yoneoka et al. 2002) .\nOur study did not find an association of the number of HSCs with cognitive functioning, which is in line with studies that included older persons from the community (Yao et al. 2014; Maclullich et al. 2004 ). However, a review showed that HSCs were more common in patients with memory impairment compared to controls (Maller et al. 2011) . The increase in HSCs may thus result from diseases that underlie cognitive impairment (Maller et al. 2011 ), but they may also become more visible with age-related atrophy and not due to dementia itself (Heier et al. 1989 ).\nStrengths of our study include the use of two different study samples. In this way, we were able to replicate our study in a second sample and thus increased the generalizability of our findings. Also, we did not use a size criterion and were therefore able to encompass the majority of HSCs irrespective of presumed etiology. Previous studies used different methods for researching the occurrence and effect of HSCs. Some rated HSCs assuming that they were perivascular spaces and therefore used a limitation in cavity size of 2 mm (Maclullich et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2011) or 3 mm (Yao et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014 ) in diameter. Larger spaces were determined as being focal lesions (Yao et al. 2014) or in some cases also as perivascular spaces when in an area of perforating arteries (Zhang et al. 2014) .\nA limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design, which does not allow any inferences about cause and consequence. Second, our participants were scanned with a 1.5 T MRI, which may underestimate the number of HSCs present, particularly HSCs that were smaller than 1 mm in diameter. In our previous study with use of 7 T MRI we observed HSCs in 97% of the participants. In that study, the sample size was smaller but most of these HSCs were presumed to be cavities filled with CSF, and 6% were thought to be of an ischemic subtype, perhaps Table 4 Results from the linear regression analysis of the association of number of hippocampal cavities (0, 1 or 2 or more cavities) with Z-scores of cognitive performance Reference category is no HSCs for all analyses (no HSCs for SMART-Medea n = 32; no HSCs for PREDICT-MR n = 40). B represents the mean difference in Z-score of cognitive performance for 1 vs. 0 HSC and for \u22652 vs. 0 HSCs a Number of hippocampal cavities adjusted for age, sex, and education level microinfarcts as post-mortem pathology research on two HSCs revealed (Van Veluw et al. 2013) . Other histology research suggested that the cavities were dPVS (Sasaki et al. 1993; Barboriak et al. 2000) . Our current study lacked the possibility to do post-mortem verification of the cavities. However, the location of the HSCs and our observation that no associations exist with age, vascular risk factors, or cognitive functioning suggest that most of these cavities are remnants of the embryological development of the hippocampus (Kier et al. 1997; Hayman et al. 1998) . Also, it is very likely that blood vessels are included within the sulcus during the fuse of the hippocampus walls as the arteries that feed the hippocampus penetrate there, among other places (Kier et al. 1997; Erdem et al. 1993) , and thus these cavities may also be named PVS. Another limitation is that the FLAIR sequences at 1.5 T MRI did not allow to determine what proportion of HSCs may have been infarcts. Further, although we used two study samples, the size of each was relatively small and we cannot exclude the possibility that lack of power resulted in absence of statistically significant associations. However, when estimating the associations between age and common findings on MRI and cognitive functioning in the two study samples, we found significant associations with age in the expected direction (supplemental table 2). These findings imply that the power of this study is sufficient to find any positive associations. Finally, as we rated number of HSCs only, we do not know to what extent volume of cavities may have shown different associations.\nIn sum, in a population with a history of vascular disease and a population of primary care attendees not selected on disease status we found that hippocampal sulcal cavities are very common on 1.5 T MRI. However, no associations with age, sex, vascular risk factors or cognitive functioning were observed, suggesting that HSCs are mostly part of normal anatomic variation of the human hippocampus. To increase our understanding of the smaller proportion of cavities that might be pathological PVS or infarcts, we recommend future studies to include a large number of participants with a wide age range; and to incorporate ultra-high field MRI with a FLAIR sequence.
