[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Special education teachers, through a national survey conducted in"}, {"section_title": "", "text": ". As teacher satisfaction also plays a significant role in the overall climate of the school, factors that influence teacher satisfaction become critical information when seeking to create positive school environments (Gersten, Keating, Yovanoff, & Harniss, 2001 ).\nThis study seeks to identify features of the special education position related to teacher satisfaction. To this end, it examines the perceptions of special education teachers in rural areas related to: (a) what they like best about teaching in rural schools; (b) the challenges and reasons for dissatisfaction with their position; and (c) information on support variables, specifically, a shared responsibility for delivering services to students on their caseload. The aim is to provide an understanding of the unique benefits and challenges of special education positions in rural areas. It is hoped that such information may be helpful to rural administrators by highlighting factors related to teacher satisfaction and thus strengthen their ability to foster positive working conditions in their schools. The literature review that frames the study outlines many positive and negative aspects of teaching in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "Positive Aspects of Teaching in Rural Schools", "text": "Rural school communities have many positive qualities that can influence the satisfaction of special education teachers. Rural teachers, for example, often report positive relationships with their students and parents, as well as an appreciation of the rural lifestyle (Davis, 2002) . Provasnik and her colleagues (2007) , using data provided by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), found that compared to teachers working in urban locales, a larger percentage of teachers working in rural areas, were satisfied with their class size, their students' behavior, and the support they received from parents. Students in rural districts more frequently came to school prepared to learn and had fewer student behavior problems. Parents were more frequently involved in parent and teacher conferences and school events.\nResearch in rural education has highlighted additional qualities found in small, rural schools that positively impact teacher satisfaction. Malloy and Allen (2007) studied one rural elementary school with a low teacher attrition rate (6% versus 20% in the district and 19% in the state). The staff fostered a family-like atmosphere (e.g., making personal phone calls to each other in times of stress). The school emphasized collaboration among staff (e.g., team teaching, mentoring, peer coaching and evaluation) and administrators were reported as being caring and approachable. The non-threatening environment encouraged questions from new faculty and promoted opportunities for teachers to discuss issues with experienced colleagues. Similarly, in one rural district in Florida, teachers stated the sense of knowing each other well was the quality of working in a small school community they enjoyed most (Huysman, 2008) . The presence of a cohesive school community was important for these teachers working in their small, rural school. Nagle, Hernandez, Embler, McLaughlin, and Doh (2006) , investigating 13 high schools with high levels of staff stability in three rural states, found that an attitude of collective responsibility within the school was also important to teacher satisfaction. Students with disabilities were often educated in the general education classroom and the staff shared the responsibility for educating all students, both special education and general education students. Teachers of general and special education described close relationships with each other and a high degree of collaboration. This was facilitated by a shared planning time for teachers and team meetings once a week. Building administrators were also very involved with special education processes and supported a positive working relationship between teachers."}, {"section_title": "Challenges of Teaching in Rural Areas", "text": "The remote locations and geographically large districts of some rural areas pose distinct challenges for special educators. In rural special education, the low incidence of special needs populations can mean smaller caseloads, but can also mean teachers are one of few special educators in their school or district, or even the only special educator providing services in several schools. Special educators in remote locations frequently report professional and social isolation as a challenge of their position (Collins, 1999) . Additionally, the transition to a rural area, where the social and cultural activities typically associated with larger urban districts are not available, can be difficult for new teachers (Bornfield, Hall, Hall, & Hoover, 1997) .\nThe characteristics of the special needs population create additional challenges for rural special educators. In some small rural school districts, special education teachers provide instruction to students in kindergarten through 12th grade across a variety of subjects (Schwartzbeck et al., 2003) . Special educators are often asked to address a wide variety of student needs and disability categories in rural schools, resulting in a need for teachers to work outside of their typical training and expertise (Brownell et al., 2005) .\nMany rural schools operate within a more restricted budget because of a lower tax base in these areas (Monk, 2008) . Limited operating budgets in rural schools present additional challenges for rural special education teachers. Teachers may need to make do with fewer materials and resources due to budget constraints. Rural schools may struggle to provide the specialized services required by individualized programs. As a result, small schools may be forced to consolidate services or hire outside agencies to provide services for their students with special needs (Hodge, & Krumm, 2009 ).\nHistorically, teachers in rural areas have experienced lower pay scales, fewer support networks, and limited professional development opportunities because of their schools' limited resources (Collins, 1999; Ludlow, Conner, & Schechter, 2005) .\nFurther, the federal mandates of No Child Left Behind (NCLB, 2001) for student progress can be discouraging for special educators in rural areas. Despite the teachers' effectiveness, a small number of special needs students can create artificial volatility in achievement scores, hindering the school's ability to meet adequate yearly progress (AYP). Being marked as an In Need of Improvement school can create a demoralizing environment for special educators. NCLB sanctions (e.g., fewer federal funds, reassignment of money, or the option of school choice) can strain an already stretched school budget as administrators struggle to recruit and compete with the better salaries, student services, and teacher programs found in other parts of the state (Brownell et al., 2005; Jimerson, 2005) .\nIt appears that special education teachers who work in small and rural communities may have fewer professional sources of support available to them thus increasing their sense of professional isolation. In a recent national study, researchers examined the relationship of work-related support to special education teacher satisfaction in rural districts (Berry, 2012) . One key support variable, the support provided by other special educators, was not always available. However, teachers who were resourceful had a wider network of support from available sources such as administrators and general education colleagues; these teachers reported greater levels of satisfaction. Job satisfaction was also found to increase if others in the school understood the special educator's role and responsibilities and if others shared in the responsibility of providing services to students with disabilities.\nIn summary, research has indicated that small, rural school environments have positive qualities and apparent challenges that can influence special education teachers' satisfaction with their position. However, only a small number of studies investigating factors related to teacher satisfaction specifically focus on the rural special education teacher. Studies that have investigated rural teachers were generally conducted in a centralized region or single state. Research conducted on a national scale that analyzed rural special education teachers' perceptions of their positions would provide vital information related to teacher satisfaction. This study was guided by the following research questions: What do special education teachers report they like best about their current position in rural schools? What do they perceive as the challenges of working in rural schools? What do teachers cite as reasons for dissatisfaction with instructional or noninstructional aspects of their job? Do special education teachers state they shoulder the entire responsibility of educating students with disabilities on their caseload or do they share this responsibility? What are the contributors to this perception?"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "During the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school years, special educators from a national sample of rural school districts provided data for this study. Data reported here were collected from responses to open-ended questions related to special education teachers' perceptions of satisfaction and support in their positions. These questions were part of a larger survey with quantitative items that have been reported separately (Berry, 2012) . The following sections outline procedures for sample selection, teacher characteristics, survey administration, and data analysis."}, {"section_title": "Sample Selection", "text": "Participants were special education teachers from rural school districts in 33 states. Rural districts were identified in the following way: first regular public school districts were identified from the NCES Common Core of Data (Version 1a: NCES, 2006). Districts were then identified as rural in several ways: (a) their eligibility in either the Rural Education Achievement Program or the Rural and Low-Income Schools Program; (b) they were designated with a rural NCES metro-centric code (i.e., 7 or 8); or (c) had a rural NCES urban-centric code (i.e., 41 for rural fringe, 42 for rural distant, or 43 for rural remote). Fifty-five districts were then randomly selected from these rural districts. Sixteen of the districts were in rural fringe locale codes and located near an urban cluster, 23 were categorized as rural distant (i.e., 5 to 25 miles from an urban area) and 16 were in rural remote areas (i.e., more than 25 miles from an urban center). Additional characteristics of the districts are outlined in Table 1 .\nResearchers utilized district websites and administrators to identify all special education teachers in each district. A letter of introduction was sent to each special education teacher explaining the aims of the study. Teachers were then contacted by telephone and invited to participate in the research. A cap of 10 teachers per district was imposed to avoid over-representation of the sample by larger districts.\nFrom a pool of 522 special education teachers in the 55 districts, 159 were found ineligible either because they were not special educators (e.g., worked as a paraprofessional or school psychologist) or the cap of teachers had been reached for the district. Interviewers were able to contact 243 teachers by telephone, resulting in a response rate of 67% (i.e., 243/363). A total of 204 teachers agreed to participate in the study for a participation rate of 84% (i.e., 204/243; Berry, 2012). "}, {"section_title": "Teacher and Position Characteristics", "text": "As can be seen in Tables 2 and 3 , special education teachers in this sample were typical of those found in other rural research (Bornfield et al.,1997; Davis, 1992) . The majority of teachers (62%) had lived in their rural area for 16 years or more, and nearly half were teaching in a school located in the same general area as the place where they grew up. Teachers held certifications and taught in more than one grade level. Most (80%) had small caseloads (i.e., fewer than 20 students) with an average of 15 students. Teachers in the sample had a wide range of experience. Most teachers (62%) held their state's highest level of certification in special education and were considered highly qualified. Half of the teachers had been teaching in the field of special education for more than 10 years, and 33% more than 16 years (Berry, 2012) . One rural teacher had been working in the field of special education for 32 years. In some districts the special education teacher was the only special educator in the district and divided his/her time between two or three buildings, whereas in other districts the special educator was one of many special education teachers in a large consolidated district. "}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Seven interviewers conducted phone interviews of 35 to 90 minutes in length with the teachers. Interviewers were two researchers from the National Center on Rural Education Support (NCRES) who had extensive training and experience in survey implementation, and five university graduate assistants. Interviewers were trained prior to the start of the study and three periodic checks for drift with these procedures were conducted over the nine months of the study. Reliability rates for adherence to the script and accuracy of response recording was 95% or higher (Berry, 2012) . During the interview, a script was read and teacher responses were typed directly into a computer database. Additionally, interviewers were trained to verify that the recorded answer accurately represented the teacher's views by reading the recorded response aloud (i.e., member checking) following the teacher's response to each item. If teachers provided additional information to expand or clarify their responses, the interviewer would type that information into the database."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "Coding for the teacher responses was developed in a structured and logical way. Data were compiled by question in a table containing each teacher's response. One researcher from NCRES and one doctoral student coded data into topic areas generated from prior research in rural special education investigating special education teacher job satisfaction (Downing & Peckham-Hardin, 2007; Gehrke & McCoy, 2007; Malloy & Allen, 2007; Nagle et al., 2006) . Categories emerged from the teacher responses (e.g., small school size, relationship with staff, relationship with students, paperwork), as researchers accounted for new relationships. Data were then re-categorized as connections both within and across items developed and new constructs emerged (e.g., shared responsibility with general educators, related service providers). This across-case analysis method was used to identify pervasive patterns and themes (Miles & Huberman, 1994) . The code number(s) for each category were recorded beside each teacher's response.\nTo assure that open-ended responses were coded with reliability, the two coders independently coded all responses from a subset of randomly selected districts. The coded responses for these districts were compared and inter-coder reliability (i.e., number of agreements divided by the total number of agreements plus disagreements) was 93% percent. Differences in coding were discussed and a consensus was reached. The remaining districts were then coded independently. Subsequent reliability checks ranged from 90 to 97% agreement with an average of 94.5%. Descriptive statistics were compiled based on the frequency and variety of teacher responses to address the research questions under investigation."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Special educators in 55 rural districts conveyed to researchers what they liked best and what they found challenging about teaching in special education. Additionally, teachers reported on factors related to their satisfaction and dissatisfaction with their positions."}, {"section_title": "What Teachers Liked Best", "text": "Teachers talked about many aspects of their school and community when asked what they liked best about being a special educator in a small and rural school. Some of the major themes identified were positive characteristics generally associated with being a special education teacher whereas others were characteristics of being a teacher in a rural school.\nTeaching in special education. Some of the teachers (14%) talked about positive aspects of working in the field of special education. For example, one teacher remarked, I like working in small groups and learning each of my kids learning styles in order to make the curriculum fit with their own unique ways. These teachers enjoyed watching their students make progress from year to year. I enjoy working with this population of students, explained one teacher. \"I feel I can really make a difference and improve their lives, whatever their disabilities.\nTeaching in a rural school. The majority of the teachers (86%), however, when asked about what they liked best about their special education position, discussed aspects of the position related to teaching in a rural school. Teachers indicated that the smaller size of their rural community made possible positive relationships with others in their school community, with their students' parents, and with their students.\nAlmost one third (31%) of the special education teachers conveyed a family-like, supportive community in their school. "}, {"section_title": "Challenges to the Position", "text": "When special educators were asked specifically about the challenges they encountered being a special education teacher in a rural school, several major themes emerged from the data. Teachers raised issues widely acknowledged by special educators in general (e.g., parents, role responsibilities, paperwork, testing, the lack of time) and some issues specific to a rural context. "}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction", "text": "Special education teachers' responses about satisfaction spanned instructional and noninstructional areas of their position.\nSatisfaction with instructional aspects. Most of the special education teachers (89%) indicated that they were either satisfied or strongly satisfied with the instructional aspects of teaching and delivering services to students on their caseload. Within the group who were dissatisfied, teachers provided several reasons for dissatisfaction, including workload demands (4%) and not enough time to meet the demands of the role (2%). For example, one middle school teacher stated, I feel the kids need more time to work on their skills. I just don't get enough time with them."}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction with non-instructional aspects.", "text": "A large majority (67%) of the special education teachers indicated they were dissatisfied with the non-instructional aspects of teaching. Many teachers (43%) specifically mentioned the paperwork involved with the job. Paperwork! said one teacher, whose comments represented the overall sentiment. There is more and more and it accomplishes less and less. It takes away from the time with the kids. Seventeen percent of the teachers who expressed dissatisfaction commented on the time demands of the special education job (i.e., record keeping, writing reports, etc.). These responsibilities demanded so much time that they had to be accomplished on personal time. A few (2%) teachers mentioned the lack of support from others in the school."}, {"section_title": "Shared Responsibility", "text": "Researchers also examined whether special education teachers believed they shouldered the entire responsibility for providing services to students on their caseload or shared that responsibility. Half of the teachers (51%) said that they had sole responsibility for students with disabilities. One special educator who worked with students with more severe disabilities made statements reflecting the sentiments of these teachers. It is all me, she said. If I don't speak for them it isn't going to happen. I need to advocate for my students constantly.\nSpecial educators provided a variety of reasons for perceiving that they shouldered the entire responsibility of educating their students. Thirty-four percent of the teachers conveyed a lack of support from others in their school. A few of these teachers cited state testing and school sanctions as adding to their sense of professional isolation. Nine percent of the special education teachers acknowledged that others helped in their work with identified students but ultimately felt it was their responsibility to see that services were provided. Others (5%) specifically cited a legal responsibility for IEP implementation as the reason they believed the responsibility was theirs.\nOn the other hand, nearly half (49%) of special educators indicated that they shared the responsibility of educating students with disabilities with other educators in the school. A representative remark from this group was:\nIt is a community here and everyone plays a role. The voices of the teachers conveying their perceptions of their positions provide a picture of rural special education that is both informative and instructive. There were several factors in the study, however, which may pose limitations to the reported results.\nLimitations\nThe data are reported in a way that conveys the recurrent themes that emerged. Categories selected by 2% or fewer teachers are not reported. If a teacher's answer to a question included multiple themes, then the response was recorded in each respective category.\nThe validity of teacher responses may have been influenced by factors of time, trust, and the order of the questions (Tamur, 1992) . Time constraints may have affected teachers' interpretations of the question and their answer. The limited time frame of the telephone interview may have exerted pressure on teachers to respond quickly to questions that involved complicated relationships and inadvertently encouraged teachers to respond with a perfunctory remark. Moreover, the method of interview delivery did not allow a level of trust to develop and teachers may have had limited investment in providing more than a superficial response. Nevertheless, many teachers did supply lengthy and candid answers and measures were taken to accurately record their perspectives. The sequence of the questions may have also influenced teachers' responses to include information about support and relationships. For example, questions about the advantages and challenges of teaching followed items pertaining to work-related support."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The 204 special education teachers in this study expressed their perceptions of the benefits and challenges of their positions in rural schools. Some voiced concerns about the responsibilities of their position and professional isolation; however, others spoke of a caring school community that supported them personally and professionally. From this picture of rural special education, conclusions can be made that will assist rural administrators in facilitating positive working conditions in rural schools and potentially influence teacher satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Special Education in Rural Schools", "text": "The teachers in this national sample of rural special educators voiced many of the same concerns as their special education counterparts in urban areas (Billingsley, 2004a) . Teachers discussed the challenges of providing services to their students given the constraints of time, budgets, scheduling, responsibilities (e.g., paperwork, co-teaching), and role confusion in inclusionary settings. These challenges have been discussed in the literature as contributors to teacher dissatisfaction and the attrition of teachers in the field of special education (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Brownell et al., 2005; Miller, Brownell, & Smith, 1999; Stempien & Loeb, 2002 ).\nAn additional challenge, which repeatedly surfaced in the analysis, was the sense of professional isolation. Comments conveying the lack of support from general education teachers, parents, and administrators were common. Moreover, half of the special educators reported that they felt they shouldered the entire responsibility for educating students with disabilities. Of concern, perceptions of professional isolation appear to have a relationship with lower levels of teacher satisfaction and job commitment (Billingsley, 2004b; Cooley & Yovanoff, 1996; Westling, Herzog, Cooper-Duffy, Prohn, & Ray, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Special Education in Rural Areas", "text": "Despite inherent challenges, most special educators were largely satisfied with the instructional aspects of their position. Many of them felt supported in their role through relationships with others in their school and rural community. To illustrate this relationship between professional support and satisfaction, when commenting about what they liked best about their position, a number of special education teachers centered their remarks around the supportive community they had in their rural school and small town. Special educators described close knit-relationships among school staff and a greater sense of familiarity with students and their families. This broader knowledge of their students gave teachers the sense they could individualize instruction more effectively and improve student learning outcomes. In addition, half of the special education teachers stated they shared the responsibility of providing services to students with disabilities with other teachers including general education teachers, that teaching was a team effort. However, relationships between teachers were not always supportive. Consequently, special education and general education teachers may need training and administrative support to foster these potentially beneficial relationships."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "In light of the results, the following recommendations would seem appropriate:\n1. Administrators should provide teachers with opportunities for both formal and informal support. Such opportunities might take the form of common planning time or other meetings where general and special education teachers can gather, exchange information, problem solve, and discuss student related issues. Local and regional meetings and online connections among special educators can provide a vehicle to develop supportive relationships.\n2. Administrators may need to facilitate conversations to help general and special education teachers clearly define their roles and responsibilities pertaining to the education of students with disabilities. Such delineation of roles has the potential to reduce role confusion and role conflict and support collaboration among general and special education teachers.\n3. General education and special education teachers may require specific training in different types of co-teaching and how to negotiate collaborative relationships in an inclusive environment (Scruggs, Mastopieri & McDuffie, 2007) . Local or regional professional development or inservice training in co-teaching may help to form and sustain supportive relationships.\n4. Administrators should provide special educators with support and flexibility with respect to the scheduling of the school day. Teachers should be able to meet the time demands of providing services to students as well as the administrative demands of the position.\n5. Administrators should be supportive and resourceful, working with local, state, and federal agencies and funding sources, to help special educators provide the necessary services and technology for students with disabilities.\n6. Administrators should provide special education teachers with assistance in the paperwork and clerical responsibilities to lighten the burden created by special education processes.\n7. Pre-service teacher training programs, particularly those with a rural focus, need to prepare special educators to teach effectively in inclusionary settings. Pre-service teachers need specific pedagogy to know how to collaboratively plan with general education teachers and use evidence-based practices within the context of the curriculum (Brownell et al., 2010) .\n8. Rural schools may struggle to provide the services required by individualized programs. As a result, small schools may be forced to consolidate services among several districts (Hodge, & Krumm, 2009) . Federal and state organizations should provide financial support to maintain small, local schools and capitalize on the positive environments fostered there.\n9. Future research may study the factors involved in a creating a shared sense of responsibility for special education among all teachers and the components that contribute to this type of essential teacher collaboration.\nMuch has been learned about the advantages and challenges of rural special education positions by listening to the teachers in this study. The results indicate that teachers and administrators in small, rural schools may be in a unique position to nurture important qualities in their school that matter. Creating a positive working environment has the potential to increase teacher satisfaction and, as a result, improve the quality of the education students with disabilities receive in rural schools."}]
