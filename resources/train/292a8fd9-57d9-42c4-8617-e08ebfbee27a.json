[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is strong genetic, biochemical, and cell biological evidence to support the hypothesis that accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is a driving factor in the development of AD (Hardy & Selkoe 2002). Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) yields A\u03b2, and although A\u03b2 cannot account for all features of AD, mitigating its production and accumulation is a key therapeutic strategy. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCK) 1 and ROCK2 are ubiquitous serine/threonine kinases that share 65% similarity in their amino acid sequences and 92% identity in their kinase domains (Nakagawa et al. 1996). Targeting ROCKs to combat A\u03b2 production stems from studies suggesting that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce A\u03b2 levels in animal and cellular models of AD by suppressing activity of ROCKs (Zhou et al. 2003). Subsequent results indicated that statins mitigate APP processing to A\u03b2 via ROCKs (Pedrini et al. 2005). Together, these findings supported the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of ROCKs might serve as a rational avenue to curb A\u03b2 production. However, this promising hypothesis languished for years due to the limited understanding of which ROCK isoform was responsible for these effects. Recent work demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of ROCK2 suppresses A\u03b2 production in cellular and animal models of AD (Herskowitz et al. 2013). However, whether ROCK1 influences A\u03b2 production in neurons was not addressed. Here, observations from MCI and AD brains were linked to in vitro and in vivo models to provide evidence that ROCK1 is a rational therapeutic target to curb A\u03b2 levels in AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Antibodies", "text": "ROCK1 Abcam ab45171; Actin Abcam ab6276; ROCK2 Abcam ab56661; LIMK1 Cell Signaling 3842; phospho-LIMK1 (Thr508)/LIMK2 (Thr505) Cell Signaling 3841; MUNC18 Abcam ab3451; APP (22C11) Millipore MAB348."}, {"section_title": "Tissue and cell lysate preparation and immunoblotting", "text": "Postmortem human brain tissue samples were provided by the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and its Adult Changes in Thought Study and the Johns Hopkins ADRC and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (Table 1).

To assess whether ROCK1 protein level is changing in AD, Brodmann area 46 prefrontal cortex tissue homogenates were prepared from 16 AD and 11 age-matched pathology-free control cases (Table 1). Homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot ( Fig. 1a-c). Densitometry analysis indicated that ROCK1 levels were elevated ~57% in AD brains compared to controls (Fig. 1d). To determine if changes in ROCK1 occur early in disease progression, 9 MCI and 5 asymptomatic AD brains were analyzed. Asymptomatic AD is hypothesized to represent early disease stages between the first appearance of AD neuropathology and the onset of clinical symptoms (Sperling et al. 2011, Driscoll & Troncoso 2011, and MCI is a prodromal phase of AD. Densitometry analysis indicated that ROCK1 levels were elevated ~56% and ~54% in MCI and asymptomatic AD brains, respectively, compared to controls (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that ROCK1 levels are increased in the early stages of AD and remain elevated throughout disease progression."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b242 oligomers increase phosphorylation of LIMK", "text": "Past work suggested that ROCK2 protein level may be influenced by A\u03b2 oligomers (Pozueta et al. 2013). Based on this and our observations that ROCK1 and ROCK2 are elevated in MCI and AD brains ( Fig. 1) (Herskowitz et al. 2013), we hypothesized that A\u03b2 oligomers increase ROCK1 and ROCK2 protein level in neurons. To test this, primary cortical neurons were incubated in the presence or absence of A\u03b242 oligomers for 6 h, and then harvested for immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2a). Densitometry measurements showed higher, but not significantly increased, ROCK1 and ROCK2 protein levels in neurons treated with A\u03b242 oligomers (Fig. 2b). Next, we sought to determine whether A\u03b242 oligomers alter activity of ROCKs. Phosphorylation of LIM kinase-1 threonine 508 (pLIMK1), a ROCK1 or ROCK2 substrate (Ohashi et al. 2000), was increased significantly ~59% in neurons exposed to A\u03b242 oligomers (Fig. 2c). These findings suggest that A\u03b242 oligomers can increase activity of ROCKs in neurons."}, {"section_title": "ROCK1 depletion reduces A\u03b2 levels", "text": "To determine how selective depletion of ROCK1 influences A\u03b2 generation in neurons, primary cortical cultures were transduced with lentivirus expressing ROCK1-targeted or scramble shRNA. Ninety-six hours later, levels of endogenous full-length cell-associated APP, secreted \u03b1-secretase cleaved APP (sAPP\u03b1), and A\u03b240 levels were measured by immunoblot or ELISA (\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP and A\u03b242 were below the limit of detection). Secreted A\u03b240 levels were reduced ~56% and densitometry analysis indicated that APP and sAPP\u03b1 were decreased ~37% and ~42%, respectively, from ROCK1 knockdown neurons compared to scramble controls ( Fig. 3a and b). To assess ROCK1's influence on A\u03b2 generation in vivo, frontal cortex homogenates from adult ROCK1 heterozygous-null (ROCK1+/\u2212) and wild-type littermate control (ROCK1+/+) mice were subjected to immunoblot or ELISA analysis. Endogenous A\u03b240 levels were reduced ~26% in ROCK1+/\u2212 mice compared to ROCK1+/+ littermates (Fig. 3c). These findings are consistent with ROCK1 knockdown experiments in neurons but conflict with previous work demonstrating that ROCK1 depletion increases endogenous A\u03b240 production in HEK293 cell lines (Herskowitz et al. 2013). We hypothesized that the opposing outcomes of ROCK1 knockdown on A\u03b2 levels in postmitotic neurons and human cell lines may be accounted for by differences in cellular proliferation. To test this, HEK293 cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing ROCK1targeted or scramble shRNA, and 96 h later cells were harvested for immunoblots and cell counting. Analysis by the Countess II Automated Cell Counter revealed that cell number was increased significantly ~44% in wells depleted of ROCK1 ( Fig. 3d), suggesting that ROCK1 knockdown enhanced cellular proliferation. This likely contributed to the increase in A\u03b2 production that was observed following ROCK1 knockdown in HEK293 cells (Herskowitz et al. 2013). Additionally, we sought to determine how selective depletion of ROCK2 influences A\u03b2 generation in neurons. To test this, primary cortical cultures were transduced with lentivirus expressing ROCK2-targeted or scramble shRNA, and 96 h later, levels of endogenous A\u03b240 were measured by ELISA. Secreted A\u03b240 levels were reduced ~42% from ROCK2-depleted neurons compared to scramble controls ( Fig. 3a and b). This supports past findings that show pharmacologic inhibition of ROCK2 diminishes A\u03b2 production in human cells and neurons (Herskowitz et al. 2013). RNAi depletion of ROCK1 suppressed A\u03b2 generation (Fig. 3a). This was likely due to the reduction in APP level that was observed following ROCK1 knockdown (Fig. 3b). To determine whether the decrease in APP following ROCK1 depletion occurred at the RNA or protein level, quantitative PCR analysis was performed. Primary cortical cultures were transduced with lentivirus expressing ROCK1-targeted or scramble shRNA, and 96 h later cells were harvested for RNA. APP mRNA levels were increased in ROCK1-depleted neurons, indicating that the reduction in APP protein level was not due to decreased APP mRNA (Fig. 3e). To determine if ROCK1 depletion in neurons reduces APP protein level by enhancing APP protein degradation, ROCK1-targeted or scramble shRNA-expressing neurons were treated for 24 hours with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or 6 hours with Bafilomycin, an endosomal acidification inhibitor that blocks autophagosome formation (Yamamoto et al. 1998). APP protein levels were measured by immunoblot. MG132 treatment reduced APP level, whereas APP accumulated significantly in bafilomycin-treated cultures (Fig. 3f). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that reduction of ROCK1 diminishes A\u03b2 levels by enhancing lysosomal degradation of APP."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Mitigating A\u03b2 levels is a rational strategy for AD treatment, however therapeutic targets with clinically available drugs are lacking. Our current findings indicate that ROCK1 is elevated in MCI and AD brains and that genetic depletion of ROCK1 reduces A\u03b2 production. Based on this and past work (Herskowitz et al. 2013), we propose that both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are rational therapeutic targets to combat A\u03b2 production in AD. Whether elevated ROCK1 levels contribute to early pathogenic mechanisms of AD or affect transition from MCI to AD are important questions. It will be critical to determine whether increased ROCK1 is driven by specific cell populations, such as reactive gliosis, or a direct effect of inefficient protein degradation, enhanced gene transcription, or a combination of these mechanisms in neurons. Our results indicate that both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are elevated marginally in neurons exposed to A\u03b242 (Fig. 2b), which support previous findings that show A\u03b2 oligomers may increase ROCK2 protein level (Pozueta et al. 2013). ROCK1 and ROCK2 are principle downstream effectors of RhoA, a Rho GTPase family member (Woo & Gomez 2006, Zhang et al. 2003. A\u03b2 oligomers activate RhoA, and it is likely that A\u03b2 activates ROCKs via RhoA interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (Petratos et al. 2008, Pozueta et al. 2013, Lacor et al. 2007. Results herein strongly support this hypothesis by demonstrating that pLIMK1, a direct substrate of ROCKs (Ohashi et al. 2000), was substantially increased in neurons following exposure to A\u03b242 oligomers (Fig.  2c). Notably, pLIMK1 levels are increased in AD brains (Heredia et al. 2006). There is an accordant relationship between RhoA activity and A\u03b2 generation (Zhou et al. 2003). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that A\u03b2 accumulation in MCI and AD activates the RhoA/ ROCK pathway which in turn fuels production of A\u03b2. Escalation of this cycle over the course of many years may contribute to the buildup of amyloid pathology in MCI and/or AD (Fig. 3g). Pharmacologic inhibition of ROCKs can induce protein degradation pathways, including autophagy, in mammalian cells, primary neurons, and drosophila (Bauer et al. 2009, Koch et al. 2014, Gentry et al. 2016. Recent studies indicate that RNAi depletion of ROCK1 or ROCK2 in human neuroblastoma cells reduces endogenous tau by stimulating autophagy (Gentry et al. 2016). Based on this and the findings herein, we hypothesize that ROCK1 mediates A\u03b2 production by influencing autophagic pathways that regulate APP degradation in lysosomes. Notably, APP mRNA levels were increased in ROCK1-depleted neurons (Fig.  3e). This may reflect intracellular compensatory mechanisms that were induced by the reduction in APP protein level following ROCK1 knockdown. ROCK1 or ROCK2 depletion suppresses A\u03b2 levels in cultured neurons (Fig. 3a), and on this basis, we propose that small molecules that inhibit both ROCK1 and ROCK2 may be promising agents for amyloid-based therapeutics. To this end, Fasudil is a clinically approved ROCK inhibitor that was shown to suppress A\u03b2 production in neurons (Shibuya et al. 2005, Herskowitz et al. 2013.
