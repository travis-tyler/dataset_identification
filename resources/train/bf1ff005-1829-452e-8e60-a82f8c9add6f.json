All passenger motor vehicles operated by NASS are located at various field offices and are assigned based on approved program needs and geographic region. NASS uses its fleet to conduct agricultural statistics programs through its 12 Regional Statistical Offices that serve all 50 States. The NASS fleet is comprised primarily of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) that allow for passengers and equipment to easily travel to farms, ranches, and fields. Of the 12 Regional offices, there are 16 NASS owned and 29 vehicles leased from General Services Administration (GSA). While all 12 NASS Regional offices require the use of motor vehicles, it is often more cost-effective to acquire vehicles through existing cooperative agreements with the National State Departments of Agriculture, through leases from State motor pools, or via rental agreements. Field offices monitor and track vehicle use and costs. NASS plans to move from owned to lease as owned vehicles are reported excess. Where possible NASS uses short term rental and shared motor pools. The use of common carrier is not feasible. The ability to reach the nation's farms, ranches, and fields is crucial to the NASS mission and for ensuring accurate data are being collected and reported. Changes to motor vehicle fleet. In 2013, NASS had sixteen owned vehicles and twenty-nine GSA leased vehicles and made no changes. For 2014 and 2015, NASS plans no changes to the motor vehicle fleet. Replacement of passenger motor vehicles. For 2014 and 2015, NASS plans to maintain the current level of 45 motor vehicles with five vehicles scheduled for replacement. NASS follows the Federal replacement policy for agency owned vehicles, and maintains vehicles past the minimum Federal replacement criteria of six years or 60,000 miles when appropriate. NASS complies with GSA fleet managers when replacing leased vehicles, ensuring continued program needs. Impediments to managing the motor vehicle fleet. There are no identified impediments to managing the motor vehicle fleet in the most cost-effective manner. 4x2  4x4  2012  2  21  21  1  ---45  305  Change  ---1  +1  -----101  2013  2  21  20  2  ---45  204  Change  --------+29  2014  2  21  20  2  ---45  233  Change  --------12  2015  2  21  20  2  ---45 "}, {"section_title": "Appropriations Language", "text": "The estimation includes appropriation language for this item as follows (new language underscored; deleted matter enclosed in brackets): Salaries and Expenses: For necessary expenses of the National Agricultural Statistics Service, [$161,206,000] $178,999,000, of which up to [$44,545,000] $48,044,000 shall be available until expended for the Census of Agriculture: Provided, That amounts be made available for the Census of Agriculture may be used to conduct the Current Industrial Report surveys subject to 7 U.S.C. 2204 g(d) and (f)."}, {"section_title": "Lead-Off Tabular Statement", "text": "Budget Estimate, 2015........................................................... $178,999,000 2014 (1) A net increase of $14,294,000 and 47 staff years is requested for the Agricultural Estimates Program for a total of $130,955,000 and 750 staff years ($116,661,000 and 703 staff years available in 2014). Base funding for the Agricultural Estimates program will be used to continue collecting integrated surveys and estimates used for agricultural statistical reports that: Directly impact the market, Directly contribute to the Federal Principle Economic Indicators of the United States, Provide data for which NASS reports are the only publically available sources of information, Support USDA program delivery, and Have specific legislative requirements for release. The Agricultural Estimates program provides data essential to both the public and private sectors of the agriculture industry. The NASS reports are mostly the only publically available objective source for these data. Providing market information was one of the USDA key missions when it was created in 1862. Critical market-sensitive data are used by the commodity and agricultural markets to operate efficiently, providing a fair and equitable environment for price discovery in the marketplace. Without a Federal role in responding to the need to have objective data available for the U.S. and world consumer market key market information would be in the hands of a few. Producers and ranchers would be at a disadvantage with those who have resources to pay for information, and potentially expose markets to manipulation. Base funding for the Agricultural Estimates Program supports: USDA Strategic Goal 1: To assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self sustaining, repopulating and economically thriving. USDA Strategic Goal 2: Ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources. USDA Strategic Goal 4: Ensure all of America's children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals. Funds will be used for salaries and benefits, travel and transportation, rental payments, communications and utilities, printing and reproduction, goods and services from non-federal and federal sources, research and development, operation and maintenance of equipment, and supplies and materials, and equipment. a. An increase of $806,000 for pay costs for the Agricultural Estimates Program which includes $211,000 for annualization of the fiscal year 2014 pay raise and $595,000 for the anticipated fiscal year 2015 pay raise. This increase will enable NASS to maintain staffing levels, which are critical to achieving the agency's principal goal to assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating and economically thriving. Approximately 64 percent of NASS' budget is in support of personnel compensation. b. An increase of $6,165,000 for the Decentralized GSA Rent and Security Payments (paid in 2014 from the central appropriations): USDA proposes in FY 2015 the decentralization of GSA Rental Payments and DHS payments. The amount is the equivalent share of the current GSA Rent and DHS central appropriations based upon current space occupancy across the continental United States. The appropriations request for the central GSA rent account and the DHS payment account has been reduced accordingly."}, {"section_title": "National Agricultural Statistics Service", "text": "17-8 c. An increase of $2,000,000 and 6 staff years for the Pollinator Health Initiative to respond to the serious problem for agriculture due to the large scale losses of pollinators: Pollinators are vital to the agricultural industry for producing food for the world's population. A dramatic rise in the number of disappearances of honeybee colonies in North America was noted in late 2006, from 10-15 percent annual colony loss to greater than thirty percent. Named colony collapse disorder (CCD), this occurs when worker bees from a beehive or European honeybee colony abruptly disappear, with minimal mortality evident near the hive and an intact queen and food. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and initial reports have also come in from Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree while the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%. The mechanisms of CCD and the reasons for its increasing prevalence remain unclear, likely a combination of factors including: infections with Varroa mites and other pathogens and viruses; pesticides, such as the neonicotinoid class; inadequate nutrition and loss of natural forage habitat; genetic factors; and changing beekeeping practices and stress on colonies from transportation. Colony collapse is significant economically because many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by European honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the worth of global crops with honeybee pollination was estimated to be close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the United States have led to substantial increases in the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services. Based on Presidential concern, this key government-wide Pollinator Health Initiative is funded by several USDA agencies as well as other departments. USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with other relevant Federal partners, are scaling up efforts to address the decline of honey bee health with a goal of ensuring the recovery of this critical subset of pollinators. NASS supports this USDA -EPA CCD National Action Plan, which emphasizes the importance of coordinated action to identify the extent and causal factors in honey bee and pollinator declines. As part of this effort, the requested funding will allow NASS to focus its resources and expertise as funds permit to expand, as appropriate and feasible, its annual survey of bee keepers to include questions related to colony losses, pests and parasites, management practices, crops pollinated and locations served, as well as estimates of revenues and expenses. Expansion of the loss survey of beehives was strongly encouraged by beekeepers, the National Academy of Sciences, and the USDA Office of the Inspector General. This action will provide improved baseline and annual data to determine the extent of CCD, in addition to providing quantitative information on potential causal factors, essential to the industry. NASS may supplement with a targeted survey, following feasibility analysis, of small beekeepers (< 5 colonies) and of recipients of pollinator services. NASS is committed to collaborating with USDA and the other departments on a unified and complementary approach to develop and support the Pollinator Health Initiative. This will allow NASS and its collaborators to address critical information needs at an accelerated pace and guide honey bee management at a national scale. d. An increase of $2,500,000 and 10 staff years for the Geospatial Improvement Initiative ($800,000 available in 2014): This new program will enhance the current satellite based agricultural statistics monitoring program. It will research and institute systems to provide satellite based crop condition, soil moisture, crop progress (phenological development of crops), crop yields, and begin research and development to provide data on emissions of greenhouse gasses associated with agriculture at local levels. This will leverage strategic cooperative partnerships with USDA Climate Hubs and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Regional Climatic Centers. This program is meant to extend the monitoring capabilities of both CropScape and VegScape programs and provide new, objective information that supports both the production of agriculture statistics while extending these products to local levels. This basic statistical information is the foundational information for agricultural, environmental, and climate researchers to have local, factual information on U.S. croplands. Additionally, it is anticipated to be of significant benefit to agricultural researchers to have field level geo-referenced data. The valuable CropScape and its underlying Cropland Data Layer (CDL) are the foundational data for new geospatial layers on specific crop condition, crop progress, soil moisture, crop yield, disaster assessment, crop biomass, land tillage and residue assessment, and ultimately greenhouse gas inventories and carbon sequestration potential of agricultural lands. The scientific development of these layers are in various stages of research, operation, or still only conceptual. NASA scientific grants have been supporting basic research on crop progress and crop condition, however new resources are needed to establish a sustainable remote sensing capacity and to increase the scope and pace of research and development. The scientific, technological, and methodological capacities now exist for significant improvement to USDA's monitoring and assessment capabilities. Such improvements would expand the NASS remote sensing capacity for timely and accurate statistics in the areas noted above. Longer term, and perhaps more importantly, these GIS data layers would serve the dual purpose of capacity building for a new geospatial intelligence, enabling more accurate, detailed, and systematic greenhouse gas modeling, monitoring, and assessment from national to local scale. The proposed research and data products will enhance the evaluation of temporal and spatial responses of climate change impact at local levels on crop production. Understanding the impact helps build our capacity to cope and mitigate the effects through genetics and management practices. Inventories of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks are key elements in evaluating sectors, trends, and the efficacy of mitigation strategies and important in potential policy formulations. The development of this initiative NASS will seek experts to add to our staff and scientists to collaborate with at other research institutions. The research and products are new and the initial performance measures are to deliver the following accurate and useful products: A crop condition qualitative product to the public within two years and weekly during the crop season for the following years. A soil moisture data layer product within three years and on a weekly basis thereafter. A crop yield model for new crops within four years. A cooperative staff shall be assembled within two years to collaborate on research and development with greenhouse gas researchers. e. A decrease of $1,920,000 and 2 staff years for efficiencies, including support for USDA programs: Because of the limited funding resources and in order to partially offset the Pollinator Health Initiative and expand the Geospatial Improvement Initiative NASS completed a thorough and comprehensive review of all of its programs. That review consisted of evaluating the entire agricultural statistics program within the following priorities: Principal Economic Indicator data; Data which directly impact the market; Data necessary to implement USDA programs which provide payments to farmers and are used to administer the farm safety net for producers; and Data for which there are no other publically available sources of information. Additionally, NASS reviewed the availability of alternative objective data sources to identify process improvements which could be implemented to maintain data series while reducing costs to the American taxpayers. Further, NASS found efficiencies with our new restructuring and will redirect the funding to the key governmentwide Pollinator Health Initiative and the Geospatial Improvement Initiative to expand the knowledge base on climate change. National Agricultural Statistics Service 17-10 f. An increase of $2,600,000 and 22 staff years to restore the Fruit and Vegetable In-Season Reports ($7,341,000 and 40 staff years available in 2014): NASS restored the annual Fruit and Vegetable program in 2014 to fulfill data users' requests and to provide acreage statistics necessary for conducting the chemical use program. In 2015, NASS will augment the annual Fruit and Vegetable program by providing the in-season forecasts for fruits and nuts. These are needed by industry and include a variety of reports including the monthly Crop Production reports, annual Cherry Production report (issued in June), and the annual Cranberries report (issued in August). For vegetables, NASS will resume publishing in-season forecasts in the September Vegetables report. Additionally, NASS will resume publishing a preliminary Annual Summary for all noncitrus fruits and nuts in January. The annual data is required to conduct the fruit and vegetable chemical use surveys. NASS Regional Offices will collaborate with outside entities in agreements to produce reports containing additional detail for specific crops. NASS will collect data for these forecasts from producers, processors, and others using a series of grower and processor surveys. NASS will also utilize administrative data whenever available to supplement the survey data. Constituents include fruit growers, processors, brokers, extension specialists, grower associations, commodity councils, State Departments of Agriculture, USDA (and other government) agencies, commodity marketing boards, research specialists, universities, and students. Data in these reports are used to align resources (transportation, storage, processing, etc.) with expected supplies, to project market conditions, to evaluate current conditions potential economic impact, for planning purposes, and for educational and research purposes. g. An increase of $3,798,000 and 20 staff years to restore the Chemical Use program to the rotation schedule established in 2010 ($3,504,000 and 22 staff years available in 2014): In 1991, NASS began surveying the use of pesticides and commercial fertilizers in response to data needs for water quality and food safety initiatives. Before the NASS program was instituted, there was very little statistically reliable and readily available information on the amounts and types of chemicals used in agriculture. Consequently, neither USDA nor other concerned parties could respond adequately to questions about agricultural chemical use and its possible effects on the environment. The NASS data series is the only free, publicly available agriculture chemical use information. Proprietary data sources exist, but are extremely costly to access and cannot be disclosed outside the client's purview. The 2009 Omnibus included funding to reinstate the fruit Chemical Use Survey and the balance of the program was reinstated in 2010. Due to budget reductions in 2012 the chemical use program crop rotations were changed so that individual crops were surveyed less frequently, and the post harvest chemical use survey was eliminated. In 2015 NASS will restore the remaining chemical use data series to the 2010 level, including data on major row crops, and fruit and vegetable chemical use data on an alternating year basis. Appropriated funding is necessary for this initiative to ensure equal access to Federal statistics. The chemical use data collected by NASS have been used in building a database for the USDA Pesticide Data Program. This database is used by the Department to evaluate the safety of the Nation's food supply. Additionally, the implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), in 1996, increased the need for actual, reliable chemical use data. FQPA requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct an accelerated review of tolerance levels for re-registration of pesticide products. Part of the review includes using actual chemical usage data that only growers can provide. The absence of these data has created difficulties for EPA and industry to effectively conduct and analyze these reviews. In the absence of actual data, EPA is often in the position to assume maximum label rates are being applied on all acreage. This has the potential of over-estimating actual pesticide usage."}, {"section_title": "17-11", "text": "h. A decrease of $1,655,000 and 9 staff years through suspending lower priority reports to support the Department's higher priority initiatives: Because of the limited funding resources and in order to partially offset the new Pollinator Health Initiative and expand the Geospatial Improvement Initiative NASS completed a thorough and comprehensive review of all of its programs. That review consisted of evaluating the entire agricultural statistics program within the following priorities: Principal Economic Indicator data; Data which directly impact the market; Data necessary to implement USDA programs which provide payments to farmers and are used to administer the farm safety net for producers; and Data for which there are no other publically available sources of information. Additionally, NASS reviewed the availability of alternative objective data sources to identify process improvements which could be implemented to maintain data series while reducing costs to the American taxpayers. By our objective criteria, the following surveys have been found to be lower priority and can be suspended at this time to help offset the Pollinator Health and Geospatial Improvement initiatives: A decrease of $480,000 and 2 staff years to suspend the Catfish and Trout Reports ($480,000 and 3 staff years available in 2014): NASS will suspend the Catfish Processing survey, the Catfish Production Survey, Catfish Feed Deliveries, and the Trout Production Survey in 2015. However, the results of the 2014 Census of Aquaculture will be published in 2015 which will provide an alternate source of data on Catfish and Trout for the 2014 calendar year. A decrease of $353,000 and 2 staff years to suspend the Potato Stocks Reports ($353,000 and 2 staff years available in 2014). A decrease of $557,000 and 3 staff years to suspend the July Cattle Report ($557,000 and 3 staff years available in 2014). A decrease of $80,000 to suspend the June Rice Stocks Report ($80,000 available in 2014): NASS will suspend the June Rice Stocks Report, but continue doing the January, March, and December reports. These reports allow rice farmers and rice mills to track volume and movement of the rice crop from the farm to the processing facilities. Data in the report include rough and milled rice stocks stored on and off the farm as well as stocks by grain length and milled stocks by whole and broken kernels. NASS collects data from rice producers and all known rice storage facilities. A decrease of $55,000 to suspend all Hops and Hops Stocks Estimates ($55,000 available in 2014). A decrease of $130,000 and 1 staff year to suspend the Mink Report ($130,000 and 1 staff year available in 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Census of Agriculture Program", "text": "(2) A net increase of $3,499,000 for the Census of Agriculture (COA) and no staff years ($44,545,000 and 230 staff years available in 2014): The Census is conducted every 5 years to obtain agricultural statistics for each county, State and the Nation. The Census is the leading source of statistics about the Nation's agricultural production and the only source of consistent, comparable data at the county, State and national levels. The Census is authorized by law under Title 7, U.S. code 2204g and is conducted in close cooperation with the Nation's agricultural user groups and farmer organizations. Data include number of farms; farm characteristics; livestock, poultry and their products; crops; land use; irrigation; operator characteristics; ownership; income; production expenses; direct marketing; farm labor and migrant workers; agricultural activity on Native American Indian reservations; chemical use; computer use and more. Reports cover the current census, with comparative data for previous census years. An additional report will be provided for Puerto Rico. Continuation of the Census of Agriculture Program is critical because funding below the base level would result in: A data gap that hinders NASS ability to complete the COA. Lack of Census of Agriculture data used by public and private decision-makers, including USDA and Congress, to make sound, well-informed, and effective policy, production and marketing decisions. Base funding for the entire Census of Agriculture Program is broken down into five general categories detailed below. Due to the cyclical nature of the Quinquennial Census of Agriculture Program, appropriated funds will shift among these five broader categories over the five year cycle of activities. Research, evaluation and analysis are continually being conducted during the entire cycle of the Quinquennial Census of Agriculture throughout all aspects to ensure data quality and efficiency."}, {"section_title": "Direction and Planning:", "text": "This category includes planning, administration, and support for the Census of Agriculture, the annual Current Agricultural Industrial Reports, and the Quinquennial Special Studies. This category encompasses developing timelines, milestones, deliverables, and quality assurance checks associated with the Census Programs. Also included in here is collaboration with USDA, other Governmental, and private sector stakeholders to incorporate critical periodic and emerging data needs into the plan. Covered by this category are research, evaluation and analysis activities during the entire five year census cycle. During the production year, NASS gathers critical information associated with the population composition, data collection and data processing. This information is used to guide NASS staff in making improvements in areas that lead to enhanced quality of census products, improved efficiency, and reduced respondent burden. Examples include evaluation of approximately 250,000 incoming calls from respondents through the Census Helpline, analysis of remarks captured from over 280,000 reports that came via the Internet reporting instrument and thousands of emails to our customer service unit. Content Determination and Design: NASS evaluates and tests the questionnaires for all the components of the Census of Agriculture Program. New content solicited from internal and external stakeholders must be tested prior to production in order to ensure all the questions are interpreted correctly by the respondent. Also, cognitive interviews provide vital feedback to questionnaire content and design. The Quinquennial Census of Agriculture questionnaire is developed to facilitate NASS capability to survey specific sub-populations without the additional cost of screening for those populations. This category also includes the cost of printing the questionnaire for all program components. The information gathered from research, evaluation, and analysis activities has a direct impact on question modification and improved questionnaire design. NASS uses metrics from the census edit system to determine frequency of edit and analyst changes to every item on the census form. This enables NASS to discern which 17-13 questions need to be adjusted to more accurately collect data that leads to higher quality data products. During the data collection and processing year of the census cycle, efforts to improve the processes for the next cycle begin. A sample of records that have substantial reporting errors, such as the amount and distribution of farm or ranch land in the land section, is collected. Research and analysis is then conducted to determine the cause of misreporting so that it can be reduced for the next census. During the 2012 census, approximately 250,000 COA survey respondents called the NASS Helpline. Information from these calls is captured and analyzed to determine which areas of the questionnaire are most troublesome. Text mining software is used to discern common problems. The results from both the reporting error study and the helpline information will be used to provide insight into content and design changes for the 2017 Census of Agriculture questionnaire. NASS received approximately 280,000 responses from the internet website. Comments from these respondents were captured and will be used to help determine improvements to ease respondent burden and to provide a more userfriendly application. NASS also analyzes common reporting errors from internet collection to enrich the instrument for the 2017 Census of Agriculture."}, {"section_title": "Mail List Development and Mail Out:", "text": "Because of the consistent activities necessary to develop a robust and proficient census mail list (CML) for the Census of Agriculture Program, and the similar list maintained for the Agricultural Estimates Program, NASS combines the two lists to more efficiently maintain one list that can be utilized for both programs as well as the NASS reimbursable program. The goal with the CML is to build as complete a list as possible of agricultural places that meet the NASS farm definition. The CML compilation begins with the list used to define sampling populations for NASS surveys conducted for its annual agricultural estimates program. NASS builds and improves the list on an ongoing basis by obtaining information from outside sources. These sources include lists from state and federal government agencies, producer associations, seed growers, pesticide applicators, veterinarians, marketing associations, and a variety of other agriculture related areas. NASS also obtains special commodity lists to address specific list deficiencies. These outside source lists are matched to the NASS list using record linkage programs. Most names on newly acquired lists are already on the NASS list. Records not on the NASS list are treated as potential farms until NASS can confirm their existence as a qualifying farm. Along with assembling and labeling the mail packets, postage costs for the mail collection of the Census of Agriculture, Current Agricultural Industrial Reports and Special Studies (follow-on surveys) are covered in this category. Costs for activities involving the screening of millions of potential farms through the National Agricultural Classification Survey (census screener) are covered under this category. NASS conducts three iterations of this screening survey in the three years prior to census production. This is a more cost effective way for eliminating nonfarm respondents with a four page screener rather than including them on the Census Mail List."}, {"section_title": "Collection and Processing:", "text": "This category involves all activities associated with system development, programming, and data collection for the components of the Census of Agriculture Program. The completion of a Census of Agriculture with high coverage of qualifying farm operations is vital as it provides an up-to-date list frame. Activities encompassing processing, editing, and analysis are conducted on the Census of Agriculture returned mail packets. Additionally, outreach now includes Native American Indian, outlying areas, and small or disadvantaged farm operators. NASS outsources some of the data collection and processing in cooperative agreements with the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture and the Census Bureau's National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Research on data collection techniques to improve response rates are subsumed in this category. NASS routinely conducts research on the effectiveness of various treatments to the selected survey population. Evaluating various correspondence materials and modes of delivery provides NASS with a better understanding of effective interaction with respondents while discovering less expensive and more efficient ways of gathering the critical data needed to inform policy decisions. Research continues to be conducted on the census dual-frame weighting methodology for under-coverage, non-response, and misclassification."}, {"section_title": "Publication and Dissemination:", "text": "The Census of Agriculture base includes marketing, disseminating, and producing tangible and electronic products for external data users, USDA, and the public. NASS conducts publicity prior to and during data collection to encourage better response rates. Public relations and customer service are important external factors to encourage the continued willingness of farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses to voluntarily provide information on which most of the NASS statistics are based. Encompassed in this category is the work and activities surrounding the release of data from the components of the Census of Agriculture Program. This requires staff time for developing publication tables, creating summary and disclosure programs, and reviewing data and data products prior to release. This category also comprises research into value-added data products and dissemination techniques that respond to data user needs and requests. As an example, NASS examined ways to improve the visual representation of census data which resulted in a new dynamic web-mapping product that will be made available for the 2012 Census of Agriculture data. Base funding for the Census of Agriculture Program supports: USDA Strategic Goal 1: To assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self sustaining, repopulating and economically thriving. USDA Strategic Goal 2: Ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources. USDA Strategic Goal 4: Ensure that all of America's children have access o safe, nutritious, and balanced meals. Funds will be used for salaries and benefits, travel and transportation, rental payments, communications and utilities, printing and reproduction, goods and services from non-federal and federal sources, research and development, operation and maintenance of equipment, supplies and materials, and equipment. NASS will collaborate with the National Association of the State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) in data collection. a. An increase of $202,000 for pay costs for the Census of Agriculture Program which includes $53,000 for annualization of the fiscal year 2014 pay raise and $149,000 for the anticipated fiscal year 2015 pay raise. This increase will enable NASS to maintain staffing levels, which are critical to achieving the agency's principal goal to assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating and economically thriving. Approximately 64 percent of NASS' budget is in support of personnel compensation. b. An increase of $3,037,000 for the Decentralized GSA Rent and Security Payments (paid in 2014 from the central appropriations): USDA proposes in FY 2015 the decentralization of GSA Rental Payments and DHS payments. The amount is the equivalent share of the current GSA Rent and DHS central appropriations based upon current space occupancy across the continental United States. The appropriations request for the central GSA rent account and the DHS payment account have been reduced accordingly. c. An increase of $1,010,000 and a decrease of 2 staff years for the five general categories of the Census of Agriculture Program base ($44,545,000 and 230 staff years available in 2014): The base funding with the increases will facilitate the five functions for the Quinquennial Census of Agriculture Program as well as for the following special studies: Annual COA Special Study: Current Agricultural Industrial Reports (CAIR). At the request of the Chief Economist NASS plans to annually conduct four of the approximately forty-seven vital Current Industrial Reports that were formerly conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau CIR program was cancelled at the end of 2011. These surveys are part of the U.S. Economic Census Program as is the Census of Agriculture and, as such, are mandatory and required by law. The CAIRs support the estimation requirements for NASS, Economic Research Service (ERS), the World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB), the USDA Chief Economist's Office, and the Census of Agriculture. Private industry uses CAIR data to monitor effect of international trade on domestic production, evaluate relationship between company and industry performances, market analyses, assess current business conditions, and plan future operations. d. An increase of $3,500,000 and 4 staff years for the Quinquennial COA Special Study: Census of Horticultural Specialties ($0 available in 2014): The Census of Horticultural Specialties was last conducted for the 2009 growing season. The census is a detailed examination of all operations identified from the Census of Agriculture with sales of $10,000 or more. Production and sales data for fresh cut flowers, potted flowering plants, foliage plants, bedding plants, or cut cultivated greens are summarized. This census also collects data regarding expenses, growing area, and hired labor. This historic data series was also conducted in 1970, 1979, 1988, and 1998. NASS proposes to conduct the Census of Horticultural Specialties every five years as funding permits and the next one is scheduled for FY 2020. e. An increase of $2,500,000 and 4 staff years for the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) Survey ($0 available in 2014): NASS will work in collaboration with ERS to conduct a mandatory survey under the Census of Agriculture to update data on land ownership and farm finance that was last collected in the 1999 Agriculture Economics and Land Ownership Survey (AELOS). NASS has renamed this survey Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL). The TOTAL had been a follow-on survey to the Census of Agriculture every ten years up to the 1999 program. The Advisory Committee on Agriculture Statistics made the recommendation that this TOTAL survey was the top program to be reinstated to the Census of Agriculture Follow-on Survey program. Data from this new survey would inform policy decisions for USDA programs linked to farm land ownership and rental arrangements, inform research on generational transitions in agriculture, and provide updated parameters for the National Accounts for agriculture that ERS provides the Bureau of Economic Analysis (Department of Commerce). NASS and ERS have developed a new survey approach using the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and the June Area Survey across two fiscal years. With this two year methodology NASS will conduct a survey to build the list frame in the first year 2014 and in the second year 2015 NASS will conduct the TOTAL survey based on that list frame. Funding for the first year in 2014 will come from a reimbursable agreement with ERS. The survey results of this two year collaborative effort between NASS and ERS would be available after data summary and analysis in late 2015. f. A decrease of $6,750,000 and 6 staff years for conducting the surveys conducted in 2014 as part of the normal Census of Agriculture Follow-on process listed below: A decrease of $3,000,000 and 2 staff years for conducting the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (Redesigned Follow-on survey) in 2014. The Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey provides one of the most complete and detailed profiles of irrigation in the United States and is . It supplements basic irrigation data collected from all farm and ranch operators from the Census of Agriculture. These survey results are critical to the country and will affect policy decisions for the next five years. A decrease of $1,500,000 and 2 staff years for conducting the Census of Aquaculture Survey in 2014. The Census of Aquaculture was conducted for the 2005and 2013 growing years and provided a comprehensive picture of the aquaculture sector at the State and national level. This census collects detailed information relating to production methods, surface water acres and sources, products, sales, point of first outlets, aquaculture distributed for restoration, conservation, recreational purposes, and farm labor. A decrease of $2,250,000 and 2 staff years for conducting an Organic Survey in 2014. Congress initiated the request for this much requested and needed survey.

To achieve this, NASS administers USDA's program of collecting and publishing current national, State, and county agricultural statistics. The Census of Agriculture, conducted every years, provides comprehensive, local level data about agricultural communities across America. The statistical data provided by NASS are essential to both the public and private sectors for making effective policy, production, and marketing decisions on a wide range of agricultural commodities. NASS current activities are organized into the following six major areas: (1) agricultural estimates program, (2) census of agriculture (COA) program, (3) activities covering both agricultural estimates and COA programs, (4) operational transformations to streamline business processes, (5) National Operations Center, and (6) work performed for others. More information on each of these areas follows."}, {"section_title": "AGRICULTURAL ESTIMATES PROGRAM Current Activities:", "text": "The NASS agricultural statistics program is conducted through 12 Regional Field Offices serving all 50 States. Scientifically designed surveys of farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses, and others provide the basis for developing estimates of production, supply, price, and many other aspects of the agricultural economy. These surveys are supplemented by field observations, objective yield counts and measurements, and other data to provide reliable information. Administrative data available from other USDA agencies and State Departments of Agriculture are also used to produce statistical reports, including monthly livestock and poultry slaughter, egg production, and dairy products reports. Official USDA national and State reports are issued relating to: 1) the number of farms and land in farms; 2) acreage, yield, production, and stocks of grains; 3) production of hay, oilseeds, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, floriculture, nursery, and selected specialty crops; 4) inventories and production of hogs, cattle, sheep and wool, goats and mohair, poultry, eggs, and dairy products; 5) prices received by farmers for products, prices paid for commodities and services, and related indexes; 6) cold storage inventories; 7) agricultural chemical use; and 8) other related items that affect the agricultural economy. The NASS field offices forward the estimates to Headquarters in Washington, D.C., where they are combined, analyzed, and released at scheduled times to the media and public through free published statistical reports on the NASS Web site, http://www.nass.usda.gov/. Annually, NASS publishes close to 400 national agricultural statistical reports, covering over 120 crop and 45 livestock items, complemented by additional State agricultural statistical releases. These basic and objective data are critical to maintain an orderly association between the consumption, supply, marketing, and input sectors of agriculture. NASS provides timely and accurate agricultural statistics that are used throughout the agricultural sector to evaluate supplies and determine competitive prices for world marketing of U.S. commodities. These statistics promote a level playing field in production agriculture with impartial information available to everyone at a predetermined and publicized date and time. Statistical data are also provided on chemical use and biotechnology for use in monitoring and evaluating risk assessment to both food safety and food security. Data on agricultural practices, farm and ranch irrigation practice trends, and the geographic information system cropland data layer provide meaningful information on the Nation's resource base and environment. NASS continues to keep abreast of information needs through a variety of means, including holding data user meetings, and advisory committees, attending industry meetings, and sponsoring outreach activities. Even though most NASS reports consist of specific data series, improvements to reports and databases are constantly being made in terms of additional data breakouts, improved coverage, and improved timeliness. Special reports or additional categories within existing reports are added to best summarize the constantly changing character of agriculture. In February 2013, NASS and ERS issued Broiler Highlights from the 2012 Agricultural Resource Management Survey of the U.S. broiler industry. During the first three months of 2012, trained enumerators conducted personal interviews with more than 2,000 broiler growers in the 17 largest broiler-producing states. Farmers provided information about their operating costs and farm-related income. The farmers were also asked about feed, housing, and sales during 2011. Highlights of production practices and resource use that are useful to producers and policy makers can be found within this brief report. http://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/index.asp"}, {"section_title": "Data Users Meeting CSD Shiela Corley", "text": "Chemical Use Program: NASS participated in the August 11-13, 2013 American Phytopathological Society's annual meeting in Austin, Texas.

To ensure a secure release environment, NASS implemented security new efforts."}, {"section_title": "Research and Development RDD Linda Young", "text": "NASS is examining model-based estimation techniques to improve the statistical reliability of published forecasts/estimates and to provide accurate error measures. With respect to state-level corn and soybean yields, a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates multiple data sources, including current and historical data, and administrative/auxiliary information is being developed. Time series techniques are being utilized to model estimates of hogs and pigs as well as cattle. Small area estimation techniques were examined to model county-level estimates of cash rental rates for pastureland, irrigated cropland, and non-irrigated cropland; harvested corn and soybean acreage; and corn and soybean yield. This model transferred from research to development and will be operational in 2014. NASS has worked collaboratively with consultants from outside of the agency to develop the methodology for all of these endeavors. NASS uses its area frame both as a stand-alone frame to estimate numbers of farms and a wide variety of commodities, and as a measure of incompleteness for its list surveys --including the Quinquennial Census of Agriculture. The Agency's area frame estimates of the numbers of farms for 2007 were less than those from its dualframe 2007 Census of Agriculture, raising the question of misclassification of farm status by field enumerators during the June Survey of segments from the area frame. Capture-recapture methods that use the census mailing list in census years and the list frame in non-census years to adjust the area frame's estimate of the number of farms for misclassification are being developed. Measures of uncertainty for the resulting estimates are being produced. NASS is exploring methods to identify operations for which it is most unlikely to obtain responses in future surveys during data collection. Classification tree models have been developed for the Crops/Stocks and ARMS surveys to assign nonresponse propensity scores to survey samples. Methods to use this information in adaptive design strategies to manage data collection are being fielded and tested with the goal of collecting response more efficiently. Future research will evaluate methods of using this information in statistical estimation. NASS began using the Computer Audio Recorded Interview (CARI) system developed by the Research Triangle Institute for the U.S. Census Bureau. The system is intended to improve data quality by allowing evaluation of both data collection instruments and interviewers. NASS continues to evaluate use of CARI and train enumerators to obtain optimum results. The Census of Agriculture is conducted every 5 years and provides comprehensive data series at the national, State, and county level. It provides a snapshot of the agriculture economy including the number of farms, characteristics of farm operators, land use, production expenses, value of land and buildings, farm size, market value of agricultural production, acreage of hundreds of crops, inventory of livestock and poultry, and extensive farming practices including irrigation, marketing and utilization of government sponsored programs. Fiscal year 2013 consisted of data collection, processing, and analysis for the 2012 Census of Agriculture.\nNASS revised and is in the process of implementing new weighting methodology for the 2012 Census of Agriculture. The new methodology was reviewed by a panel of outside experts, which was convened by the National Academy of Sciences in December 2012. The capture-recapture methodology suggested by the Committee on National Statistics performs adjustments for nonresponse, under-coverage, and misclassification of farm status. To implement the capturerecapture methodology, the 2012 June Area Survey was utilized as the independent survey and matched to the 2012 Census of Agriculture mail list. Separate models were developed to calculate the various probability components and then the probabilities were combined to form the weights for the in-scope census records. Final weights will be produced upon the completion of data review and analysis. This will be the first time that census estimates will be published with standard errors at the county level. Research for the Future: Preliminary review of the 2012 reported data began with limited follow-up interviews with producers who may have reported inaccurate data. In addition, comparisons of errors in reported data in the 2007 and 2012 censuses were initiated. The intent of these early evaluations is to assess potential areas for future improvement to the census report form or data collection procedures. The results from these small scale tests will be used as inputs to plans for the pre-2017 Census Content Test. NASS places a high priority, as required by the OMB IRC process, on receiving input from both data users and farm operators with regard to improving data collection processes, as well as data timeliness, quality, and usability. Input and suggestions are received from numerous data users through the renewal of the OMB docket process. In addition, our state and regional directors meet with grower's associations and data users from around the country to solicit input on program and policy changes that will strengthen the agricultural industry. NASS also receives input from the Agricultural Advisory Committee, which represents a wide-spectrum of agricultural leaders. NASS is pro-active in incorporating improvements into our programs through the OMB docket process. For example, in 2013, NASS increased the visibility of our confidentiality and security policies, including a website update, to highlight the importance of safe guarding respondents' data."}, {"section_title": "Selected Examples of Recent Progress: 2012 Census of Agriculture", "text": "Data collection began with the announcement of the census via a postcard or autodial followed by a mailing of three million census forms in December 2012. The data collection strategy included two additional follow up mailings, telephone enumeration, and selected personal interviews. NASS realized a desirable response slightly above 80%. Full release of the census of agriculture will be in fiscal year 2014. NASS successfully increased the number of Internet reporting from less than 100,000 five years ago to over 280,000 respondents. This was achieved through great effort with: Increased resources into computing power for the server to enable a larger capacity of online users, More testing with the electronic data reporting in terms of user friendly questions, Enhanced screening questions to determine farm status earlier in the questionnaire, Highlighted online reporting in NASS public messaging that electronic data reporting is quicker, easier, secure, and leads to less mail correspondent burden. During 2013, NASS continued the Census of Agriculture communications campaign with tactics such as the production of approximately 40 video and 40 audio public service announcements (PSA) featuring national, State, and community agricultural leaders (including PSAs in English and Spanish); and nationwide radio and TV media outreach featuring interviews with NASS spokespeople. A workshop was held with representatives of community based organizations (CBOs) in October 2012 to explain the importance of the census of agriculture to all of those involved in farming, regardless of size. NASS requested the assistance of the CBO leaders to spread the message to respond and to help promote trust among respondents who may be less familiar with NASS. The CBO-NASS handbook \"Partnering to Count and Serve U.S. Farmers, A Handbook to Increase Participation\" was unveiled. As the Census questionnaires were being returned, NASS was in the process of a restructuring its field office structure from 46 State offices to 12 regional offices and 34 two person offices. To enable the timely processing, editing, and analysis of the completed forms without disruption from structural changes in the agency, NASS established a centralized editing group at its National Operations Center (NOC) in St. Louis, Missouri. Existing staff in the Field Offices managed the collection and editing of special cases for the 2012 Census of Agriculture while 80 temporary staff at the NOC were hired to complete the centralized editing and analysis of the Census. This enabled NASS to meet Census of Agriculture goals while also moving forward on the field transition. Two workshops were conducted to train field staff on Quinquennial census procedures. The first was in October 2012 and covered final preparations for data collection and processing. The second workshop was held in April, 2013 and covered analysis and dissemination. Both workshops were held at the National Operations Center in St. Louis. NASS continues to make a strong effort to improve its online products. All products will be available online shortly after their official release.

Work at the NOD continues to reach full production capabilities. The NOD is designed to complete a large portion of the Agency's telephone data collection. The NOD Call Center includes 154 calling seats, 24 seats for coaches and supervisors, and a 12-station call monitoring room to enhance quality assurance. In 2013, nearly 1,679,000 telephone calls were completed by NOD interviewers and over 3,000,000 minutes logged of incoming telephone calls from respondents. The Agency's interviewer training program is developed at the NOD and enhanced training protocols have proved efficient in providing interviewers the skills, knowledge, and abilities they need to perform at a high level. At the end of 2013, there were 6 supervisors, 29 coaches, and 263 telephone interviewers on board at the NOD. NASS will continue to select and train well qualified telephone interviewers. Current plans call for the hiring of 100 additional intermittent interviewers in order to maintain staff calling operations six days a week, 15 hours per day. In addition, NASS will continue to improve the training protocols to improve standards, efficiency and data quality. Another component of the NOD is the Frames Maintenance Group. The Agency's national list sampling frame defines a target population for drawing survey samples or conducting a census. This Group's mission is to develop, maintain and allow for efficient sampling of U.S. farms and ranches. They complete record linkage with newly acquired list sources and add newly discovered farm and ranch operator names to increase coverage of the frame. They also perform maintenance on a daily basis to keep the frame as up-to-date as possible. In 2013, the Group updated more than 430,000 records to make sampling, mailing, data collection, and summarization efforts more efficient. The Forms Processing Group receives the paper-based survey questionnaires that are completed and mailed by farmers and ranchers. These respondent-completed forms are tracked and accounted for to make sure the respondents are not contacted again by telephone. Completed forms are scanned for image retrieval and the data are keyed into a centralized database. In 2013, the Group completed these activities for over 490,000 forms. The Surveys Development Group supports and develops computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) programs used by the Agency's Call Centers to conduct interviews over the telephone with farmers and ranchers. CATI is a complex process that requires survey sample and call management, scheduling, reporting and call monitoring that requires careful coordination. In 2013, the Group supported over 80 CATI interviewing programs and developed 18 new programs. During 2013, the NOD expanded its operational footprint by opening its new print and mail facility to serve NASS needs. The print and mail facility is designed to gain greater efficiency in the NOD's operational and production practices. Plans are to continue to acquire new technology, equipment, and capabilities that directly support the NOD's ability to provide a broader and more diverse range of print and mail services.

These procedures have been streamlined and enhanced to provide maximum flexibility and design adaptability. In FY 2013, the review process was established and best practices were drafted for review by Statistical Methodology staff. A variety of agricultural community data needs are requested, which augment the on-going workers, hours worked and wage rates. In 2013, the Agricultural Labor Survey was conducted in April and the report was issued in May, a second survey was conducted in October with the report issued in December."}, {"section_title": "National Woodland Owner Survey (USDA Forest Service)", "text": "In 2013, NASS conducted an official census of forest owners in the United States. It was aimed at increasing understanding of woodland owners who are the critical link between forest and society. The Forest Service mailed approximately 4,000 questionnaires to individuals and private groups that own the woodlands where the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program has established forest monitoring plots. NASS conducted telephone follow up for nonresponse surveys on about 665 mailings.

Preparation included distribution of national news releases, blogs, feature stories, talking points, e-mails, and tweets. NASS created and distributed production story packages with interviews for local radio around the country. NASS Public Affairs conducted a strong public messaging campaign to encourage electronic reporting as quicker, easier, secure, and leading to less mail correspondent burden during the FY 2013 data collection effort for the 2012 Census of Agriculture. This effort contributed to the significantly increased number of survey responses via Internet reporting."}, {"section_title": "International Technical Assistance Provided Mark R Miller", "text": "NASS provided technical assistance and training to improve agricultural statistics programs in nine countries. In 2013, short-term assignments supported work in Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia, Haiti, India, Rwanda, Serbia, Tanzania and Uganda. The technical assistance ranged from basic survey concepts and procedures to complete national Census of Agriculture support. In addition, NASS coordinated and/or conducted training programs in the U.S. for 151 visitors representing 19 countries. These assistance and training activities promote better quality data and improved access to data from other countries, which allows U.S. analysts to better understand the world supply and demand situation. Improved analysis supports trade and more efficient marketing of U.S. agricultural products. Census of Agriculture -NASS successfully increased the number of COA Internet reporting from less than 100,000 five years ago to over 280,000 respondents. This was achieved through great effort with: 1) Increased resources were put into computing power for the server to enable a larger capacity of online users, 2) More testing with the electronic data reporting in terms of user friendly questions, 3) Enhanced screening questions to determine farm status earlier in the questionnaire, 4) Highlighted online reporting in NASS public messaging that electronic data reporting is quicker, easier, secure, and leads to less mail correspondent burden. Census of Agriculture -The NASS Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey provided detailed data relating to on-farm irrigation activities. FRIS is a follow-on survey to the census of agriculture, occurring every five years in the year after the census. The data are reported at national, State and watershed levels. They are the only data complete, consistent and accurate enough to use in benchmarking on-farm irrigation measures over time. FRIS data contribute to water-related programs, economic models, legislative initiatives, market analyses, and feasibility studies. The information helps industry representatives, leaders, and planners chart the best course for future on-farm irrigation. There was tremendous demand for the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey data especially because of the 2012 drought in the midsection of the country. These survey results are critical to the country and will affect policy decisions for the next five years."}, {"section_title": "Selected Accomplishments Expected at the 2015 Proposed Resource Level:", "text": "Agricultural Estimates -This geospatial improvement initiative will enhance the current satellite based agricultural statistics monitoring program. It will research and institute systems to provide satellite based crop condition, soil moisture, crop progress (phenological development of crops), crop yields, and begin research and development to provide data on emissions of greenhouse gasses associated with agriculture at local levels. This will leverage strategic cooperative partnerships with USDA Climate Hubs and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Regional Climatic Centers. This program is meant to extend the monitoring capabilities of both CropScape and VegScape programs and provide new, objective information that supports both the production of agriculture statistics while extending these products to local levels. This basic statistical information is the foundational information for agricultural, environmental, and climate researchers to have local, factual information on U.S. croplands. Additionally, it is anticipated to be of significant benefit to agricultural researchers to have field level geo-referenced data. Agricultural Estimates/Census of Agriculture -NASS will continue to place a high priority on meeting preestablished release dates. Key Performance Measures and Targets: NASS performance measures are based on its mission to provide timely, accurate, and useful agricultural statistics. Census coverage and response rates contribute to accuracy and usefulness. Each objective of the USDA Strategic Plan to which NASS contributes has a measure for each of the Investment Criteria: Usefulness (relevance), accuracy (quality), and timeliness (performance). These performance measures can be summarized into 4 generic measures: Measure 1. Usefulness -The accessibility, relevance, coherence, comparability, and usefulness of NASS official reports and products and services as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) a . These performance measures vary by goal, but get to the root of why NASS is considered the Federal leading provider of agricultural statistics. Precision of data are necessary for stakeholders to be able to rely on the data to make day-to-day management decisions and eliminate unnecessary chaos in the market. Measure 2. Timeliness -Percent of time official reports are released on the date and time pre-specified to data users. Agricultural statistics are at the core of many decisions made in the agriculture sector. If these data are not timely, the disruption and chaos generated would be immeasurable. This performance measure is the same for all of the goals and will be calculated across all NASS reports. Measure 3. Census Coverage -Percent of United States farms or ranches covered by the census mail list. NASS strives to build a census mail list that covers a maximum number of farms and ranches nationwide. NASS devoted tremendous resources to the 2012 census to maximize coverage rates and continually strives to maintain or improve upon this for the 2017 census. As a result NASS successfully increased the number of Internet reporting from less than 100,000 five years ago to over 280,000 respondents. This was achieved through great effort with: Increased resources into computing power for the server to enable a larger capacity of online users, More testing with the electronic data reporting in terms of user friendly questions, Enhanced screening questions to determine farm status earlier in the questionnaire, Highlighted online reporting in NASS public messaging that electronic data reporting is quicker, easier, secure, and leads to less mail correspondent burden. Measure 4. Census Response Rates -Percent of census mail list respondents returning a usable report. b NASS mails census questionnaires to over 3 million potential farms and ranches. NASS strives to maximize the response rates using multiple approaches to data collection. Even though response rates are historically trending downward, NASS strives to maintain its completion rate from the 2007 census. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Actual Actual Actual Actual Actual Target Target /1 -The American Customer Satisfaction Index is normally only measured every 3 years.
