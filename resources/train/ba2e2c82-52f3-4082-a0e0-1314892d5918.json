[1] [2] [3] [4] For women with stage IA2 or IB1 cervical cancer (tumors <4 cm in the greatest dimension that are confined to the cervix), radical hysterectomy is associated with cure rates in excess of 80%. [5] [6] [7] [8] Traditionally, radical hysterectomy has been performed as open surgery through a laparotomy incision; however, this approach is associated with considerable perioperative and longterm complications. [7] [8] [9] Randomized clinical trials have shown that survival after minimally invasive surgery is similar to survival after open surgery among patients with early-stage uterine, colorectal, or gastric cancer. [10] [11] [12] [13] Furthermore, minimally invasive hysterectomy has led to a lower risk of infection and faster recovery than open surgery.\n14 The first laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer was reported in 1992. 15 Since then, numerous single-institution series and observational cohort studies have shown that the procedure is feasible and is associated with less blood loss, shorter postoperative hospitalization, and fewer complications than open surgery.

We assigned patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery a weight of 1 \u00f7 (propensity score) and those who underwent open surgery a weight of 1 \u00f7 (1 \u2212 propensity score). 39 To reduce the variability in the inverse probability of treatmentweighted models, we used stabilized weights. 40 We assessed balance among covariates using absolute standardized differences; a difference of 10% or less was considered to indicate a wellbalanced result. 39 Population-level (marginal) hazard-ratio effects (under the assumption of the absence of unmeasured confounding) that are estimated by propensity-score methods are more like the effects estimated in a randomized, controlled trial than those estimated by means of multivariable Cox regression. 40, 41 We compared the distributions of categorical variables using the chi-square test in the unweighted cohort and weighted logistic-regression models in the weighted cohort. In the propensityscore-weighted cohort, we compared survival, perioperative outcomes, and pathologic outcomes between the open-surgery group and the group that underwent minimally invasive surgery. We compared all-cause mortality using the inverse probability of treatment-weighted log-rank test and plotted weighted survival functions. 42 We estimated the hazard ratio for death from any cause after minimally invasive radical hysterectomy, as compared with open surgery, with weighted Cox proportional-hazards models.\nWe performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. To ensure that treatment-related survival differences were not confounded by a differential use of adjuvant therapy, the survival model was refitted with postoperative treatment as a covariate (radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, or no further treatment). We further evaluated whether the use of indicator variables for missing data introduced bias into our results by performing a T h e ne w e ngl a nd jou r na l o f m e dicine multiple-imputation analysis. We also assessed the robustness of our main results by using alternative analytic strategies, such as model selection with the use of Hosmer and Lemeshow's purposeful-selection approach 43 and multivariable Cox regression, and propensity-score matching. To confirm that the observed associations were not the result of unobserved differences between hospitals that had adopted minimally invasive surgery and those that had not, we repeated the primary analysis after excluding patients who had been treated at centers that performed no minimally invasive radical hysterectomies during the study period. Details of the sensitivity analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. To explore whether the observed association differed according to the minimally invasive method (traditional laparoscopy vs. robot-assisted laparoscopy), tumor size in the greatest dimension (\u22652 cm vs. <2 cm), or histologic type, we estimated the hazard ratios that were associated with minimally invasive surgery after refitting separate propensity-score-weighted survival models for each subgroup.\nTo test whether the findings of the patientlevel analysis might be due to a causal effect of minimally invasive radical hysterectomy, we conducted a quasi-experimental interrupted timeseries analysis using the SEER 18-registry database. 44 We hypothesized that if the association in the main analysis was due to a causal effect, the adoption of minimally invasive radical hysterectomy would influence survival trends among women undergoing radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer in the United States. The 4-year relative survival rate was used as the primary outcome in this analysis to adjust for the effect of noncancer-related mortality trends. 45 According to published data, 31 2006 was the year in which surgeons in the United States began to adopt minimally invasive radical hysterectomy for the treatment of cervical cancer; the use of the procedure increased from 1.8% of the cases in 2006 to 31.1% of the cases in 2010. We used data from the 2000-2006 period to estimate the trends before adoption, and we fitted a weighted least-squares model to test whether the trend in the 4-year relative survival rate changed in 2006 (see the Supplementary Appendix)."}, {"section_title": "R esult s", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "During the 2010-2013 period, 2461 women with data in the National Cancer Database underwent radical hysterectomy for stage IA2 or IB1 cervical carcinoma and met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1) ; of these women, 1225 (49.8%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. Of the women who underwent minimally invasive surgery, 978 (79.8%) underwent robot-assisted laparoscopy.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings suggest that minimally invasive surgery was associated with a higher risk of death than open surgery among women who underwent radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer. This association was apparent regardless of laparoscopic approach (robot-assisted or traditional), tumor size, or histologic type. This finding was consistent across several analytic approaches and robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we observed that the adoption of minimally invasive surgery in the United States, starting in 2006, coincided with the beginning of a decline in 4-year relative survival rates among women undergoing radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. The association between minimally invasive surgery and shorter survival that was observed in the patient-level analysis could be due to the selection of patients or to unmeasured confounding. However, patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery would be predicted to have longer survival than those who underwent open surgery on the basis of their younger age, higher socioeconomic status, and lower tumor grade. Furthermore, unmeasured confounders such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tobacco use, which are risk factors for poor survival among patients with cervical cancer, are associated with low socioeconomic status 46, 47 and were therefore likely to be more common among women who underwent open surgery than among those who underwent minimally invasive surgery. In addition, previous National Cancer Database studies that compared minimally invasive surgery and open surgery in patients with early-stage ovarian or endometrial cancer did not show that minimally invasive surgery was associated with inferior survival, which suggests that the observed effect is unique to cervical cancer. 48, 49 Finally, the interrupted timeseries analysis, which showed that the adoption of minimally invasive techniques coincided with a decline in cancer-related survival, is not subject to a patient-selection bias.\nOur findings differ from those of earlier retrospective studies and conflict with a consensus within the field of gynecologic oncology that supports the use of minimally invasive surgery in early-stage cervical cancer. 2, 3, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 50 However, previous studies were considerably smaller than the present study, and most had shorter followup as well. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] For example, in one of the largest published investigations reporting the results of long-term follow-up, Nam and colleagues 23 studied data from 526 patients with stage IA2 or IIA cervical cancer who underwent laparoscopic surgery or open surgery and found that, after a median follow-up of 91 months, women who Subgroup analyses show the associations between minimally invasive radical hysterectomy and all-cause mortality according to mode of minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic approach vs. robot-assisted approach), histologic type (squamous-cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma), and tumor size in the greatest dimension (<2 cm vs. \u22652 cm). Diamonds represent point estimates for the hazard ratio as compared with open surgery, and horizontal lines indicate the associated 95% confidence intervals. Separate propensityscore models were fitted to predict the probability of minimally invasive surgery for each subgroup, and hazard ratios were estimated with the use of inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox proportional-hazards models. T h e ne w e ngl a nd jou r na l o f m e dicine underwent minimally invasive surgery did not have a significantly higher risk of death than those who underwent open surgery (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.4). However, the hazard ratio that they observed was similar to ours, and given that there were only 23 deaths, the study was underpowered to detect a clinically meaningful difference between groups. An important limitation of the present study is our inability to explain why minimally invasive surgery was associated with shorter survival. There may be limits to the extent of resection that can be achieved that are inherent to minimally invasive radical hysterectomy. For example, open surgery may allow for greater anterior traction on the uterus, thereby facilitating wider resection at the uterosacral ligaments and parametria. Although we observed no meaningful difference in the frequency of positive margins, close surgical margins may have been more common in the minimally invasive surgery group than in the open-surgery group, which could explain the observed difference in survival. 51 It is also possible that uterine manipulators, which are frequently used for retraction and visualization during minimally invasive hysterectomy, may disseminate tumor cells. Alternatively, it may be that minimally invasive surgery is not inherently inferior to open surgery but that the patients in this study were treated by surgeons who were more experienced with open radical hysterectomy than with minimally invasive surgery. Cancer control after radical prostatectomy appears to be sensitive to surgeon experience, 52 and a similar effect may exist in minimally invasive radical hysterectomy. If the observed findings are the result of a learning curve, we would expect that survival differences among patients undergoing open surgery and those undergoing minimally invasive surgery would diminish as surgeons gain experience with minimally invasive surgery. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms leading to shorter survival.\nAnother limitation of this study is the absence of information about recurrence or cause of death in the National Cancer Database. In addition, although the National Cancer Database includes 70% of new cancer diagnoses, our findings may not generalize to patients who were treated in other settings. 32 On the other hand, SEER registries, although they are populationbased, are located in regions that have greater proportions of nonwhite and economically disadvantaged residents than are in the general U.S. population. 53 Although the populations that were included in the main analysis of the National Cancer Database and the interrupted time-series may overlap, they were distinct with respect to geographic region, study period, treating facilities, and definition of disease stage. We were unable to confirm the accuracy of clinical, pathologic, exposure, or outcome data in either database directly. In addition, we were unable to estimate precisely the associations between minimally invasive surgery and all-cause mortality among subgroups in which few deaths occurred, such as the subgroup of women who had tumors smaller than 2 cm in the greatest dimension.
