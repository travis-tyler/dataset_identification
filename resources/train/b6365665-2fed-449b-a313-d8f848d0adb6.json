[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Pupils lack the joys and delights of literacy, whilst pressured into learning by memorisation (rote). Such examples are: initiating discussions with the schoolteacher, developing essential or analytical observations regarding their surroundings and elements, whilst discovering text interconnectedness, possibly achieved through reading. Numerous teachers are perceived as unsure concerning generating a need amongst learners to focus on instructions. This study demonstrates poetry as a solution for this challenge. The study focusses on ways, teaching English as a social practice, using a literacy process observation amongst High School De Vos Malan's pupils in King Williams Town in the Province of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The \"Atwell Reading Workshop\" is used for data collection. The study is identified, using a qualitative and interpretive approach.\nThis study concentrates on four reading alleviations workshops: Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times in the chosen educational institute; fundamental inspiration; observing the literacy progression; poetry reading and involvement of pupils. This study is informed by \"Foucault's Critical Discourse Analysis\", representing a theoretical framework.\nThis research shows that no other literature type can be equal to that of poetry teaching. Poetry teaching represents expressions, meticulous intense wording, the significance of a nonfictional opinion, dialogue forms and the prominence thereof, the splendour of allegorical linguistics and therefore the necessity of correct punctuation and descriptive linguistics."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "consideration is provided to previously disadvantaged children where their HL is not English.\nThe contingency supposedly provided for a distinction or judgement of individual students and their activities. Their initiative and spontaneity in South Rote learning appears to obstruct and overshadow African public schools (Hoadley 2018) . This authoritarian teaching style caused more harm than good and too often manifests in a form of marking time, surface learning, collective chanting and rite of rote. In rote learning a teacher occupies the centre stage instead of the learner.\nThe paradigm is High School De Vos Malan where this study was conducted. The situation was disturbing, with adverse consequences to most English First Additional Language (EFAL) pupils, leading to a cycle of failed reading and writing academic outcomes. This system was incorporated, despite two major curriculum changes consecutively introduced by the South African democratic regime, established in 1994, following the demise of Apartheid. For this reason, this study supports a need for an unorthodox alternative of teaching English as First Additional Language (EFAL), relating to a social practice through the lenses of Freire and Macedo's literacy process view. The following quotation from Freire and Macedo summarises a literacy process view: \"Reading the world always precedes the word and reading the world implies continually reading the word ... in a way however, we can continue and precede merely by reading the world, but by a certain form of writing it, rewriting, of transforming it by means of conscious, practical work\" (Freire and Macedo 1987, 15-21) The aforementioned suggests transmitting typical transmission model of teaching authorised knowledge, might not amalgamate as a view of literacy meant to empower pupils rather than disempower them through an authoritarian view of learning. Such a position evokes a \"banking concept\" (Freire 1993, 72) , of education pursuing accumulated teacher knowledge as the ultimate education aim.\nQuality education through a literacy process view in this study, can be measured by findings of the \"International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement\" (IEA Guidebook 1998) utilising the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) as they remain closely linked. This study focussed on PIRLS, in line with the central theme besought to investigate how EFAL can be taught as a social practice through a literacy process view. A literacy process view, as explained below, appeared convenient as a device to improve English acquisition in the context of this study. This view indicates a scaffold, enticing participants to read and write independently and free of anxiety and assessment test obligations."}, {"section_title": "A LITERACY PROCESS VIEW", "text": "Contrary to the positivist notions of literacy, the aim is to submit to a literacy process view. Such a literacy process view, centres on a metacommunicative ability. The term metacommunicative ability indicates a growing awareness and control over social means, whilst pupils develop a discourse, enabling an attempt to co-create knowledge and experience.\nTheir (participants/pupils) act of reading and writing may represent their social involvement/social practice. Consequently, the students would realise that a sustaining meaning in reading and writing requires them to maintain the reading and writing process (Rosenblatt 1978) . This implies that they will not be overly concerned with \"what does that say?\" or \"what do I make that say?\" (Sivasubramaniam 2011, 69) .\nAs their words, putting in writing, would or might reveal, they may be concerned with keeping the process of reading and writing valid. This is in line with process reading, utilised in this study, where pupils/participants used Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times in the chosen educational institute; fundamental inspiration; observing the literacy progression; poetry reading and involvement of pupils (Atwell 2006) as interpretive practice avenues. This indicated that they could learn to improve their writing by progressing with the range of increasing responsiveness as found in this study. These pupils' systematic skills might improve, narrating their reading and writing experimental qualities.\nConversely, a literacy process view utilised in this study, provided participants with what Adamson, Coulson and Fujimoto-Adamson (2019, 21) refer to it as an \"agency\". During this process, competent students might not observe their text through immovable artefacts, as an alternative, text might be used to evolve and create significances, overcoming fixture of a script when used for producing objective meanings (Rosenblatt 1978) .\nConsidering the aforementioned information, scripts can seem sensible to individuals merely in potential informative routine approaches, which cannot be determined with a factual, inaccessible communication language location (Rosenblatt 1978) . Conversely, Interpretive practice can also serve to illustrate the message-rich and involvement-poor (Brandt 1990) writing of individuals, observing the text as a self-sufficient and self-referential instrument of literacy (Rosenblatt 1978) .\nA literacy process view is therefore synonymous with social interpretive practices, involvement and metacommunicative ability with a capacity to read the word (Rosenblatt 1978) . Contending a literacy process view, the study aspired to focus on text functions, whilst teaching pupils to read the world. If interpretive practice does not relate to articulating knowledge of the world, the practice should be dismissed as unfruitful (Sivasubramaniam 2011) . Using literacy as social practice, can address the dynamic and dialectical link between words and worlds. In this concern, \"the command of reading and writing is achieved, commencing with words and themes, meaningful to mutual experiences of those becoming literate; this excludes words and themes linked only to the experience of the educator\" (Adamson et al. 2019, 20-21) . Considering this observation, the students' factual reading and interpretation do not include the routinely learnt recurrence reading technique of reality.\nSimilarly, the PIRLS 2017/18 report results, wherein 78 per cent of South African Grade 4 children reported to be unable to read for meaning in any language, appear to be consistent with the aforementioned assertions. This report intrinsically, is distressing as it might exacerbate the ever-escalating decline of the matric academic performance, specifically in the Eastern Cape, the natural setting of this study. If the inability to read and write is not addressed, may have long-term serious repercussions, leading to misunderstanding instructions and concepts by students across subjects. This was the case before in the English First Additional Language (Pupils exploiting EFAL) class at High School De Vos Malan (Kepe 2017) . This study therefore advocates for an unconventional approach to rote learning, which is to teach EFAL as a social practice through a literacy process view.\nThe Critical Discourse Analysis emphasises the aforementioned observation of language as action and societal conduct, establishing: \"discourse -the use of language in speech and writing as a form of social practice\" (Kepe 2017, 77) .\nDiscourse in Foucault's terms, \"governs the way that a topic is meaningfully discussed. It also influences how ideas are put into practice. It is also used to regulate the other individuals' conduct. This indicates discourses (or discourses in the social theoretical sense) limits and restricts, other ways of talking and producing knowledge\" (Hall 2000, 346) ensuring a literacy process, enabling pupils to improve their speaking, writing and reading skills. Discourse in this sense, should embody spoken and written texts, with each being able to construct and identify its interlocutors. It is crucial that students should use a literacy process view, holding a critical understanding of the discourses around them to avert misunderstanding or misinterpretation in and outside the classroom. This pedagogy-focussed study explored how FAL could be taught as a social practice through the literacy process view. For Stranger-Johannessen and Norton (2017) the language of instruction concern designates a combative matter in Africa, sternly disputed by the media and recurrently focussed on in academic literature.\nIn this concern, WorldAtlas.com (2018) estimated 2000 languages spoken in Africa and only a few, mostly small countries, such as Botswana, Burundi, Lesotho, Madagascar, Rwanda, Somalia and Swaziland and some small island states in Sub-Saharan Africa use one language for the greater part of its population. The abundant use of languages, coinciding with biased history, encouraged the use of colonial languages such as English, French and Portuguese as the medium of instruction (Wolff 2016a ). The study established ways of teaching EFAL as a social practice through the literacy process view in a South African school.\nThis study provides evidence that offered learning materials, such as fairy-tale reading material and books with poems as crucial for literacy improvement and to acquire a global or additional language (Krashen 2004; Clark and Rumbold 2006; Garan and DeVoogd 2008) . This study focussed on determining ways of teaching English as First Additional Language through social practice, exploiting a literacy process view. The study observation is that such textbooks are vital for advancing knowledge in the native language, whilst functioning as the groundwork for literacy development in alternative languages, such as English, isiXhosa, Afrikaans and French, amongst others (Cummins, Brown and Sayers 2007) .\nConversely, during schooling initiation, educators profoundly trusted \"chalk and talk\" (teacher centred approach), indicating their primary literacy teaching means (and other subjects). Teachers therefore lacked opportunities to advance teaching methods, using books with fables and poetry during their lessons (Stranger-Johannessen and Norton 2017); teachers and pupils appear to battle with literacy, specifically with English and African Languages. This phenomenon appears across the globe, specifically in the Non-Anglophone countries, such as Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland and Finland, amongst others. Africa appears to be the most affected: Khalifa Said, the reporter of the Tanzaniannewspaper: reported through The Citizen (2016) that the latest literacy study where the old habit involved, \"turning the page with a flick of a finger, not the click of the mouse, was slowly dying a natural death\" (Khalifa Said 2016, paragraphs 6-9). Given this, in South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Zambia the steady decline in the popularity of the newspaper appears to have levelled off after several years sliding (Khalifa Said 2016).\nSeveral assumptions remain unchallenged to teaching reading and writing and which languages to use. Whilst this narrative remained unresolved, pupils with reading problems are entangled in a negative cycle of failed reading outcomes and academic underperformance (Hendricks 2013) . This study investigated how EFAL can be taught as a social practice, using a literacy process view amongst pupils of High School Devos Malan, King Williams Town (in the Province of the Eastern Cape, South Africa)."}, {"section_title": "As aforementioned, this analysis results from longitudinal ethnographic case study research conducted at High School De Vos Malan in King Williams Town in the Eastern Cape", "text": "Province of South Africa. The thesis took three academic years to be completed. It comprised 36 learners, followed from Grade 10 to 12 from 2014 to 2016 for continuity, whilst observing their progression within the period. The methodology section will elaborate on this concern.\nThis study comprised a sample of 18 pupils and 10 teachers. From ten teachers, three teachers taught English as Home Language (HL) for Grade 10 to 12. Seven teachers taught content subjects for Grade 10 to 12. These seven teachers include the principal, also teaching mathematics and his deputy who taught accounting. The principal taught mathematics for Grade 9 and 11. The deputy taught accounting for Grade 10 to 12. There were also two Head of Departments (HODs), one representing physical science and the other, mathematics. One Even though the school hold a dual medium of instruction (English and Afrikaans), multilingualism through code switching characterised the learning situation, which did not form the theme of this study. This study besought to determine how EFAL can be taught as a social practice through a literacy process view in a school. Having such a combined input of pupils in one school proved to have its own limitations. This can be explained through the lenses of Hendricks (2013) , who observed that in South Africa, predominantly in the Eastern Cape Province, homes have inadequate reading material for children, beyond the Bible. Community libraries are rare in rural areas as they hold a limited vocabulary and are inclined to misunderstand instructions. Research exacerbated this concern, indicating that 93 per cent of public schools have a shortage of library resources or librarians, yet unfortunately, Government reduced budgets to school libraries, including providing non-textbook reading material. This adversely affected learners' academic performance, particularly those from less affluent families as most could only speak English in school. Beyond school hours, they revert to their mother tongue (isiXhosa/Afrikaans). This invokes Witt (2003, 2) who extrapolates that \"... difficulties with reading literacy, if not addressed, then permeate all future educational undertaking as the divergence between their reading literacy skills and the demands of the curriculum widens\".\nIf the PIRLS (2017/18) report is observed with 78 per cent Grade 4 children in South Africa who are unable to read, it can be concluded that South Africa lags far behind other countries. Contrasting this percentage with a country such as America, representing only 4 per cent and in England 3 per cent who are illiterate. The comparison appears relevant because if a developing country such as South Africa, wants to excel, it must be compared with the best.\nNotwithstanding that the same report was conducted amongst the middle-income countries, such as Iran, indicating that 35 per cent of Grade 4 pupils could not read for meaning.\nThe figure in Chile was only 13 per cent (Mullis, Martin, Foy and Drucker 2012) .\nThe report indicates that South Africa rated last concerning literacy amongst fifty countries. This forms a pattern, as a declining number of South African students who cannot read, continue to debilitate. Only 3 per cent of South African Grade 4 students reached the High International Benchmark. In 2016 only 2 per cent reached this benchmark (Mullis, Martin, Foy and Drucker 2012) .\nThe aforementioned situation invokes Dyer, Shatz and Wellman (2000) , observing that children from underprivileged backgrounds in England who often engage in reading activities, perform better academically than children who have educated parents but do not indulge in reading. The same study indicates that the youth who read for pleasure performed better, not only in language classes but also in maths, established in all subjects. Considering the aforementioned statement, supporting the justification, the justification supports additionally claims, specifically related to the question: \"How can the English FAL be taught as a social practice through a literacy process view?\" This question is dealt with in the latter part of the study. The study advocates that a central community lacks, where norms or standards of English competence for all communities can be defined, therefore competence in academic language employs a holistic construct, needing to be pluralised to reflect the broad diversity of global settings where it is used (Nunn and Langille 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "This section attempts to suggest alternative approaches by locating this study within the context of the existing literature. Certain aspects are explained, constituting the literacy process view serving as a stimulus for improving EFAL at High School De Vos Malan in this study. The literacy process observed, mainly comprised four aspects: Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times in the chosen educational institute; fundamental inspiration; observing the literacy progression; poetry reading and involvement of pupils. (Atwell 2006) .\nSince the aforementioned aspects are interwoven and inextricably linked, they cannot be explained in isolation. These aspects will assist unpacking the literacy process view in the context of this study. This study reasoned that students are in a disadvantaged position because they appear to lack study skills, writing skills, summarisation, critical thinking and examination skills because of their long-term exposure to rote learning. Such a deficiency might have led to their reliance on the traditional notion of grammar-translation methods employed since primary/elementary level where they appeared to learn through \"a continuous process of rote memorisation that they got used to ...\" (Sivasubramaniam 2011, 188) .\nThis factor continues to influence them, even at university level. The situation can be compared with a house built without a concrete foundation that would show some cracks at a later stage. Considering this aspect, the study advocates for teaching EFAL as a social practice through a literacy process view. The study contends that incorporating such principles into the curriculum should be performed with a holistic approach, using a literacy process view, regarding learning and teaching, such as \"nurturing a sense of wholeness in enquiring minds, encouraging negotiation and facilitating learning through dialogue\" (Nunn and Langille 2016, 302-316) to enable pupils and teachers to constantly choose appropriate techniques and methods concerning evolving situations."}, {"section_title": "THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "Theoretically, this study is premised within Foucault's (1981) Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). Extensive reading, identity and culture are constructed discursively in this study, using EFAL as a social practice. The analysis of discourse pertains to the analysis of the language applied. Kepe (2017) paraphrase discourse as \"a culturally and socially organised method of dialogue where the context of interaction is crucial to meaning making\" (2017, 74) . This consolidated definition leads to identifying the function of a reading workshop in this study, explained below. Atwell (2006) describes a reading workshop as \"an instructional practice that may assist children to grow as readers, speakers and independent thinkers\" (Atwell 2006, 26) . As exhibited in Kepe (2017) , pupils can create a literary community through reading workshops, enthusiastic about reading, whilst engaging in becoming fluent readers and thinkers, leading to a literacy process view. As a class teacher and a researcher, the research conductor was able to create a fear free environment. This was exhibited by the role the participants played in their classroom corner library where they enjoyed a freedom to select a book they like. Pupils were afforded reading time through Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (USSR) and received guidance."}, {"section_title": "READING WORKSHOP", "text": "The ability existed to teach reading to children, ensuring their reading ability to enable them to learn. Conversely, understanding the reading material, whilst enjoying the reading process were complex. Bearing this in mind, the pupils needed time to develop these skills.\nThey had to be devised to create an environment, supporting their growth and independent reading skills, pursuing book sponsors from NGOs such as Read and provincial libraries. The privileged was requested to bring available reading material from home. Parents were also engaged to sponsor reading material for the reading workshop.\nIn the context of this study, structures, such as classroom corner libraries and the big reading box were made available for the readers, reading what they find interesting: From fiction to nonfiction, from graphic reading material to magazines and news reports from printed and digital resources. The aim of the reading workshop was to provide time for pupils to read. Time made the difference in learners', whilst growing as readers. Emphasis was on managing pupils' self-governing reading during poetry classes. Demonstration assisted readers to easily construct their own poems (e.g. the \"I\" poem).\nThis was a starting line, using their own experiences to develop skills and strategies to read increasingly complex text. Towards concluding the children were required, during the lesson, to read aloud, be it a peer reading/shared reading/group/reading aloud, or whilst presenting their poems through a poster in class. The shared time added closure and a sense of celebration. The photograph labelled Corner library image A may assist to amplify how display was employed with the reading material removed from the handmade shelves of our classroom corner library."}, {"section_title": "Corner library image A", "text": "The above display was meant to entice and imbibed their thirst for reading. This signifies only one aspect of the reading workshop. Importantly, the reading material had to be contemporary whether fiction/non-fiction/magazines/graphic reading material or newspaper reports. Reading was also modelled and recommended. A strategically awareness was present, not to overshadow independent reading, which forms a pillar of a literacy process view. Activities, such as narration, dialogue, debates and roleplays were exhibited in the context of this project.\nThe study then progressed to the function of poetry in the reading workshop. Atwell (2006a) emphasises that poetry unassumingly assists individuals in self-understanding and knowledge on the requirements of high schoolers/adolescents. She states: \"The lesson poetry teaches kids concerns good writing, critical reading, the kind of adults they wish to become and the kind of world they hope to inhabit, extend the best invitation I can image to grow up smart, healthy, and whole\" (Atwell 2006a, 26) . This invokes Smith (1986) observing that adolescents are looking for role models consequently, if a teacher models reading then pupils are prone to become readers as was in (Kepe 2017) . Conversely, pupils who want to feel competent and in control of their lives, pursue role models in peers and adults. This is where the influence of poetry becomes significant. Poetry further communicates the goals of this research, since it was established that reading amongst pupils as a stimulus, inciting a learner to become a critical reader and a proficient writer, whilst becoming a fluent, eloquent speaker."}, {"section_title": "THE FUNCTION OF POETRY", "text": "In this regard, poetry became the mainstay of the curriculum for its brevity and generosity (Atwell 2006a) .\nIn view of these aspects, pupils find poetry appealing as they either find or draft a poem concerning interesting subjects from comic book heroes to prejudice. Pupils drafting their own poems, may travel farther into the genre, as explained below: An \"I Am\", (Fall 2013, 9-10) poem was utilised to develop love for poetry. This was often used during the study as an icebreaker in the classroom with participants at High School De Vos Malan. Participants' involvement would be to write an \"I Am\" poem about their own self. The \"I Am\" poem expressed the way they feel, their hopes, their thinking, dreams and enjoyment amongst others.\nEach \"I Am\" poem comprised specific mutual elements. The lines in \"I am poem\" were recited in class, started with words: \"I know\", \"I think\", \"I feel\" \"I say\" I smell and \"I hear\" (Fall 2013, 9-10) amongst others. Some sentences in the poems described resonated their imaginations, sounds and experiences (presenting figurative language).\nOther sentences expressed actual, literal emotions. The first line in their \"I am\" poems, was repeated during the conclusion of each stanza. In the research conductor's view this was a manifestation of literacy."}, {"section_title": "LITERACY", "text": "Provided the complex relationship between verbal and written language, a linguistic notion of literacy might prove to be unbeneficial. It might discard the available focus on the controversies, encompassing \"text\" (Kern 2000) . The study did not model on a view of literacy, which is usage centred; literacy would employ a use-centred model where the learner is empowered through interpretive practices. The study focussed on cultural awareness and critical reflection (Kepe 2017) . The goal of such literacy is parallel with the \"extensive reading\" approach. It is not free from social influences, linking individuals and the populace (Vygotsky 1978 ). Kern's (2000, 35) , observation corresponds with Vygotsky (1978) , stating that literacy is not the \"personal, idiosyncratic property of an individual, but rather a phenomenon created by society and shared and changed by the members of that society\"."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "Concerning the paradigm, the study is interpretive, based on a qualitative method.

This was in consistence with the study's firm belief that reading and responding are central to the literacy process view. This was observed in the USSR programme established concurrently during this study. Eighteen participants (learners) read independently and widely for enjoyment. As proof that reading indeed occurred during that time, participants would read and then react/reflect on the reading material read, such as any fiction/nonfiction selected books, graphic books, magazines or newspaper articles. Due to its efficiency and productivity, this process was endorsed and accommodated by High School De Vos Malan's School Management Team (SMT) as intrinsic to an English First Additional Language class timetable during the English FAL lesson.\nCertain SMT participants in this study, applauded the productivity of the USSR where pupils had a first-time opportunity to read and select interpreting book and read for joy.\nEndeavouring to enrich the programme, the study used a corner classroom library and managed to obtain book sponsors from the Eastern Cape Provincial Archive.\nParticipants brought various magazines and newspapers from home to the reading box.\nThe USSR was observed as an aspect of the subheading: Reading and interpreting a selected book and fit in to the English period where, before any lesson of the day commences, participants were provided 15 minutes to read silently. Due to time constraints, participants would be provided time to read homework whereby they were expected to report, react and reflect on what they read, in the form of free writing in their journals /USSR report.\nThis observation is consistent with the study observation that high school readers are inclined to specialise and flourish on characters close to their own age with identifiable emotions, accompanied with sensible challenges (Kepe 2017) . This statement appears valid, observed in participants' responses when they shared emotions, cried and laughed with characters in their USSR reports in the reading zone. It was fascinating in this programme to establish that participants actively engaged with reading material and reacted afterwards. Atwell (2007b) stresses that teachers should recognise learners' inclination (preference) as readers and provide them with books, matching their reading ability and interests.\nLearners' choice became a strong motivator and opportunities were created and initiated for them to engage in. Failure might have resulted in a lack of opportunities for regular, engaged reading. This indicates that the environment for reading was appealing.\nHigh schoolers teachers are aware that especially at an adolescent age, pupils must be treated as individuals. Pupils are expected to become independent readers. Yet, often they are provided with limited opportunities to investigate their own interests in reading; to read at their own pace, or to make their own decisions concerning book reading. High school teachers need to reform to develop and become lifelong readers. Several leading reading teachers, including Atwell (2006a) and Kepe (2017) argue that learners' ownership is crucial for a reading workshop. Instead of trying to persuade pupils to read all revered as \"great literature,\" pupils should be engaged in conversations on the uses they have for a range of texts in their own lives (Lewis 1997) . The study contended for teaching EFAL as a social practice through a literacy process view. Pupils seemed to have been forced to read material that they have no interest in and did not have a choice in selecting. This created resisting reading in school.

The rigorous selection was based on the qualitative study argument of no rules in qualitative research for determining how several instances are necessary to support a conclusion or interpretation and this is always a judgement call (Taylor and Bogdan 1998) . This elucidated on the observation that a single incident can be enough to build a conceptual category. As aforementioned, the data metaphorically suggests two categories of participants, indicating pupils and teachers. The analysis that followed in the study, employs a representative sampling for each of the above categories to introduce their perspective on teaching EFAL as social practice through a literacy process view. The categorisations of the themes were conducted discreetly for this analysis and interpretation.\nThe reader should be reminded that the devices used to collect data may not have been analysed and interpreted in isolation as they appear to be inextricably linked. The six devices indicated: Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times in the chosen educational institute, poetry reading and involvement of pupils. Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times at school and poetry reading and involvement of pupils were viewed as crucial components of the programme. In the representation of the data to follow, the crucial devices were depicted as segments.\nTwo strands of data were used for both Segment 1) a book of choice with time to read in class and Segment 2) reading and sharing poetry, ensuring that the presentation was salient.\nData stretches were illustrated in the analysis by using italic fonts. For the purposes of reference and harmony, the students would be labelled as (S) and the teachers as (Teachers). As aforementioned it was essential to recognise the data collection devices in contrast with the central theme, which in this case represents the main research question, to investigate how the EFAL could be taught as a social practice through a literacy process view in a specific school.\nBelow are the crucial devices followed by the theme:"}, {"section_title": "TEACHING FIRST ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AS A SOCIAL PRACTICE THROUGH A LITERACY PROCESS VIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Main devices", "text": "1) Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times at school.\n2) Poetry reading and involvement of pupils.\nBased on the above stance, instead of six themes, the study proposed one theme, fused within the main question: Teaching EFAL as social practice through a literacy process view paired with 1) Reading and interpreting a selected book, scheduled at specific times and 2) Poetry reading and involvement of pupils.

I know there are issues of culture/ tradition and accent, but you know accent is what you hear, and you get used to. For example, if they are used to British or American accent, they may lose they tradition/culture. I mean we have our own slangs and South Africans, we love our own slangs, and it doesn't matter whether you speak Afrikaans/ IsiXhosa/ isiZulu. So, I think it's a social thing, yes. I mean I have travelled overseas and used the words that we as South African are used to. I think in terms of the accent we just need to be tolerant I mean people have misconception of it. Being an avid great reader myself, I mean, my mother, since the small age, will push the books to us and it doesn't matter what you read as long as you read. The problem is that as such our learners, their parents aren't reading either, so they don't get into the habit of reading.

In view of this, this study revealed that for pupils to succeed in both EFAL deficit and in their studies across subjects in this school, they do not only need knowledge of English as instruction language and a social practice, but they also need to have a good knowledge of the cultures of those they interact with. This study employed an ethnographic design to investigate ways EFAL could be taught as a social practice through a literacy process view in a school. The research population was based on purposive sampling and participants were selected, based on judging their typicality (Kohonen et al. 2001 ).\nThe USSR was fitted into the English period before the lesson of the day for 15 minutes.\nDue to time constraints, participants were provided with reading homework. They were expected to report and reflect from what they read in the form of the USSR report/journal writing. This is consistent with the findings of this study that high school readers are inclined to specialise and flourish on characters close to their own age with recognisable emotions and realistic challenges. This study also revealed that poetry as a device, was effective in engaging participants' interactions in class, evident when sharing emotions, cried and laughed with characters in the reading workshop. Importantly, what was fascinating in this programme was to establish participants actively engaging with reading material and reacting afterwards.\nThe study revealed that teachers should recognise learners' inclination (preference) as readers and provide them with reading material matching their reading ability and interests.\nThis was a case in this study where learners' choice became a strong motivator (Gardner 1985) .\nThis invokes Atwell (2007b) , postulating that teachers need to create and initiate opportunities for pupils to engage, but failure may result in a lack of opportunities for regular, engaged reading. This indicates that the environment for reading should be appealing. Teachers should establish the scene. Organise attractive contemporary \"good books\" appropriate to pupils' level.\nOtherwise, falling short of this may assist identifying reasons why most pupils are poor readers upon entry into high education (Adamson et al. 2019 ). This study revealed that fostering pupils to become engaged readers, the teacher enables them to gain competence and self-efficacy (Rosenblatt 1995) .\nThe study also revealed the importance of intrinsic motivation (Gardner 1985) , in which teachers are crucial in establishing the stage and stimulating the desire to read for pleasure. This invokes Rosenblatt (1978) who mentions poetry as a major device through which language structure can be accomplished contingent on the passion and skilfulness of the teacher concern.\nHer assertion aforementioned agree with participants' observations that reading must commence from a young age. More reading material should be to the avail of pupils to relate themselves with. Simultaneously, it was also participants' view that schools need to be furnished with a school library and cupboards, displaying reading materials in and around the classroom. This includes catalogues from book companies where pupils indicated the availability of choice."}, {"section_title": "RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Implications of the study", "text": "\u2022 This study implicated a passion for reading, which should be instilled at an early age and commence preferably from home and be strengthened at primary schools. This would assist because by the time pupils reach secondary school, they are already fond of reading and have become readers. In the same breadth, this may culminate into improved results at Grade 12 because language would not indicate a challenge or a barrier.\n\u2022 Implications on teaching content subjects: It is well known that reading turn ordinary pupils into readers, which are analytical, critical, interrogative, diagnostic, systematic, logical and investigative thinkers. Considering this, pupils would have less battles with concepts. Pupils are known to fail examinations because they are unable to read instruction. Good readers would understand instructions and questions because they are familiar with the vocabulary used in the content. Since research indicates a strong correlation between reading proficiency and academic success at all ages, as the strategies suggested earlier towards teaching EFAL as a social practice through a literacy process view in a school, can contribute towards better results."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY", "text": "Concerning the limitations, the main challenge was the time as an insider, so it was needed to balance teaching time with study. Concerning (teachers) as participants break times had to be targeted and the free periods hold interviews and also to remind or galvanise participants for data collection. In some instances, the study would utilise holidays or even the weekends by arranging appointments, depending on the participant's availability, especially with teachers (participants) or at the least even call participants as a reminder and persuade them to complete a questionnaire for the purposes of data collection. Even though, there was some degree of procrastination by some participants (teachers) concerning data completion and delaying tactics, such as convening interviews sighting busy schedules, polite communication skills and patience with them, ultimately prevailed."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This investigation was mainly intended to examine whether EFAL could be taught as a social practice through a literacy process view in High School De Vos Malan. The findings collected from this study verified that cognitive and social interactive approaches should be encompassed within the constructivist epistemology to assist participants in becoming competent in EFAL.\nFindings of this study attired towards advancing teaching of the EFAL as a social practice through a literacy process view; an unorthodox alternative is not the only way for the acquisition of EFAL in schools. The above elucidations need to be observed as validations that sustenance the relevance of context to human behaviour and the significance of the subjective belief systems of those involved in research to research processes and outcomes (Nunn and Langille 2016) .\nIn assessing the above statement, the conclusions should not be observed as \"a temporal affirmation of objective knowledge that has accrued from traditional/scientific and rationalistic explorations\" (Sivasubramaniam 2011, 36) . This invokes Kohonen et al. (2001) , extrapolating that the conclusions should be context-based, context dependent confirmations of a constructivist knowledge, suggested through subjective perspectives of participants through their experiences in High School De Vos Malan. This study's suggestions serve as reinforcements, excluding generalisations of what was perceived as \"context bound characteristics\" of perspectival/speculative knowledge, evidenced from the data analysis."}]
