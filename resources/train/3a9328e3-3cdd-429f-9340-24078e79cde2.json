While there is large evidence of diffuse damage to the white matter in AD, it is unclear whether specific white matter tracts exhibit a more accelerated pattern of damage and whether the damage is associated with the classical neurodegenerative changes of AD. In this study, we investigated microstructural differences in the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using recently developed automated diffusion tractography procedures in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Eighteen major fiber bundles in a total of 36 individuals with AD, 81 MCI and 60 control participants were examined with the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. For each fiber bundle, the mean fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, radial and axial diffusivities were calculated. Individuals with AD had increased diffusivities in both left and right cingulumangular bundles compared to control participants (p < 0.001). Individuals with MCI also had increased axial and mean diffusivities and increased FA in both cingulumangular bundles compared to control participants (p < 0.05) and decreased radial diffusivity compared to individuals with AD (p < 0.05). We additionally examined how white matter deterioration relates to hippocampal volume, a traditional imaging measure of AD pathology, and found the strongest negative correlations in AD patients between hippocampal volume and the diffusivities of the cingulumangular and cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundles and of the corticospinal tracts (p < 0.05). However, statistically controlling for hippocampal volume did not remove all group differences in white matter measures, suggesting a unique contribution of white matter damage to AD unexplained by this disease biomarker. These results suggest that (1) ADassociated deterioration of white matter fibers is greatest in tracts known to be connected to areas of pathology in AD and (2) lower white matter tract integrity is more diffusely associated with lower hippocampal volume indicating that the pathology in the white matter follows to some degree the neurodegenerative staging and progression of this condition. \u00d3 2015 IBRO.

This condition contributes to substantial societal and economic burdens (Rice et al., 1993; Langa et al., 2001) , and the pathophysiology of AD remains to be fully understood. Although much work is focused on cortical atrophy and on amyloid and neurofibrillary pathology in the cortex and subcortical gray matter (Bouras et al., 1994; Hyman, 1997; Tiraboschi et al., 2004; Jack et al., 2011) , it is also clear that there is significant widespread damage to the cerebral white matter (WM) as the disease progresses, both evidenced by an increased amount of WM abnormalities as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Yoshita et al., 2006) , and by studies showing demyelination, microglial activation, loss of oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytosis in the WM (Brun and Englund, 1986; Sjobeck et al., 2005 Sjobeck et al., , 2006 Gouw et al., 2008) . This WM damage likely plays an important role in the clinical presentation of individuals with AD, and better understanding of these changes may provide insight into alternative pathologic mechanisms contributing to AD dementia. In particular, it is of interest to understand where the strongest regional WM changes are found and whether they affect particular fiber bundles in the cerebral WM. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this damage tracks with cortical AD pathology such as hippocampal degeneration.\nSeveral studies have used neuroimaging techniques such as volumetric measurements (Salat et al., 1999a,b; Salat et al., 2009 ) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Rose et al., 2000; Bozzali et al., 2002; Choi et al., 2005; Bucur et al., 2008; Madden et al., 2009; Salat et al., 2009; Stebbins and Murphy, 2009; Gold et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010; Pievani et al., 2010; Douaud et al., 2011; Nir et al., 2012 Nir et al., , 2013 Rowley et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014) to study WM pathology in AD and show both extensive local and diffuse damage. DTI enables the measurement of several microstructural properties of the WM tissue environment. Commonly-described DTI parameters include fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR), which have been respectively correlated histologically with degree of myelination (Beaulieu, 2002; Moseley, 2002; Peters, 2002) , cell death and edema (Chenevert et al., 2000; Sotak, 2002) , axonal injury and demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytosis (Werring et al., 1999; Song et al., 2002 Song et al., , 2003 . In addition to markers of tissue integrity, diffusion-weighted imaging is a useful technique to infer local fiber orientation for the computational modeling of the major fiber bundles in the brain, referred to as 'diffusion tractography' (Basser et al., 2000) . Previous studies used a combination of DTI and tractography to study pathology in AD (Madden et al., 2009; Pievani et al., 2010; Douaud et al., 2011; Hasan et al., 2012; Nir et al., 2012; Rowley et al., 2013) . We here add to this work by applying a recently developed automated probabilistic tractography procedure for wholebrain modeling of the major cerebral WM fiber bundles, TRActs\nConstrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) (Yendiki et al., 2011) and examining which of the major large fascicles of the brain exhibit the greatest WM deterioration as a consequence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. We additionally examined the association between tract integrity measured with DTI and a classical imaging marker of AD, hippocampal volume, to determine whether the WM changes are related to neurodegeneration or to a different cause. We demonstrate for the first time in a large dataset relative effects among fiber bundles showing greatest WM deterioration in cingulum-angular bundles for both MCI and AD, while the corticospinal tracts, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, uncinate fasciculi, corpus callosum, and anterior thalamic radiations were relatively spared. Tract integrity was associated with hippocampal volume in individuals with AD as well as the control cohort; however, the relationship in AD was pronounced for tracts closest/with anatomical connectivity to the hippocampus. These data demonstrate that regional WM pathology tracks with hippocampal degeneration in AD. While we expected a selective loss in individuals with MCI and a more generalized effect in AD related to a greater degree of global cortical degeneration, we did not find this. Instead, we found greater diffusivity differences in AD compared to controls in the same WM tracts where effects are seen in MCI."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). A description of ADNI as described (on the ADNI website) is provided here: The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nAt the time of analysis, 232 participants were found to have performed both structural and DTI scans from the ADNIGO and ADNI2 databases. In addition to MRI data, clinical profiles including age, sex, education, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were obtained for participant characterization. Group designation of Control, MCI, or probable AD was determined by diagnosis as specified by ADNI based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke -Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (McKhann et al., 1984) . Clinical profiles and diagnostic information were obtained from the closest assessment to the time of brain imaging scan. Participants enrolled as generally healthy and with significant subjective memory concern were grouped together into the control group, and participants enrolled as early and late MCI were combined into one MCI group. Overall, the 232 baseline DTI datasets available in the ADNI database included 48 individuals with AD, 99 individuals with MCI, 71 cognitively healthy control participants and 14 individuals of undetermined group (absent or incomplete clinical information for a diagnosis at the time of download)."}, {"section_title": "MRI acquisition", "text": "All participants underwent whole-brain MRI scanning on 3-Tesla GE Medical System scanners at one or multiple visits.

Although we do not discuss longitudinal analysis in this report, the FreeSurfer longitudinal stream was used for participants with multiple time points (with diffusion datasets) as this procedure is unbiased by the number of time points and more robust when multiple time points are available (Reuter et al., 2010 Reuter and Fischl, 2011; Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2012 Sabuncu et al., 2014) . Measurements of both right and left hippocampal volumes and estimated intracranial volume (ICV) were performed using the automated subcortical segmentation and cortical parcellation tools available as part of FreeSurfer, as described previously (Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl et al., 2004a Fischl et al., ,b, 2008 Desikan et al., 2006; Han and Fischl, 2007; Yeo et al., 2008; Destrieux et al., 2010) . We normalized the hippocampal volume ICV [(sum of both hippocampus volume divided by ICV) * 100] and the volume of the lateral ventricles to ICV [(sum of both lateral ventricle volume divided by ICV) * 100] for statistical analyses.

TRACULA is a novel method for automated global probabilistic reconstruction of 18 major WM pathways. In order to reconstruct these WM tracts, TRACULA utilizes prior information on the anatomy from a set of training participants where the tracts of interest were labeled manually. This prior information is the likelihood of each tract to travel through or next to each of the cortical and subcortical segmentation labels from FreeSurfer. The output of TRACULA is a probabilistic distribution for each of the 18 tracts.\nParticipant data was first preprocessed to correct for simple head motion and eddy currents by aligning the diffusion weighted images to an average of the b = 0, T2-weighted images. The gradient vectors were rotated accordingly. FreeSurfer's bbregister ) was used for affine intra-subject registration between the diffusion-weighted and anatomical images, and to an MNI152 template (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) . Using FSL's dtifit (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl), a least squares tensor estimation was completed creating the FA, MD, DA, and DR volumes. FSL's bedpostX (Behrens et al., 2007) was used to apply the ball-andstick model of diffusion, using one isotropic and two anisotropic compartments per voxel. TRACULA then uses the individual participant's ball-and-stick model of local diffusion orientations, as well as the participant's cortical and subcortical segmentation labels, combined with prior information on each tract's position relative to these labels based on the training set to estimate the probability distributions of each tract. This allows the reconstruction of volumetric distributions of the 18 major white-matter pathways included in the atlas and the extraction of tensor-based measures (FA, MD, DA and DR) for each of the reconstructed pathways. The 18 major WM pathways include the corticospinal tract, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinated fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundle, cingulum-angular bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus-parietal bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus-temporal bundle, corpus callosum's forceps major and forceps minor."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of head motion", "text": "Participant motion has been demonstrated to be a confounding factor in prior imaging work leading to spurious group differences in diffusion MRI (Yendiki et al., 2013) as well as other imaging domains (Power et al., 2012) .

For participants with multiple diffusion datasets (177 out of 232), we used this information to select the participant's diffusion dataset with the least translation motion for all of our processing and analyses. No significant differences in motion measures were found between diffusion datasets chosen from individuals with a unique diffusion dataset and individuals with multiple diffusion datasets (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Quality assessment and exclusion", "text": "Among 232 participants, a total of 177 images were fully processed through TRACULA and included in the final group analyses: 11 were not processed due to an unsuccessful or inaccurate FreeSurfer reconstruction, 30 were not included due to failure of reconstruction of at least two major tracts. In total, twelve AD, 18 MCI and 11 controls as well as the 14 participants with undetermined grouping were excluded from the initial 232 individual datasets downloaded from the ADNI database.\nVisual inspection suggested that the participants without successful reconstruction were individuals with severely degenerated brain tissue. We therefore compared the motion scores, normalized WMSA volume, normalized volume of the lateral ventricles between the included and excluded participants to determine whether any of these parameters accounted for the reconstruction failures, using Student t-test. While there was no difference in motion scores between the two groups, there were significantly greater normalized WMSA volume and normalized volume of the lateral ventricles in the excluded subjects (not shown).\nAlthough these datasets could have been included with additional effort, the results demonstrate that the current dataset provides adequate statistical power to detect the strongest disease effects despite the exclusion of participants with excessive tissue damage including WM damage and/or ventricular enlargement. Therefore, it is important to note that this exclusion may over-emphasize the degree of selectivity of the results as the excluded individuals would have increased statistical power to detect more diffuse damage as observed previously in voxelwise and region-of-interest studies."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Statistical analyses were performed using JMP version 10 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.).

These analyses were applied to the control, MCI and AD participants to understand the relationship between the damage classically attributed in AD (declining hippocampal volume) and the deterioration of the WM tracts with the disease, and show whether these two phenomena can be potentially attributed to a linked disease pathway.

Of note, several significant associations remained strong in individuals with AD, such as for MD in both cingulum-angular bundles, cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundles, corticospinal tracts, and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Notably, AD also preserved a strong association between hippocampal volume and DA of the corpus callosum-forceps minor, and both cingulum-angular bundles.

We find that the cingulum-angular bundles of MCI and AD participants show deterioration in WM integrity compared to controls mainly through increases in diffusivity values, while corticospinal tracts, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, uncinate fasciculi, corpus callosum, and anterior thalamic radiations were relatively preserved, but still demonstrated (non- significant) increased diffusivity values in AD (except for the corticospinal tracts). This is suggestive of greater deterioration associated with AD cortical pathology given that the cingulum-angular bundle connects to the hippocampus, one of the structures most affected by AD. Furthermore, increases in diffusivities are associated with cell death and edema (Chenevert et al., 2000; Sotak, 2002) , which are expected following neurodegeneration. To investigate this link further, we examined the associations between the integrity of each major fascicle and a traditional marker of AD pathology, hippocampal volume. This was significant for the cingulumangular bundles, but also for several other fascicles, indicating that hippocampal volume and cortical AD pathology might still have an effect on WM integrity more broadly, even if absolute group differences in DTI parameters were not statistically significant. Furthermore, we investigated whether there were group differences that are unexplained by hippocampal volume and age. We indeed still found significant group differences in DTI parameters of the left and right cingulum angular bundles, even when correcting for age, sex, education, hippocampal volume and motion measures. This suggests that the increases in diffusivity values (and changes in FA) in MCI and AD are not solely dependent on age and hippocampal neurodegeneration, and that there might be additional processes that could explain these remaining differences, such as co-existing vascular injuries in AD participants, or even possibly vascular injuries that are part of the AD pathogenesis itself, which were not investigated in this study.\nSeveral prior studies have examined the influence of AD and MCI on WM measured by DTI (Choi et al., 2005; Bucur et al., 2008; Madden et al., 2009; Salat et al., 2009 Salat et al., , 2010 Stebbins and Murphy, 2009; Gold et al., 2010; Pievani et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010; Douaud et al., 2011; Nir et al., 2012 Nir et al., , 2013 Rowley et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014) . Our aim here was to apply a newly developed technique for reconstructing discrete large fascicles throughout the cerebral WM in a large sample to determine the relative effects across these anatomical units which are known to have functional specificity. Overall, the fiber bundles demonstrating most significant alterations are known to support memory and these results confirm prior work using whole brain, region of interest, and more selective tractography (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010; Salat et al., 2010; Douaud et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Hasan et al., 2012) . However, it is also different from similar prior work (Pievani et al., 2010) using tractography in a smaller sample in that it finds a stronger effect on these systems (cingulum-angular bundles), instead of greater diffusivity values for all tracts in AD compared to controls. It has to be noted however that diffusivity values of most tracts generally increased with progression of the disease, despite not achieving significant group differences. We also observed a significant increase in the FA of the cingulum-angular bundles in MCI participants compared to controls and AD subjects (and non-significant increase in several other tracts), which is a behavior that has been observed before (Douaud et al., 2011) . This behavior is related to an increase in DA in MCI compared to controls that is unmatched by an increase in DR, generating a higher FA in MCI. An increase is then observed in DR in AD and explains the lower FA observed in AD compared to MCI. This can be potentially attributed to the relative neurodegeneration of one fiber bundle while crossing fibers from another bundle are spared; however it is unclear whether the fibers of the cingulum-angular bundle undergo axonal changes in MCI or whether fibers crossing this bundle are undergoing radial changes such as demyelination that would appear as an increase of DA. It is not surprising to see this behavior given several studies have shown that most of the WM fiber bundles in the brain are crossing with other fibers (Wedeen et al., 2012; Jeurissen et al., 2013) ; however, at this time, the increase in diffusivity in MCI remains unclear and neuropathological and histological studies are needed to better inform this phenomenon and correctly understand it. While there were generally no significant group differences in the association between tracts' DTI metrics and hippocampal volume, controls had a negative correlation between tracts' DTI metrics and hippocampal volume in most tracts for diffusivities. AD similarly had a negative correlation between tracts' DTI metrics and hippocampal volume in most tracts, especially the forceps minor and the cingulum-angular bundles for both axial and MD. A negative correlation between hippocampal volume and MD of the cingulumcingulate gyrus bundle and of the corticospinal tracts was also found in AD. This hints at a relationship in the controls that is largely driven by normal individual variation where individuals in good health will tend to have both a larger hippocampal volume and greater integrity of their WM tracts, while in AD the relationship is more specific and related to the disease that affects hippocampal volume to a much larger extent than normal variation within the controls. This effect was more diffuse than the group differences observed.\nOne limitation of this study is the exclusion of participants with excessive tissue damage including WM damage and/or ventricular enlargement, which biases this study toward finding less WM damage and overemphasizing the degree of selectivity of the results as Fig. 3 . Example of the association between DTI parameters and normalized hippocampal volume [(sum of both hippocampi volume)/ICV * 100] in the right cingulum-angular bundle in control, MCI, and AD participants, using the Pearson's correlation test. FA = fractional anisotropy; MD = mean diffusivity; DR = radial diffusivity; DA = axial diffusivity; normalized hippocampal volume = (sum of hippocampal volume)/ICV * 100; MCI: mild cognitive impairment; AD: Alzheimer's disease. ''r'' indicates the correlation coefficient. the excluded individuals would have increased statistical power to detect more diffuse damage as observed previously in voxelwise and region-of-interest studies. Individuals with FreeSurfer cortical reconstructions and anatomical segmentations in need of manual correction were excluded for this study. Another limitation is that the remainder of the participants did not undergo any manual correction, though the FreeSurfer anatomical segmentation is known to be robust and highly correlated with manual segmentations (Cherbuin et al., 2009; Morey et al., 2009; Pardoe et al., 2009; Wenger et al., 2014) .\nThe pathophysiologic link between WM damage and cortical changes in AD is currently unclear. It is possible that these greatest WM changes observed are secondary to cortical deterioration and the overall loss of fibers following neurodegeneration. Alternatively, it is possible that some other cause generates both the WM and cortical damage observed in AD, or that an independent influence on WM damage is also present in addition to secondary events to neurodegeneration, such as vascular injuries co-existing or part of AD pathology. It is possible that therapeutic interventions specifically targeting processes related to WM deterioration could at least slow the progression of disease and should therefore be considered."}]
