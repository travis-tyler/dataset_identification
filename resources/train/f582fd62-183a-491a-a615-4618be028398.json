[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Risk to human well-being is a function of both vulnerability and exposure to hazards in all their varied forms. Characterizing this risk falls within the human-environment interaction domain of geographic study. The focus of the present study is how geographically referenced data can be used in the human-environment interaction equation to model at-risk vulnerable populations, particularly the medically fragile. As feature layers, these data represent both human geographic space and the environmental hazard spaces of tropical storm processes derived from empirical observations and hydrological modeling techniques. These data layers can then be integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) to produce target data layers of vulnerable populations (Cova 1999). GIS plays an increasingly important role in the comprehensive emergency management cycle, since the resulting data and information generated from this application provides information and context for planning and decision support (Greene 2002). Identifying the location and numbers of medically fragile (MF), including the elderly over age 75, that are potentially at-risk from tropical storm surge inundation is an important consideration in emergency management planning as population growth continues along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. In this study, the estimation of MF populations is undertaken by employing the relatively simple concept of the disaster or hazard footprint (Garb et al. 2007). A GIS is used to extract the numbers of a defined vulnerable population, like the medically fragile, by creating a geographically referenced storm surge inundation zone--the footprint--and superimposing it on a population source feature layer (the input). The boundary or edge of the footprint inscribes the at-risk population as a target feature layer (the output)."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "REGIONALIZING COASTAL POPULATIONS", "text": "Regionalizing coastal populations generally falls into two categories: physical, which includes distance inland and/or hypsometry, and administratively defined coastal management zones, which is usually defined as a set of counties and their populations bordering the coastline. Arbitrary distances such as 100 kilometers can be used to enclose and define at-risk populations living near coastal shorelines. This simple set of criteria is useful for making cross-regional comparisons and illustrating the global trend in coastal population growth around the globe. Globally, not all coastal populations are equally at risk from hazards, since local coastal topographies and patterns of human settlement are highly variable. Hypsometric regionalization schemes using elevation from mean higher high water to determine the extent of inundation (Cohen and Small 1998) possess similar advantages and disadvantages to regionalizing coastal populations as the distance criterion. Distance and elevation criteria both lend themselves well to modelling the impacts of sea level rise at different scales and scenarios (Haer et al. 2013;Hanson et al. 2011;Lam et al. 2009;Small and Nicholls 2003). Storm surges and inundation will affect settlements and populations that are part of larger political and administrative entities. Planning and coordination of emergency services occurs at different scales and draws upon resources at higher levels of governance such as the US county and state. Here, coastal populations are derived from counties that have experienced or can potentially experience direct and indirect impacts from coastal hazards. In this approach demographic and socio-economic characteristics and trends found for affected populations are integrated into information that can be used to inform stakeholder decision making and planning (FEMA 2011). A coastal management zone is defined if 15% of a county lies in a coastal watershed or that a given county accounts for at least 15% of a coastal cataloguing unit (Ache et al. 2013;SEDAC-CIESIN 2012). In addition to the watershed criteria, NOAA also provides digital watershed and shoreline county data via its Digital Coast website (NOAA n.d.). Defining at-risk populations by combining political administrative units such as counties in relation to coastal watersheds and shorelines is a practical approach for emergency management planners at local and regional scales. Another method for defining populations at risk from coastal hazards is using estimated spatial extents of a physical hazard. These extents are sometimes referred to as disaster footprints (Garb et al. 2007). Examples include plumes of particulate matter, radiation, and other contaminant releases. The extent of inundation from a storm surge can be thought of as a hydrologic disaster footprint. Coastal populations at-risk of inundation are identified by the superimposition of this disaster footprint. The population inscribed by the disaster footprint represents an approximate minimum number of people exposed to the hazard, since the effects of inundation will extend beyond the physical boundary of the storm surge zone by interrupting egress and hampering access to services, as well as affecting emergency response to populations outside of the footprint. Determining the geographic extent of storm surge inundation accompanied by an estimation of individuals directly affected can be a useful planning tool in the emergency management planning armamentarium especially when combined with socio-economic data, high resolution mapping such as FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and local knowledge and experience."}, {"section_title": "THE RISK EQUATION", "text": "Risk can be thought of as the likelihood of an individual or population experiencing from an event that results in a negative outcome for life, limb, and property. Disaster risk is a function of the interaction between an individual's or population's vulnerability to a hazard --both natural and anthropogenic. Vulnerability, like susceptibility, is a state that is based on the degree of exposure, the capacity to respond, and the ability to recover or inherent resiliency. Hazards are events that unfold in temporal scales ranging from the nearly instantaneous to centuries, and have the potential to threaten individual and societal well-being (Wisner et al. 2004). For growing coastal populations, sea level rise exacerbated by the impacts of tropical storm inundation represent both long and short term coastal hazards with their attendant levels of risk to vulnerable populations. Conceptually, the risk equation can be represented as thus (Cova 1999), where V(E v ) represents the segment of the vulnerable population, E v , exposed to a hazard and H(E v ) is that portion of the hazard that can potentially affect can be modeled as feature layers in a GIS and are the conceptual basis for extracting estimates of medically fragile populations."}, {"section_title": "THE VULNERABLE AND THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE", "text": "A population's vulnerability can change from one hazard to the next, while population groups living within the same geographic area and exposed to the same hazard will experience different levels of risk and outcomes. The degree of vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic hazards can arise from social and economic processes that produce uneven distributions of wealth and access to resources thereby exacerbating an individual's ability to cope financially as well as psychologically (Cutter 2013;Cutter et al. 2013;Cutter et al. 2008;Cutter et al. 2003). This lack of resiliency can also have future impacts on a population's health and well being. Demographic characteristics of populations can also influence vulnerability. A relatively young population with larger numbers of children will experience risk from hazards differently than elderly populations. Regardless of socio-economic status and demographic characteristics, all populations will have individuals with chronic medical conditions that require levels of care in order to live. The problem of survival for these groups becomes particularly acute when disaster strikes. The medically fragile population or MF is one such vulnerable group (Baker and Cormier 2014;Wilson et al. 2013) found within populations exposed to coastal hazards. The primary MF population is divided into three tiers of priority based on medical condition and the care or treatment required to maintain life. Tier 1, the highest priority level, includes individuals who are medically unstable and require uninterrupted medical attention. No immediate care will result in deterioration of patient health status. These patients tend to be electrically dependent, needing life sustaining equipment and/or medication. Another characteristic of this patient group, important for emergency planning, is that these patients have neither caregiver nor an informal care network. Tier 2 patients have similar health needs to the first group and are also medically unstable, but the need for immediate care is less dire. Although ideally this group should be seen within 24 hours after an interruption of regular scheduled healthcare, the critical period can be extended up to 48 hours before further deterioration of health. The final group, Tier 3, is made up of those patients that can miss treatments and scheduled healthcare appointments, but not beyond one week. Unlike Tier 1 and 2 patients, this group is supported by an informal network of caregivers, or is able to seek care and access care on their own (Wilson et al. 2013;Hammiel et al. 2007). Distributed among the patient priority tiers are five chronic medical conditions that define the primary MF population. The following conditions comprise approximately 8.08% of the US general population: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3.89%); insulin dependent diabetes (1.96%); congestive heart failure (1.76%); receive long-term oxygen treatment (0.33%); and end-stage renal disease (0.14%) (Hammiel et al. 2007). Applying the total proportion of chronic conditions to the 2010 US Census population under the age of 75 years yields an approximate minimal number of 22.7 million patients that occupy one or more of the five condition categories (US Census Bureau 2010). In addition to the primary MF population, the total MF population includes individuals over the age of 75 years. This is based on the assumption that at least 80% of this population suffers from at least one of the five chronic previously listed. Elderly populations present unique challenges to emergency management systems in terms of mobilization, safe egress, and access to emergency services and sheltering during a tropical storm event (Behr and Diaz 2013;Aldrich and Benson 2008;McGuire et al. 2007;O'Brien 2003). Approximately 19 million people or 7% of the total US population belong to this group, thereby increasing the overall MF population to an estimated figure of 41.7 million (US Census Bureau 2010)."}, {"section_title": "COASTAL HAZARD: THE STORM SURGE FOOTPRINT", "text": "A storm surge is the result of a combination factors generated by tropical and extratropical storms. Local and regional coastal topographic and bathymetric characteristics combine with wind speed, storm track, and pressure to produce a dome of water that, when added to current astronomical tidal heights, can overwash shorelines potentially reaching far into interiors causing much destruction to coastal ecosystems, including human life, limb, and property (Kron 2013). To characterize the threat storm surges can pose to human well-being, the Sea, Land, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model has been developed to assist forecasters (Glahn et al. 2009;Jelesnianski et al. 1992), engineers, and emergency management planners in their efforts to mitigate the effects of storm surges and design improvements in the built environment (Grubesic and Matisziw 2013; Slobbe 2013) as well as provide services, including appropriate evacuation routes for those directly affected by tropical storm hazards. The SLOSH model is the basis for two approaches used in tropical storm prediction forecasting. These approaches incorporate aspects of both deterministic and probabilistic modeling (Thompson and Frazier 2014). The first approach, the Probabilistic Hurricane Storm Surge (P-Surge) model, is built on many SLOSH runs that incorporate past forecasting performance and different wind and tracking scenarios (Taylor and Glahn 2008). P-Surge modeling provides probabilities of storm surges exceeding different heights above land (NOAA 2014a). Archived P-Surge inundation extents are available for tropical storm advisories and can be used to estimate populations that may be inundated at different heights above land using a GIS (Wilson et al. 2013). The second approach is a composite of many thousands of SLOSH model runs that incorporates a range of hypothetical hurricanes and conditions. The chief products of the latter approach are the Maximum Envelopes of Water or MEOWs and the Maximum of MEOWS or MOMs (Glahn et al. 2009). Both of these products incorporate forecast uncertainty and are used by emergency managers in the design of evacuation zones for vulnerable populations (NOAA 2014b). While P-Surge inundation extents provide fairly realistic maximal upper boundaries with probabilities useful in emergency management planning, MOMs can provide a reasonably stable spatial field or zone that allows for studying potential inundation scenarios for different hurricane categories. This is an important capability for long term location planning of evacuation routes, sheltering, and the designation of facilities for food, medical provisioning, and other needs. The study of vulnerable populations and hazards is inherently geographic. GIS permits the integration of widely disparate geographically referenced data. Indeed, large publicly available datasets are now nearly ubiquitous with many different public agencies producing and maintaining geographically referenced data that cover a myriad of topics. The conceptual risk equation 1 above provides a framework by which empirical and modeled public data, specifically US Census populations and storm surge inundation zones, can be used to construct estimates of at-risk MF populations exposed to tropical storm surges. In addition to producing numeric estimates, a GIS can also be used to visualize the spatial distributions of at-risk MF populations at different scales and hazard scenarios. The present study explores a simple method for using publicly available data and GIS to determine the sizes and geographic distributions of the at-risk general and MF populations for the eastern and Gulf coastal margins of the US. The research presented here is intended to explore a low-cost practical method for estimating costs, allocating resources, and targeting MF populations."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "The goal of the present study is to estimate and provide a means for visualizing the numbers and geographic distribution of at-risk general and MF populations for the eastern and Gulf coasts of the US. Using a GIS, at-risk populations are estimated by combining enumerated population distributions from the US Census with spatial hydrological modeling outputs (MOMs). The nature of the data required is discussed below followed by the steps used in the GIS modeling of at-risk MF populations. The US Census constructs its observational units from a combination of administrative, infrastructural, and natural boundaries that encompasses populations at different geographic scales. Census blocks are the smallest observational units and completely tessellate the 50 US (n = 11,155,486 plus 544,847 water only blocks) (US Census Bureau 2010). As part of the US Census geographic hierarchy, they are the fundamental spatial unit for designing congressional and state legislative districts and are also used in the delineation of urbanized areas (US Census Bureau 2013). Not all nonwater census blocks are populated and the size and shape of census blocks will reflect settlement pattern and density."}, {"section_title": "THE VULNERABLE POPULATION FEATURE LAYER", "text": "Population age group data were available at the census block level from the Census Bureau's SF-1. 2010 block level population data for each of the coastal states belonging to the study area were downloaded via ftp from the US Census Bureau's website. SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was then used to extract population data and export them into MS-Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) worksheets state by state. In MS-Excel the population groups were aggregated into two population groups: under 75 years and those over. Once compiled, the worksheets were \"joined\" to the 2013 census block TIGER/Line Shapefiles (US Census Bureau 2014a) using ArcGIS 10.0/1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). In the new shapefiles, the MF population fields were calculated by applying the constant of 0.0808 (see Hammiel 2007 above) to the group under 75 years for each census block within the state. For each state, these final block shapefiles served as source zone input layers for estimating MF populations."}, {"section_title": "THE HAZARD FEATURE LAYER", "text": "In contrast to the empirical nature of the census block, the spatial units used for SLOSH, P-Surge, MEOWs, and MOMs calculation are mathematically derived hyperbolic grids and form a series of SLOSH basins that ring the eastern and Gulf coastline of the US. The grid cells, while having a somewhat regular appearance prior to simulation, vary in size with increasingly smaller, higher resolution cells focused on larger coastal population centers in order to provide more accurate estimates of storm surge heights for emergency management planning. The SLOSH basin data were obtained from the SLOSH Display Program (version 1.65i) (NOAA 2013). MOMs were selected by hurricane category for each of the 33 SLOSH Basins. To construct storm surge footprints for each hurricane category MOM, the hyperbolic grids for the 33 basins were first merged (\"Union\") and then the grid cells were \"dissolved\" using the geoprocessing facility \"Dissolve\" in ArcGIS. The union and dissolving processes were automated by employing ArcGIS's ModelBuilder (ESRI, Redlands, CA) ultimately yielding five separate input feature layers (hurricane categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4&5 combined) that covered the entire eastern and Gulf coasts of the US. Figure 1 depicts the combined spatial extents of the 33 SLOSH basins that cover the eastern and Gulf coastlines. Table 1 summarizes state basin coverages with the maximum MOM storm surge heights attainable for each state in meters. The minimum height of water for all MOMs was three centimeters. To estimate coastal MF populations two methods are employed. The first method, a form of spatial interpolation, proportionally weights populations by area. For example, the leading edge of a storm surge footprint will not only encompass census blocks in their entirety, but will also intersect blocks at the furthest reaches inscribed by the edge of the footprint. Population estimates for these intersected blocks are found by multiplying the total block population's number by the remaining proportional area of the intersected block. Proportionally weighting populations by area is the least problematic when using census blocks. Because the areal extent of a block is small, the assumption of the block's population being homogenously distributed within is more realistic than the same assumption for larger census units such as the census tract or county. The second method, less computationally intensive, \"captures\" census block centroids contained within inundation zones or storm surge footprints. With this method, the entire population of a block is included in the aggregate MF population when the centroid is located behind the leading edge of the footprint (Chakraborty 2011;Schlossberg 2003). The present study will evaluate the differences in population estimates generated by both methods.  In the terminology of spatial interpolation, the block feature layers for both general and MF populations are the equivalent to source zone layers (V(E v )), while the storm surge footprint layers (H(E v )) used to \"clip\" the source zones are the rezoned target layers (MF populations at risk). The following summarizes a general framework of steps used to arrive at estimates of medically fragile populations. Step 1: Construct population source zone layers built from the US Census blocks. Construct storm surge footprint layers (the final target zones) from the SLOSH Step 2: Use storm surge footprint layers to rezone the population source zone layers into final target zone layers. Use the areal weighting spatial interpolation technique to create population estimates for those census blocks that have been intersected by the edge or boundary of the basin and/or storm surge footprint. Step 3 Using the same storm surge footprint layer as in step 2, overlay the disaster footprint to capture all census block centroids contained within and assign and aggregate the centroid populations, thus obtained, to each inundation hazard layer. Step 4. Estimate medically fragile populations by applying the constant, 0.0808, which was derived from the literature to both interpolated and captured block populations. Step 5. Create map of MOM inundation zones and tabulate and compare populations estimated by both methods. Figure 2 provides a visual summary of the layers used in this study. The map focuses on census blocks within and surrounding Mobile, Alabama inscribed by a combination of SLOSH basins (ms7, hbix, emo2, and epn3). This feature layer is the population source zone. One feature layer, the hurricane category 4/5 storm surge footprint is shown and represents a target zone. The jagged appearing edges of the footprint1 are what remains after the hyperbolic grid cells for the hurricane category 4/5 MOM are \"dissolved\" in GIS."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The data generated from running ArcGIS ModelBuilder were then compiled into tables to produce maps and summary tables. The resulting figure and tables show the geographical extent of each hurricane category and provide values for MF populations by hurricane category and states. The tables also provide a comparison between the aggregates of block populations estimated by spatial interpolation (areal weighting) and centroid capture. Figure 3 portrays the geographical extent of inundation for each hurricane category region based on SLOSH Basin MOMs along the eastern and Gulf coasts of the US. Some SLOSH Basin MOMs have the same storm surge heights for hurricane categories 4 and 5, hence they are combined in the map and the subsequent tables. Visual inspection shows that category 1 hurricanes inundate the largest areas for nearly all states. Coastal city locations are also included to show that nearly all major settlements are within the reach of an inundation extent. Lake Okeechobee is also included since its coastline and surrounding uplands are affected by storm surges. Table 2 shows the estimated MF populations at risk for the modeled storm category regions in Figure 3. For each category, the numbers of at-risk individuals are estimated by the two methods. The number of blocks contained within a storm surge footprint, including those intersected by the leading edge of the storm surge footprint, is found in column b. The block centroids captured by the footprint are found in column c. Block and population numbers are accumulated as the hurricane category increases. Column d is the difference in the number of blocks used in estimating the MF populations for each hurricane category. The results show that within the geographic scope of each hurricane category, fewer block centroids are captured than the number of blocks used in areal weighting. The differences between the two methods range between 4.4% and 9.9% and decreases as the number of blocks increases (column e). "}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "International Journal of Geospatial and Environmental Research, Vol. 2, No. 1 [2015], Art. 1 https://dc.uwm.edu/ijger/vol2/iss1/1  The same pattern holds for comparing the general populations calculated using both methods. The percent differences between the two populations are small, ranging from 0.16 % to 0.70% and decreases with higher hurricane categories. A similar pattern holds for the estimated MF populations for each hurricane category. For the entire eastern and Gulf coast margins the general population potentially exposed to a category 1 hurricane numbers at least 13.7 million people with approximately of 2.0 million people that are medically fragile. These numbers double for the region exposed to category 4 and 5 hurricanes: approximately 27.8 million of the general (total) population and about 4.0 million medically fragile. For both the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Table 3 (derived from Table 2) shows the relative amount of risk of inundation for MF populations as storm surge extents increase their reach inland by hurricane category. The shaded cells in the matrix are the increases in relative risk to MF populations as hurricane categories move to the next level. The largest relative increase is between hurricane categories 2 and 3 and thereafter relative risks begin to decline for the stronger hurricane categories. As can be seen from the map in Figure 3, this can be explained by the locations of major coastal cities, many of which are already inundated by the storm surge extents of hurricane categories 1 through 3. Overall, the leap from category 1 hurricanes to category 4&5 hurricanes nearly doubles (1.96) the at-risk MF population, while incremental changes are much less drastic, especially for hurricanes ranging from categories 4 to 4&5. At local and regional scales more variation in relative-risks by hurricane category could be expected for MF populations due to topography and differences in the geographic distribution and densities of population.  Table 4 is a state-by-state breakdown of Table 2 that compares areally weighted block MF populations with block centroid capture MF populations. As might be expected, there is more variation of values, which can be explained by the smaller numbers of blocks used in the calculations, but also by differences in block densities-a reflection of differences in coastal settlement patterns. In some cases, larger numbers of MF populations garnered by centroid capture are realized. In terms of absolute numbers, the five states that have the most MF population numbers exposed to category 1 hurricanes are New York, Florida, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Massachusetts. For category 2 and higher, Florida and New York trade places. While, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts have high concentrations of MF populations in relatively small areas, states like Florida and Louisiana have a more geographically broad exposure and a greater likelihood of a tropical storm event. Florida's MF population is also proportionally larger due to greater numbers of individuals over the age of 75 years."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The purpose of this research was to provide a conceptually simple method by which one of the most vulnerable populations exposed to storm surge hazards, the medically fragile, can be estimated using existing publicly available data. To that end, a GIS was used to integrate US Census data and a physical model of storm surge data from NOAA to construct risk maps of medically fragile populations. The scope of MF populations along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts underscores the ongoing need for sufficient and sustainable medical infrastructure to preserve life, limb, and property that is fundamental in the design of the approach used here. It provides a global answer to the question of how many of the US general and at-risk MF populations are potentially exposed to tropical storm surges, which is especially poignant in an environment of rising sea levels, and growing coastal populations with increasing exposure to storm activity. While the geographical extent of MF populations by hurricane category regions is useful for visualization, discussion, and planning (see Figure 3), the steps by which they are calculated can yield important information concerning the distribution of at-risk populations for local emergency management planners (see Figure 2). US Census blocks were the observational units of analysis used in the present study, since their small size makes easier the assumption of an internally homogeneous population distribution. The hazard footprint or the spatial extent of a MOM storm surge zone encompasses many more blocks in relation to those that it intersects and should reduce the level of uncertainty in estimating populations when employing the areal weighting technique in spatial interpolation. This method was computationally intensive and involved several designs of ModelBuilder with attendant rounds of verification. With this cost in mind, it was of experimental interest to see how areal weighting might compare to a much less computational intensive method such as centroid capture. The results showed that for the estimated MF populations derived from both methods there was little difference, especially as hurricane categories and block numbers increased. In most cases centroid capture populations were slightly less than those estimated by areal weighting. In the absence of detailed cadastres, estimating MF populations by means of centroid capture would be a simpler and less time consuming option. The advantage of areal weighting over centroid capture is that in addition to MF population estimates, infrastructural resources such as evacuation routes, emergency shelters, and facilities will be included with the target zone layer. A limitation of this study is that the source zone layers, which are built from census blocks, do not contain socio-economic data that could be useful to emergency management planners in evaluating hazard impacts, vulnerabilities, and potential needs of targeted MF populations. This limitation could be overcome by extracting American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year rolling estimates for various household and socioeconomic data from census tracts using dasymetric methodologies. In this case, census blocks could be used as controls for transferring census tract source data layers to storm surge footprint target layers as outlined in Wilson and Mansfield (2010) and Hao et al. (2006). An online data tool, OnTheMap for Emergency Management, developed by the US Census Bureau (US Census n.d.), is another example of how data can be extracted from a variety of sources and integrated into a complementary data format with maps, reports, and charts focusing on the population characteristics of declared and other disaster areas (US Census Bureau 2014b). As with all modeling and estimation methods, there exists a level of uncertainty. This is demonstrated in the differences between the areal weighting and centroid capture methods. There is also inherent variation in the resolution of the hyperbolic grid cells within SLOSH basins. As distance increases from more densely populated areas, the hyperbolic grid cells will become larger with coarser resolution. High resolution and large scale layers based on LIDAR (e.g., FEMA's recent flood insurance rate maps [FIRM]) may be one way to remedy this issue at more local scales (Monmonier 2008). The present study is a foundational work for future and more refined research. Socioeconomic data can be incorporated into the model to add another dimension to MF population characteristics. The present iteration of the model makes the assumption that all MF populations are equal. Incorporating socio-economic into target zone layers would be useful in emergency management planning efforts in evaluating pre-event needs and post-event resiliency. Additionally, more accurate assessments of risk to inundation can be made by the incorporation of high resolution FIRMs locally and comparing the spatial extents of the latter with MOM extents by hurricane category. Combined with local knowledge this approach could yield a detailed picture of the different levels of MF population vulnerability. Finally, by integrating the different sources of data outlined above, local pre-and post-event changes to medically fragile and other vulnerable population distributions along with social and economic impacts can be studied. The results of this study were global in nature, but can be generalizable to local scales of analysis and all types of population vulnerabilities. The approach used was built on high-resolution data from the US Census and modeled hydrologic data. Locally detailed maps, as exemplified in Figure 2, can be produced that are derived from the same data used in calculating the MF populations at risk of inundation. These maps, combined with socio-economic data, FIRMs, and local knowledge can provide the emergency management planners a valuable tool in assessing the needs of local populations before exposure to storm surges."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Today, there is ample warning about potential storm surges that provide enough time for evacuation of ambient and residential populations at-risk of inundation on predetermined routes inland to shelters, hotels, and the residences of nearby family and friends. Many years of experience and public education campaigns have inured coastal populations to the realities of living with tropical storms. However, in spite of this growing knowledge, appropriate attitudes and adaptations, and improved practice in the emergency management cycles, the population response to tropical storm related hazards is by no means uniform or ideal. Certain segments of the population vulnerable to storm surges will present challenges to emergency management planners. Specifically, the medically fragile members of coastal populations are at extreme risk due to their dependency on electrical devices and their shorter care cycles. The study of hazards is exemplified by the focus on human-environment interaction and brings human and physical geography together. Environmental monitoring capacity, surveillance, and modeling have grown with much of the data geo-referenced and publicly available to the geography student and researcher at little or no cost. Another large data source that has grown in accessibility (and inherently geographical) is US Census data at the fine-grained scale of the census block. Together these data provide a great opportunity to study the effects of physical environmental processes on vulnerable population groups using geospatial technologies and geographic/hydrologic modeling. This study was, at the very least, an example of how these types of data combined with current technologies can be used to tell one of many stories about people and their physical environment."}]
