The spatial analysis in the small Texel region or micro-textures is complicated with the existing statistical approaches such as Gauss-Markov random fields, second-order statistics or local linear descriptor transform based on Smith and Chang (1994) . It discards the templates of internal frequency varying regions. The spatial filter banks such as Gabor, S-filter and Gaussian fails to correlate the texture features for evaluating the features by Unser (1995) . The statistical textural features in estimating the spatial relationship of various types of data sets of aerial and satellite image analyzed by Haralick et al. (1973) . The calculation of spectral features of texture image of terrain based on power spectrum to estimate the roughness in the ring and wedge based region yields inaccurate towards different type of data determined by Chen and Young (1982) . Later, the discrete Broadatz textures are characterized to yield optimal transform from the set of histogram obtained through the neighbourhood pixel or cooccurrence based classification that results in overlapping applied by Unser (1986) . By using wavelet transform to extract the multi-component texture method improves orthogonality but highly time consuming for due to multi-scale strategy. The images with different features are marked as indices based on relative similarity based on the research by Monay and Gatica-Perez (2007) . The Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) for object or feature analysis exploit much research developments with application. Among them, the multi-texton histogram integrates with the cooccurrence matrix based on Julesz's textons theory to describe image features by Liu et al. (2011) . Feature extraction method consists of gray level co-occurrence matrix and GMRF features. The classification is done by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). A detailed literature review is presented by Tou et al. (2009) for the classification of texture images based on various feature extraction techniques. In our previous work (Vivek and Audithan, 2014 ) that we integrated the characterization of textures based on Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST) by extracting entropy measure and to classify the given Brodatz database texture image using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier by Fang et al. (2010) . Although such adaptation improves the classification accuracy, it also severely increases the feature space complexity. Similarly, the an exclusive machine learning algorithm with strong supervised LP Boost classifier to train the ADNI database of MR images in a hyper-plane shows improved in classification compared with other methods that developed by Fang et al. (2011) . Similarly, the LP Boost algorithm optimized for weak classifier while ignoring strong classifier through mini-max theory that revokes on the edge constraint shows higher convergence rate and accuracy for real world applications. Later, the same algorithm updated with strong classifier with the limited range that the training set of 5-fold-cross validation shows higher accuracy in the research by Easley et al. (2008) and Liu et al. (2010) . Thus, we propose the combination of multitexton histogram with the Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST) to discriminate the Brodatz album based on feature extraction and then it undergoes classification with the mini-max theory based LPboost classifier the accuracy of this system very well compared to other state of art techniques."}, {"section_title": "TEXTON CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX", "text": "The overall combination of the proposed system diagram is given in Fig. 1 .
