[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Transthyretin (TTR) is a binding protein for the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T 4 ), retinol and \u03b2-amyloid peptide. TTR aids the transfer of T 4 from the blood to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but also prevents T 4 loss from the blood-CSF barrier. It is however, unclear whether TTR affects the clearance of \u03b2-amyloid from the CSF. This study aimed to investigate roles of TTR in \u03b2-amyloid and T 4 efflux from the CSF.\nEight weeks old 129sv male mice were anaesthetized and their lateral ventricles were cannulated. Mice were infused with artificial CSF containing 125 I-T 4 / 3 H-mannitol, or 125 I-A\u03b240 / 3 Hinulin, in present or absent of TTR. Mice were decapitated at 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 minutes after injection.\nThe whole brain was then removed and divided into different regions. The radioactivities in the brain were determined by liquid scintillation counting.\nAt baseline, the net uptake of 125 I-T 4 into the brain was significantly higher than that of 125 I-A\u03b240, and the half time for efflux was shorter ( 125 I-T 4 : 5.16, 3 H-mannitol: 7.44; 125 I-A\u03b240: 8.34, 3 Hinulin: 10.78; mins). The presence of TTR increased the half time for efflux of 125 I-T 4 efflux, and caused a noticeable increase in the uptake of 125 I-T 4 and 125 I-A\u03b240 in the choroid plexus, whilst uptakes of 3 H-mannitol and 3 H-inulin remained similar to control experiments.\nThis study indicates that thyroxine and amyloid peptide effuse from the CSF using different transporters. TTR binds to thyroxine and amyloid peptide to prevent the loss of thyroxine from the brain and redistribute amyloid peptide to the choroid plexus.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The heart was exposed and blood taken using a syringe inserted in the left ventricle.\nThe brain was then washed with cold PBS and was dissected into right and left frontal cortex (FX), choroid plexus (CP), ependymal lining lateral ventricles (EP), hippocampus (HC), cerebellum (CB) and rest of brain (ROB). Samples were weighed on a Cahn microbalance (Thermo, USA), and homogenized with PBS in a glass homogenizer.\nThe TCA precipitation method was used to determine how much 125 I was still attached to A\u03b2 at the end of the experiments [56]. To measure intact 125 I-A\u03b2, one volume of TCA (20%) was added to the sample, and then samples were vortexed, incubated in ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Following centrifugation, radioactivity of precipitated 125 I-A\u03b240 (intact peptide) and TCA supernatant (degraded peptide) were measured on a LKB Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). Solvables (National Diagnostic, UK) was added to each of samples to dissolve organic samples overnight. The radioactivities of the tissues and 100\u03bcl of infused aCSF were determined by liquid scintillation counting (LKB Wallac Rackbeta Spectral 1219 counter) after the addition of 3.0 ml liquid scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, Packard Bioscience, Netherland).\nRegional brain uptake (volume of distribution) was calculated using equation:\nVd (ml.g -1 ) = 100*(Tissue dpm.g -1 ) / (aCSF dpm.ml -1 )\n(1)\nThe half-time for efflux of 125 I-T 4 and 125 I-A\u03b240 from brain was calculated according to Banks et al [57] .

The CP contains 10 times more TTR mRNA in per gram of tissue than liver and secretes TTR at rate 13 times greater than liver [2] .

About 6% of total protein in CSF is TTR (~15 \u03bcg TTR mL -1 of CSF), which binds 80% of T 4 in the CSF [5] .\nThe secretion of TTR by the CP into CSF has been suggested to play a key role in the transfer of T 4 from the blood to the CSF, as a unidirectional secretion of TTR to the CSF may drive thyroxin hormones (TH) across the blood-CSF barrier (BCB) [6] . In humans, TTR transports about 15% of plasma T 4 , and the rest of T 4 are carried with other TH distributing proteins, e.g. thyroxine binding proteins (TBG), albumin [7] . In TTR knockout (KO) mice, TTR absence does not impair TH tissue contents, despite the low circulating levels of total T 4 [8, 9] . These observations are in agreement with the free hormone hypothesis, that the hormone biological activity depends only on its free plasma concentration [10] . In the CSF, TTR is a major T 4 carrier [5] . It was reported that T 4 distribution from the CSF into the brain is TTR-dependent and occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis [11, 12] . The TTR-T 4 interaction poses a preferential relevance in the brain than in the peripheral circulation, given there are two other T 4 transporter proteins besides TTR being present in plasma with TBG having the highest affinity for T 4 , whereas TTR is the major carrier for T 4 in the CSF.\nBesides being the carrier of T 4 and retinol, TTR has been suggested to bind \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) essentially protecting the brain from neurotoxic accumulations called amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [13] [14] [15] [16] . TTR binds to both A\u03b2 monomers and oligomers, but preferentially binds to the latter [17] . TTR suppressed A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro via an interaction between the thyroxine binding pocket of the TTR and A\u03b2 residues 18-21 [14] , and prevents its toxicity [18] . In rat CP epithelial cell culture experiments, TTR was found to sequester A\u03b2 in the CSF and guided A\u03b2 to the CP for enzymatic degradation and removal [19, 20] . TTR is suggested as a protease with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and A\u03b2 as substrates [21] . TTR cleaves A\u03b2 in multiple positions with some of the generated A\u03b2 peptides displaying lower amyloidogenic potential than the full-length counterpart [18] . As TTR was able to degrade aggregated forms of A\u03b2, it may contribute not only to the maintenance of A\u03b2 levels within a normal range, but also to the removal of deposited A\u03b2 in case of imbalance and disease.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. TTR-A\u03b2 interaction seems to have a neuroprotective effect in AD patients. TTR levels in the brains of AD patients are negatively correlated with the abundance of amyloid plaques [22] , and TTR is upregulated in response to elevated A\u03b2 levels in transgenic mice overexpessing mutant amyloid precursor protein [23] . Significant reduction of TTR concentration in CSF of AD patients, compared to normal age controls was found by a number of studies [24] [25] [26] [27] , suggesting the AD patients either having reduced TTR production or depleting TTR with enhanced level of A\u03b2 in the brain. While Schultz et al. [28] did not find significant changes in TTR in CSF between AD patients and normal controls, but found a significant reduction in CSF TTR (14%) in AD patients who were medicated with cholinesterase inhibitors compared to those AD patients who were not.\nThis study was to characterize roles of TTR on \u03b2-amyloid clearance from CSF in comparison to thyroxine (T 4 ) using an in situ mouse brain perfusion technique, and unravel mechanism of both T 4 and A\u03b2 efflux in a physiology model.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The increased accumulation of T 4 in the CP by TTR may be due to reduced basolateral efflux (from choroid epithelial cells to plasma) as well as an augmented uptake of T 4 from CSF. The T 4 efflux from the CSF involves a number of transporters [29] and is saturable in presence of unlabelled T 4 [9, 11, 30] . Despite the important role of TTR in TH homeostasis, mice lacking the TTR gene maintain normal functioning of thyroid glands in the face of significant reduction in total serum T 4 concentration [9] . Using the same model it was found that TTR was not essential for TH to reach the brain [8] . This is not surprise given there are numerous mechanisms for T 4 transport, and a number of thyroxine binding proteins may take over the role of TTR in TTR-null mice. Despite the apparent normal distribution of T 4 in the brain, TTR knock-out mice have behavioural changes, which are associated with an apparent increase of noradrenaline in the limbic forebrain of the mice [31, 32] .\nIt has been suggested that TTR has other important physiological effects. TTR could bind A\u03b2 and prevent amyloid formation, and also inhibit A\u03b2 induced cytotoxicity [13, 14, 18] .\nA\u03b2 deposition in the brain has been linked to the AD pathogenesis. The accumulation of A\u03b2 in the AD brain is suggested to be related to defective A\u03b2 clearance from the brain rather than increased A\u03b2 production [33] . P-gp and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in cerebrovasculature have been reported to play important roles in A\u03b2 clearance from the brain to the blood [34] . A recent study demonstrated that TTR interacted with A\u03b2 directly and stimulated brain-to-blood but not blood-to-brain A\u03b2 permeability in hCMEC/D3, a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line [35] . Together with one of their previous studies [36] , they conclude that TTR acts as an A\u03b2 carrier that transports the peptide to its receptor both at blood brain barriers in the brain and at the liver in the peripheral system [35, 36] . In our study, we intended to use TTR concentrations close to the physiology level in mouse CSF (20-50 \u03bcg/ml) [37] , which are more than that of 125 I -A\u03b240. The TTR dose effect was not seen. Thus, we could use one dose of TTR (i.e.50 \u03bcg/ml) in the study. That will be close to the clinical setting. At physiological condition in human, TTR is abundant (5-20 \u03bcg/ml or 0.1-0.36 \u03bcM) [38] while A\u03b2 concentration in CSF is relatively low (3nM or less) [39, 40] . The effects of TTR on A\u03b2 neurotoxicity have also been demonstrated in in vivo experiments.\nThe silencing the endogenous TTR gene accelerated the appearance of A\u03b2 associated neuropathology, while genetically programmed overexpression of a human TTR transgene suppressed both the neuropathologic and behavioural abnormalities in the APP23 transgenic mouse model [41] . Backcrossing of the TTR null mice with an AD mouse model resulted in an increase in the deposition of A\u03b2 in the brains of mice with the hemizygous deletion of TTR [42] . TTR concentration in the CSF was found to negatively correlate with AD patients [43] , as well as the degree of dementia in patients with AD [44] . However, TTR\nThis article is protected by copyright.

In a triple transgenic mouse model of AD, CP dysfunction was shown linking to increasing A\u03b2 burden resulting in reduced production of CSF and diminished secretion of TTR [46] . In AD patients, CSF turnover / clearance is decreased by 50% [47] . It will decrease A\u03b240 clearance from the brain and increase the contact time for proteins with glucose in the CSF, which promotes the glycosylation of CSF proteins and increased oxidative stress [48] . The CP also contains high levels of A\u03b2 degrading enzymes, such as neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme-1, insulin degrading enzyme [19] , which degrade \u03b2-amyloid peptides. In our study we showed TTR bound to A\u03b240 and distributed A\u03b240 to the CP, as the CP has high affinity to TTR due to presence of TTR receptor [49] . We found significant loss of the integrity of 125 I-A\u03b2 / TTR complex in the brain tissue detected by the TCA precipitation assay. The loss of radioisotope activity in the precipitate could be due to involvement of enzymatic degradation in the CP, blood brain barrier or brain parenchyma. The accumulation / degradation of A\u03b240 in the CP enhance A\u03b240 removal which is known to occur at the CPs via receptor mediated processes [e.g. via the LRP1] that are modulated by chaperone complexes such as ApoE, clusterin, TTR [50] . In the CP, the abundance of LRP-1 increases with age, whereas the abundance of LRP-2 (megalin) is reduced during normal ageing in rodent [51] . Megalin is thought to contribute to the clearance of A\u03b2 through the CP [52] , and patients with AD have reduced levels of megalin at the CP [53] . Since the BBB is not intact with the clearance deficits in the AD patients, the role of A\u03b2 transport and degradation at the CP becomes increasingly more prominent and needs further investigating.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that TTR acts differentially on T 4 and A\u03b240 efflux from the CSF. TTR prevents the loss of thyroxine from the CSF, a positive adaptation since T 4 is a substrate for multiple efflux transporters from the CSF, but is a necessary requirement for normal brain function. TTR does not significantly affect the retention of A\u03b240 in the brain parenchyma, but redistributes A\u03b240 to the CP for degradation and clearance. As a major site of TTR synthesis in the brain, the CP is an important site for homeostasis of TTR binding hormone and peptides.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The ependymal ventricular lining (EP) also showed some uptake of 125 I-T 4, however, the rest of brain did not show much uptake. The addition of TTR to the lateral ventricles resulted in increased retention of 125 I-T 4 in the CP, and the increase reached significance with TTR 200 \u03bcg.ml -1 .\nThe addition of TTR did not change retention of 125 3 Hinulin in whole mouse brain in absence and presence of TTR"}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Baseline distribution of 125 I-T 4 / 125 I-A\u03b240 in the brain", "text": "At baseline, levels of both 125 I-T 4 and 125 I-A\u03b240 in the brain were significantly higher than their size matched extracellular markers (mannitol and inulin), suggesting active uptakes of T 4 and A\u03b240 ( Fig 1A, Fig 2A) .\nRegionally, net levels of 125 I-T 4 and 125 I-A\u03b240 in the CP, EP, were higher than those in FX and CB, presumably the latter tissues were further away from the injection site -the lateral ventricles (Fig 3,4 )."}, {"section_title": "Efflux half time of 125 I-T 4 / 125 I-A\u03b240", "text": "Levels of 125 I-T 4 , 125 I-A\u03b240 as well as the extracellular makers fell over time in whole brain and in the CSF secreting CP (Fig 1,2) .

At baseline (without TTR), both 125 I-T 4 (775 Da) and 125 I-A\u03b240 (4455 Da) were cleared from brain faster than their corresponding extracellular markers, 3 H-mannitol (182 Da) and 3 H-inulin (5000 Da), consistent with the concept of specific transporters for 125 I-T 4 and 125 I-A\u03b240, in addition to the diffusion and fluid drainage pathways accessible by mannitol and inulin. With TTR in aCSF, the loss of thyroxin from the brain was significantly reduced (i.e. efflux half time was prolonged), while the retention of A\u03b240 in the brain was not significantly affected (i.e. efflux half time was not changed). In presence of TTR, the accumulation of both 125 I-T 4 and 125 I-A\u03b240 in the CP were significantly increased. Since the nascent CSF is washed out from the ventricular system during perfusion with artificial CSF in the experiments, the CSF endogenous TTR approaches zero in these mice during the perfusion.\nTTR is a protein that binds and distributes the TH in the body. In the blood, >99% of TH is bound to specific plasma proteins known as TH distributor proteins, such as TBG, TTR, albumin and ApoB100 [7] . These TH binding proteins maintain the large extrathyroidal pool of TH which can be liberated with great rapidity for entry into cells, ensure a constant supply of TH to the cells and tissues [1, 7] . In the CSF, TTR assumes the main role in terms of TH homeostasis, as TTR has higher affinity to T 4 than the albumin (ca 5-9 x 10 -8 M vs ca 7 x 10 -5 M) [1] .
