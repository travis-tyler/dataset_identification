In economic terms, it has been estimated that the net present value of future earnings for a student having access to a teacher one standard deviation above average effectiveness approaches half a million dollars (Hanushek 2011 ).\nHowever, it is equally well documented that minority and low-income students, and particularly those in schools with high concentrations of poverty or racial minorities, are considerably less likely to be taught by teachers with strong credentials or high estimated effectiveness (e.g., Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2011) . Compounding the initial maldistribution, highly effective teachers leave disadvantaged students and schools at higher rates than their less effective counterparts (who also turnover rapidly). It is, therefore, not surprising that policymakers, researchers, and practitioners interested in promoting learning, economic growth, and the closing of achievement and opportunity gaps would explore policies designed to promote the retention of effective teachers in traditionally disadvantaged schools.\nAs with any labor market, teachers make decisions about where to work or stop working based on some combination of salary differentials and non-pecuniary benefits (i.e. the satisfaction of working with a particular group of students and colleagues) or costs (i.e. the challenges of working in a high stakes, high needs, environment with limited parental support). However, teacher labor markets are distinct in at least two important ways that might fuel inequitable distributions of effective teachers. Salaries are increasingly low relative to what candidates might earn in other sectors of the economy (Hanushek and Rivkin 2006) , and perhaps more importantly salaries, at least within districts, are flat (Podgursky and Springer 2011) . The combination of these two factors magnifies the role of perceived working conditions as a driver of teacher mobility decisions, especially for effective teachers who may have more options available.\n1 Some teachers are consistently better at raising the achievement of their students than others.\nValue-added studies of teacher effectiveness consistently find large variation in teacher classroom performance (e.g., Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander, 2007; Hanushek et al., 2005; Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger, 2008; Sanders and Rivers, 1996; Rockoff, 2004) . Top-performing teachers, as defined by those teachers at the 95 th percentile, produce three times the achievement growth in students when compared to low-performing teachers (Hanushek, 2003) . Hanushek and Rivkin (2004) reported that the achievement gap among high-and low-socioeconomic status students could be overcome if an economically disadvantaged student encountered an above average teacher for five consecutive years.\nPublic schools differ dramatically with respect to perceived working conditions, or attractiveness as places to teach, with schools that have higher concentrations of low-income, nonwhite, and low-performing students generally perceived as less desirable places to work (Murnane et al., 1991; Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 1999; Loeb and Page, 2000; Boyd et al, 2005; Scafidi et al, 2007; Kukla-Acevedo, 2009; Loeb, Darling-Hammond, & Luczak, 2005) . More experienced teachers can typically use seniority-based transfer provisions in collective bargaining agreements to choose where to teach, and they can be expected to use it to exit these less desirable placements.\n2 Similarly teachers with stronger credentials are more likely to have quality employment opportunities outside of teaching, and teachers with track records of effectiveness are likely to attract job offers from schools in other districts."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "For the reasons outlined above, sorting of teachers across schools exacerbates racial and poverty-related achievement gaps. Schools enrolling children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be staffed by teachers graduating from less competitive colleges, teachers instructing out-of-field, and novice teachers (Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2002; Iaterola and Steifel, 2003; Roza et al., 2007 Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2011; Peske and Haycock, 2006) .\nTeacher effect research consistently finds that novice teachers (e.g., first or second year teachers) produce smaller achievement gains for their students than more experienced teachers (Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander, 2007; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kane, 2005; Henry et al. 2011) . The net result is that children enrolled in schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged students have greater exposure to less qualified instructors.\nThe inequitable distribution of highly-effective teachers across schools within districts is arguably a consequence of uniform teacher salary schedules in conjunction with differences in nonpecuniary characteristics of schools (e.g., condition of school building, principal leadership, safety, distance from home, and perhaps most importantly the makeup of the student body). When pay is equalized, but students and resources are segregated by ability, income, and race, teacher quality is disequalized across schools within a school district. In order to equalize teacher quality, federal and state policymakers have demonstrated a heightened interest in designing practical 2 In a case study of five large, urban school systems, Levin, Mulhern, and Schunck (2005) reported that 40 percent of teaching vacancies were filled by incumbent teachers and that school administrators had very little or no voice in the hiring decision. 3 A number of studies have found a negative relationship between academic ability and the likelihood of entering teaching (Manski 1985; Hanushek and Pace 1995; Vegas, Murnane, and Willett 2001; Podgursky, Monroe, and Watson, 2010) . Murnane et al (1991) and Bacolod (2003) suggest a decline in the quality of teacher labor supply over time. Corcoran, Evans, and Schwab (2010) attribute the decline in teacher quality to labor market opportunities for women outside of the education sector, which Hoxby and Leigh (2003) attribute largely to compression of teaching wages.\nincentives to help offset differences in non-wage job characteristics (Prince, 2002; Prince, 2003; Johnson, 2005; Kirshtein, Berger, Benatar, and Rhodes, 2004) , including signing bonuses, certification stipends, tuition reimbursement, loan forgiveness, tax credits, and housing subsidies."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "The theory behind retention incentives assumes that offering financial incentives will help retain more teachers in the upper tail of the ability distribution in hard-to-staff or chronically lowperforming schools. A common argument of proponents of financial incentives is that schools need to be able to respond to labor market conditions by offering additional incentives when trying to retain teachers at less competitive campuses, typically located in rural or densely urban areas.\nUnfortunately, there is little research on the compensating differential needed to offset differences in nonpecuniary workplace characteristics. As such, retention bonuses in practice have ranged from $250 to more than $20,000."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "In this paper, we report findings from a quasi-experimental evaluation of the recently implemented retention bonus program for teachers in Tennessee's priority schools.

During the 2011-12 school year, approximately 17 percent of teachers leave their schools every year in Tennessee and the attrition rate for the state's mosteffective teachers is around 7 percent. The attrition rate for highly effective educators increases to 10 percent when focused on urban districts in the state and 23 percent when focused on the bottom 5 percent of schools in the state (more than 3 times greater than the statewide attrition rate of highlyeffective teachers), who are the focus of this study.\nIn the spring of 2013, in an effort to combat these high rates of teacher turnover among highly-effective teachers in chronically low-performing schools, the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE) and the Tennessee Governor's Office announced a teacher retention bonus program for priority schools. Under the program, all priority schools were eligible to participate by applying to offer $5,000 retention bonuses to any level 5 teacher who was teaching in a priority school. 6 For many of the teachers in TN priority schools, a $5000 bonus constitutes approximately a 10 percent salary increase, or the equivalent of teacher with a master degree moving from 10 to 15 years of experience on a district salary schedule.\nLevel 5 teachers at priority schools who accepted retention bonuses were required to complete the 2013-14 school year at a priority school in order to keep the bonus. For the purposes of this program, a teacher is defined as a classroom teacher with assigned students and associated evaluation scores. It excludes principals, school counselors, and school services personnel. Itinerant teachers can receive a pro-rated amount of the retention bonus based on the number of days per week that he or she is actually working in a priority schools.\nBoth the priority school designation and the systems of teacher evaluation are major components of the retention bonus program. Below we describe the priority school designation as defined by Tennessee's school accountability program. We then discuss the new teacher evaluation 6 TDOE and the Governor's office also implemented a teacher signing bonus program. To help attract the most effective teachers to priority schools, a signing bonus of $7,000 was offered to every new level 5 teacher that transferred from a non-priority school into a priority school during the 2013-14 school year. Only 59 teachers received the signing bonus, therefore, this aspect of the program is not considered in this evaluation due to small sample size.\nsystems that were implemented as part of Tennessee's federally-funded Race to the Top grant program."}, {"section_title": "Priority school status", "text": "In 2012, the TDOE secured waivers from certain portions of the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law. The waiver allowed Tennessee to replace NCLB's Adequate Yearly Progress proficiency targets with a system that focuses on \"ensuring growth for all students every year and closing achievement gaps by ensuring faster growth for those students who are furthest behind\" (TDOE, 2012) . Additionally, the state identifies individual schools based on these relative performance measures, ranging from high-performing \"reward\" schools to low-performing \"priority\" schools.\nTennessee identified 83 priority schools based on a composite proficiency rate (success rate)\nfor all students in a school. The bottom five (5) percent of schools in the state are assigned priority status. The composite proficiency rate used to determine a schools eligibility for priority status is based on the following formula, where math, reading/language arts and science are for grades 3 through 8 and Algebra I, English I and II, Biology I, and graduation rate are for high schools:\nThe success rates used for determining priority schools include up to three years of data. Success rates are calculated for schools with at least 2011-12 school year data. Only schools that are active in the 2011-12 school year, with at least 2010-12 and 2011-12 data, were identified as priority schools."}, {"section_title": "Teacher evaluation", "text": "In January 2010, the Tennessee Generally Assembly passed Senate Bill 5, also known as the Tested subject area teachers are designated as a level 5 educator if their three year composite TVAAS score and their overall teacher observation rating place them in the highest performance category.

For that reason, a strong body of research has sought\nto better understand what makes highly qualified or effective teachers decide to stay or leave a school, or exit the profession altogether (i.e. Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2011; Scafidi, Sjoquist, & Stinebrickner, 2007; Feng 2010; Feng, Figlio, & Sass, 2010) . We briefly discuss findings from recent teacher retention bonus research."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Retention Bonuses", "text": "A number of studies have directly examined the influence of cash bonuses on retention and attrition rates of teachers at high need schools with mixed results. 8 The nature, 9 size, and context of 8 Our review of the literature is focused on studies that investigate the effect of incentives on teacher retention. A number of studies have investigated the effect of signing bonuses on teacher recruitment, including Glazerman et al (2013) , Liu, Johnson, Peske (2004), and Fowler (2003) . 9 Another common form of recruitment or retention financial incentive is the use of scholarship programs for teachers that condition receipt of payment on teachers serving in disadvantaged schools for a specified period of time (Johnson 2005 based on placement on the salary schedule, a $2,000 bonus for teaching in a hard-to-staff school, and a $2,500 retention bonus after the 4 th year of the program and $3,000 after the 8 th year. Hough finds that the QTEA salary increase did not affect retention of targeted teachers, though overall teacher retention rates increased following the implementation of the program, to which the author attributes the null finding.\nSimilarly, in their evaluation of a pilot supplemental funding program to a group of educationally disadvantaged schools in North Carolina, Henry and colleagues (2010) found that approximately half of the money went towards salary bonuses that gave the schools a comparative advantage in hiring and retaining teachers. The authors note that in years of the pilot funding teacher turnover decreased significantly at the schools with the supplement, in spite of having the most disadvantaged students in the state, while turnover rates increased at non-supplement schools.\nHowever, while the RD design of the study allowed the authors to attribute the increased retention to the supplemental funding, they were unable to distinguish the effects of salary bonuses from other expenditures that might have made teachers more likely to stay.\nConversely, Clotfelter and colleagues' (2008) were able to directly examine a $1,800 annual teacher retention bonus offered in North Carolina between 2001 and 2004 to certified math, science, and special education teachers in a set of low-performing and/or high-poverty secondary schools.\nThe authors found modest, but significant effects on teacher turnover. The difference-in-differencein-difference analytical strategy indicated that the bonuses reduced turnover rates of eligible teachers in eligible schools by 17 percent, or 5 percentage points. Survey results also indicated widespread misunderstandings about the nature of the retention incentive offered, and skepticism among teachers and administrators that the size of the bonus would be sufficient. The NC bonus program differed from the TN retention bonuses both in its smaller magnitude ($1,800 vs. $5,000) and the fact that it was not tied to any measure of teacher quality, but rather specified credentials (math, science, and special education teachers).\nteachers to low-performing schools. The program had significant effect on teacher recruitment but did not differentially affect teacher retention among GTF recipients and non-recipients.\nTwo recent studies have sought to estimate effects of retention bonuses offered based on measures of teacher effectiveness. First, Glazerman and colleagues (2013) evaluated a substantial monetary incentive offered through the Talent Transfer Initiative (TTI) across 10 school districts in seven states that was designed to recruit and retain high performing teachers in low performing schools. Using a random assignment scheme, teachers who demonstrated a sufficient level of value added effectiveness (roughly the top 20 percent for their subject and grade) were eligible for a $20,000 bonus -paid in installments over a two-year period -if they transferred into and remained in schools that had low average test scores. Results showed that the transfer incentive had substantial positive impact on teacher-retention rates during the payout period; retention rates were significantly higher for high performing teachers compared to their counterparts -93 versus 70 percent. However, not surprisingly, the difference was no longer statistically significant after the payments stopped.\nFinally, while their analysis of salary bonuses in IMPACT, a high-stakes teacher evaluation system implemented in DC that was designed to improve teacher quality and student achievement, faces similar challenges to other studies of bonuses administered as part of broader reforms, Dee and Wyckoff (2013) implement a rigorous set of analyses similar to those described in this paper to offer important evidence with respect to the impact of bonuses. Using a regression-discontinuity design, the authors compared teachers near the IMPACT score threshold that separated \"Effective\"\nfrom \"Highly Effective\" teachers. Like the evaluation program in TN, the DC system utilized a mix of observation and value-added metrics to generate a continuous composite score with sharp cut points to group teachers into consequential categories of effectiveness. Teachers qualified for a large one-time bonus (up to $25,000) after being rated \"Highly Effective\" for one year and a sizable and permanent base salary increase (as large as $27,000 per year) upon achieving \"Highly Effective\" status in a second consecutive year. The authors utilize the sharp discontinuity between teachers eligible for the base pay increase and those who are not to estimate the local average treatment effect of a significant long-term salary increase on performance and retention of high performing teachers.\nWhile the incentive had positive effects on teacher performance, impacts on retention of effective teachers were not statistically significant. At first glance, this null finding seems contradictory to the general trend toward larger effects for larger incentives, but there are important contextual issues that likely contributed to the inability to detect an effect. First, the comparison group (teachers who had barely missed the cutoff for \"Highly Effective\" designation in the prior year) was also subject to a substantial financial incentive, as they were eligible for the one-time bonus in the study year and the prospect of base pay increases in the coming years. Second, perhaps as a consequence of the new IMPACT policies, the retention rate for effective teachers above and around the cutoff was particularly high in the year studied (roughly 90 percent).\nIn sum, there is substantial evidence that difficulties with retaining effective teachers at lowperforming schools and schools with high concentrations of low-income and minority students contribute to an inequitable distribution of teacher quality. Descriptive analyses of reasons for teachers exit indicate that, while non-pecuniary factors play a large roll in effective teachers' decision to exit, salary is also a factor. However, though generally positive, evaluations of monetary interventions designed to increase retention have failed to reach consensus as to the appropriate size and scope of a bonus program to that will encourage effective teachers to stay."}, {"section_title": "Data and Sample", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "This study utilizes administrative data obtained from the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE) and maintained by the Tennessee Consortium on Research, Evaluation, and Development (the Consortium) at Peabody College's Vanderbilt University.

After exhaustive attempts to reconcile the five anomalous cases, we decided to drop these cases from the analysis file as we could not locate information on these cases. participation in the retention bonus program, we estimate a series of probit models. The probit analysis estimates the probability that a school participates in the retention bonus program.\nSpecifically, these models take the following form:\nwhere the dependent variable is P, a binary variable indicating whether a school elected to participate in the retention bonus program; is a vector explanatory variables and is the error term. The regression sample is made up of the 82 priority schools, 56 of which agreed to participate in the retention bonus program.\nWe incorporate several school and teacher characteristics into our analysis of the determinants of a school's decision to participate in the retention bonus program. The school determinants are the share of economically disadvantaged students, school type (elementary, middle, and secondary), and school size. The teacher determinants are the average years of teacher experience and the share of teachers who are male.\nWe control for the share of economically disadvantaged students because within-school variations in student characteristics can make it more difficult to measure the effectiveness of individual teachers, so schools in which the student body is more diverse may be less likely to participate in the program. Although all schools are priority schools, the share of economically disadvantaged students ranges from 74.8 to 100 percent, and it is important to note that lower percentage of economically disadvantaged students indicates greater diversity. We also control for school type given recent surveys suggest that elementary school teachers are less supportive of teacher incentive programs than are secondary school teachers (Jacob and Springer, 2008) .\nWe control for school size because studies suggest that small groups are more likely than large groups to adopt egalitarian incentive structures (Encinsoa, Gaynor, and Rebitzer, 2007) . If this is the case, the median teacher might not want their school to participate in the program if he or she had full information about the abilities of other teachers (as would be likely in a small school) and if there were significant variation in those abilities (Freeman and Gelber, 2010) .\nWe include both the share of teachers who are male and the average years of teaching experience because the literature suggests that perspectives on incentive pay programs vary by gender and experience (Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007; Ballou and Podgursky, 1993; Goldhaber, DeArmond, and DeBurgomaster, 2010; Ekel and Grossman, 2002) . Additionally, several studies on teacher attitudes toward incentive pay policies conclude that beginning teachers are more accepting of performance pay than are more experienced, veteran teachers (Ballou and Podgursky, 1993;  Goldhaber, DeArmond, and DeBurgomaster, 2010; Jacob and Springer, 2007). Finally, we include the share of level 5 teachers in a school at time t-1. One might assume that a greater share of level 5 teachers would make a campus more likely to participate as high-performing teachers are most likely to benefit from the program.\n[Insert Table 4 Here] Table 5 reports estimates of the impact of the bonus program on teacher retention. While we report estimates using a large number of different bandwidth selections, our discussion will focus on estimates from models where the sample is defined by the optimal bandwidth specification defined by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2009) . We do not find a statistically significant program effect on teacher retention when using a linear form, though the point estimates are in the hypothesized direction. When modeling a cubic form of the local polynomial regression, which is the empirically preferred form, the estimate is statistically significant and positive. Level 5 teachers that receive a retention bonus are 23 percent more likely to remain teaching in a priority school when compared to teachers just below the level 5 cutoff (see Figure 6) . 17 This estimate is robust to a variety of bandwidth selections."}, {"section_title": "Impact of the retention bonus program", "text": "The theory behind retention incentives implies that the opportunity to earn an additional $5,000 in income for working in a priority school for an additional year will cause retention bonus eligible teachers to be more likely to remain in a priority school the following year, as the economic benefit is greater given standardized remuneration practices in the public education sector. We refer to the outcome of retention from the 2012-13 to 2013-14 school years as Y. Our treatment variable, whether a teacher received an overall teacher evaluation of 425 or greater, which designates them as a level 5 teacher, will be denoted as T. We are interested in the impact of being eligible for a retention bonus, X \u2265 425, on retention from the 2012-13 to 2013-14 school years.\nFollowing the Neyman-Rubin causal model, there are two possible outcomes for each individual teacher i at the conclusion of the school year. The first, denoted by Y i (1), is the potential outcome for teacher i when he or she is eligible for a retention bonus. The other, denoted by Y i (0), is the potential outcome when the teacher is not eligible for a retention bonus. Thus, the treatment effect for observation i is defined by:\nHowever, a fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can never observe Y i (1) and Y i (0) at the same time for a single teacher. This remains true regardless of the methodology used to make an inference. Instead, we can only observe the outcome of interest after a teacher receives their overall performance score and they make a decision on whether to return to a priority school the following year. Thus, we are interested in estimating the average treatment effect of being eligible for a $5,000 bonus on retention, as defined by:\nIn a sharp regression discontinuity design framework, we would construct a comparison group for high-performing teachers (level 5) in priority schools participating in the retention bonus program consisting of similar teachers that are not able to receive a bonus because they scored just below the level 5 teacher performance threshold. Because a teacher's eligibility for the bonus program is determined by a score on a quantitative, continuous variable with a strict cutoff (a level 5 teacher rating, which equates to a 425 or higher on the overall teacher evaluation rating variable), teachers slightly below the 425 cutoff that work in priority schools participating in the bonus program can serve as a control to estimate unbiased average treatment effects of the bonus program within specified bandwidths. 14 The number of points a teacher is above or below a level 5 rating (highly effective), which equates to their overall performance score minus 425 points, becomes the running or forcing variable. When this number is equal to or greater than 0, the teacher is considered a highly effective instructor (a level 5 teacher) and eligible for a $5,000 retention bonus if they teach in a priority school the following year. When the value on the forcing variable is less than 0, a teacher's overall performance score is below 425 and they are not eligible for a retention bonus irrespective of their decision to work in a priority school the following school year. Of course, this identification strategy may understate the true treatment effect if teachers that just missed being a level 5 teacher return to a priority school the following year in hopes that the program will be around for another year and that they earn a level 5 teacher rating.\nHowever, as displayed in Figures 1 and 2 , noncompliance is present, which makes a sharp regression discontinuity identification strategy invalid. Forty-four level 5 teachers, or approximately 11 percent of our level 5 teacher sample, did not receive a retention bonus even though they returned to a priority school during the 2013-14 school year (no-shows). Seven level 4 teachers received a retention bonus even though they were not eligible under program guidelines (crossovers). To deal with endogeneity problems arising from partial compliance, we implement an instrumental variables estimation strategy using the exogenous assignment to the treatment (score on running variable) as an instrument for the effective participation in the retention bonus program. In this sense, treatment is no longer deterministically related to crossing a threshold but there is a jump in the probability of treatment at 425.\n[Insert Figure 2 Here] Thus, to estimate the impact of the bonus program on retention, we adopt a fuzzy regression discontinuity design in which the treatment status is probabilistically determined as a discontinuous function of our running variable following procedures recommended in Lee and Lemieux (2009) .\nThe relationship between the probability of treatment and the performance score threshold can be written as: where is an error term independent of X, the fuzzy RD design can be described as:\nWe can substitute the treatment determining equation, which is estimated as a linear probability model, into the outcome equation to get the reduced form equation, which can be expressed as:\nwhere = * . An obvious advantage of the reduced form approach is that it provides an estimate of the treatment effect and accompanying standard errors. As described in Imbens and Lemieux (2008) , these estimates are identical to the ratio of the reduced form coefficients / , provided that the bandwidths used in the first and second stages are consistent (and that the same order polynomial is used for g ( . ) and f(.)).\nIf there is an underlying relationship between X and staying in a priority school, Y, this comparison will suffer from bias as long as our treatment group contains observations with X strictly above our cutoff value and the control group contains observations with X strictly below our cutoff value. By requiring that observations be closer to the cutoff value we can limit the amount of bias, but then the sample becomes smaller and we suffer a loss of precision, which is a palpable concern in the present context. Thus, we also estimate a local polynomial regression model where the functional form is cubic in the running variable.\nWe address the bandwidth selection problem using Imbens and Kalyanaraman's (2012) optimal bandwidth calculation; that is, how close should an observation be to c in order to be part of the analysis sample without sacrificing precision due to small sample size. We also estimate models using kernel-weighted local polynomial smoothing with triangular case weights. Triangular case weights are applied such that the impact on the estimate of cases farther from the cutoff declines at a linear rate.\nWe also estimate select specifications of our models with controls. It should not matter much whether controls are included, given our assumption that the relationship of Y to X is continuous and the supporting evidence that our treatment and control conditions are equivalent on observables. However, to the extent that the underlying relationship of Y to X is not linear, there may still be some bias remaining (our controls partly captures the effect of treatment and partly differences between the treatment and control groups that would have occurred anyway, for which we have imperfectly controlled). In this case, including covariates can reduce that bias and, in the usual way, their inclusion may improve precision.\n"}, {"section_title": "Testing the validity of the RD identification strategy", "text": "There are three fundamental assumptions required by the RD identification strategy. First, unobserved characteristics vary continuously around the teacher effectiveness cutoff with observable characteristics used to determine bonus eligibility.

As displayed in Table 3 , we find a number of statistically significant differences when comparing the full sample of teachers (column 1) to teachers at and just to the right of c (column 4). 16 For example, a greater percentage of female and black teachers are rated level 5, while fewer white teachers and teachers with a bachelor's degree attain level 5 status. Imbalances are not unexpected given that our sample includes all priority school teachers.\n[Insert Table 3 Here] However, we are most interested in whether the observed baseline covariates are \"locally\" balanced on either side of the cutoff, which should be the case if the treatment indicator is locally randomized. As displayed in Table 3 , across all comparisons and statistical tests, we reject the hypothesis that the means of the treatment and the control condition teachers are statistically different as indicated by the means reported in columns (3) and (4) and mean differences reported in column (7).

The concern is that self-interested individuals may try to influence their overall performance score rating in order to increase the likelihood of being As noted earlier the timing of program implementation further attests to this fact -the program was implemented relatively late in the school year and teachers did not necessarily have an opportunity to artificially inflate performance scores (particularly teacher observation ratings) in an effort to become eligible for a retention bonus."}, {"section_title": "Other programs or services", "text": "A final assumption of the RD identification strategy is that there are no other programs or services with same eligibility rules.

Table 4 displays estimates of the relationship between school characteristics and program participation. We find that the share of economically disadvantaged students in the school is a strong predictor of participation, though the estimate is not in the expected direction. Schools with a greater share of economically disadvantaged students, i.e., less within-school variation in student characteristics, were more likely to participate in the program. We also find evidence that middle schools were modestly less likely to participate in the retention bonus program when compared to high schools. Finally, it is clear that the share of level 5 teachers is a strong predictor of program participation. This is expected given that level 5 teachers are most likely to benefit from the program."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneous treatment effects", "text": "We explore the impact of the bonus program on teacher retention separately for tested and non-tested subject teachers. A teacher is considered a tested subject teacher if they have valid data for the individual TVAAS component of the teacher evaluation system. A teacher is considered a non-tested subject teacher if a teacher is only rated on school value-added and classroom observations. Table 6 displays estimates of the impact of the bonus program on tested subject teacher retention. Once again, our discussion focuses on the estimates when the analysis sample is defined by the optimal bandwidth specification. Estimates from the local linear regression are statistically significant, suggesting that a level 5 tested subject teacher is 24.3 percent more likely to remain teaching in a priority school when compared to tested subject teacher just below the level 5 cutoff.\nWhile the magnitude of the value on the treatment effect remains relatively similar when modeling a cubic form of the local polynomial regression, the lack of precision yields insignificant results.\nAdditionally, when the full sample is included, the estimate is statistically significant and large, suggesting a very meaningful impact of the bonus on retention of highly-effective teachers. Table 7 reports estimates of the impact of the bonus program on non-tested subject teachers. We find that the estimates are not statistically different from zero at conventional levels across all functional forms. Additionally, the magnitudes of the point estimates are quite small when compared to those reported for tested subject teachers or the sample as a whole. It appears tested subject teachers are driving the effect, which isn't unexpected given the amount of weight\nTennessee's teacher evaluation system attributes to school level performance for untested subject teachers.\n17 Appendix A shows similar results when estimates are produced using kernel weights."}, {"section_title": "Cost benefit analysis", "text": "While the estimated effects of the retention bonus on teacher retention are modest in magnitude and sensitive to model specification, estimates of net program costs that account for benefits to students in the form of future earnings projections indicate the intervention would provide a net benefit even if its effects on retention were substantially overestimated. The robustness of the cost effectiveness of the policy is primarily a function of the strength of the intervention that retention of a Level-5 teacher in a Priority School represents. Teachers who accepted bonuses had overall teacher effectiveness ratings more than a full standard deviation above the state average, and the average teacher hired by Priority Schools was rated roughly two thirds of a standard deviation below the state average.\nThus, for every teacher that is retained as a result of the bonus, students taught by that teacher rather than the likely replacement experience an increase in teacher effectiveness of 1.7 standard deviations. To put this in perspective, Hanushek (2011) estimates the net present value of the increased earnings resulting from a teacher 1 standard deviation above the mean teaching 25 students for 1 year to be greater than $500,000. If we focus on marginal economic returns to students in discounted lifetime earnings (column 2 of Table 1 ), the program would only need to have influenced 5 Level-5 teachers to stay and teach another year to justify its total cost (roughly 2.1 million for 361 bonuses). Using Hanushek's most conservative estimate of the annual marginal earnings effects of a teacher quality increase (roughly $12,000 discounted lifetime earnings per student for a 1 standard deviation improvement), we find that the bonus program would pay for itself in long run tax revenue if only 10% of bonus recipients stayed because of the bonus and taught an average of 30 students for 1 year."}, {"section_title": "Program Costs", "text": "In total, the state distributed slightly over $2.1 million in $5,000 retention bonuses to 361 highly effective teachers, who agreed to stay at a priority school during the 2013-14 school year.\nAfter employer shares of taxes and administrative costs, the total cost to the state associated with each bonus paid was roughly $6000. However, if the goal of the investment was to retain highly effective teachers, it is informative to calculate the costs per teacher who would have otherwise left the priority school.\nWhile our fuzzy regression discontinuity design estimated treatment effects local to the cutoff score and not generalizable to Level-5 teachers who had particularly high scores, we attempt to account for uncertainty in the effect estimates by presenting estimates for a range of plausible program impacts. If 20 percent of teachers who received bonuses stayed at a Priority School as a result of the program, the cost per teacher retained would be roughly $30,000. If the teachers who were retained as a result of the bonus taught an average of 25 students the cost per effected student would be roughly $1,200. If 90 percent of the teachers who received bonuses would have stayed in the absence of the bonus, the cost per effected pupil would be $2,400 per effected student.\nCompared with interventions, like NCLB's supplemental education services (Springer et al, 2014; Heinrich et al, 2013) , summer school (Jacob and Lefgren 2004) or reduced class size (Krueger 1999), the costs per effected pupil associated with the bonuses are modest, particularly given the relative effects on student achievement predicted for radical shifts in teacher effectiveness associated with the retention of highly effective teachers (i.e., rated Level-5)."}, {"section_title": "Program Benefits", "text": "The second broad component of the cost-benefit analysis accounts for potential benefits to students from Level-5 teacher retention. The effects of teacher retention on student achievement rely primarily on the value added of the retained Level-5 teachers relative to a range of potential replacement teachers (Table 8) . These benefits are estimated in dollar terms using recent figures on the net present value of increased lifetime earnings associated with improved student achievement.\nHere we follow Hanushek's (2011) use of Chetty and colleagues' (2013) 18 estimates of long-term benefits of effective teachers, noting that our estimation of a teacher's relative effectiveness compared to the distribution of teachers in the state is based on a composite evaluation score rather than a single value-added measure.\nThe second column of Table 8 displays the present value of predicted increase in lifetime earnings for a class of 25 students taught by a retained teacher, relative to their predicted earnings if they were taught by likely replacements (average teacher in the state, average teacher in a priority school, or average new hire at a priority school). These student benefit estimates are derived from Hanushek's (2011) predicted annual marginal returns to a 1 standard deviation improvement in teacher effectiveness. The student income effects range from just roughly $550,000 to $900,000 per retained teacher, depending on the relative effectiveness of the teacher who would have replaced them had they left.

Others highlighted the difficulty, which the authors note, of generalizing from data on teacher value-added measures that predated the introduction of highstakes accountability systems (Winerup, 2012) . However, to date, it remains the most methodologically rigorous attempt to quantify the monetary benefits of teacher quality.\nteacher retained, using the current average sales tax rate in Tennessee of 9.45 percent. Estimated long-run revenue effects range from approximately $52,000 to $85,000 per teacher retained. The fifth column presents net benefit to the state budget per teacher retained less the net cost per teacher retained, which ranges from $26 to $60 if roughly 23 percent of bonus recipients would have otherwise left. Table 9 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "19 While the calculated benefits rely heavily on long-term effects on student earnings, an alternative estimation strategy that disregards any student effects, focusing instead on reduced administrative costs associated with turnover also results in the bonuses representing a low cost intervention. Synar and Maiden (2012) estimate the costs associated with a teacher leaving (separation, hiring, and training) range from roughly $10-18 thousand dollars per teacher.\nWe report findings from a quasi-experimental evaluation of the recently implemented retention bonus program for teachers in Tennessee's priority schools. We estimate the impact of the program on teacher retention using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. We exploit a discontinuity in the probability of treatment conditional on the composite teacher effectiveness rating that assigns bonus eligibility. Point estimates for the main effect of the bonuses are consistently positive across all specifications, and for teachers of tested subjects the program appears to have an effect that is generally both statistically and substantively significant.\nRetention bonuses tied to estimates of teacher effectiveness could serve as a tool for policymakers to improve the quality of the teachers instructing disadvantaged students without implementing layoffs or other punitive measures. Because teachers across the effectiveness spectrum leave high poverty, high minority schools regularly on their own volition, and are generally replaced by less experienced, less effective teachers, bonuses that retain the teachers at the higher end of the effectiveness distribution can have substantial impacts on the quality of a schools faculty. In contrast to policies that would target teachers with poor evaluations or low value-added estimates for dismissal, introducing churn and instability, the retention bonuses mitigate unwanted turnover and have the potential to strengthen leadership and institutional knowledge among the schools' faculty.\nAs is true for any policy that relies on observations and test-score-based value-added estimates to differentiate teachers, the benefits of retention bonus are only as strong as the measures of effectiveness are accurate. If, for example the designation of \"highly effective,\" based on the composite evaluation, is functionally random or even falls more frequently on less desirable teachers, then the policy would not have the desired effects on the teaching pool and could have discouraging effects on effective teachers who failed to receive the designation and monetary reward. However, the negative consequences of such miscategorizations in the context of retention bonuses are seemingly less severe than in the case of teacher quality policies that rely on terminations.\nWhile this study offers an important contribution to a relatively slender body of research using rigorous research designs to estimate the impact of teacher retention bonus programs, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. At the same time, it is worth noting that the late implementation limits the potential for principals and teachers to game the system by inflating observation scores to increase certain teachers' odds of receiving the bonus. While the timing of implementation limits both the sample and predicted effect size, it potentially strengthens the internal validity of our regression discontinuity identification strategy.\nSecond, considerable noncompliance with the rules established for the distribution of the bonuses makes it difficult to rule out the potential that principals were offering bonuses selectively based on some alternative criterion that happened to align relatively well with the cutoff that provides the basis for the discontinuity. The use of the Level-5 assignment rule as an instrument allows us to isolate the variation in bonus recipients that was attributable to the functionally random distinction between teacher scores slightly above and below the cutoff for teachers to become a level-5. However, if principals were aware of the cutoff and inflated teachers' observation scores who they wanted to stay or thought were more likely to stay, then the estimated effect of the bonus program could in part represent some unobserved difference between the recipient teachers and non-recipients that was not captured by the full set of controls. As we stated above, though, this type of gaming bias is made less likely due to the small window of time around the implementation, and analyses of evaluation scores separate from value added measures uncovered no consistent irregularities. Forthcoming interviews and surveys of administrators and teachers should help clarify whether the observed noncompliance was attributable to something other than rushed implementation.\nIn sum, despite these substantial implementation difficulties, and a relatively small sample of participating schools, we find some preliminary evidence of a causal link between the bonus offer and retention of high quality teachers. Estimates are particularly positive amongst teachers of tested subjects, for whom we have the most credible estimates of classroom effectiveness and are perhaps the most difficult to retain in schools facing strict oversight and accountability. On several measures, schools that participated in the bonus program appear to be slightly more disadvantaged than even the other eligible priority schools, ensuring that the bonuses provided additional compensation to effective teachers working in some of the most challenging settings in the state.\nMoving forward, policymakers implementing similar programs could benefit from additional steps to ensure principals and teachers in eligible schools are aware of the bonuses and are supported throughout the implementation process to ensure compliance with program guidelines.\nEarlier implementation and efforts to improve awareness would increase the likelihood of this type of performance based retention bonus serving as both an incentive to stay at a hard-to-staff school and a reward for laudable work in a vital setting. Future research should seek to illuminate teacher 25 and principal perceptions of the bonuses, barriers to them reaching the teachers they are designed to target, and the mechanisms by which they influence teachers to stay.
