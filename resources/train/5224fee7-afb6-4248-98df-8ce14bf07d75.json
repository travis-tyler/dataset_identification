[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) and dual T2w and proton density (PD)"}, {"section_title": "| I N TR ODU C TI ON", "text": "White matter hyperintensities (WMHs), defined as regions of higher signal than the surrounding normal appearing white matter (NAWM) on T2w or FLAIR MR images, are one of the most common findings in structural MR imaging in older adults, reflecting demyelination and axonal loss (Prins & Scheltens, 2015) . While sensitive as an expression of abnormality in the white matter (WM) tissue, the etiology of WMHs is quite varied, with ischemia due to cerebral small vessel disease playing an important role in the majority of older subjects (Gouw et al., 2010; Yoshita, Fletcher, & DeCarli, 2005) . This age-related ischemic small vessel disease is also referred to as arteriolosclerosis, hypertension-related, or vascular-risk-factor-related small vessel disease (Pantoni, 2010) .\nHowever, the term small vessel disease is also related to other pathologies that affect small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, genetic small vessel disease distinct from amyloid angiopathy (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant/recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL/CARASIL), inflammatory-mediated small vessel disease (e.g., primary angiitis of central nervous system CNS, Wegener's granulomatosis), and venous collagenosis (Pantoni, 2010) .\nSome of the consequences of small vessel disease include lacunar infarcts, WMHs, micro and macro bleeding. The first two phenomena are easily detected on MR images. In contrast, small vessels cannot be seen using MRI, so the term small vessel disease on MRI has been used for (and become equivalent to) WMHs and lacunar infarcts (Pantoni, 2010) . Unfortunately, there is great heterogeneity across neuropathological centers regarding the definition of MRI small vessel disease, with overall agreement lower than 50% (Pantoni et al., 2006) . As there is no conclusive data showing the levels of specificity and sensitivity of WMHs on MRI as a reflection of a specific etiology of small vessel disease, we consider, in our cases, that the two major groups (arteriolosclerosis and amyloid angiopathy) are probably the main substrates of the WMHs. These two etiologies on their own have a crucial role in three major clinical areas: stroke, neurocognitive disorders (dementia), and aging-related cognitive decline (Pantoni, 2010) .\nThe location and load of WMHs have been shown to correlate with age, a history of hypertension, hyperinsulinemia (Hawkins et al., 2017) , and cognitive deficits (Biesbroek, Weaver, & Biessels, 2017; DeCarli et al., 1995; Dubois et al., 2014) . Therefore, WMHs constitute a clinically meaningful biomarker of cognitive decline related to general aging and pathological vascular processes, which are known contributors to multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases (Iturria-Medina, Sotero, Toussaint, Mateos-P erez, & Evans, 2016) . They are a particularly important clinical measure in the elderly populations (Carmichael et al., 2010; De Groot et al., 2002; DeCarli et al., 2001; Dubois et al., 2014; Longstreth et al., 1996; van Straaten et al., 2008) .\nWMHs are generally assessed using FLAIR or T2w/PD scans which have optimum contrast for detecting such lesions (Caligiuri et al., 2015) . T2w/PD and FLAIR WMHs have been shown to correspond to myelin stain lesions in postmortem histology studies (Fernando et al., 2004; Takao et al., 1999) . However, WMHs can also be detected on T1w scans to some extent. The characteristic bright WMH signal of FLAIR, T2w and PD, manifests in the T1w sequence as a hypointense area, heterogeneous in the value of the lower signal, ranging from isointense to hypo-intense in relation to the surrounding NAWM. In other words, a FLAIR, T2w/PD homogeneous hyperintense area would correspond, in the T1w modality, to a similar area of heterogeneous hypointense signal, ranging from values close to fluid, to isointense in relation to the surrounding NAWM. This phenomenon is probably determined by the different types and degrees of change occurring in the WM at the same time (e.g., more/less intense demyelination and axonal loss).\nThis range of T1w hypointensities in a region of WM tissue is more homogeneously represented by the bright signal of T2w and FLAIR sequences. As the quantification of lesion volumes in a given MRI modality depends on the contrast between the lesional area and the surrounding NAWM, these volumes will always be larger if the detection considers the bright signal of FLAIR or T2w scans, as opposed to using only T1w images. The hypointensity seen on T1w images presumably reflects the most severe spectrum of WM injury.\nAlthough FLAIR or T2w/PD scans are the optimal sequences to detect WMHs, many especially large-scale studies forgo acquisition of either one or all of the optimal modalities because of time and financial constraints. There can also be differences in WMH volume levels when comparing T2w/PD with FLAIR scans, with FLAIR scans tending to give higher overall levels. Consequently, it would be extremely useful if one can get an estimate of the load and location of WMHs without requiring these optimal modalities. While there have been other studies that define and use T1w white matter signal abnormality (WMSA) detected by Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012) as a measure of WMH in aging and AD populations (Jacobs et al., 2013; Leritz et al., 2014; Salat et al., 2010) , to our knowledge, no studies have investigated and validated the relationship between these T1w hypointensities and FLAIR or T2w/PD-based WMH segmentations and whether there is a significant difference in their relationships with clinical measures.\nIn this article, we aimed to compare the ability of T1w, T2w/PD and FLAIR scans in differentiating between healthy tissue and WMHs, both in terms of (a) detection in comparison with manually segmented labels and (b) correlation with a variety of clinical measures. Our goal is to determine if WMHs can be partially but accurately segmented based only on T1w images, and how reliable T1w-based assessments are in comparison with the more accurate estimates obtained based on FLAIR or T2w/PD sequences."}, {"section_title": "| M A TE RI A L S A ND M E TH ODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Subjects", "text": "The WMHs were segmented both manually and automatically in three different datasets to ensure generalizability of the results.

The quality of the nonlinear registrations was visually assessed and the results that did not pass this quality control were discarded.

In ADNI1, T2w images were used as the primary contrast with T1w and PD used to aid in the decision process. The rater defined the voxel of interest according to anatomical location and intensity information in all given MRI modalities. To be considered a WMH, a given voxel had to be hyperintense in relation to the surrounding NAWM on T2w, PD, or FLAIR. The same voxel had to be iso to hypointense in relation to the NAWM on T1w images.

The intensity features include voxel intensity for all available modalities, the probability of a specific intensity value being a WMH (p WMH ) or non-WMH (p non-WMH ) for each available modality, and the ratio of these two probabilities for each available modality. The spatial features include a spatial WMH probability map indicating the probability of a voxel at a specific location being a WMH and the average intensity of a non-WMH voxel at that specific voxel location for each available modality. After preprocessing and co-registration of all available modalities, these spatial and intensity features are calculated for each modality. The Random Forest classifier is then trained using these features to segment the WMHs (Dadar et al., 2017a) .\nFor each dataset, the automatic technique was first trained and validated based on the manual segmentations. Two sets of automatic segmentations were completed, first with all available modalities (referred to as All-Contrasts segmentations) and second without using the T2w, PD, and FLAIR information (referred to as T1w-Only segmentations). The trained classifiers were then used to segment the entire ADC, ADNI1, and ADNI2/GO datasets. The quality of the segmentations was then assessed and verified by a human expert. The volumes of the WMHs for the left and right frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes and the entire brain were calculated by nonlinearly warping the Hammers atlas (Hammers et al., 2003) to the T1w scans of individual subjects and normalized for head size to make population comparisons possible.\nThe WMH volumes obtained from the T1w-Only segmentations were then correlated with All-Contrasts volumes and clinical scores. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed to correct for all multiple comparisons separately for each dataset (significance threshold 5 0.05).\nAll the correlations with clinical scores were performed with log transformed WMHs (to achieve normal distribution), controlling for age.\nThe key concern when using T1w-Only segmentations is whether the WMH portions that are not captured by T1w-Only segmentations are clinically significant. To assess whether the difference between the WMH volumes provided by T1w-Only and All-Contrast segmentations is statistically significant, a general linear model was used to regress the contrast (WMHL All-Contrast -WMHL T1w-Only ) and each measure. Figure 1 shows the axials slices of T1w, T2w, PD, and FLAIR images for a subject from ADC, T1w, T2w, and PD images for a subject from ADNI1 and T1w and FLAIR images for a subject from ADNI2/ GO, along with the manual segmentations, as well as T1w-Only and All-Contrasts automated segmentations.

Figure 4 shows the results of these comparisons for each dataset. The correlations were significant for every lobe in both datasets (r 5 .888, p < .001 for ADNI1, and r 5 .969, p < .001 for ADNI2/GO for whole brain correlations).

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using WMHs as an outcome in clinical trials investigating cerebral small vessel disease in the context of stroke and dementia (Debette & Markus, 2010) . They reflect the burden of the disease in relation to a small-vessel component (Pantoni, 2010) , and are associated with decline in different cognitive domains. Specifically in AD, WMHs are emerging as a potential biomarker of the preclinical vulnerability risk for the disease (Brickman et al., 2012; Deoni, Matthews, & Kolind, 2013; Provenzano et al., 2013) .\nThe optimal MRI sequences for detecting WMHs are FLAIR and T2w/PD scans. However, many previous large-scale datasets have forgone the acquisition of these sequences in favor of other imaging modalities or due to time and financial concerns. WMHs are also visible as hypointense regions on T1w images, but their range of hypointensity is more spread out when compared to the bright signal obtained in FLAIR and T2w/PD, with large isointense areas, or almost isointense in relation with the surrounding NAWM (Fig. 9 ). This lower contrast between the NAWM tissue and WMHs on T1w sequence makes accurate detection of the full extent of WMHs more challenging in this MRI modality. However, by assessing, even to some extent, the load and location of WMHs using only T1w data, it is possible to study them in other retrospective datasets, where T2w/PD, or FLAIR information are not available. The key concern when using T1w-Only segmentations would be whether the WMH portions that are not captured by T1w-Only segmentations are clinically significant.\nIn our study, a previously validated automated technique was used to segment the WMHs with and without the optimal FLAIR and T2w/ PD information. In a previous study, we have shown that this automated tool was able to detect WMHs using different combinations of MRI sequences (Dadar et al., 2017a) . Here, a random forest classifier was chosen to report our results based on our previous experiments and validations as it had the best performance in detecting WMHs among the studied linear and nonlinear classifiers. However, similar experiments were also performed using the other available classifiers such as AdaBoost which showed similar results regardless of the choice of classifier.\nOur results suggest that the measures obtained from using only\nT1w images underestimate the actual WMH burden, since they only capture the portion of the lesions that co-localizes with the lower intensity signal of the overall T1w hypointense area (Fig. 9) . We speculate that these deeper hypointense portions are probably due to more severely affected tissue (i.e., more extensive demyelination, and/or more axonal loss) which are likely to be more clinically relevant (hence In addition, T1w images are generally acquired at higher resolutions (i.e., 1-mm-thick slices) than the T2w/PD or FLAIR scans which are generally acquired at 3-5 mm slice thicknesses. The higher spatial resolution of T1w images can also be used to obtain more spatially accurate segmentations, where such information may not available due to the higher slice thickness of the T2w/PD and FLAIR images.\nOur study indicates that datasets that lack T2w/PD and FLAIR modalities may still benefit from the estimation of WMHs using our T1w-Only segmentation approach, to correlate this MRI data with other clinical variables available for the subjects. | 1105"}]
