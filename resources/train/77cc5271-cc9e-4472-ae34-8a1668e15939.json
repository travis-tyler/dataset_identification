[{"section_title": "", "text": "V ENTRICULAR arrhythmias, whether occurring during routine daily activity (1-4) or induced by exercise ( 5 -8) increase in prevalence and complexity with advancing age. Although this age-associated increase in ventricular arrhythmias may be related in part to the higher prevalence of organic heart disease in older populations, such an increase in arrhythmias with age is observed even in populations carefully screened to exclude overt and occult coronary artery disease (3, 4) .\nA possible mechanism for the age-associated increase in ventricular arrhythmias involves anatomic or functional cardiac changes accompanying normative aging. For example, left ventricular (LV) mass increases approximately 50% across the adult life span in normotensive populations (9, 10) . Left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed by either electrocardiogram or echocardiogram has been associated with more frequent and higher grade ventricular arrhythmias on ambulatory ECG compared to hearts with normal LV mass (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . In one hypertensive sample, Ghali et al. (15) demonstrated graded increases in the prevalence of ambulatory ventricular arrhythmias with increasing LV mass. However, studies of general populations have shown relatively weak relationships between ambulatory ventricular arrhythmias and LV mass (13, 16) .\nExercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias (EIVA), like ventricular arrhythmias detected on ambulatory ECG, are more prevalent in older persons (5) (6) (7) (8) and in patients with hypertension (17) or organic heart disease (7, 18) . In contrast to the widely studied relationship between ambulatory ventricular arrhythmias and echocardiographic LV mass, the role of cardiac structure or function in the genesis of EIVA remains unexplored. The present study seeks to determine the contribution of echocardiographic variables in the ageassociated increase in EIVA among a large sample of healthy normotensive volunteers, carefully screened to exclude organic heart disease. In addition, the study explores the relative importance of simple anthropometric characteristics, exercise test variables, and echocardiographic findings as predictors of EIVA. Our primary hypothesis was that the physiologic LV hypertrophy which occurs with aging would explain much of the age-associated increase in EIVA."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Study population. -Subjects for the present study constituted a subset of participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (19) . These community-dwelling volunteers, 21 to 96 years old, undergo 2.5 days of extensive testing biennially at the Gerontology Research Center of the National Institute on Aging. Individuals without clinical evidence of heart disease or major orthopedic limitations routinely undergo maximal treadmill exercise testing. Mmode echocardiograms have been performed on those healthy volunteers who were not receiving cardioactive"}, {"section_title": "M24", "text": "MAY VGA ET AL. medications, to define age-associated changes in cardiac anatomy and resting function. Individuals were retrospectively selected for the present study if they fulfilled the following criteria: (a) clinically healthy normotensive volunteers who underwent maximal treadmill exercise testing and technically adequate M-mode echocardiograms on the same visit or within two consecutive biennial visits; (b) no therapy with diuretics, antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic, or other cardioactive medications; (c) achievement of at least 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate without 1.0 mm of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment responses; and (d) absence of ventricular arrhythmia at rest.\nTesting methodology. -Graded maximal treadmill exercise testing was performed using a modified Balke protocol as previously described (8) . Speed was set at 3.5 mph for males and 3 mph for females, with progressive increases in elevation of 3% starting from horizontal, every 2 minutes until exhaustion. The electrocardiographic signal was interfaced simultaneously with a Honeywell 8011 oscilloscope and an audible cardiotachometer and recorded on FM tape. The ECG was recorded continuously in leads aVF, V,, and Vj throughout exercise and during the 6-minute recovery period; playback was performed when arrhythmias were heard but not captured on paper initially during testing.\nResting M-mode echocardiograms were performed with subjects in the left lateral position, using standard methods (20) . End diastolic and end systolic measurements of left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDd and LVIDs, respectively), interventricular septal thickness (IVST), posterior wall thickness (PWT), mitral valve E-F closure slope, and end systolic left atrial size were performed according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) (21) . For each variable, the values for at least 3 nonconsecutive beats were averaged. Relative wall thickness was computed using the formula: relative wall thickness = 2 X PWT/LVIDd. Fractional shortening was computed with the formula: fractional shortening = [LVIDd -LVIDs/ LVIDd] x 100. LV mass was computed by the formula of Devereux et al. (22) as follows: LV mass = 0.8 [1.04 (LVIDd + IVST + PWT) 3 -(LVIDd) 3 -0.6]. To further examine the relationship between diastolic LV performance and EIVA, we compared Doppler-derived indices of diastolic function between subjects with and without EIVA in the subset of 71 individuals who also underwent this examination. Doppler diastolic LV indices examined were peak early (E) and late (A) filling velocities and their ratio (E/A), atrial filling fraction (AFF), and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT). M-mode and Doppler echocardiograms and exercise ECGs were read independently of one another by a single experienced observer.\nEIVA observed at any time during exercise or the 6-minute recovery period were classified as follows: (a) absent, if no ventricular ectopic beats were observed during exercise or recovery; (b) simple, if isolated ventricular ectopic beats never accounted for 10% of beats in any minute; and (c) complex, if ventricular ectopic beats constituted 5= 10% of beats in any minute or occurred in runs of 3 or more (8, 23) .\nStatistical analysis. -Univariate and multivariate predictors of EIVA were derived from the following sets of variables: (a) physical characteristics: age, gender, body surface area, body mass index; and (b) exercise test variables: exercise duration, maximum heart rate, peak systolic and diastolic blood pressures; and the echocardiographic measurements described above, both before and after normalizing for body size, as appropriate. Separate analyses were performed for the presence of any EIVA and for the presence of complex EIVA. Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations and compared between groups using unpaired /-tests. The Mantel-Haenszel statistic (24) was used to compare gender and age differences in arrhythmia distribution. The relationship between age and physical, exercise test and echocardiographic variables was examined by linear regression analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of EIVA. A two-tailed p-value < .05 was considered significant."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Among the 470 participants with both echocardiograms and treadmill exercise tests, 94 subjects were excluded because of incomplete echocardiographic data which precluded the calculation of LV mass, and 10 because of ischemic ST segment responses to exercise. Of the 366 participants who fulfilled our study criteria, 145 were males (40%) and 221 were females (60%). Their ages ranged from 20 to 90 years, with a mean age of 49 \u00b1 16. The majority of subjects (83%) had their echocardiogram and treadmill exercise test performed on the same BLSA visit, while the remainder underwent these tests on consecutive biennial visits. Indices of LV size or performance outside the normal range were observed in 15 individuals (5%), 13 with mild LV dilatation > 3.2 cm/m 2 (range 3.3 -4.0 cm/m 2 ), and 2 with interventricular septal hypertrophy > 1.3 cm (range 1.4 -1.6 cm) (20) . Age-associated changes in selected anlhropometric, exercise test, and echocardiographic variables in these carefully screened volunteers are shown in Table 1 . Aging was accompanied by highly significant reductions in exercise duration, maximal heart rate, peak E velocity and E/A ratio, mitral valve closure slope, and increases in peak exercise blood pressure, left atrial size, atrial filling fraction, isovolumic relaxation time, LV wall thicknesses, and LV mass index.\nAmong the 366 individuals who met the inclusion criteria, 270 (74%) had no EIVA, 79 (21 %) had simple EIVA, and 17 (5%) had complex EIVA. There was a striking trend for EIVA to be more prevalent and complex with advancing age and among males (Figure 1 and Tables 2 and 4) . Table 2 compares the mean values of exercise and echocardiographic variables between the group with any EIVA and those without EIVA. In addition to their male predominance, the group with EIVA was older and had larger body surface area, lower exercise duration and maximal heart rate, higher peak systolic blood pressure, greater LV mass index, and a trend toward reduced early diastolic filling velocity. By multiple logistic regression analysis (Table 3) , only age independently predicted the occurrence of EIVA. Incorporating peak systolic blood pressure in the model reduced the model chi square from 44.7 to 29.9. When age was removed from the original model, only LV mass was an independent determinant of EIVA, with an odds ratio of 1.02 for each g/m 2 increase, /; = .002, and a reduction in the model chi square to 24.1. Results in the subset with Doppler diastolic indices were essentially identical, with age the only independent predictor of EIVA, p < .01.\nTo examine the factors associated with the development of potentially serious ventricular arrhythmias with exercise, we further categorized the participants into those without and those with complex EIVA, defined by either frequent ventricular ectopic beats (n = 10) or runs (n = 7). For this analysis, individuals with no EIVA and those with simple EIVA were grouped together. Univariate analysis showed that the group with complex EIVA was characterized by older age, male gender, greater left atrial size and increased LV posterior wall, septal and relative wall thicknesses, and greater LV mass. Lower heart rate and higher systolic blood pressure at maximal effort were also associated with complex EIVA (Table 4) . Doppler diastolic indices were not included in this analysis because only two subjects with Doppler data had complex EIVA. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed, incorporating age, gender, and left atrial size into the model. By this analysis (Table 5) , we found that greater left atrial size and older age were independent predictors of complex EIVA. Adding LV posterior wall thickness or relative wall thickness to the model increased the model chi square only nominally from 19.9 to 21.3 because neither of these latter variables was an independent predictor of complex EIVA. When age was removed from the model, only left atrial size was an independent predictor, p = .007, and the model chi square was reduced to 14.7, p = .0007."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In several prior studies, increased age (1-4) and LV hypertrophy (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) have been associated with an increased prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias detected on ambulatory ECG. We hypothesized that the well-known ageassociated increase in EIVA might also be mediated in large part by cardiac anatomic variables such as LV mass, a relationship not previously examined to our knowledge. Our results demonstrated that in community-based subjects 20-90 years old who were carefully screened for the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cardioactive medications -factors which themselves have been impli- cated in an increased prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias -LV mass index was higher in those with EIVA than in those without them. This association of EIVA with greater LV mass pertained to both the presence of any EIVA as well as to complex EIVA alone. However, on multivariate analysis, only older age independently predicted the presence of any EIVA, and only older age and increased left atrial size independently predicted complex EIVA.\nOver the past decade several investigators have documented a higher prevalence and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias during ambulatory ECG monitoring in hypertensive patients versus those without echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (11, 12, 14, 15) . For example, Ghali et al. (15) demonstrated in 49 hypertensives that every 1 mm increase in septal or posterior wall thickness was associated with a two-or threefold increase, respectively, in arrhythmia frequency and complexity. The Framingham Study has also shown such an association in their overall population (13) but not in subjects free from cardiovascular disease (16) . In these latter subjects, only older age and increased systolic LV dimension were independent predictors of Lown grade 2 or greater ventricular arrhythmias (16) .\nSeveral previous studies have shown EIVA to be more prevalent and complex with increasing age (5) (6) (7) (8) 25) . Prior studies in our laboratory, for example, have demonstrated exercise-induced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia to be 25 times more prevalent above vs below age 65 years (25) . Although the mechanism for the age-associated increase in EIVA is not clear, possibilities include a higher prevalence of undetected coronary artery disease (26) , an exaggerated plasma catecholamine response to exercise (27) , and the augmentation of LV mass with age (9,10). In the current study, increased age was associated with the presence of both simple and complex EIVA. This association is unlikely to be mediated by higher prevalence of silent coronary artery disease since all participants were asymptomatic and had negative ST-segment responses to maximal exercise. As observed in ambulatory ECG studies (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , increased LV mass was a correlate of EIVA. However, in the present study this relationship was no longer significant once the effect of age was considered by multivariate analysis, suggesting that age rather than LV mass is the stronger predictor of EIVA. Similarly, male sex, larger body size, and a higher exercise peak systolic pressure, factors associated with a greater LV mass (13, 16, 28, 29) , were predictors of EIVA on univariate but not multivariate analysis. When age was removed from the multivariate model, only LV mass index emerged as an independent Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-abstract/51A/1/M23/586387 by guest on 29 January 2019 predictor of EIVA, suggesting that the effect of age on EIVA may be partially mediated by the well-known physiologic LV hypertrophy seen with normative aging (9, 10) .\nThe occurrence of complex EIVA in our sample was also associated with older age, as well as with male gender, increased LV posterior wall thickness, relative wall thickness, and LV mass; this is generally consistent with the predictors of any EIVA. A somewhat unexpected finding, however, was that left atrial size was the sole independent predictor of complex EIVA aside from age. To our knowledge, an association of larger left atrial size with ventricular arrhythmias has not been previously reported. Nevertheless, such a relationship is physiologically plausible, since a larger left atrium generally reflects a higher LV end diastolic pressure or volume, which itself may be arrhythmogenic. Both a larger left atrium at rest (10) and a higher LV end diastolic pressure (30) and volume (31) during exercise have been associated with advancing age and may be mediated in part by the early diastolic dysfunction (9, 10, 32) and by the less complete systolic emptying during exercise (31, 32) which accompany normative aging.\nSeveral limitations of the current study should be recognized. By including only normotensive individuals, none of whom had major LV dilatation, dysfunction, or hypertrophy, we may have missed possible associations of EIVA with these variables. The fact that increased LV mass and increased posterior wall thickness and relative wall thickness were univariate but not independent predictors of any EIVA or complex EIVA, respectively, argues against such an effect, at least with respect to LV mass. Furthermore, neither a univariate nor multivariate relationship between variables proves causality. Another limitation is the small number of individuals with complex EIVA, thereby weakening our power to detect variables independently predictive of such arrhythmias. Although plasma catecholamines or serum electrolytes measured during exercise might provide additional insights regarding the mechanisms of EIVA, these were not available in our volunteers. Finally, twodimensional echocardiographic and Doppler measures of LV anatomy and function, performed in only a subset of subjects in this study, might prove more potent predictors of EIVA then the M-mode echocardiographic parameters analyzed here. Future studies utilizing these newer techniques in populations with a wide range of cardiac pathology may provide further insights regarding the interaction of age with cardiac structure and function in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. Additional studies might also determine whether pharmacological reduction of blood pressure, LV mass, or left atrial size attenuates the frequency and complexity of EIVA."}]
