[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), as opposed to its autosomal dominant form, is likely caused by a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, and health lifestyle factors. Twin studies indicate that sporadic AD heritability could be between 58% and 79%, around half of which is explained by the \u03b54 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE4). We hypothesized that genes associated with known risk factors for AD, namely hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, would contribute significantly to the remaining heritability. We analyzed 22 AD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with these risk factors, that were included in the sequencing data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 data set, which included 355 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We built survival models with the selected SNPs to predict progression of MCI to probable AD over the 10-year follow-up of the study. The rs391300 SNP, located on the serine racemase (SRR) gene and linked to increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, was associated with progression from MCI to probable AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major etiology behind cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly population (Plassman et al., 2011) . Its biggest risk factor is aging (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011) , and thus, as the worldwide population is steadily getting older (Brodaty et al., 2011) , a significant increase in the prevalence of AD seems imminent. In fact, what underlies aging as a risk factor in the sporadic form of AD, as opposed to its autosomal dominant form due to known amyloid precursor protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PS1), or Presenilin 2 (PS2) genetic mutations, is likely the causal interaction(s) of genetic and environmental factors over an individual's lifetime.\nRegarding genetic risk, twin studies indicate that AD heritability lies between 58% and 79% (Gatz et al., 2006) . The only wellestablished factor linked to AD is the \u03b54 allele on the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4), which is involved in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Kim et al., 2009) . Carriers with only one copy of the \u03b54 allele have 2 to 3 times the risk of developing AD, whereas carriers of two \u03b54 alleles have 12 times the risk of developing AD (Roses, 1996) . It is therefore estimated that APOE4 could be responsible for 50% of the genetic predisposition in AD (Ashford and Mortimer, 2002) .\nWe postulate that the remaining half of the reported genetic heritability could be explained by genes associated not directly with AD, but with risk factors for AD. These include diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, and coronary heart disease (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011) . In particular,\n(1) non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (T2D), a chronic condition characterized by hyperglycemia either caused by insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production or both (Longo et al., 2012) , is highly prevalent in the elderly population and has been linked to a 2-fold increased risk for AD (Ott et al., 1999) . Twin studies have shown that onset of T2D during midlife (onset age <65 years) was more likely to be associated with dementia and AD than onset later in life (onset age !65 years) (Xu et al., 2009 ); (2) increased plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations in older adults (65e85 years) has been associated with poorer working memory performance (Meusel et al., 2017) ; increased serum cholesterol in midlife increases the risk of AD, and patients taking lipid-lowering agents have a lower risk of AD than patients taking no medication (Dufouil et al., 2005; Notkola et al., 1998) ; (3) high blood pressure in midlife is a risk factor for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia (Qiu et al., 2005) ; (4) obesity (body mass index [BMI] !30) in midlife has also been associated with AD (Whitmer et al., 2007) , and a meta-analysis of prospective studies showed a 2-fold increase in risk for AD in obese individuals (Anstey et al., 2011) ; and (5) coronary heart disease, defined as a history of myocardial infarction, angina, angiographic coronary stenosis, or coronary revascularization, has been associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and progression to dementia (Roberts et al., 2010) .\nBased on these findings, we hypothesized that variants in genetic risk factors associated with diabetes, hypertension, lipid transport, obesity, and coronary heart disease would be associated with an increased risk of progression of MCI to AD. Our major contributions in this work include (1) identifying single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants known to be significantly associated with these risk factors for AD that were present in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and (2) conducting survival analyses in a robust design to identify those SNPs and covariates significantly associated with risk for progression of MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics", "text": "ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by M.W.

Three variants had fewer than 5 participants with a homozygous variant: rs16945088 (G/G) with a genotype frequency of <1% (n \u00bc 3) and an allelic frequency (G) of 15%; rs12413409 (A/A) with a genotype frequency of 1% (n \u00bc 4) and an allelic frequency (A) of 15%; and rs6725887 (G/G) with a genotype frequency 1% (n \u00bc 4) and an allelic frequency (G) of 20%.

Genome-wide association studies have revealed associations of AD with other genes, but of much smaller magnitudes than for APOE (Butler et al., 2009) . Moreover, studies with twins indicate a disease heritability of 58%e79% (Gatz et al., 2006) . Thus, an important portion of the genetic risk for AD remains unknown and could be linked to variations in genes associated with known health-related risk factors for AD.\nWe assessed the association of genetic variants linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and coronary heart diseases with progression from MCI to probable AD over a 10-year observation period. Of the 22 SNPs included in our study, only one, linked to T2D, was significantly associated with progression from MCI to probable AD after adjusting for covariates (Fig. 2) .\nThe rs391300 SNP is located in the serine racemase (SRR) gene. SRR generates D-serine from L-serine, a co-agonist with glutamate of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. A variant in the SRR gene was significantly associated with schizophrenia susceptibility and T2D in a Chinese Han population (Labrie et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2010) . The rs391300 gene variant was also associated with therapeutic efficacy of metformin in T2D (Dong et al., 2011) and with risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in a Chinese Han population (Wang et al., 2011) . However, another genome-wide association study in Hans did not confirm this relationship between SRR gene variants and T2D (Zhang et al., 2014) .\nRegarding the association between SRR and AD, a study investigating the role of D-serine in the pathophysiology of AD (Hashimoto et al., 2004) concluded that reduced activity of SRR could play a role in the susceptibility to AD because serum levels of D-serine were decreased in AD patients compared with cognitively normal controls. D-Serine is a co-agonist of NMDA receptors, which have been shown to be decreased in brain regions affected in AD, particularly the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Sze et al., 2001) . A dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission in relation to NMDA receptors could also be involved in the pathophysiology of AD (Kornhuber and Weller, 1997; Olney et al., 1997) . Currently, the effect of rs391300 on the SRR gene remains unknown; only that the effect of this SNP on certain phenotypes was investigated, and not on the functionality of SRR itself. The SNP rs391300 could impact activity or expression of SRR, subsequently altering the metabolism of D/L-serine and thereby influencing conversion of MCI to AD via an NMDA receptor effect. Alternatively, an association with another SNP not included in our analysis is also a possibility because an exhaustive analysis of all SNPs associated with risk factors for AD was not performed.\nThe relationship between AD and T2D remains unclear but is currently a very dynamic area of research. While hyperglycemia has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline (Crane et al., 2013) , the association of suboptimal cognitive performance with insulin resistance/T2D could also be partly explained by reactive oxygen species that contribute to microvascular damage (de Bresser et al., 2010; Segura et al., 2009; Unoki and Yamagishi, 2008) and beta amyloid and tau accumulation (Chen et al., 2003) within the brain. In addition to oxidative stress, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulate beta amyloid release from neurons, and insulin resistance impairs brain amyloid clearance and phosphorylated tau clearance (Carro and Torres-Aleman, 2004; Craft and Watson, 2004; De Felice et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2017a) . Increased amounts of proinflammatory factors and ceramides produced in the liver of T2D may also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause or exacerbate neurological insults (de la Monte, 2009; Diehl et al., 2017) . More recently, the role of amylin, an amyloidogenic protein cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic b-cells, has been supported by several studies as a potential connection between T2D and AD (Bharadwaj et al., 2017; de Matos et al., 2017; Zhang and Song, 2017) . Amylin exerts its neurotoxicity by directly interacting with beta amyloid and causing its aggregation (Ono et al., 2014) . Interestingly, decreased brain volumes (Brundel et al., 2010; den Heijer et al., 2003; Moran et al., 2013; Scheltens et al., 2002) and functional connectivity (Chen et al., 2014; Musen et al., 2012) assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were found in similar brain regions for both T2D and AD patients. These 2 conditions share many common risk factors (i.e., aging, dyslipidemia, genetic predisposition, hypertension, and obesity) and pathological processes (i.e., inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction) (Zhang and Song, 2017; de la Monte and Wands, 2008; Kang et al., 2017b) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study found a significant association between an SNP (rs391300) linked to T2D and conversion of MCI to AD, even after correction for APOE genotype.\nOne goal of being able to better identify those at risk of AD is to allow intervention before damage is irreversible. Multimodal prevention-type treatments for AD are emerging (Ngandu et al., 2015) and commonly suggest lowering the risk for coronary heart disease and/or T2D. Increased risk of T2D due to SRR may therefore be an important target for AD preventative measures. from the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke.
