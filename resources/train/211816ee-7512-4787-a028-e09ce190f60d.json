[{"section_title": "", "text": "after grapes in total value of fruit production and planted fruit acreage, accounting for 21% of the value of total fruit production and 18% of total area planted to fruit in 2006. Beef represents the largest segment of the U.S. livestock sector. Sale of cattle and calves accounted for 73% of total value of production of meat animals in 2006 (USDA 2007) .\nBetween 1987 and 2002 , the total number of farms in each of these industries fell while the number of farms in the largest census farm category grew (see Figure 1) . The relative growth in number of larger farms was much greater in the corn and wheat industries than in the apple and beef industries. Total production rose in the corn and beef industries while production dropped in the wheat and apple industries. However, the drop in wheat production was less than the relative decline in total number of farms in the wheat industry so this industry also became more concentrated. Production concentration was greater in the corn and beef industries than in the wheat industry, and the evidence of increased concentration in the apple industry was mixed.\nThe rapid changes in these industries suggest several important empirical research questions and testable hypotheses with regard to firm and industry growth that could have implications for public and private decision making. For example, profit-maximizing, risk neutral, price-taking firms are expected to grow if they can exploit scale and/or scope economies. Scale economies exist if the firm experiences decreasing average cost as output increases, while scope economies exist if the average total cost of production decreases as a result of increasing the number of goods produced.\nWhile there is considerable evidence that scale and scope economies apply generally to agricultural industries, whether they apply to the largest farms is an open empirical question.\nThe empirical evidence is inconclusive and varies with industry of interest and approach used to examine the evidence (e.g., Mulik, Taylor, and Koo 2005; Just, Mitra, and Netanyahu 2005; Morrison-Paul, Nehring, and Banker 2004; Helmers and Atwood 2003; Mafoua 2002; MorrisonPaul 2001; Ollinger, MacDonald, and Madison 2000; Ben-Belhassen and Womack 2000) . For example, even two very recent studies (Skolrud et al. 2007; Mosheim and Lovell 2006) found contradictory evidence about scale economies in the dairy industry. The former found evidence of non-diminishing scale economies for the largest decile of dairy farms while the latter found constant or declining returns to scale for larger farms. Our research expands the analysis of scale and scope economies in the context of industry consolidation for the corn, wheat, apple, and beef industries.\nThe purpose of this paper is to learn about growth and diversification trends within size cohorts for the four industries and compare them to those of the dairy industry. It contributes essential missing links in understanding how structural change is occurring at the firm level in these industries. Although it does not address causation, the paper creates an informational base that is particularly relevant for econometric analysis of causal factors. For example, if evidence of scale diseconomies were found in an industry, it would suggest that other forces, e.g., human capital, business/family life cycle, value chain, government policies (Gray and Boehlje 2007; Hoppe et al. 2007) , must be operating to drive consolidation.\nWe extend the analysis used by Skolrud et al. (2007) for the dairy industry to determine whether cost economies are evident in the U.S. corn, wheat, apple, and beef industries. We seek answers to three research questions that apply to incumbents in all four industries. First, do the largest farms grow at least as rapidly as medium-sized farms? If they grow less rapidly, it would suggest that convergence toward an equilibrium size is occurring even if that equilibrium size has not been observed yet. On the other hand, if the largest farms grow at least as fast as the medium-sized ones, we must conclude that farms are not yet approaching an equilibrium size.\nSecond, do farms become more diversified over time? If they do, it would provide inferential evidence of increasing economies of scope.\n1 Third, if they do become more diversified over time, do the largest farms diversify more rapidly than medium-sized farms? If they diversify less rapidly, it would suggest that a change in the relative importance of scale and scope economies could cause medium-sized farms to grow the fastest in the future even if the largest farms currently grow most rapidly. If, however, the answer to all three questions is yes, then even without further analysis, we would conclude that the largest farms are expected to continue to grow the most rapidly, and no equilibrium farm size is currently in sight. That would imply that major structural changes will likely continue in these industries, at least in the near future.\nTo preview our findings, growth rates in each of these four industries declined with farm size. This finding is in marked contrast to the dairy industry in which the largest farms grew faster than medium-sized farms over the same period of time. Wheat and apple industries are becoming more diversified while corn and beef industries are becoming less diversified. Within the wheat and apple industries, diversification increased faster for medium-sized farms than for the largest farms. Inferentially, these findings suggest that scale economies diminish for large farms across all four industries and, where scope economies exist, they also diminish for large farms."}, {"section_title": "Method of Analysis", "text": "We apply both inferential and statistical methods to answer the three research questions. We partition initial farms into ten non-overlapping size cohorts in 1992 based on the magnitude of agricultural sales (exclusive of government payments), with an equal number of farms in each cohort. 2 We track incumbent farms in the ten initial size cohorts through two successive censuses, determine differences in growth rates, levels of diversification, and industry exit rates.\nWe also track new entrants to determine their similarity to incumbent firms.\nWe address the first question about whether farms are converging to an equilibrium size by examining the relationship between initial cohort size and the mean growth rate of each incumbent cohort. We conduct our analysis for the five-year period between the 1992 and 1997\ncensuses and for the 10-year period between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. 3 This relationship provides inferential evidence concerning whether farms are converging to an equilibrium size.\nPositive growth of a cohort's mean size indicates that, on average, farms in the cohort are likely operating under increasing returns to scale and/or scope. Farms in cohorts that are growing the most rapidly are likely to be among the most effective in reaping these economies.\nWe also examine the first question statistically by testing whether incumbent farms have grown in accordance with Gibrat's law (Sutton 1997) To address the questions about increasing diversification, we separate farms in each census into five sales categories. These categories differ by the percentage of the farm's total agricultural sales in its primary commodity sales category. 4 For corn and wheat farms, the sales classification is based on sales of grain, oilseeds, dry beans, and dry peas; for apple farms, it is based on sales of fruit, tree nuts, and berries; and for beef farms, it is based on sales of cattle and calves. 5 The five sales categories are 90% or greater, 75-89.9%, 50-74.9%, 25-49.9%, and less than 25% of sales from the primary commodity sales category of total agricultural sales, exclusive of any government payments.\nWe calculate a weighted measure of specialization (the converse of diversification) for each cohort by multiplying the share of the cohort's farms in each sales category by the midpoint of the sales percentile range\nR and then sum across sales categories . i\nThis measure represents an approximation to the cohort's weighted share of total agricultural income from sales of the primary commodity group. 6 Higher percentage values indicate higher dependence on the primary commodity group's sales, greater output specialization, and lower output diversification."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use longitudinal data from the Census of Agriculture in 1992, 1997, and 2002 . Based on the Census Farm Number (CFN) and Personal Operation Identification System (POIDS) codes, we track most individual farms through subsequent censuses based on the legal entity for tax purposes. Except for retired and residential/lifestyle farmers, the sample includes all farms for which the owner checked farming as his/her main occupation and had at least 100 harvested grain to cattle was 24% higher in 1997 than in 1992. By 2002, it dropped to just 10% higher. Our assessment of the magnitude of diversification for beef in 1997 will therefore be biased upward relative to diversification for wheat and corn, particularly in 1997. However, it turns out that our qualitative conclusions are unaffected. 5 Since the Census survey did not record revenues for our four individual commodities, we used the closest sale groups as proxies. 6 Unlike the Herfindahl and entropy measures of diversification which use sales from several enterprises within one farm and measure spread across these several enterprises (e.g. Sumner and Wolf 2002) , our measure only uses sales from the primary enterprise.\nacres of corn or wheat, 5 acres of apples, or 20 beef cows, in the 1992 Census of Agriculture.\nThe sample covers 90% of all corn acreage, 93% of wheat acreage, 95% of apple acreage, and 88% of all beef cattle and calf numbers in the nation. In this paper we use the terms wheat, corn, apple, and beef farms for inter-industry comparison. They represent all farms defined by these census criteria.\nFor each commodity, we rank farms in the 1992 Census of Agriculture based on their value of agricultural sales, exclusive of government payments. 7 These farms constitute our initial ten cohorts. New farm entrants in 1997 that meet the 1992 selection criteria constitute our 11 th cohort, which we follow through the 2002 census. Similarly, we include new farm entrants in 2002 as our 12 th cohort. 8 We compute summary statistics for each cohort in each census to determine changes in size distribution characteristics of farms over time. They include: (1) number of farms, (2) mean size, (3) median size, (4) size range, (5) size standard deviation, (6) size skewness, (7) size kurtosis, (8) number of exiting farms, and (9) portion of farms in each of the four sales categories.\nTo permit valid calculations of farm growth between the 1992 census and each later census, agricultural receipts are deflated by the index of prices received. Corn, wheat, apple and beef sales are deflated by the indexes of prices received for feed grains and hay, food grains, fruit and nuts, and meat animals, respectively. The remaining agricultural sales are deflated by the index of prices received for all farm products (USDA 2001 (USDA , 2005 .\nWe report the first two moments, the median and approximate range of the 1992 farm size distribution of each cohort for each commodity in Table 1 . A large number of farms in each of the four industries were relatively small operations, selling less than $100,000 worth of agricultural commodities. While less than half of all corn and wheat farms can be considered small operations, half of apple farms and 70% of beef farms fell into this category. For all commodities, cohorts 1-9 had medians that were very similar to their means, and they had small standard deviations. In each case, the standard deviation for cohort 10 was much larger than the others because its range was open-ended. The median and mean values for cohort 10 were also very different for each commodity, suggesting that this cohort was right-skewed, containing some very large farms.\nWe also report the median, and range width of the 1997 and 2002 farm size distributions for each incumbent cohort in Table 2 . Medians were substantially different than the means in all cohorts for each commodity. The standard deviations were also large and many increased over time. Along with the range width, these statistics indicate that the size distribution of farms in each incumbent cohort became highly asymmetric and dispersed over time. For each of the first nine cohorts, size heterogeneity of farms increased over time because a few farms experienced substantial growth. In fact, except for apples, a number of farms in every cohort grew enough to be within the range of the largest cohort in successive censuses."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Firm Growth", "text": "Corn and wheat farms grew less rapidly than apple and beef farms (See Figure 2) . However, farms did not maintain a constant growth rate over the ten-year period in any of the industries.\nIn general, farms grew less rapidly between 1997 and 2002 than between 1992 and 1997, making the 10-year average growth rate lower than the 5-year average growth rate. The growth rates for incumbent apple and beef farms slowed the most between 1997 and 2002.\nThe growth rate distribution across cohorts was very similar for corn, wheat, and beef farms.\nThe most rapid growth occurred in the smallest cohort, and the slowest growth occurred in the largest cohort (see Figure 3) . This pattern applied to both time intervals. Additionally, as noted above, the magnitude of growth rates decreased for all cohorts for each of the three commodities over the ten-year period relative to the five-year period.\nDespite having some similarities to the growth rate patterns of the other three commodities, farms in the apple industry followed a different path, with most of the differences occurring at the upper end of the farm size distribution. In particular, the largest farms did not grow the slowest in this industry. Instead, farms in cohort 7, for example, grew more slowly than those in cohort 10 in both periods.\nFor all commodities, the growth rate was strongly and negatively correlated with cohort number over both periods. With the exception of the apple cohorts, all cohorts grew at a more rapid rate than the next larger cohort over each time interval. Correlation coefficients between the growth rate and the cohort number ranged from -0.85 to -0.93 for corn, wheat, and beef farms in both the five and ten year periods. Although a little lower (approximately -0.70), the correlation coefficients for the apple industry were also negative for each period.\nThe estimated parameters for equation (1) are reported in Table 3 for each commodity and time interval. The parameter estimate associated with the annual growth rates for each time interval was negative for each commodity. With the exception of the wheat and apple equations for the ten-year period, the growth parameter estimate was significant at the 5% level. Thus, we fail to reject the hypothesis of mean reversion for either time interval for corn and beef and for the five-year period for wheat and apples. Additionally, we fail to reject the hypothesis of random walk growth implied by Gibrat's law for the ten-year time interval for both wheat and apple farms.\nBased on our findings from the cohort growth patterns and the statistical tests for all four commodities, we can answer the first question and provide inference about equilibrium size in each industry. First, they show the mean size of the largest cohort grew less rapidly over the 5-year and 10-year periods than the mean size of nearly all other cohorts. We therefore conclude that the answer to the first question is \"No\": the largest farms do not grow as rapidly as mediumsized farms. Second, they provide evidence for all commodities in the five-year period and for corn and beef in the ten-year period that cost economies diminish with size and suggest that a stable steady-state equilibrium does exist. Only in the case of wheat and apples for the ten-year period do the size distributions appear to follow a random walk with no stable steady-state equilibrium. Thus, we can clearly rule out the hypothesis that \"larger farms grow relatively faster than smaller farms\" for all four industries. We also find considerable evidence to support the hypothesis that a steady-state equilibrium exists for two of these four industries (corn and beef) but the support is dependent on time interval for wheat and apples."}, {"section_title": "Firm Size and Diversification", "text": "Farms in the sample varied greatly by the percent of agricultural income generated by the respective commodity group. Recall that we use the commodity group's weighted share of agricultural income, , from equation (2) as a proxy for specialization, i.e., the converse of diversification. Specialization differences are examined both among cohorts and between time intervals, the results of which are summarized in Table 4 k D Apple farms were the most specialized in each census while beef farms were generally the least specialized. On average, our sample of apple farms generated about 80% of their agricultural revenue from the sale of fruit, tree nuts, and berries in 1992 while beef farms received only 44% of their agricultural revenue from the sale of cattle and calves. Grain farms received 63-65% of their agricultural revenue from the sale of grains, oilseeds, dry beans, and dry peas in 1992. Over the ten-year period, both wheat and apple farms became less specialized while corn and beef farms became more specialized in their source of agricultural revenues."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "In addition, the level of specialization varied by cohort level. In 1992, the 10 th cohort (containing the largest farms) was the least specialized for each of the four commodities. It remained the least specialized in each census for all commodities except apples. The most specialized cohort, however, varied by commodity and census. For corn and beef, it was generally one of the smaller cohorts; for wheat and apples, it was generally one of the mid-sized cohorts.\nThe relationship between farm size and the degree to which the farm relied on its primary output is also apparent from the correlation coefficients. In the case of grain and beef farms, the generally large negative correlation coefficients document a clear tendency among these farms toward less specialization as farm size increases. This tendency became stronger over time for beef but weaker for grain, especially wheat for which the correlation coefficient approached zero in 2002. For apple farms, the positive correlation in 1997 and 2002 indicates a tendency toward more specialization as farm size increases.\nOur findings concerning temporal changes in specialization for the four industries answer the second research question, Do farms become more diversified over time? They show that only wheat and apple farms become more diversified over time. We therefore conclude that the 9 The results in Table 4 indicate that beef farms became much more specialized in 2002. However, the survey questions that defined degree of specialization changed for beef farms in the 2002 Census of Agriculture. Consequently, our conclusion about beef farms is subject to the possibility of measurement error due to the change in the way the questions were formulated. There was little change in level of specialization on beef farms between the 1992 and 1997 censuses.\nanswer to the second question is \"Yes\" for wheat and apples, but \"No\" for the corn and beef industries.\nConsequently, the third question, whether larger farms diversify more rapidly than mediumsized farms, only applies to wheat and apple farms since corn and beef farms became more specialized. In order to answer this question, we first organized cohorts into small, medium and large farm groups. We classified farms in cohorts with less than approximately $100,000 in 1992 agricultural sales as small farms, those with $100,000 -$300,000 in sales as medium-sized farms, and those with sales above $300,000 in sales as large farms. The cohorts which fall into each class are reported in Table 5 . We then used the medium and large farms' specialization indices to compute rates of change in specialization coefficient over time (see Table 4 ). In each case, the relative decrease in specialization (when it occurred) was less for large farms than for medium-sized farms. Thus, larger farms do not appear to diversify more rapidly than mediumsized farms for either wheat or apple farms."}, {"section_title": "Firm Entry and Exit", "text": "The distribution of new entrants was very different than the distribution of incumbent farms and varied between censuses (see Table 6 ).

Also, we did not track their sales separately from the cohort's incumbents.\nentrants were very large. In fact, in 1997 their median size was smaller than the overall median size of all incumbent farms in the corresponding industry, falling between the median sizes of incumbent cohorts 3 and 4. The median size of 2002 new entrants was closer to the overall median size of all incumbent farms, falling between cohorts 4 and 7.\nBetween the 1992 and 1997 censuses, more new farms entered each industry than exited.\nOnly small grain and medium-sized apple farms had approximately the same number of entering and exiting farms. The correlations between the exit/entry ratio and cohort number were highly negative for corn and wheat, close to zero for apples, and positive for beef (Table 7) .\nOver the 10-year period, with the exception of small beef operations and large corn farms, there were more exiting than entering farms of all sizes in each industry. This imbalance was most apparent for wheat farms -more than four times as many farms exited wheat production as entered this industry. Also, more than twice as many large beef farms exited the industry as entered. The correlations between exit/entry ratio and cohort number suggest that the number of exiting farms relative to the entering farms decreases with size in the corn and wheat industries, but increases with size in the beef industry.\nAdditionally, new entrants between 1992 and 1997 were more specialized than were all incumbents (see Table 4 ). With the exception of beef, at least 70% of total agricultural sales came from the sale of the primary commodity. Apple entrants were the most specialized and beef entrants were the least specialized in 1997 with 85% and 51% of their total agricultural income coming from the sale of the primary commodity, respectively. Corn, wheat, and apple entrants in 1997 became less specialized by the 2002 census. New entrants in the apple industry between 1997 and 2002 were also the most specialized among the four industries and were more specialized than any incumbent apple cohort.

The similarities in structural changes previously observed at the industry level for many agricultural commodities (Gray and Boehlje 2007; Morrison-Paul et al. 2004; Mafoua 2002) do not appear to hold at the farm level. Our inferential evidence of scale and scope economies was considerably different between these industries and the dairy industry.\nScale economies diminished with size for each of the four industries while they increased with size for dairy farms. Large dairy farms grew faster than medium-sized farms while large grain, apple, and beef farms grew more slowly than medium-sized farms. This suggests that, unlike dairies, the size of farms in some of these industries is approaching an equilibrium and this equilibrium is generally stable.\nThe extent of scope economies also varied substantially among industries. Scope economies were evident in the dairy industry as farms of all sizes became much more diversified. Our findings suggest that the corn and beef industries did not exhibit evidence of scope economies while the wheat and apple industries did. Like the dairy industry, the evidence of scope economies in the wheat and apple industries was greater for medium-sized than for large farms."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The purpose of this study was to assess evidence of scale and scope economies for four major agricultural industries using longitudinal agricultural census data between 1992 and 2002. They have become more consolidated as the total number of farms decreased while the number of large farms producing each commodity increased in each of these industries. Consequently, production has become more concentrated in each industry.\nWe conclude that scale economies diminish with size for each of these four industries. Large corn, wheat, apple, and beef farms all grew slower than medium-sized and small farms. This suggests that their size distribution is approaching a steady-state equilibrium. This statement holds inferentially for all four commodities. However, based on our statistical hypothesis tests, only the size distribution of corn and beef farms is approaching a steady state equilibrium while the others are following a random walk. In each industry, new entrants were larger on average than the incumbents, but the size of new entrants showed high variability.\nAlso, based on evidence that it became more specialized over time, we conclude that the corn industry does not exhibit scope economies. Scope economies were apparent in the apple industry and to a lesser extent in the wheat industry. They were greater for larger than for medium-sized farms. A growing number of apple and wheat producers are making the strategic decision of becoming less dependent on production of fruit and grain, respectively, in favor of other agricultural outputs. Large farms remain less specialized than medium-sized farms.\nHowever, the rate of diversification over time was highest among medium-sized producers.\nSmall farms in all four industries remained more specialized than larger farms.\nThere were more exits than new entrants in all industries over the ten-year period from 1992 to 2002, particularly evident in the wheat industry. The relationship between industry exit/entry ratio and farm size, however, was industry specific. The ratio increased with size in the beef industry while it decreased with size in the corn and wheat industries. In the apple industry, there was no apparent relationship between industry exit/entry ratio and farm size.\nThese findings have important decision-making implications for producers of these commodities. The diminishing scale economies in these four industries suggest that larger producers might avoid diseconomies of scale and reduce potential inefficient production by approaching expansion cautiously. The dominance of scope economies over scale economies for large apple and wheat farms suggests that large farmers in these two industries could grow more efficiently by pursuing output diversification. Alternatively, corn producers of all sizes have little incentive to pursue greater diversification given their current technologies.\nThese findings also have important decision-making implications for policy makers, but implications of a rather benign nature. Unlike the dairy industry in which policy intervention may ultimately be needed to promote competitiveness because the largest farms are growing at the fastest rate, the evidence suggests little need for such policies in these industries. 1992 1997 2002 1992 1997 2002 1992 1997 2002 1992 1997 -0.98 -0.94 -0.85 -0.84 -0.61 -0.02 0.01 0.69 0.56 -0.90 -0.93 -0.98 Large farms 9-10 9-10 9-10 10 "}, {"section_title": "Coefficient", "text": ""}]
