They have the advantage of capturing clearly the direction of the knowledge transfers. Their presence in the theoretical model leads to a reduced-form spatial cross-regressive model which differentiates better the role of each type of externality -and displays a better goodness of fit -than the spatially lagged model where spillovers depend on geographical proximity only. Both models are estimated on spatial panel data covering the dynamics of innovation across US states over the 1986-1999 period.

While most of the Ricardian studies assume no interaction between the geographical units under study, the few that do rely on traditional proximity-based dependence. In this paper we argue that since the larger share of agricultural goods produced by a state is not for its own local market, including interregional trade in the Ricardian framework provides new perspectives, avoids a missing variable bias and prevents erroneous conclusions. Our new framework is applied to the system of the U.S. states over the four most recent censuses (1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012) and demonstrate that climate and socio-economic conditions experienced in a state's trade partners have a significant role on that state's local farmland values. CHAPTER 1 META-ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN UNION STRUCTURAL FUNDS ON REGIONAL GROWTH"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the European Union, every programming period sees around 1/3 of the budget devoted to various regional cohesion policies. Since their implementation in the 1970's, a large set of studies measure their impact on the economy of the recipient localities, regions, and countries. They are selected because of their low levels of relative per capita GDP, high unemployment rate, low density, and recessive industry. While some contributions in the academic literature are generally supportive of the continuation of such policies (e.g. CAPPELEN et al., 2003;ESPOSTI and BUSSOLETTI, 2008), others cast doubts about their actual efficacy (e.g. DALL'ERBA and LE GALLO, 2008; and some estimates of LE GALLO, 2007, andof BOUAYAD-AGHA et al., 2011), highlight their conditional efficacy (e.g. EDERVEEN et al., 2002EDERVEEN et al., , 2006RODRIGUEZ-POSE and FRATESI, 2004;DALL'ERBA and LE GALLO, 2007), or conclude that they act negatively on growth (FAGERBERG and VERSPAGEN, 1996; and some estimates of PUIGCERVER-PE\u00d1ALVER, 2007, andof BOUAYAD-AGHA et al., 2011). Understanding what factors explain the differences in the estimated impact of regional policies and whether actual practical changes can be implemented is especially important now that sluggish economic growth among European Union members and recent rounds of bailouts have undermined the availability of public funding for regional cohesion purposes. This paper relies on a literature that econometrically estimates the regional growth impact of structural funds and identifies the sources of heterogeneity in the estimated impact. The focus is solely on econometric studies for homogeneity purposes. Moreover, some other papers are not considered because they do not rely on a sufficiently homogenous definition of the funds (e.g. they use proxy or dummies). As a result, the metadatabase is composed of 17 manuscripts offering 323 estimates in total. The meta-analysis framework was first introduced by GLASS (1976). It has the capacity to combine the results of several existing studies and summarize their outcome. In addition, it controls for differences/similarities within and between studies and identifies whether the former come from sampling (e.g. size and time period of the sample) or non-sampling (e.g. estimation process and regressors used) characteristics. Estimation takes place in the frame of metaregressions which measure the role of the study characteristics by explaining the differences among study outcomes. Hence it allows a more complete picture of an existing literature than traditional qualitative or narrative approaches. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 begins with a short description of the theory commonly used to measure the impact of EU structural funds. It continues with a description of some of the econometric challenges met in this literature. Section 3 reports the way the primary estimates have been collected from the existing literature. Section 4 presents the meta-regression models as well as the selected moderators. Section 5 reports the estimation results and discusses the factors that significantly affect the magnitude of the estimated impact of the funds. In addition, an ordered probit model uncovers the factors that influence the probability of estimating a significantly positive return of the funds. Finally, section 6 concludes.\nA number of recent contributions (e.g. Corrado and Fingleton, 2012;Pinske and Slade, 2010;McMillen, 2012) has called for more attention to two intrinsically related and recurrent issues in spatial econometrics. The first one deals with the common use of diagnostic and goodness-of-fit tests to determine the appropriate form of spatial autocorrelation. We will demonstrate in this chapter that spatially explicit reduced form models can be derived from substantive economic theory when the spatial processes at work are motivated theoretically and can be directly embedded in the foundations of the model. A previous application of this approach can be seen in Ertur and Koch (2007), Fischer (2011) and Dall'erba and Llamosas-Rosas (2014) who study the role of interregional knowledge externalities in a Cobb-Douglas production function of regional income dynamics. This chapter focuses on a different application, namely the regional knowledge production function (henceforth KPF) derived from Griliches (1979) for which, to our knowledge, no prior extension of this sort is available. The second challenge relates to the W matrix of spatial weights being almost consistently based on some degree of geographical proximity as if the strength of interregional interactions were to depend on that factor only (Fingleton and Le Gallo, 2008). While geographical distance is unambiguously exogeneous, it does not change with time nor allow to identify clearly the direction of the flows or their asymmetric nature. As a result, some contributions have proposed alternatives such as, among many others, the transportation cost (e.g. Conley and Ligon, 2002), economic distance (Fingleton, 2001(Fingleton, , 2008LeSage and Pace, 2008), or technological proximity (Parent and LeSage, 2008) across regions. These specifications permit the relative distance between any pair of regions to be asymmetric, but the direction of the transactions is still missing and they only offer a proxy of the actual interregional flows. As such, in this chapter we prefer to work with a W based on observed flows (such as Eliste andFredriksson, 2004, andChen andHaynes, 2014, who use trade flows, or , who rely on flows of patent creation-citation respectively) that evolve over time, are measured in the past to guarantee their exogeneity and, more importantly, support theory. In order to illustrate how to implement these increasingly popular directions in the field of spatial econometrics, this chapter offers to reconsider the traditional theoretical development of the regional KPF and provides an application to the measurement of interregional knowledge spillovers across U.S. states. While the large majority of empirical evaluations of the KPF are performed at the firm level (such as David et al., 2000;Cefis and Orsenigo, 2001;Cho et al., 2008), a growing number of studies evaluate it at the regional level (Audretsch and Feldman, 1996;Crescenziet al., 2007;Rodriguez-Pose, 2001; Acs and Armington, 2004;Adams, 2002;\u00d3 hUallach\u00e1in and Leslie, 2007;Sonn and Park, 2011;Anselin et al., 1997). This trend is, in part, motivated by the concern that regional economies have to compete nationally and internationally to attract the factors at the origin of innovation and maintain their technological edge over their competitors. Among the studies focusing on knowledge production at the regional level, the investigation of knowledge spillovers has received an increasing amount of attention. Knowledge spillovers take place when firms, industries, or regions benefit from the knowledge created by other firms, industries or regions without bearing the cost associated to its creation (Fischer et al. 2009). While the role of spillovers in knowledge creation has been well documented in the theoretical literature (Marshall, 1920;Jacobs, 1969;Jaffe, 1986;Glaeser et al., 1992;Fung and Chow, 2002;Asheim and Isaksen 2002;Henderson, 2003), their appropriate measurement remains a challenge. For instance, a large amount of knowledge spillovers takes place through face-to-face interactions (Jaffe, 1986;Jaffe et al., 1993;Audretsch and Feldman, 1996;Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2001;) and this process is not documented clearly. We do not know how often nor where the agents of one company meet agents from another company to exchange ideas. As a result, regional KPF often deal with this type of undocumented spillovers as if they are limited spatially. Empirical evidence confirms this point. For example, Jaffe et al. (1993) find that patents produced in one state are more likely to be cited within the same state. At the same time, other contributions indicate that knowledge spillovers may well reach companies located beyond the boundaries of the locality they originate from. This statement is in line with Anselin et al. (1997) who uncover that university research leads to innovation in high technology companies located within the same region and in neighboring ones. The previous study is the first one to have used the formal tools of spatial econometrics to measure these spillovers. Many more have followed since then with applications to many different areas of the world. For instance, Bode (2004) highlights the role of interregional knowledge spillovers in West Germany while Parent and LeSage (2008) do so for all the European regions. Several other studies focus on the system of the US regional economies, as we do in this paper. Among them, Parent (2012) examines the determinants of growth in state-level patents using a dynamic space-time model and a panel data sample covering 49 US states over the 1994-2005 period. Mukherji and Silberman (2013) demonstrate that a metropolitan area's ability to absorb external knowledge has a positively significant impact on its innovation capacity. Previous studies define interregional interactions based on geographical proximity. As an attempt to address the more general and more appropriate intellectual interactions among regions, Jaffe (1986)  This approach has been used first by  who analyze 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and conclude that the proportion of local citations has increased over the 1975-1999 period. However, when  extend this matrix to all the US counties and to a more recent period (1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999), they conclude that on average patents created in remote locations (more than 50 miles away) have a greater role on a county's patenting activities than patents created locally (less than 50 miles away). Miguelez et al. (2010) focus on 269 European NUTS2 regions. Their results indicate that distant knowledge spillovers can take place through additional mechanisms, such as market transactions (e.g., the purchase of knowledge services from specialists, the purchase of knowledge products from suppliers and labour mobility), the monitoring of competitors, through foreign direct investments and firm spin-offs. However, we are not aware of a study measuring the role of these flows in the interregional innovation system of the US. One type of knowledge flow that has been disregarded in the regional KPF literature is the spillovers of human capital embodied in the migration of highly-skilled workers. Yet, some articles have already highlighted the contribution of mobile inventors on the diffusion of knowledge across firms or regions. The phenomenon has mostly been studied in the context of international migrants coming to the US. For example, Kerr (2013) points out that highly-skilled immigrants account for about 25 percent of the workers in the most innovative and entrepreneurial U.S. industries, and they are responsible for a somewhat similar share of output measures like patents or firm start-ups. Chellaraj et al. (2005) find that both international graduate students and skilled immigrants have a significant and positive impact on future patent applications as well as on future patents awarded to university and non-university institutions. More precisely, a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign graduate students would raise patent applications by 4.7 percent, university patent grants by 5.3 percent, and non-university patent grants by 6.7 percent. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no previous contribution has examined the role of the internal migration of the highly-skilled workers on innovation differentials across US regions. This paper intends to fill this gap. \nThe attention generated by the impact of the Summer 2012 drought on the Corn Belt exemplifies how vital it is for the US agricultural sector to understand climate change and how to mitigate and/or adapt to it. While there is little controversy about whether agriculture is sensitive to changes in climatic conditions, significant uncertainty exists with respect to future climate's impact on agriculture. It is anticipated that some regions will be winners and others losers, but it is still unclear whether climate change will bring a net gain or a net loss for the US agriculture as a whole (Adams, 1989;Mendelsohn et al., 1994;Desch\u00eanes and Greenstone, 2007), as production currently spans a variety of climate zones over all the lower 48 states and occupies up to 42% of US territory. Among the studies of climate impacts on US agriculture, three types of models can be identified. The first is the crop growth simulation model (e.g. Nordhaus, 1991;Tol, 1995;Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999;Nelson et al., 2009) which is based on agronomic (biophysical) models and focuses on simulating crop growth over the life cycle of a plant exposed to the full range of weather outcomes including extreme events. The second type of model uses standard econometric techniques to estimate the impact of climate and other exogenous inputs (such as soil quality) on one type of crop (e.g. McCarl et al., 2008;Lobell et al., 2008;and Schlenker and Roberts, 2009). Finally, the third theoretical framework called the Ricardian approach and initiated by Mendelsohn et al. in 1994 offers a different approach in that it explicitly account for adaptation. Landowners, well aware of their local production conditions, are expected to allocate their land to the most rewarding use. This framework has attracted much attention when analyzing the US agricultural sector (e.g. Schlenker et al., 2005Schlenker et al., , 2006Desch\u00eanes and Greenstone, 2007;Dall'erba and Dominguez, 2015), partly because decisions on which crop to plant, how much of each input to use and what tillage/management technique to adopt are determined endogenously and will reflect in the value of farmland or agricultural profits, the usual dependent variables in a Ricardian regression framework (Kelly et al., 2005). In this paper, we follow the latter approach for several reasons. First, empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that adaptation at the farm level is already taking place in the US. The 1996 report of Schimmelpfennig et al. indicates that \"some of the alternatives considered are adoption of later maturing cultivars, change of crop mix, and a timing shift of field operations to take advantage of longer growing seasons\". Adaptation does not limit itself to crop-producers. Schimmelpfennig et al. (1996) report that \"the growth of dairy in the South is a testament to the creativity of farmers in finding ways to cool animals in hot climates (for example, shading, wetting, circulating air, and air conditioning). Other adaptations include herd reduction in dry years, shifting to heat-resistant breeds, and replacing cattle with sheep\". Furthermore, the crop production approach treats each crop individually when crops are actually mutually dependent through factors such as crop rotation (practiced for 85% of the corn and 75% of the wheat of the US over 1990, Padgitt et al., 2000 or access to inputs (land, water, fertilizers, and government subsidies) whether they share the latter or compete for them. Finally and more importantly for this current paper, the recognition that trade is going to act as an adaptation mechanism to climate change is growing (Julia and Duchin, 2007;Stephan and Schenker, 2012;Schenker, 2013;Zhang et al., 2014). Indeed, short-run production losses following a sudden drought or a flood for instance can be substituted for imports. Moreover, long-run climate changes should lead the production of some agricultural products to shift to countries which will then experience a competitive advantage compared to current producers. Our paper offers important contributions to this literature for several reasons. First, while the contributions above have all focused on trade at the international level, ours focuses on the system of the US states only so that the traditional trade barriers can be ignored. Second, in spite of the growing spatial econometric literature that emphasizes the role of spatial dependence in the crop production function or Ricardian framework (Polsky, 2004;Seo, 2008;Lippert et al., 2009), dependence is always limited to geographical proximity. We argue that trade flows are more appropriate as they capture more substantive forms of dependence and their intensity and direction vary for each pair of partners. Third, we develop the reduced-form spatial model directly from theory instead of relying on the usual Lagrange Multiplier tests of Anselin et al. (1996) to select the right spatial model. Last but not least, we control for the role of spatial heterogeneity by relying on a nested hierarchical structure whereby the climate zones the US states belong to are explicitly modeled. It allows us to generate consistent estimates (Greene, 2000) and to account for within-group and between-group interactions (Moulton, 1986). A hierarchical approach is also used in Overmars and Verburg (2006) when considering field-level and village-level data or in Van Cauwenbergh et al. (2007) who deal with parcel-, farm-and landscape/region/state-level data when assessing agricultural systems sustainability. In the literature quoted earlier, the focus has primarily been on generating different coefficient estimates by groups to model spatial heterogeneity (Schlenker et al., 2005, split counties by irrigation level while Dall'erba and Dominguez, 2015, split them by elevation). In order to shed new lights on the role of agricultural trade across US states in a Ricardian model of climate change, we start in section 2 with a review of the literature using spatial econometric techniques to deal with spatial dependence. We develop a theoretical Ricardian model with trade in section 3 where the data used for our empirical work is also described. Section 4 focuses on the estimation of the reduced-form spatial model and the interpretation of its results. Finally, section 5 summarizes the results and provides some concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "Growth theories and econometric methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Theories", "text": "Three strands of economic growth theory are commonly used to understand the role of public investments in stimulating growth. The traditional approach is the neoclassical growth framework that relies on the assumptions of decreasing returns to capital and constant and exogenous rate of technological progress. Structural funds correspond to public investments allocated to a capital scarce region, hence they increase the growth rate of the recipient area which experiences faster convergence towards its steady-state level but for a short period of time only . The growth rate does not change in the long-run due to the decreasing nature of the returns to capital. This holds true with investments in human capital as well (MANKIW et al., 1992). In this framework, only changes in the exogenous rate of technological progress modify the steady-state growth rate. The second strand of the literature, the endogenous growth theory, is based on the assumptions of constant returns to capital (at the regional level), endogenous technological progress and local externalities. It assumes that new investments in public capital increase the marginal product of private capital. This fosters capital accumulation and growth in the recipient region in the long-run (ROMER, 1990;ASCHAUER, 1989). However, the empirical paradox pinpointed by JONES (1995aJONES ( , 1995b according to which total factor productivity remains constant in spite of new expenditure in R&D and human capital has given birth to the semi-endogenous growth theory (JONES, 1995b). Based on the idea of decreasing returns to scale in the production of knowledge, these models assume that total factor productivity growth depends on the exogenous growth rate of the population because it determines the R&D employment growth rate. Neither the neoclassical nor the endogenous growth theories are specific enough about the type of public capital that is funded, yet the largest share of structural funds (around 1/3) finances transportation infrastructures. They reduce transportation costs, hence they have consequences on the economic growth of the recipient regions in ways that cannot be captured in any of the previous growth theories. As such, the third strand of economic growth theory, namely the new economic geography (KRUGMAN, 1991;, has generated increasing interest. In this framework, new transportation infrastructures lead to different degrees of improvement in accessibility and economic development in the region(s) where they are implemented (VICKERMAN et al., 1999). When new (interregional) transportation infrastructures connect regions of different levels of income, companies and workers may delocate from the poor region to the rich one to benefit from agglomeration economies (KRUGMAN, 1991). This process can be self-reinforcing when the presence of localized technology spillovers is conducive to growth as indicated in the models of BALDWIN et al. (2004) who combine new economic geography and endogenous growth theories. In addition, since interregional transportation infrastructures are more often the rule than the exception in Europe, they will increase the accessibility of several regions, but the gains they generate will always be relatively higher in the richest one (VICKERMAN et al., 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Econometric methods", "text": "In spite of these three strands of economic growth theory, the empirical literature of interest here relies almost exclusively on the neoclassical beta-convergence model \u00e0 la BARRO AND SALA-I- MARTIN (1991). This feature is an advantage in a meta-analysis as it makes the estimates of the primary studies homogeneous conceptually. Specifically, the (cross-section) model most commonly used in the literature to measure the elasticity of the funds derives from the beta-convergence model specified in MANKIW et al. (1992, p. 423) but with variations in the number and specification of the regressors: (ln( ) \u2212 ln ( 0 )) = + 0 ln( 0 ) + 1 ln( ) + 2 ln( + + ) where the dependent variable is the annual growth rate of per capita GDP in region i over the period t0 -T, 0 is the initial level of per capita GDP, s is the average gross domestic savings rate, n is the population growth rate, is the exogenous rate of technological progress, is the rate of depreciation, X is a matrix of additional variables that maintain the steady state of each economy constant and SF stands for the structural funds. is the error term with the usual properties. Most studies report a significant negative estimate of 0 which validates the convergence assumption brought to the fore by the neoclassical growth model. This paper focuses on the effect size of the average annual growth rate with respect to structural funds, i.e. the coefficient 4 . Note that one gets a different marginal effect when an interaction term is added to specification (1). For instance, when EDERVEEN et al. (2006) evaluate whether the funds are conditionally effective on the quality of the institutions that rule the recipient region, they add a term such as 5 * to the regressors of equation (1). The marginal effect then becomes / = 4 + 5 . In this situation, the effect at the mean of the interacted term is measured when possible (e.g. the mean of 'institutions' in the case above). While most of the studies measure the variables in the matrix X at the initial time period to prevent endogeneity, the funds are sometimes measured over the growth period. This leads to a problem of reverse causality as the funds are partially allocated based on past relative levels of regional per capita income (DALL'ERBA and LE GALLO, 2008). The more recent studies in the database have dealt with this issue by using past levels of structural funds (such as MOHL and HAGEN, 2010), instrumental variables (such as in DALL'ERBA and LE GALLO, 2008;) or ARELLANO and BOND's (1991) estimator (ESPOSTI and BUSSOLETTI, 2008). Differences in the treatment of endogeneity among primary studies will be treated in section 5 of this paper. As access to structural funds data has become more available, several authors have decided to assess the impact of the funds in the frame of a panel data model. Such a specification provides them with more information and data variability. This allows control over unobserved heterogeneity and reduces problems of collinearity among the expanatory variables. No panel-data study uses a random effect approach which, in the frame of a neoclassical growth model, implies that the individual effects are correlated with some regressors. This would lead to endogeneity (ESPOSTI and BUSSOLETTI, 2008). Increasing interest in new economic geography and advances in the field of spatial econometrics have led four studies to investigate the impact of the funds on both the targeted regions and on their neighbors LE GALLO, 2007, 2008;BOUAYAD-AGHA et al., 2011;MOHL and HAGEN, 2010). It allows them to proxy for interregional backward and forward linkages, technology spillovers, commuting across regions, and to refute the traditional assumption of independence of the error terms."}, {"section_title": "Primary studies", "text": "The collection process of the primary studies was performed to avoid missing any relevant empirical estimates and to reduce the potential biases due to any nonrandom selection. The following process was adopted: first, a search was made on the Economic Literature Index, ISI web of Knowledge and Google for any reference such as 'European growth', 'structural fund', and 'European regional cohesion'. Next, only the studies written in English were selected as the authors have limited capacity to extract information from other studies. Studies using proxies for structural funds were eliminated. The studies using dependent variables other than per capita income growth, using a theoretical framework other than the neoclassical growth model or relying on a different modeling framework were also eliminated. Some studies and measurements were also removed because they do not use the actual amounts of structural funds. For instance, some use a binary variable for recipients vs. non-recipients (BECKER et al., 2010;ESPOSTI, 2007) or use different growth regressions by eligibility status (RAMAJO et al., 2008). Here, only the measurements of ESPOSTI (2007) based on the actual allocation of the funds are kept. The latter contribution demonstrates clearly that using a dummy variable or actual expenses leads to different results. Furthermore, some estimates in PUIGCERVER-PE\u00d1ALVER (2007) were disgarded because they are based on the regional allocation of the funds relatively to the Community average. Note also that econometric studies providing local estimates, as LE GALLO et al. (2011), or focusing on the regions of one country only could not be considered since all the other studies measure the overall impact on the sample of EU regions. Studies that appear in the bibliography of the relevant articles were individually checked too. Working papers that have led to a publication have naturally been removed from the sample. It leads to a meta-database composed of 17 studies of which two had estimates calculated over a five-year growth process that needed to be adjusted to a yearly growth rate. Secondly, the functional forms needed more homogeneity. While most of the studies rely on a linear model or on a log-log model (9 and 5 articles respectively), 2 articles use a log-lin model and 1 uses a lin-log model. The latter two cases report few estimates and the semi-elasticity they represent ((\u2206 / ) \u2206 \u2044 ) or \u2206 (\u2206 / ) \u2044 ) can be transformed to an elasticity ((\u2206 / ) (\u2206 / ) \u2044 ) when the average value of X (for log-lin) or Y (for linlog) is reported. This process guarantees the completeness, homogeneity and comparability of the population under investigation, i.e., 323 estimates of the impact of structural funds on regional growth. The studies used in the metadatabase and some of the characteristics of the collected estimates appear in Table 1.1 below.

The fixed effects model assumes that the variability among the effect sizes can be fully explained by a set of moderators that account for differences in the characteristics across study i: where 1 \u2026 are the study characteristics, 1 \u2026 are the regression coefficients, is the error term andv is the estimated variance of the effect sizes collected from the primary studies, i = 1,2,\u2026,k are indices for the estimated effect sizes. In the mixed effect model the variability beyond the sampling error is derived partly from a systematic factor and partly from random sources: Both the fixed-effects and the mixed-effects models allow the true effect size and its precision to vary across regressions. However, the mixed effects model also assumes that not all heterogeneity is observable. It allows for the presence of residual heterogeneity by assuming that the underlying effects follow a normal distribution around the effects predicted by the covariates (SUTTON et al., 2000). One potential drawback of the above models is their assumption that the estimated effect sizes are independently distributed no matter what study they come from. The traditional assumption of independence can be violated when two (or more) effect size estimates come from the same study. This means they are based on the same sample of data, which introduces dependence at the sampling level but it can easily be accounted for by appropriate estimation of the sampling covariance matrix. Here, the 323 observations in the meta-analysis database are not from 323 independent studies since they are all nested within 17 studies. In order to verify if accounting for this type of dependence modifies the conclusions, the above models are complemented with a two-level hierarchical model that considers first the within-study variation and second the between-study variation (GOLDSTEIN, 2003). Following the notation used by DOMINICIS et al. (2008), the two-level hierarchical model is: where i is the individual observations nested in study j, represents the error term at measurement level,v is the estimated variance of the effect sizes from the collected studies, is the error term at the study level shared by all measurements within the same study. As in DOBSON et al. (2006), this paper finds that it would be impossible to take into account all the conditioning variables given the limited size of the sample and that several of them can be found in some individual studies only. As a result, the focus is on the most commonly used conditioning variables while differences in data and estimation characteristics are captured by dummies. Controlling for all sources of heterogeneity is anyway unnecessary as it would only capture study differences that are already taken into account in the study fixed effects of the hierarchical model. There are three classes of moderators. The first class concerns the data characteristics, which include information about: -the publication status (published or unpublished), as it may be a source of heterogeneity (EGGER et al., 1997). -the degree of freedom. -the area of study (more or less than EU12) as studies performed on a sample that excludes the Southern and East European countries generally conclude to a greater degree of cohesion and efficiency of the funds. -the type of spatial unit used (country vs. regions) as it is well-known the spatial scale used for the analysis influences the conclusions -the definition of the funds (fund/GDP vs. other) in order to differentiate the ways the primary studies normalize the allocation of the funds. -the functional form used (linear, semi-elasticity vs. elasticity) as the three forms are found in the primary studies. These two functional forms constitute the bulk of the estimates (see Table 1.1). -whether the funds are for objective 1 regions as historically the largest share of structural funds has been allocated to so-called objective 1 regions selected upon their level of per capita GDP being below 75% of the European average. -the time lag between the average allocation of the funds and the average of the growth period as several primary studies use a lag to remove potential problems of simultaneous causation and recognize that public investments do not act instantaneously on growth. -the number of years included in the allocation of the funds. Studies based on an average of several years are less sensitive to the cyclical effect of each year's allocation. -initial year of the growth period (pre-vs. post-1994). It allows us to test the existence of a structural break in the capacity of the funds to promote growth. 1994 is chosen as it corresponds to the beginning of the 1994-1999 programming period during which more than 2.5 times the previous (1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993) level of funds was allocated. -whether the study was written/published before or after the median year (2007) of the sample. This variable allows us to test whether more recent studies benefit from the experience built in the past literature. For instance, more recent studies pay a much greater degree of attention to issues of endogeneity of the funds and spatial autocorrelation than earlier studies. If not controlled for, both issues affect the magnitude and precision of the estimates. The second class of moderators concerns the estimation characteristics, that is information on the estimation methods. Distinguishing the least squares methods (OLS, GLS, LSDV) from the others (ML, GMM, 2SLS) is necessary. While OLS and ML are equivalent in most simple regressions, they are not equivalent in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. This means ML is not part of the reference group. The other two moderators in this class indicate whether instruments (IV) were used to account for the endogeneity of the funds and whether a fixed effect approach was used. As mentioned in section 2, panel data studies cannot use a random effect approach in a neoclassical growth model. Finally, the role of controlling for spatial dependence is tested as it is increasingly recognized that the funds have effects beyond the boundaries of the recipient areas. It is a dummy with value 1 when the presence of externalities and feedback effects has been accounted for by spatial econometric means in the primary study. The third class of moderators refers to the presence of regressors other than structural funds. The estimated effectiveness of the funds is also conditional upon such characteristics in the primary studies (EDERVEEN et al., 2002(EDERVEEN et al., , 2006RODRIGUEZ-POSE and FRATESI, 2004;ESPOSTI and BUSSOLETTI, 2008). They include the presence/absence of a national dummy variable, of the initial per capita GDP, of variables capturing the characteristics of the economic structure (e.g. share of workers in agriculture), employment or population, public investments or infrastructure stock, human capital or investments in education or research and development, corruption/institutional quality and the presence of an interaction term. In essence, the results will suggest that the use of the above data characteristics, estimation characteristics and moderators produce smaller/greater estimates of 4 on average in the primary studies. Except for the few continuous variables present here, the estimates can also be understood as measuring the bias that exist from excluding the associated control or choosing the alternative (in parenthesis in Table 1.2) in the primary study. Note that the interpretation of some of the above dummy variables is not necessarily the same for different studies. For example, which country-or region-specific characteristics are captured by 'Fixed effects' depends on which other regressors are already included in the primary study. Similarly, the type of IV used is conditional upon other existing regressors. However, it is impossible to account for such a large degree of heterogeneity across primary studies without compromising the degree of freedom and the quality of the estimates. Table 1.2 presents the results of the regressions for the fixed effect model (column 1) and the mixed effect model (column 2) where the 323 estimates are considered independent and for the hierarchical linear model where they are not (column 3). Indeed, the study fixed effects included in the latter model controls for differences across studies. The magnitude, sign and precision level of the estimates are comparable across all three models. The results indicate that the first significant moderator is 'publish'. It is a dummy variable that takes 1 when the primary study is published and 0 if not. The coefficient indicates that, on average, published studies report an impact that is lower than unpublished studies. The second significant moderator is 'area of study'. It is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 when the area of study is less than EU12 and 0 if not. The coefficient indicates that, on average, the impact of the funds on growth is greater in samples considering 'less than EU12' countries than in samples based on 'EU12 or more'"}, {"section_title": "Meta-regression results", "text": "countries. This result is not surprising considering that the poor regions of the Southern countries that enlarged the European Union from 9 to 12 members consumed a large share of the structural funds, yet they did not necessarily catch-up with their average national income or with the European average (DALL'ERBA and LE . While no significant difference between studies performed at the country or regional level is found, there is one between estimates based on the funds/GDP vs. any other form of normalization (funds/population or just funds). The former leads to estimates that are slightly higher on average. No significant difference due to the functional form is found, which supports our choice of working with the whole sample. The next significant moderator is 'objective 1'. It is a dummy variable that takes value 1 when the funds are explicitly allocated to objective 1 regions. The difference in the estimated impact of such funds compared to non-objective 1 funds is significant but is very small (less than 0.000). The results indicate also that the immediate impact of the funds is greater than its delayed impact although not by much. This argument is in tune with BOLDRIN and CANOVA (2001) where these authors see, at least in the first rounds of EU cohesion policies, a strategy targeted more towards shortterm income support and redistribution than long-term sustainable development. The number of years included in the allocation of the funds has no significant impact on heterogeneity. However, both the initial year of the growth period and the year of composition/publication of the primary study matter. They are dummy variables with value 1 for early periods and 0 for the more recent periods. Several factors could explain the role of the beginning of the growth period: the presence of business cycles that render the funds more efficient over some periods of time, an increase in the amounts allocated over each programming period (following the enlargement to the South, the 1994-1999 period saw a significant increase in funding for regional development compared to the past), or the presence of a 'learning effect' in the allocation and use of the funds as advanced by RODRIGUEZ-POSE and NOVAK (2013) recently. The authors justify it with a 'more appropriate expenditure of the Cohesion funds, due to a progressive shift in their expenditure priorities' as well as a 'strengthening of the principle of partnership' with local and regional authorities (p.32). The significant presence of a time trend in the year of publication or composition of the manuscript indicates a 'learning effect' too, although of a different nature. More recent studies can rely on a larger literature providing additional expertise on the topic and on the appropriate statistical techniques to pay attention to, among other, spatial autocorrelation and the endogenous nature of the funds. Both effects can affect the magnitude and the precision of the estimates. Next, this paper tests whether several estimation characteristics used in the primary studies influence the estimated impact of the funds on growth. It appears that controlling for the endogeneity of the funds leads to estimates that are lower on average. It is the only significant characteristic in the second class of moderators. Finally, the role of the regressors included in the primary studies is tested. They correspond to a dummy variable with value 1 when it is present in the primary study and 0 otherwise. Three moderators are significant at the 5% level. They are 'human capital or investment in education or R&D', 'corruption/institutional quality' and 'interaction term'. The first variable leads to an effect size that is lower on average. Its presence across many studies reflects the dominance of the augmented Solow growth model that includes the presence of a proxy for human-capital accumulation (MANKIW et al., 1992). EDERVEEN et al. (2006) is the contribution that explores the role of the second variable the most among the four studies that do so. Not surprisingly, they conclude that the effectiveness of the funds is conditional upon the level of corruption/institutional quality of the recipient area. Compared to studies that do not control for this characteristic, their estimates conclude to a lower effect size on average. Finally, when it comes to the 'interaction term', the reader should refer to the primary studies to find the exact definition of the 17 variables the funds have been interacted with in 77 cases. On average, the presence of an interaction term leads to a higher estimated impact of the funds in the primary studies. When comparing the three models, it turns out that the coefficient estimates are very similar in magnitude and precision. It is confirmed in the similarity of the models' fit values (log-likelihood, AIC and R* -the Pearson correlation test between the fitted and observed values) and can be explained by the value of 2 being zero in the mixed and hierarchical models 1 . As a result, the heterogeneity detected in the distribution of the effect sizes is entirely observable whether it comes from the differences in study design, estimation processes, moderators used in the primary studies or from the variance of the effect sizes they estimate. 1 The hierarchical model shows the same results when the studies written by the same author(s) are considered as one. There are still 323 estimates in this case but only 12 independent studies. Finally, the above models are complemented by an ordered probit model that presents the advantage of accounting for both the effect size of the dependent variable and whether it is significant or not in the primary studies (CARD et al., 2010). In this approach, the dependent variable takes on a value of 0 for the 'significant positive estimates' (when /\u221a is greater than 1.96), 1 for the 'significant negative estimates' (when /\u221a is smaller than -1.96) and 2 for the 'non-significant estimates' (when | /\u221a | is smaller than 1.96). In this model the errors are assumed to be normally distributed with variance 1 (GREENE, 2012, p. 788). The results appear in the last column of Table 1.2. All the significant and negative estimated coefficients indicate the variables that increase Prob (y=0 | x). They also decrease Prob (y=2 | x) while their impact on the middle category, Prob , is more ambiguous as described in GREENE (2012, p.789). The opposite can be said about the significant and positive estimated coefficients. The results indicate that the variables that increase the probability of a positive and significant estimated impact of the funds are the use of a functional form other than elasticity and the presence of a variable controlling for the level of 'Employment or population' in the primary study. The probability of concluding to an efficient impact of the funds is found to decrease with increasing years of lag between allocation and growth, which indicates the immediate rather than long-run impact of EU cohesion policies (BOLDRIN and CANOVA, 2001); when the funds are divided by GDP; when spatial autocorrelation is controlled for (DALL'ERBA and LE GALLO, 2008) and when the original model captures the 'economic structure' of the recipient area."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The capacity of structural funds to promote regional economic growth has been controversial for decades. Both economic theory and empirical applications are not unanimous about their role on growth; yet structural funds are an important part of the European integration project and the evaluation of their impact matters for both the recipients and the payers. This paper takes stock of the large number of studies that measure econometrically the impact of the funds on growth and select among them those that offer comparable effect sizes. It leads to 17 studies that offer 323 marginal effects. The sources of their heterogeneity is examined by means of several weighted regression models (fixed-effects model, mixed-effects model and hierarchical model). While they all assume that part of the heterogeneity is due to differences in the data characteristics, estimation methods and choice of regressors in the primary studies, they each model the variance of the omitted variables differently. Yet, they all lead to very similar estimates, which proves the robustness of the results and that all the heterogeneity detected among the effect sizes is observable. They indicate that several differences in the data characteristics are at the origin of the heterogeneity found in the primary estimates. Among them, the publication status is found to influence the size of the estimates. A 'learning effect' is also present because studies focusing on more recent years conclude to a larger impact of the funds, which suggests the way of allocating and using them has become more efficient. Furthermore, the results indicate that the differences in functional forms used in the primary studies do not have a significant impact on the size of the estimates. Controlling for endogeneity and for three types of regressors ('human capital or investment in education or R&D', 'institutional quality' and 'interaction term') in the original studies also leads to significant differences in the primary estimates. The latter are characteristics of the recipient regions that condition the effectiveness of the funds. Finally, this study complements the usual meta-analytic approach by running an ordered probit model to uncover the factors that affect the probability of estimating a significantly positive impact of the funds. To our knowledge, this endeavor had never been done before. These results suggest that future researchers working on EU regional development policies should be aware of the possible econometric bias and associated erroneous conclusions that come with their choice of study design and regressors. On the other hand, it is now clear that there are many aspects of the study such as the functional form and some estimation characteristics they should not be too worried about since they do not affect significantly the size of the estimates on average. In addition, future researchers will be able to rely on a larger literature than the first contributors to this field and this 'learning effect' has proven not negligible. Given the long-lasting interest for improving the effectiveness of the funds, future contributions should devote more attention to estimating the impact of the funds in the frame of theories and models other than the neoclassical beta-convergence model. For instance, DALL'ERBA et al. (2009) offer an approach based on an endogenous growth model but many more contributions are needed. Another exciting development in the evaluation of the funds is the use of a counterfactual methodological approach based on the regression discontinuity design as in BECKER et al. (2010) and PELLEGRINI et al. (2013. The authors build on the allocation rule of Objective 1 funds to compare the effect on the regions with a per capita GDP level just below the eligibility threshold (75% of EU average) with the per capita GDP of the regions just above since they did not get this type of funding. Last but not least, more attention could be given to locally weighted estimates of the funds as in LE GALLO et al. (2011). Their main contribution is to provide coefficient estimates for every single region, as opposed to the average impact for the entire sample, as is currently done in the literature. It helps them identify the regions where the funds have had a positive and significant impact and allows them to reconsider the 'one size fits all' approach that has dominated the allocation process and the empirical literature so far.\nThis study offers a spatial panel knowledge production function to analyze the impact of spending in private R&D, in academic R&D, as well as of knowledge spillovers on the production of innovation across US sates. Our approach brings new insights in this literature for several reasons. First, we expand the traditional theoretical knowledge production function of Griliches (1979) to include explicit knowledge externalities in it. It allows us to derive the reduced-form model from theory instead of following the usual approach by which the form of externalities is chosen ad-hoc or suggested through spatial statistics applied to the distribution of the errors. Second, in order to capture the role of interregional knowledge spillovers, we derive two specifications from theory. One controls for spillovers through pure geographical contiguity while in the other one spillovers take place through existing interregional flows of patent creation-citation and of migration of the highly educated workers. Naturally, the latter two matrices see changes in the intensity and direction of the interregional flows across years, a characteristic that has seldom been used in the spatial econometric literature in general and been completely overlooked in the regional KPF literature in particular. The specification based on a W defined on proximity leads to a spatial lag model where the direct and indirect marginal effect of the inputs (spending in academic and private R&D) corresponds for the most part to our expectations. A better model fit is obtained in the specification with Ws defined on interregional migration and patent flows. The results of the spatial cross-regressive model it leads to indicate that the current and last year's R&D expenditure at universities and colleges support local innovation while private R&D may require more time to show the same effect. Our findings indicate also that past levels of R&D in the states migrants come from benefit the state they move to thus confirming the transfer of knowledge embedded in labor migration (Almeida and Kogut, 1999). The flows of patent creation-citation lead to a more novel result by which academic R&D spending that takes place at time t-1 in the states where patents are originally created is negatively correlated with the production of innovation at time t in the states that cite these patents. While some \"free-rider\" and/or competitive behavior among the innovative agents may explain this result, it contradicts what the recent contribution of Kang and Dall'erba (2005) found. However, the latter study focuses on the U.S. counties for which the degree of industrial specialization is more often than not greater than at the state level so that the complementarity in the innovative process usually experienced at the county level could be masked by the competitive effect that takes place at the state level. This chapter, like the bulk of regional KPF literature, has focused on a sectorally aggregated scheme. While some contributions have already touched upon the sectoral KPF approach (Jaffe, 1989;Autant-Bernard and LeSage, 2011), none of them provides an estimate of the marginal effect of intra-vs. inter-sectoral spillovers by sector, rely on models derived from theory or on W matrices based on actual interregional knowledge flows. Further developments examining the interregional and sectoral nature of the transfer of knowledge are thus certainly needed."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2 ON DERIVING SPATIAL ECONOMETRIC MODELS FROM THEORY AND W FROM OBSERVATIONS-AN APPLICATION TO THE U.S. REGIONAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION FUNCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The spatial panel KPF", "text": "Our starting point is a knowledge production function (Griliches, 1979) measured for each region i at time t as follows: where 0 \u2264 1 , 2 < 1 and 1 + 2 < 1. The production of knowledge , is a function of the current state of technical knowledge  where denotes the investment rate for each type of capital while is the depreciation rate that is common to both of them. Finally, , is assumed to grow at an exogenous rate g that is similarly experienced in all locations. This assumption has been challenged by Ertur and Koch (2007), Fischer (2011) and Dall'erba and Llamosas-Rosas (2014) who propose to model the aggregate level of knowledge as follows: where the elements that compose it can be described as: -is an exogenous stock of knowledge that is shared by all entities as predicted by the neoclassical growth model Swan, 1956). -as in the endogenous growth framework (Romer, 1986;Lucas, 1988), the levels of physical and human capital per worker available in region i increase the stock of knowledge available to all firms in region i by a value 1 and 2 respectively (with 0 \u2264 1 , 2 < 1). -finally, the last term captures the knowledge externalities that originate from all the regions j (with j\u2260 i) and spill over to i (as emphasized in the new economic geography theory; Boarnet, 1998). The coefficient (0 < < 1) measures the average degree of interregional dependence. The latter term originates from the new economic geography literature. In the present paper we depart from the previous model for two important reasons: 1) while the spillovers are assumed to take place instantaneously and over pure geographical contiguity only in (2a), we pay attention here to the fact that R&D efforts do not lead instantaneously to the creation of knowledge (Griliches, 1979) so that a time lag in the input variables is needed. Moreover, 2) the spillovers of physical and human capital are assumed here to originate from two distinct sources: the flows of patent creationcitations ( , ) and the migration flows from i to j ( , ). These two elements lead to a reformulation of (2a) as follows: where P denotes the patent creation-citation weight matrix and M denotes the migration weight matrix. When we re-write equation 1ain per capita terms, we get: and applying a log transformation: ln , = ln , + 1 ln , + 2 ln \u210e , Log transformation of (2a) leads to, which in matrix format can be rewritten as: and in the case of (2b), For each region i combining (3) and (4a) and multiplying by (I \u2212 ) leads to: Whereas multiplying by (I \u2212 ) and combining (3) and (4b) for each region i leads to: Since the per capita production function has decreasing returns to scale, the output level converges to a steady state, leading to constant capital productivity in per worker terms (i.e., g). Taking this property into (5a) leads to the following equation (see appendix A for details): where spending in physical and human capital across neighboring locations is assumed to lead instantaneously to the creation of knowledge in region i. The empirical counterpart of (6a) is defined as follows: following the theoretical predictions, the following two restrictions should hold: \u2212 1 = 2 + 3 and \u2212 1 = 2 + 3 . On the other hand, equation (5b) leads to : In this specification, spending in physical and human capital in partner locations defined by the interregional flows of patent creation-citation and of migration leads to knowledge production in region i after a lag of one year. The empirical counterpart of (6b) is defined as follows: for which the following restrictions should hold: \u2212 1 = 2 + 3 ,\u2212 4 = 5 + 6 , 7 = \u2212 4 , \u2212 1 = 3 + 5 , \u2212 2 = 4 + 6 , 7 = \u2212 1 , 8 = \u2212 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Description of the data", "text": "We perform our estimation based on the 48 continental states plus Washington D.C. The primary data are county-level data from . For instance, like them we use the ratio of utility patent applications per employee in manufacturing as a proxy for the innovation output (Patent). Patent application data is used because the year when the application is made is closer to the time when knowledge is created. Patent application data comes from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO, 2010). The dataset has been used by Jaffe and Lerner (2004), Crescenzi et al. (2007), and Sonn and Park (2011). We choose the sample of patents applied between 1986 to 1999 whose The contribution of academic R&D in the creation of innovation is measured through the ratio of the aggregated expenditures at universities and colleges per employee in the manufacturing sector (h) for each year from 1986 to 1999. We prefer this variable than the usual amount of spending for education or number of workers with a high-level of education because our dependent variable is not the usual aggregated output level (as in Mankiw et al., 1992;Holtz-Eakin, 1993;Lall and Yilmaz, 2001;Garofalo and Yamarik, 2002). Instead, we measure the innovation output so that the only investments in human capital that are of relevance to us are those of which aim is innovation. Yet, not all investments in education, especially those targeting low levels of education or supporting labor force training programs are intended to yield to innovation. Furthermore, the share of graduate degree holders in the local workforce only captures the stock of readily available educated workers, not the level of investment in human capital, and even if the two concepts are closely related theoretically they can lead to different elasticities empirically (see Dall'erba and Llamosas, 2015). Secondly, not all graduate degree holders work or desire to work in innovation-producing sectors. As such, the amount of R&D spent in the academia is more closely related to our dependent variable. Institution-level microdata come from the Higher Education research and development survey produced by the National Science Foundation and are aggregated at the state level to match our sample. As obvious from equations (8a-b), three spatial weights matrices are used in our study: We use a queen contiguity weight matrix (W) in equation (8a). W indicates whether two states share a common boundary or not and it is column-standardized to be consistent with the standardization process used in the other two weight matrices: Where \u03a8 \u2022 is the sum of all elements in column . 2) We rely on the NBER US Patent Citation Data File (Hall et al., 2001) for the construction of the patent creation-citation weight matrix (P). This data file contains information about any utility patents granted between 1963 and 1999 along with the citation records associated to the 1975-1999 period. Therefore, we can construct the patent creation-patent citation relationship at the US state level. However, since a patent is usually associated with several inventors, we follow the fractional counting method proposed by Jaffe et al. (1993) and , i.e. a patent with N inventors citing another patent (previously) deposited by M inventors leads to (N\u00d7M) flows of information and each of them records 1/(N\u00d7M) fraction of the patent. Once these fractional flows are summed up, they capture the origin, destination and intensity of the inter-state patent creation -patent citation routes. Because we use a panel approach, these flows are measured on a yearly level over 1986-1999. Finally, note that we column-standardize P to capture the portion of knowledge created in state j that spills over to the recipient state i as in . 3) We capture the inter-state migration flows of the highly educated workers in matrix M by constructing a series of spatial weights matrices based on the residence they occupy every other year. While the literature traditionally uses the share of graduate degree holders, the flow of migrants with this level of education is not available in our database (Integrated Public Use Micro-data Series -IPUMS). As a result, we choose the highest education level available and it is Bachelor's degree holders or equivalent. As above, the flows are measured every year over 1986-1999 and a column standardization process is applied.   1986 1990 1994 1998 1986 1990 1994 1998 1986 1990 1994 1998 1986 1990 1994 1998   display a somewhat similar but less heterogenous level of input and output knowledge levels than the states connected to each other through patenting (P matrix) or migration (M matrix). Furthermore, we find that the median level of patent creation in the states educated workers and patents originate from is greater than the median level across the states (log values are -4.6 and -2.5 vs. -5.9) while the opposite is true for the median level of inputs (university and private R&D). It indicates that the states at the origin of the interregional flows are able to generate larger returns on their investments than the median state. The following section will highlight which of the knowledge input variables generate the largest returns."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Model (7a) corresponds to a Spatial Durbin model that we estimate by Maximum Likelihood. In that purpose, we use the package spdep (Bivand et al., 2014) in R (R, 2015). LeSage and Pace (2009) note that its \u03b2-parameters cannot be interpreted as if they reflect linear regression slope coefficients. Their suggestion is to provide scalar summary measures of the Jacobian matrices containing the partial derivatives. That is, the mean of the main diagonal elements of these matrices produces a scalar summary of the direct effects while the mean of the sum of the off-diagonal elements from each row produces the scalar summary of the indirect effects. On the other hand, model (7b) can be estimated as a traditional panel data model, i.e. with either state fixed effects or random effects. Their goodness of fit is compared based on the ML results computed with the the plm package (Croissant et al., 2013) in R. The model with state fixed-effect dummy (SD) can be written as: + 1 ln(\u03b4 + , + g) + 2 ln , + 3 ln , \u210e + 4 ln(\u03b4 + , \u22121 + g) with the restrictions \u2212 1 = 2 + 3 , \u2212 4 = 5 + 6 , 7 = \u2212 4 , \u2212 1 = 3 + 5 , \u2212 2 = The model with random effects would be the same as above but with 0 ln \u03a9 instead of . Following LeSage and Pace's idea (2009), we report in Table 2.2 below the direct and indirect marginal effects of the Spatial Durbin model (7a). Their significance level is based on 500 random simulations of the parameters from the estimated variancecovariance matrix. While the direct effect of each regressor r captures the sum of the (spatial) feedback effects to the region of origin as well as the traditional effect within the region of interest ( / ), the indirect effects represent the average value of the interregional spillovers ( / ). In addition, we report the implied parameters and their significance level based on the delta method of Casella and Berger (2002) which builds on the estimated coefficient means and variance-covariance matrix. As expected, we find that the direct effects of spending in R&D by private companies (c) as well as of spending in higher-education institutions (h) are positive and significant (Jaffe 1989;Audretsch and Feldman 1996;\u00d3 hUallach\u00e1in and Leslie 2007) whether one focuses on the restricted or unrestricted model (the \u2212 1 = 2 + 3 and \u2212 1 = 2 + 3 restrictions might not hold according to the result of the LR test). We also find that the spending in the academia that takes place across neighboring states is positively correlated with local innovation, which confirms the high degree of spatial association in education spending across the US States (Census Bureau, 2013). In addition, this result could reflect that at least part of the high-skilled workers migrates to nearby locations. While not focusing exclusively on the highly educated, Molloy et al. (2011) find that shortdistance migration occurs more frequently than long-distance migration in the US. Our findings indicate also a negative effect of the neighbors' spending in private R&D. This result is in contradiction with the expectations of the literature (e.g. Bode, 2004;Anselin et al., 1997 and more especially  who also explores the role of spatial externalities of private R&D spending. Indeed, their findings highlight the significant role of both proximity-based spillovers and actual long-distance spillovers on innovation production. The latter type of externality is obviously not included in the current model. Combined with a relatively low R* statistic which measures the Pearson correlation coefficient between the response variable and the fitted values, the results of Table 2.2 suggest that model (7a) is misspecified. We explore next whether Model (7b) that offers a different specification and a definition of inter-state spillovers that it not based on geographical contiguity can improve the results. We estimate Model (7b) with fixed effects and random effects and we report their results in Table 2.3 below. In addition to a spatial weighting scheme that is closer to the actual data generation process, the reduced form model derived from theory includes the effect of past levels of investment in the state of interest and in the states it interacts with through in-migration and patent citation. Furthermore, the current model does not contain the spatial lag of the dependent variable as in (7a), so that the interpretation of the estimated marginal effect is direct. The log-likelihood, AIC, and BIC indicate that this model performs better than model (7a) in terms of goodness of fit. A closer look indicates also that the fixed effect model achieves a better fit than the random effect model, which is confirmed by the significant p-value of the Hausman test for both the restricted and unrestricted models. The results of the LR test indicate that the theoretical restrictions might not hold (\u2212 1 = 2 + 3 ,\u2212 4 = 5 + 6 , 7 = \u2212 4 , \u2212 1 = 3 + 5 , \u2212 2 = 4 + 6 , 7 = \u2212 1 , 8 = \u2212 2 ), however, the restricted model has the theoretical property that unrestricted model doesn't have, we still focus our interpretation of the results on the estimates of the fixed effect restricted model.   The implied parameters indicate that spending in private R&D expenditure does not have a significant impact on innovation output whether ones focuses on this year's or last year's spending (parameters \u03b11 and \u03b41 respectively). It is possible that additional time lags would be needed to discover a significant impact as it is well-known R&D expenditure takes time to produce any innovative output (Griliches, 1979(Griliches, , 1992). However, current and last year's R&D expenditure at universities and colleges are enough to display a statistically significant impact on innovation promotion. It confirms the results of Anselin et al. (1997) and . When it comes to the spatial externalities, our findings indicate that spending in private and academic R&D in the states recent migrants come from has a positive and significant role on innovation production (parameters \u03c3c and \u03c3h respectively), which indicates that their experience and educational background are beneficial to the recipient area as we expected. On the other hand, academic R&D spending that takes place at time t-1 in the states where patents are originally created is negatively correlated with the production of innovation at time t in the states that cite these patents (parameter \u03c4h). One possible explanation is that a patent-citing state may, intentionally or not, reduce its marginal spending in academic R&D in its own location if it is known that other states, the patent-creating states, are already bearing the costs of academic R&D. Since spending in academic R&D has a positive marginal effect on local innovation, the marginal effect of this \"free-rider\" behavior leads to a negative effect on local innovation. Another channel that could explain this negative relationship is that, on average, the states where patents are created are more innovative than those where the patents are cited so they may cite their locally-created patent themselves numerous times (Jaffe et al., 1993), hence increasing the degree of competition for innovation among states. A similar negative effect is found for private R&D spending taking place from patent-creating to patent-citing states (parameter \u03c4c), although the effect is not statistically significant.  found a positive relationship for these latter two parameters when estimated across counties located more than 50 miles apart and in a cross-section setting. However, since the degree of industrial specialization is usually larger at the county-than at the state-level, it may be that, in the current study, the complementarity in the innovative process usually experienced at the county level is masked by the competitive effect that takes place at the state level. An approach combining the sectoral and the spatial dimensions of the flows of patent creation-citation would shed some light on this conundrum, but it is left for future research.\nOnly the random effect panel model estimates associated to the state and climates zones are reported in Table 3.5. Other model estimates, such as fixed effects panel model (which provides very similar results) and pooling panel model are not reported but they are available from the authors upon request. For the weather variables, in general, we see the unweighted variables are likely to be non-significant and were smaller in magnitude compared to their weighted version, which tend to be significant and have much bigger magnitude. This general phenomenon shows strong spillover effects through trade flows, or in other words, relationship between profit and these exogenous variables might be better explained through trade flows. Specifically, for the weather variables, the estimates from the fixed panel model shows that unweighted seasonal temperatures (see the shaded cells in Table 3.5) have more impact on profit than the unweighted seasonal precipitation. It predicts that the profit will be increased by about $28M if the average temperatures in spring increases by one degree. The linear terms for other seasons are non-significant. The spring temp 2 also shows significant result, however, the magnitudes (only about $0.9M decrease) are much smaller than its linear correspondences. The other quadratic terms are non-significant. Interestingly, only temperature in spring is significant, also the significant quadratic terms shows the relationship is non-linear, however, the magnitude of the quadratic term shows such nonlinear relationship is not very different from linear. The unweighted precipitation variables are less interesting as all of them are non-significant. Besides the precipitation variables, we also find that the average proportion of extreme drought farmland and average proportion of extreme wet farmland are also both non-significant. For the unweighted human intervention variables, as expected, the main player is the share of the irrigated farmland. The unit for it is the percentage, as showed in Table 3.5. The random effect panel model reports that the profit is expected to be increased by approximately $11M if the share of the irrigated farmland is increased by 1%. The log of the fertilizer usage and total value of agricultural commodity (total demand) don't show the significance effect from the random effect panel model. The results from the unweighted variables reflect the relationship between the explanatory variables and profit locally (i.e., intrastate effect). The results from the weighted variables reflect the spillover effects on those explanatory variables from other states through the trade flows (i.e., interstate effect). For the seasonal temperature variables, the first impression is that, again, only weighted spring temperature showed significant result, but with negative sign. This is different from what we see earlier for its unweighted version, that the sign was positive. The random effect panel model reports about $67M drop in profit when spatially lagged spring temperature is increased by 1 degree. This shows that through spatial weighting, higher temperature in spring will decrease the profit. Such decreasing effect has more impact on the profit since the magnitude of the weighted spring temperature is higher than the unweighted one. All the other terms are nonsignificant including the quadratic terms (weighted spring 2 is significant at 0.1 level), showing that the relationship between weighted seasonal temperature and profit is more likely to be linear. This is different from the conventional quadratic relationship between temperature and profit reflected from the analysis of the unweighted temperature. Comparing to spatially lagged seasonal temperature, spatially lagged seasonal precipitation is perhaps more relevant to profit. The total precipitation in cold seasons (spring and winter) are generally lower than that in warm seasons (summer and fall), therefore, spring and winter are generally \"dry seasons\" for continental states in the U.S. and summer and fall are generally \"rain seasons\" for continental states in the U.S. The first impression from the weighted seasonal precipitation is that the signs are positive for dry seasons and the signs are negative for wet seasons. This shows that in general, precipitation will help to increase the profit if precipitation is in need and excessive rainfall in wet seasons might decrease the profit. Interestingly, among the four seasons under consideration, again only spring shows significant results. The random effect panel model reports that the profit will be significantly increased by about $35M when the spatially lagged total precipitation in spring increases by 1 unit. When the spatially lagged total precipitation in winter increases by 1 unit, the profit will be significantly increased by about $59M (at 0.1 level of significance). Their corresponding quadratic term are also significant at 0.1 level showing such relationship might be non-linear, however, the magnitude of the quadratic terms shows that the quadratic relationship might not be very strong. The spatially lagged average percentage of extreme drought farmland shows significant negative effect on the agricultural profit. The random effect model shows that the decrease is $2.8M if the average proportion of severe drought is increased by 1%. In terms of model fit, log-likelihood, AIC, BIC, and adjusted R 2 are calculated for the random effect panel model, where R* is simply the correlation between the model prediction and the response variable. The global Moran's I test for the profit of 48 states across 4 time points using the dynamic spatial-temporal weights matrix (this is a combined year-specific spatial weight matrix which construction process was discussed in the previous section) shows that the Moran's I statistic is 0.08 with expected value of -0.005 and variance of 0.001. The Zstatistic for Moran's I test is 2.4554 with p-value of 0.001. The significant positive value of the Z-statistic shows there is significant clustering effect for the profits regarding the overall dynamic spatial-temporal weights. This shows that the spatial-temporal consideration using the constructed weights matrix is necessary. Lagrange-Multiplier (LM) test are performed for testing heteroscedasticity, spatial autocorrelation, and serial autocorrelations. The heteroscedasticity and serial autocorrelation are evidenced while the spatial autocorrelation is not significant. This suggests that a Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation (serial) Consistent (HAC) covariance matrix adjustment is needed for the variance estimates of the regression coefficients. As such, all the results reported in Table 3.5 are HAC adjusted. The GMM model differs from the random effect panel model by adding a temporally lagged profit (by one time point) as one additional explanatory variable and using higher order temporally lagged profit as instrument variables, as in Arellano and Bond (1991). Since the temporally lagged response variable is used as one of the explanatory variable, the conventional independence assumption in OLS estimates is violated, consequently, the model has to be estimated by using GMM. A benefit of adding temporally lagged profit is, however, making the model dynamic. In general, the GMM model estimates are more sensitive, i.e., it provides more significant findings than the random effect panel model. For the weather variables, the unweighted linear spring temperature is still significantly positive, but with higher magnitude (now, about $54M increase). The other seasons show negative impact on agricultural profit ranging from -$17M (winter) to -$66M (summer), respectively. The weighted spring temperature shows significant negative impact on agricultural profit with magnitude of -$90M, while the weighted summer temperature shows significant positive impact on agricultural profit with magnitude of $109M at 0.1 level of significance. For precipitation, the findings are similar from the random effect panel model. The unweighted summer and fall precipitation show significant positive effect on profit while the weighted spring precipitation shows significant positive effect. It is interesting to see that the precipitation all have positive impact on profit but the intrastate effect happens on rain seasons while the interstate effect happens in dry seasons. This shows that trade helps to increase the profit when more rain is needed in dry seasons while it won't help much in rain seasons. The weighted average percentage of severe drought farmland is significantly negative and the weighted average percentage of severe wet farmland is significantly positive. Again, when there is excessive rain fall, the trade will help to bring up the profit. For human intervention variables, significant positive results are found for share of irrigation and total demand, which echo the findings from the random effect panel model on share of irrigation but also additionally shows significant positive result for total demand. The spatially lagged share of irrigation is slightly negative compared to its unweighted version. Because the GMM model is not based on likelihood, log-likelihood, AIC, and BIC are not calculated, instead standard diagnostic tests for panel GMM models are reported. As a standard procedure, Sargan's J test (Sargan, 1988) shows the model restriction is not over-identified. The tests of autocorrelation also shows non-significant autocorrelation is presented. There is no easy way to test for spatial autocorrelation under GMM SLX models currently."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3 THE RICARDIAN MODEL OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT MEETS THE RICARDIAN MODEL OF INTERREGIONAL TRADE: THEORY AND EVIDENCE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Literature review", "text": "The recent surge in Ricardian contributions that acknowledge and model explicitly the role of spatial dependence is motivated by three factors. First, the mismatch in the location and boundaries of the physical (weather and soil data) and administrative (e.g. income, land value) data that enter the model is a clear example of ecological fallacy at the origin of spatial dependence in the error terms (Anselin and Cho, 2000). Second, spatial autocorrelation is intrinsic in the distribution of a Ricardian model's data because nearby places experience similar temperature and rainfall (Ezcuerra et al., 2008) and spillover effects across neighbors emanate from communication between farmers (Polsky 2004, Munshi 2004, Kumar 2011, technology and investment spillovers (McCunn and Huffman 2000, Chatzopoulos and Lippert 2016), a similar policy environment (Polsky 2004) and the distance between the source of irrigated water and the location of its use (Dall'erba and Dominguez, 2015). Third, the spatial econometric literature has now provided ample evidence that ignoring spatial autocorrelation present in a model leads to biased and inconsistent or inefficient estimates (Anselin, 1988;Le Sage and Pace, 2009) even when traditional spatial fixed effects are included in the model (Baltagi et al., 2007;Kapoor et al., 2007;Anselin and Arribas-Bel, 2013).  Kelejian and Prucha (1998, 1999 and Drukker et al. (2013). Table 3.1 provides detailed information on the Ricardian contributions that have used a spatial econometric approach 3 . Two main shortcomings of the existing literature become clear. First, most of studies define the spatial weight matrix based on geographical proximity only. They choose either contiguity or great circle distance in order to do so. Even though geographical proximity has been used many times to approximate for the spatial interactions between different regions, some contributions argue that spatial weight matrices based on actual flow data are more appropriate theoretically and empirically as they change over time, they are non-symmetric and they provide a clear idea of directionality. Contributions along these lines are Eliste and Fredriksson (2004), Chen and Haynes (2014) who use trade flows and  and  who rely on actual flows of patent creation-citation. Second, it is also clear that the model selection strategy is either arbitrary or, at best, based on the Lagrange Multiplier tests, their robust version and the decision rule described in Anselin and Florax (1995) and Anselin et al. (1996). It is well-known that it is limited to choosing between a spatial lag model (SAR) and a spatial error model (SEM) when other spatial model specifications are available. The earliest example is Polsky (2004) who runs a spatial lag model with group-wise heteroskedasticity across counties of the U.S. Great 3 A spatial econometric approach has also been used in related literatures (see Holloway et al., 2007, andBrady andIrwin, 2011 for a thorough survey) such as the crop production function (Anselin et al., 2004;Schlenker and Roberts, 2009;Delbecq et al., 2012), and hedonic models of farmland value (Plantinga et al., 2002;Patton and McErlean, 2003;Huang et al., 2007;Maddison, 2009;Cotteleer et al., 2011). Plains. Two articles published shortly after (Schlenker et al., 2006;Deschenes and Greenstone, 2007) choose to deal with spatial dependence through Conley's (1999) heteroskedasticity and spatial error autocorrelation consistent standard errors. Fisher et al. (2012) uses the same approach. However, this approach has been criticized for various reasons. Kelejian and Prucha (2007) indicate that Conley's (1999) estimator does not allow for Cliff-Ord type spatial feedback effects and it is defined for continuous space when these empirical works use discrete spatial units. Furthermore and more importantly, the authors assume that spillover effects are absent in their model. Indeed, as in the OLS case, the marginal effect of a change in region i following a change in region j, \u2044 , is zero in this approach. Dall'erba and Dominguez (2015) demonstrate that it is not appropriate when focusing on the US agriculture. For instance, the rainfall and snowpack of one locality can provide water for irrigation elsewhere and part of the agricultural goods produced in one location will be consumed elsewhere (for instance, only 30% of Arizona-produced agricultural goods consumed within the state, IMPLAN, 2010). Some recent contributions formally model spillovers by standard spatial econometric means but their Ricardian analysis is not applied to the US case. Seo (2008) estimates both a SAR and a SEM in a study using South American agricultural household data. In a Ricardian study on India agriculture, Kumar (2011) uses the robust Lagrange Multiplier test (Anselin et al. 1996) to select the preferred spatial weighting matrix and model specification. Lippert et al. (2009), Schmidtner et al. (2015) and Chatzopoulos and Lippert (2016) focus on agriculture in Germany and use a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) approach to account for the endogeneity of the spatially lagged dependent variable (Kelejian and Prucha, 1998). Dall'Erba and Dominguez (2015) offer a 2SLS approach too but discover that local spillovers (in a model with the spatial lag of some covariates, SLX) are more appropriate than the global spillovers embedded in a SAR model. Furthermore, their weight matrix combines proximity with the relative output of each pair of region to avoid symmetric flows. In light of the existing literature, our contribution consists in deriving the reducedform spatial model from theory and to rely on actual trade flows of agricultural goods to identify the role of interregional spillovers. Both elements are described further in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Theory, Spatial-Panel Model and Data Used", "text": "Our open-economy Ricardian model builds on the closed economy model that has dominated the literature so far. The profit , associated with the kth potential use of farmer f 's land in location i depends on a set of local attributes , that farmer f can control (such as irrigation and fertilizer) and of attributes , that he cannot control (soil characteristics, climate, local demand). However, in an open-economy framework, the latter attributes are complemented by a set of similar attributes , and , that take place among all trade partners \u2260 , hence on which i has no control. The process by which the farmer located in i maximizes the value of the profit function is written as: where =( 1 , \u2026, ) is the vector of output prices associated with kth use of land. This factor does not change by location as each individual farmer is assumed to be a price-taker since each individual produces too little to have any influence on prices. , is the vector of the quantity of good k produced in location i. It is a function of locally controllable and non-controllable inputs as well as of similar inputs located in trade partners j used for the production of goods similar to or other than k. Finally, , =( ,1 , \u2026 , , ) is the vector of input prices bar the cost (or rent) , of land in location i used for k applied to the quantity of land . The farmer is assumed to maximize his profit by selecting the optimal level of attributes , , , , and given the level of all the attributes it cannot control ( , , , ). From an econometric viewpoint, a linear or semilog equation can approximate for the (per acre) profit envelope of the k (1, \u2026,N k ) possible land uses by assuming that land in any location is put to its most profitable use at any time t as follows: where g is a possible transformation of the attributes farmer f can control ( , ) and has no ). The reduced form model that derives from (2) is therefore a SLX model written as below: where, for any regressor r, / = + . The second element refers to local spillovers that capture how changes in the conditioning variables of the importing states affect profits in the exporting states. Model (3) is applied to the U.S. continental states over the U.S. Agriculture Census years of 1997Census years of , 2002Census years of , 2007Census years of and 2012. All the economic variables have been converted to constant 2012 USD using the corresponding Consumer Price Index (CPI). Our dependent variable is agricultural profit (the difference using agricultural income minus agricultural expense) per acre and it comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Agricultural profit generally increases from west to east and increases significantly through the years. Our independent variables capture a set of local and interregional conditions that we now describe. The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) (Mesinger et al., 2006) is used as the proxy for observations of past climate data as it assimilates observed precipitation and temperature. NARR data are available for the conterminous US and are at a 32-km spatial resolution, 3-hourly temporal resolution for the period 1979-present. Hence, we used a spatial interpolation method to calculate a state's values and aggregate, at first, the data to the monthly level. In addition to temperature and precipitation, we use their squared values to capture their non-linear effect. Because the effect of climate varies across seasons, we separate the effect to each of the four seasons: March through May is Spring, June through August is Summer, September through November is Fall, December to February is Winter. We include both linear and quadratic terms for the weather variables. The linear term reflects the marginal value of weather evaluated at the grand mean across all 48 states for 5 time points, while the quadratic term shows how that marginal effect will change as one moves away from the grad mean. We also included variables reflecting the proportions (percentages) of farmlands having severe drought (drought) and severe wet (flood) conditions averaged across all months for each state and each year. The variable indicated as the \"human intervention\" is the total demand (i.e. final and intermediate demand) for commodities with SCTG codes 1-7 (in million dollars) for each state and each year. A brief description of the SCTG codes can be found in Table 3.2. These data come from the Regional Economic Accounts developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Furthermore, we rely on the percentage of farmland using fertilizer and the percentage of farmland using irrigation to control for the usual inputs in the agricultural production process. These data are found from USDA. The summary statistics of our data are reported in Table 3.3 below.  While a set of soil characteristics is often used to capture differences in the level of fertility across spatial units in a cross-section setting, a state fixed effect can capture them in a panel data model since they do not change over time. Furthermore, we account for the first time in the Ricardian literature for the hierarchical nature of our data. State-level weather observations are dependent on the climate zone they belong to. We rely on the data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to allocate the states across climate zones and on a hierarchical structure depicted as follows to capture their role: where index i is for climate zones (i = 1,\u2026, 9) and index j is for the states nested within climate zone i (See Table 3.4 for the list of states within each climate zone). Note that, the parameter and parameter are invariant to states j in climate zone i as indicated in Equation 4. This shows the climate zone will give an impact on the overall intercept by putting additional effect upon the state level effect. The climate zone effect will not have impact on the slope parameters such as and . Furthermore, since the climate zone dummy and the state dummy are time-invariant, this gives light to use a fixed effect panel model which removes these time-invariant effects.  4], then the fixed effect panel model is used. This is also called the \"Least Squares Dummy Variable Model\" (LSDVM), because the time-invariant dummy variables are added for the hierarchical structure. The fixed effect panel model is proposed to be used because of its nice property to allow both state and climate zones to be timeinvariant, however, the fixed effect panel model are usually not as efficient as the random effect panel model. A Hausman's test is thus performed to compare between the fixed effect panel model and the random effect panel model. Furthermore, we will also test the hypothesis of a significant time lagged dependent variable \u22121 in our model. In that purpose, we use the Arellano and Bond (1991) difference generalized methods of moment (GMM) estimator first proposed by Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rosen (1988). Results for these various model settings are presented in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "While adaptation to future weather conditions is a well-documented feature of the Ricardian literature, the role of trade as a mechanism of adaptation has been investigated at the international level only (Julia and Duchin, 2007;Stephan and Schenker, 2012;Schenker, 2013;Zhang et al., 2014). Yet, there is no reason why one should not expect states within the US to also import more from other states after they got hit by an unexpected weather event such as a drought or for them to change the nature and direction of their trade of agricultural products based on new weather conditions. As such, this study fills this gap by studying the role of interstate trade in agricultural products on agricultural profits across the 48 U.S. continental states and the four census years of 1997-2012. Starting with a theoretical Ricardian model where the weather conditions, farm inputs and local level of demand in the state of interest and in its trade partners act as control variables, we derive a reduced-form model taking the form of a SLX model. It implies that a change in the above conditions within the boundaries of the importing states will affect the level of per acre profit in the exporting state. Maximum Likelihood and GMM estimates are generated for a hierarchical model where states are nested within the climate zone they belong to and various types of individual effects are tested (pooled model, fixed effect model, random effect model, mixed effect model). Since various model results are generally consistent with each other, we mainly report the findings from the random effect panel model and the difference GMM because of their consistency and efficiency. They highlight, first, the non-linear relationship between unweighted weather variables and agricultural profit. We also find that unweighted spring temperature (also unweighted spring 2 ) have a significant impact (at 5% level) on agricultural profit. Local precipitation and extreme events are not found to affect profits significantly (by random effect panel model), which may be because irrigation mitigates their marginal effect. However, the weighted spring participation has significant positive impact on profit, and it seems to suggest that for dry seasons (spring and winter), more participation will lead to more profit through trade. We also find that some of the weather conditions (severe drought and severe flood) experienced in the importing states influence significantly profits in the exporting states. When it comes to the data capturing human intervention, the results confirm our expectations: more irrigation leads to higher profits.
