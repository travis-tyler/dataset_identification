Survey Area and Its Importance \"San Francisco Bay and Delta, one of the world's largest estuarine systems, profotmdly influences and enhances the economic, climatic, and aesthetic quality of the s=otmding urban-suburban region to the great benefit of its 5 million inhabitants. With its strategic location on the coast of central California (figure 1) and its huge natural harbor, San Francisco Bay serves as a major center for ccmnerce and :industry and as a gateway to the Far East\" (ConcmJs, 1979) \u2022 Throughout this report, the San Francisco Bay area (figure 2) refers to San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays; Carquinez Strait; the tidal marshes which surrotmd these bodies of water; and that part of the \"Delta\" which encanpasses the confluence of the Sacram=nto and San Joaquin Rivers. The area south of Yerba Buena Island is referred to as South San Francisco Bay. The San Francisco Bay-area also :includes those waters outside of the Golden Gate to the 10 fathan l:ine. This entire region is collectively referred to as the \"Bay.\" The waters of San Francisco Bay lie with:in a northerly trend:ing structural depression in the California Coast Ranges Geaoorphic Province. The history of the area is characterized by a long record of extensive earth m::>vement and seismic activity. The proximity of the San Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras fault zones makes this a major concem. The major source of fresh water enter:ing the Bay is from the San Joaquin -Sacram=nto River system, which effectively drains the Central Valley of California. Local surface nmoff from streams drain:ing the hills s=otmd-:ing the Bay is minor, and grotmd water :inflow :into the Bay is negligible (Pestrong, 1972) .   Water properties within the Bay are characterized by introductions of river water, waste discharges, and exchange of ocean water through the Golden Gate. These waters are mi..\"\"red by tidal and density =ents and by wind. The circulation is driven by tides, basin topography, Delta outflow, and wind. This mixing and circulation determines the flushing ability of the system (McCulloch et al., 1970;ConOIIlOs et al., 1971;ConOIIlOs and Peterson, 1977;Imberger et al., 1977). Since about 1850, the Bay has faced increasingly serious en:virornnental pressures. The population of the nine cmmties comprising the area has increased fran 3 million people in 1940 to over 4 million in 1970 and could reach 9 million by 1990 (House Document (H DOC), 1970). San Francisco Bay itself was altered physically by massive sedimentation induced by the development of hydraulic mining in the gold districts. The alteration began in 1853 and ended by judicial decision in 1884 after shoaling the upper ams of the Bay by a few meters (May, 1970). The mining was actually halted because it was destroying agricultural land in the Sacrmrento Valley. Only casual observations of the Bay's natural history were recorded during the years between the mining, the development of agriculture with extensive ' .\u2022 irrigation diversions, and the urbanization of the Bay area. Population growth, cannercial pressure, and recreational expansion created the demand for increasing the number of facilities and activities on diked and filled Bay shores. Diking and filling have greatly reduced the Bay's water area and shoreline. Since 1850, the Bay waters which then covered 680 square miles (435,200 acres), have been reduced to less than 400 square miles ( 256, 000 acres) . The 340 miles of Bay shoreline have been reduced to only 276 miles, and the 300 square miles of marshlands now total only about 75 square miles (H DOC, 1970). Solid wastes, dredged spoil, sludge, and other materials have devastated thousands of acres of the Bay's marshlands and n:ud flats, and degraded the quality of the Bay's waters. \"Of all the great estuarine systems of the world, San Francisco Bay and the Delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers have been =.g the last to be critically studied by scientists. Indeed, for many years, this region had \"While researchers turn toward the Bay as a scientific and political plum, 0 0 0 a purely technical r turning point I invigorating the effort has been an exhaustive, two-year survey of the Bay's currents and tides,.... The NOS study, . \u2022 \u2022 . gives the many agencies studying the Bay 'the first really good set of data in CODI!XJn. Now maybe we can all really start talking about the sarre things'\" (Nichols, 1982)."}, {"section_title": "Circulation Survey Purposes and Benefits", "text": "A circulation survey consists of the acquisition of various physical oceanographic and meteorological data from which an ac=ate description of water m:>Vement can be deduced, along with a theoretical appreciation of its causes \u2022 It :includes the measurement of water currents, tides, temperature, sal:inity, and various meteorological parameters such as wind speed, direction, atm::lspheric pressure, and air temperature. These measurements are =de at J:ll.llrerous locations and depths to obta:in a reasonably canplete three-d.:imensional description of these dynamic properties \u2022 Tide and current station deployment clurations are of sufficient length to allow prediction of the tides and tidal currents by harroonic analysis methods. Cmrents are the horizontal water JIDVanent result:ing from the periodic astronomic tide produc:ing forces, as well as fran winds, density differences between water masses, \u2022and river runoff. The measured tides are simply the periodic vertical water JIDVanent result:ing fran the same astroncmic forces, with sane IOOVellleilt also caused by atm::lspheric pressure and winds. Sal:inity and temperature measurements are used to determine the density structure of the water masses, which can have significant effects on the currents, as well as on mixing and dispersion processes. Atm::lspheric measurements are used to correlate nonperiodic water JIDVanent with the forc:ing functions of wind and atmospheric pressure. Cmrent \u2022measurements at each station were at several depths, water depth penni.tt:ing, to observe density. and shear effects. The observation levels through the water coltml. :include a near-surface depth, a near-bottan depth, and levels above and below any pycnocl:ines (ideally). Cmrent stations w-ere deployed at all locations of dynamic importance, which :include estuary boundaries , key cross sections, and all other areas necessary to provide a satisfactory spatial distribution of current characteristics . locations of navigational importance were also covered. Tide data are essential to understand:ing the dynamics of an estuary because the dynamics of the entire estuary are generally driven by the ocean tide at the entrance. Nontidal sea level changes (obta:ined fran the data record by filter:ing techniques) caused by wind and atm::Jspheric pressure also affect estuar:ine dynamics. Tide stations were placed at the survey limits, at the junction of adjacent water bodies, and along the estuar:ine boundaries with:in operational limitations. Conductivity and temperature profile (ern) data were obtained to understand and describe density effects on the total circulation of the estuary. ern casts done in succession along a transect present a cross section of the horizontal density gradient. A series of ern casts taken at the same location over a tidal cycle presents the temporal variations in the vertical density . gradient at that location. Meteorological stations were spatially located throughout the survey area to obtain ac=ate regional a1::!rospheric . temperature, pressure, and wind field data. The standard height for a meteorological sensor package is 10 meters above chart datum (international standard) . The stations were located on or near the water to avoid the frictional effects of land and the orographic effects of hills and surrounding structures. Several special data sets were acquired for the San Francisco Bay Area Circulation Survey. These data sets include deep-sea tide gage (DSTG) , =rent-to-wave signal-to-noise \u2022 (S/N) , and water level recorder (WLR) measurements .. The DSTG, S/N, and WLR efforts are discussed in section 1.4 \u2022 . ,.. The major purpose of this survey was to update the San Francisco Bay area .iJ tide and tidal =rent prediction infonna.tion in the traditional products of NOS, which can be used by industrial, coomercial, military and recreational users. The survey provided a canprehensive oceanographic data set so that scientifically-based decisions can be made to enhance the envirOIIIIleilt of the Bay area. This survey was plarmed and executed in cooperation with the USGS to accomplish as ~ as was operationally feasible in the time allowed to obtain complete data sets that can meet llllltiple needs. The USGS purposes and benefits are discussed in section 1.3. The large data sets resulting from this survey have already been utilized by other government agencies, universities, and private firms involved in scie..11tific research, envirOIIIIleiltal protection, and coastal engineering. The data are also used as input into various numerical-hydrodynamic llXldels. A fortunate cirCUliiStance is that the circulation survey was conducted while the National Ocean Service California Marine Botmdary Program, 1974-1981, was still in progress (NOS, 1982), which provided additional tide data. The main objective of the CMBP is to utilize tidal data to detennine tidal datl.lms of sufficient ac=acy to delineate marine boundaries and support the NOS Nautical Charting Program. These data are also used to determine land subsidence or emergence, and to aid in shoreline control for ecological purposes."}, {"section_title": "Cooperative Agreerent with the United States Geological Survey", "text": "NOS' previous circulation survey in the San Francisco Bay area took place during 1951 -1954 (section 7. 0.) \u2022 The survey was extensive in areal coverage, but consisted =stly of short-term =ent stations. The primary purpose of that survey was to provide tidal =ent predictions as an aid to navigation. NOS now conducts circulation surveys which are m1ch =re extensive and detailed. Prior to conducting a survey, NOS notifies state and local governments, local tmiversities, and all interested parties of its plans to gain the !IXlSt benefit from the study. As early as 1975, NOS notified the State of California of its plans to carry out a circulation survey in San Francisco Bay. Formal coordination plarming began in the spring of 1978 at a meeting in San Francisco attended by me:nbers of NOS, USGS, and the State of California Water Resources Control Board (Patchen and Cheng, 1979). The State wanted NOS data because of its concern over the effect of sewage disposal on the Bay and its interest in how m1ch the flushing of pollutants from the Bay wuld be altered by a plan to partially divert the flow of fresh water from the Sacramento River (Peripheral Canal). The State involvement was eventually discontinued, but NOS and USGS continued their cooperative agreement. A description of NOS and USGS roles in the data collection effort are discussed in section 1. 4. Over the last decade, USGS has maintained a special project group in Menlo Park, California, specifically designated to study estuarine dynamics. USGS 's research scientists use San Francisco Bay as an outdoor laboratory to study ccxnplicated interactions between \u2022physical, chanical, and biological processes which take place in an estuarine envirornnent. Broad goals of the USGS study are to understand the processes and rates by which water, solutes, sediments, and organisms interact; to quantify effects. of river inflow, winds, and tides; and to develop and verify various rrumerical and conceptual I!X)dels. This program was initiated in 1969 utilizing hand-held sampling devices and bottle samples, and has evolved to a ccxnprehensive, autanated, and systematic field sampling and laboratory analytical progran. The NOAA/NOS circulation survey conducted in 1979 and 1980 provided the unique opportunity to increase the circulation, m:teorological, and density (water temperature and salinity) data base of NOS and USGS beyond what either agency alone could ccxnpile. NOS and USGS capabilities in San Francisco Bay \u2022\u2022ccxnplemented each other. USGS did not have the NOS capability to carry out a large scale circulation survey; therefore, they sought the large data base that NOS could supply. Because the USGS research group is permanently located \u2022 in the San Francisco area, they were able to supply' long-term support enabling ; NOS to obtain longer continuous data records than is usually possible. The ';USGS also supplied logistics, persormel, and operational support enabling NOS -~~to expand its efforts."}, {"section_title": "4. Details of the San Francisco Bay Area Circulation Sm:vey", "text": "The San Francisco Bay Area Circulation Survey. was partitioned into three field seasons during 1979 and 1980. The 1979 field seasons were designated OPR-1827-AR-79 (spring) and OPR-1828-AR-79 (fall), and the 1980 field season was designated OPR-1828-AR-80. In addition to the three field seasons, the USGS maintained several key current stations between the fall 1979 and 1980 field seasons (Break) , using a ccmbination of NOS Aanderaa m:ters and USGS ENDECO m:ters. During the Break, the USGS also maintained three USGS Aanderaa m:teorological stations in addition to two NOS Aanderaa m:teorological stations. Table 1 Stmmarizes the four data collection phases. The purpose of the spring 1979 field season was to collect data over the entire survey area as defined in section 1.1. These data were acquired for the entire estuarine system to show which sections of the Bay would require a greater concentration of effort during the rena:ining field seasons. The fall 1979 phase provided data for two separate regions of the Bay. Region 1 included San Francisco Bay proper and the offshore area contiguous to San Francisco Bay. Region 2 included the bays, rivers, and sloughs east of and including Carquinez Strait in the northern portion of the Bay area. The third phase of the survey, Break, represented the t:ime period between the fall 1979 and 1980 field seasons. The USGS maintained four key long-term =ent stations as well as five meteorological stations to enable continuous data collection while the roM Ship McAR1RUR returned to Seattle for winter inport. The 1980 phase of the survey provided data for three separate regions of the San Francisco Bay area. Region 1 included the Golden Gate and the offshore area contiguous to San Francisco Bay. Region 2 covered San Francisco Bay south of the Oakland Bay Bridge. Region 3 included San Pablo Bay, Petaluma. River, Sonoma Creek, and Napa River. There were also eight long-term =ent stations and corresponding tide stations, covering the entire area, which were occupied for the duration of the 1980 field season. Direct USGS operational involvement began during the fall 1979 field season when they installed three additional meteorological stations; reduced the McAR1RUR' s CID wrkload by occupying numerous shallow water stations (using the USGS R/V POLARIS); and provided eight ENDECO =ent meters to expand =ent station coverage and provide better near-surface measurements (ENDECO meters respond more accurately in the noisy near-surface environment than the Aanderaa =ent meters used by NOS on the West Coast) . .As discussed earlier, during the Break, USGS maintained four =ent meter stations and five meteorological stations enabling NOS to obtain data series exceeding one year in length. USGS also deployed and !Mintained several NOS =ent stations at extreme ends of the survey area. In addition, USGS collected chemical, geological, and biological data (section 5.0.). Section 1.2. stated that several special data sets were acquired for this survey. Two deep-sea tide gage (DSTG) systems were deployed in conjunction with the 1980 C-olden Gate and contiguous shelf area phase of the circulation survey. The purpose of these deployments was to collect deep-sea tide data\u2022 on the continental shelf to study the tidal wave as it propagates across the shelf and enters the Bay thrOugh the Golden Gate. In addition, these records will be used to provide  The data fran this survey were acquired by the NOM Ship McARTHUR, under the ccmnand of NOM. Ccm:nander Freddie L. Jeffries.

In a circulation survey, the information fran =ent meters ccmprises the primary data set. Each proposed station location in the original plan was inspected to verify the published charted depths. 1he survival of a station, especially in major shipping channels, was of the highest priority. 1he =ent meter survey was planned using a three-clim:nsional array of =ent meters. 1he observational depths were selected to assure that the vertical profile of the =ent structure could be determined. Because of navigational requiranents, observations were obtained as near to the surface as allowable by 1lDOring design and data noise considerations. To fully describe the three-clim:nsional structure both spatially and tanporally, the planned period for a given observation was determined by the standard analysis teclmiques that can be perfonned on the =ent records. Several spatially located =ent meter stations were occupied for long periods to serve as reference stations for the survey, and all other observations were planned for a period of at least 15 days , with mst stations being occupied for over 30 days. This strategy allows for ccmparisons to be made between the shorter-period stations and the long-period reference stations. The data fran the reference stations include all nontidal conditions (fresh water nm.off and meteorological effects) that oc= during the survey, and can be analyzed to give the mst ac=ate harnxmi.c constants obtainable. The geographic location of each =ent station was determined by a s:im.lltaneous three-point sextant fix during both deployment and recovery. A station's precise longitudinal location is extremely critical owing to the relative phase distribution of the harnxmi.c constituents resulting fran the spatially distributed station positions, and because =ents can vary significally with changes in bathymetry.

The addition of time cotmters to these meters has :improved data processing throughput, and allows ac=ate time assigrnnent to individual data points even when the meter malftmctions. The RCM4 design is based upon a savonius rotor =ent speed sensor, a magnetic canpass for direction detenn:ination, and a thermistor for temperature sensing. lhe pressure sensor is a bourdon tube driving a potentianeter, and conductivity is detennined by an induction-type sensor. An electranechanical encoder (analog-to-digital converter) samples and converts the different parameters to binary signals which are recorded on 6.4-nm magnetic tape; the binary signals are s:imJ.ltaneously transmitted to the surface by means of an acoustic transducer. There, they can be sensed by a hydrophone receiver which can either m:mitor the RCM4 audibly, or feed the signal directly to a printer >for data translation into digital numbers, or to an analog display unit. The measuring cycles of the RCM4 are controlled by a quartz clock for t:im:i..ng .ac=acy. POirier is supplied by batteries capable of recording 183 m of ,magnetic tape, or approximately 69 days using a 10-mi.nute sampling interval. 'The RCM4 consists of two main parts; the recording unit, and the vane ~assembly. The vane assembly has a spindle which can be shackled to the IIOOring line of subsurface floatation buoys. !he meters were originally calibrated by their inventor, Ivar Aanderaa of Norway. Before each field season, they were recalibrated and checked by the Northwest Regional Calibration Center (in Bellevue, Washington). Routine meter maintenance was performed aboard the McARTHUR. A graphic sketch of the El'IDEC:0-174 =ent meter is shown in figure 5 and table 5 presents the specifications for the meter. The ENDEC:O 17 4 =ent meter is an axial-flow, ducted-illlpeller =ent meter, which records digital data on 6. 4-nm magnetic tape. Recorded quantities include =ent speed (averaged for sampling interval), instantaneous direction, water temperature, and conductivity. Ct=ent speed is cfetennined by measuring the displacement of an encoder disc which is driven by the illlpeller throug.ll a magnetic coupler and reduction gears. Heading of the meter (current direction) is detennined and digitized frcxn the output of a damped-magnetic canpass. Temperature is  determined by a themistor encased in stainless steel, and conductivity by an electrodeless-conductivity probe. The ENDECO 174 incorporates a tether line designed to minimize llXJOring line and wave induced l!X)tions. Utilizing a two-l!l:i:nute sampling interval, the data capacil:'; of the tape cartridge is approximately 35 days. The ENDEC0-174 current meters were originally calibrated by the marrufacturer (Environmental Devices Corporation) \u2022 Calibration data unique to each current meter include ccmpass deviation, and National Bureau of Standards calibrated temperature and conductivity test points. Those data, as well as daily internally-generated reference values, are used during data reduction to ccmpute corrections for each measured param:ter. The current meters were periodically recalibrated when returned\u2022 to the manufacturer for repairs or for required retrofits, and were examined periodically in a USGS test tank to check that operation was within normal tolerances . Instruments were tested or recalibrated at approximately si.x-l!X)l1th intervals. Additionally, currentmeter impellers were rated at the USGS Gulf Coast Hydroscience Center, Bay St. lpuis, Mississsippi. Generally, the impeller ratings were fOI.Uld to be linear in the test range of 0 to 250 em/ sec and in agreement with marrufacturer supplied calibration values. ROutine maintenance was perfonned aboard the R/V POLARIS or in USGS laboratories. Table 6 presents the general specifications for the MMI electromagnetic current meter. The sensor for this toodel is spherically shaped and has no ~ parts; therefore, it is not susceptible to clogging or fouling. To properly measure horizontal water velocity in the presence of vertical water l!X)tion, a meter must possess a cosinusoidal tilt response. If the tilt response is -other than cosine, verticall!X)tion ccmponents will be translated into horizontal velocities, thus giving a false indication. Each meter is provided with a solid-state electromagnetic flow sensor, the key element in its ability to ac=ately measure both X and Y directional ccmponents in a horizontal plane. These sensor properties make the MMI a particularly practical instrument for making S/N measurements. During the San Francisco Bay Area Circulation Survey, four 1lXJOring systems were used. Each of. the four llXlOring systems was routinely l!X)dified to 64 r depending upon current speed, depth, and method of deployment. Figure 6 shows three of the four 100oring types. The fourth type is a bottom mounted mid-level platform. The heavy taut-wire 1000ring (figure 6a) was designed for 100derate to strong currents and was deployed only by the McARTHUR. The 1000ring consisted of a heavy (3,000 to 4,000 pound) railroad wheel cluster anchor, an acoustic release, two to four current meters , reserve flotation buoys, subsurface buoy, and a lighted surface marker buoy. The light taut-wire 1000ring (Figure 6b) was designed for 100derate depths, 6 .1 to 15. 2 meters, and currents less than 2. 5 knots \u2022 The system consisted of an anchor (700 potmds), an acoustic release, one or two current meters, a small subsurface buoy, and a lighted buoy as a surface marker. The bottom platform (figure 6c) was a light-weight metal platfo= which was deployed in water as shallow as 2. The mid-level platform was designed for water depths of 6.1 meters or greater, and current speeds of up to 3. 7 knots. The current meter height was adjustable fran 3.0 to 6.1 meters above the platform base."}, {"section_title": "..COQJ:l-J", "text": "17.9 +16.8(-12.8) A 6 2142 17.9 17.9 17.9 17.9 17.9 17.9 + 7.6(-22.0) A 6 2143 17.9 17.9 17.9 17.9 17.9 37\u00b052'24\" 08/04/80-08/20/80 16.1 28.9 +22.9(-6.1)    ., ::>:  . 10/16/80-11/05/80 19.9 28.9 +22.9~-6.1 A 6 2302 19.9 19.9 19.9 0 19.9 122\u00b026'23\" 19.9 +16.8 -12.2) A 6 2303 19.9 19.9 19.9 19.9 19.9 19.9 + 7.6~-21.4l A 6 2304 19.9 19.9 0 19.9 19.9 37\u00b052'23\" 11/05/80-11/24/80 19.1 28.9 +22.9-6. ::: \"' ::0: ,... .._ ...."}, {"section_title": "lt->-I-IO't-3", "text": "Cill-O 0 '< UJ I: :::I Cl: ::.: c:"}, {"section_title": ".QOQJ::S-J", "text": ":     lt->+'Oit-::0: ... ...."}, {"section_title": "OL.", "text": "\"\" .... .... 38\u00b009'25\" 10/08/80-10/24/80 15.9 4.0 + 1.5(-2.4) A 6 2288 11.5 15.9 15.9 15.9 15.9 122\u00b024'24\" C22 38\u00b001'51\" 03/22/79-04/10/79 19.0 11.5 + 2.6(-8.9) 21.9 21.9 122\u00b022'45\" 21.9 + 2.7(-6.1) A 6 2268 21.9 21.9 21.9 21.9 21.9 21.9 + 1.5 (-7  .. . .  ....

Data processing is the crucial link between physically collecting oceanographic data and actually using it. \nThe first step in processing is the ~arative Reading, at which time data quality checks are made and a data \"setting\" is computed. The staffto-gage differences are detennined by taking the staff readings as recorded by the observer at the gage and subtracting the actual values recorded on the record at the indicated time. These differences are arithmetically meaned and the average staff-to-gage differences are added to a level constant to provide corrections and continuity with previous records at that station. This will reflect any changes for tidal datums. A setting for the record is then computed. If there are problems with the gage, or it has been readjusted, or the staff has been disturbed, a change in the staff-to-gage differences may require a record to be processed on different settings for different time periods . If the gage time differs from the observer's watch time, it is noted so that the time adjustm:nts can be made. Any obviously erroneous staff readings are rejected and not included in the computation of the mean. Problems of erroneous times, heights, or malfunctions in the record are noted on the Canparative Reading to aid in correcting the record while it is being processed, 1m error code is derived fran these troubleshooting notes to highlight the major problems for future failure analysis. To supplement trouble shooting and to provide \"feedback\" to the field parties for the repair of malftmctioning gages (section 3. 3. ) , an evaluation sheet (Preliminary Evaluation) is prepared for each record. The evaluation sheet sumnarizes the . condition of the gage and is used to tell the tide observer and/ or field party the problems which need to be corrected. The main objective is to identify problems quickly so they can be corrected to keep inefficient data to a minim.lm. After the Canparative Reading is ccxnpleted, the setting canputed, and Preliminary Evaluation filled out, the record management and error analysis information are entered into a canputer data base. The 6-mirrute data are transferred onto a magnetic tape by a digital-to-magnetic tape translator which optically reads the ptmched paper tape. The magnetic tape containing the 6-mirrute values is read into the Sea and Lake levels processing canputer \u2022 system. The system is then interrogated through an interactive terminal which has a visual display (CRT) and graphics capability. The record identification tnmlber is entered and diagnostics are printed. . If there are no problems with the data, the tabulated data are printed, having the setting applied to the r8!11 6-mirrute values fran the record. The tabulation and reduction to means are done automatically by the canputer. Tabulations are verified and the data are ready for tidal datum canputations. When problems are encotmtered on a record, they have to be corrected. Data may contain time problems or invalid punches because of observer problems or gage malftmctions. Troubleshooting records with poor data oc=s either at the translation or the edit stage. The time may be corrected by translating it a few punches ahead (fast) or a few punches behind (slow) . Each punch accotmts for 6 mirrutes, and times are corrected in 6-mirrute increments (tenths of hours). Where there are skips or missing punches that do not include a high or low water, linearly interpolated values are entered into the keyboard on the translator. When the results of the processing are checked, the ending time of a tmit (string) of data is examined to see if the printed time matches the correct time at the end. The printout of 6-mirrute values is used as a diagnostic tool to find when and where the time problem occurred. To check for height discontinuities, the third difference test on the edit routine flags punches which may be erroneous or where especially splashy (high wave action) data oc=. A plot may be made on the CRT screen or on a printer to examine suspect data. iVhere outlier (extreme) points appear to be part of the real tidal phencmenon, they are not altered. If the gage appears to be malftmctioning by a faulty ptmch, the heights may be corrected by including a \"fix\" parameter when submitting a job to the canputer at the diagnostic scan stage. The system allows for breaks in the data to be automatically filled by computer under the control of the analyst. Tabulations frcm a comparison station must already be included in the system, with valid data during the break period for comparison purposes. All interpolated and eXtrapolated values are bracketed to distinguish them frcm the original data. After records are processed, they are verified and the mean values for each llDilth of record are checked against those done previously. If they compare favorably with past results, the data then enters the datum canputation phase of the program."}, {"section_title": "c", "text": "Fi!l:ure 6. Current Meter Moorings The processing scheme described in this section was used for the processing of the Aanderaa RCM4 o=ent meter data. This system was replaced by an updated processing system called Circulatory Measurements Data Processing (CMDP) system, which will be described briefly in section 3. 7. Data measured by an Aanderaa RCM4 o=ent meter are recorded internally on a 7 .6-cm reel of 6.4-mn wide, half-mil thick magnetic tape, using a ten pin mechanical encoder. Six values are recorded as follows : reference ntli!Iber, temperature, conductivity, pressure, o=ent speed, and direction. About half of the Aanderaa meters owned by NOS record hour marks (using a tim:! counter IIDdule) on the tape using the conductivity and pressure channels. The conductivity reading is replaced every hour by a 1023 value and the pressure reading is replaced by an hour value, which increments fran 0 to 1023 by ones, and then starts over. 1hus, one sixth of the conductivity and pressure data are lost for the standard 10-minute sampling rate, but these hour marks are vital for tim:! determination if a meter malftmctions. Frequently, an entire data record is saved owing to these timing marks. The 7 .6-cm instrument tape is copied by the ship onto a 12. 7-cm reel of 6.4-mn wide, 1.5-mil thick tape using a Magnacord 1024 tape recorder; a reverse copy :improves the data signal. The 12. 7-cm tape and a strip chart plot of each paraneter are sent to the Circulation Section in Rockville, Maryland. Each 12. 7-cm tape generally contains approximately 15 days of data, sampled at a rate of six data points per hour. Sane tapes may contain 30 days of data or IIDre. The following logs and doCUIDentation are sent to Rockville with the data tapes: ., The times recorded on the Station Log for each ct=ent meter are vital for time-checking the data record and ac=ately assigning times to each data point. These include the following times: 1. first recorded data point, 2. rotor freed (untaped), 3. meter in water, 4. meter out of water, 5. rotor taped, and 6. last recorded data point. In Rockville, the first processing step is the transcription of the data fran a transmittal group of 12. 7-an tapes onto a 7-track canputer-canpatible tape using a transcriber based on a design fran Oregon State University. This tape is sent to the UNIVAC 1100/40 canputer in Suitland, Maryland, with a program called PHASE 1. The output fran PHASE 1 is a listing of all data in Aanderaa inst:rt.ment units, in 6-word records (and a sync pulse). If aligrmmt is correct, i.e., ,meter malfunction has not resulted in any .missing or extra data words, each .:fOl1..11In on the listing will represent one parameter (e.g., the reference number). Extra or missing data words are easily detected owing to coltmlS shifting left or right. The PHASE 1 listing is manually checked for missing or extra data words indicated by col= shifts. These are corrected in the next phase of processing. The next stage of processing incorporates a software program called PHASE 2, which reads the PHASE 1 output tape as the new input tape. With the PHASE 2 program, the data are realigned by specifying shifting corrections, that is, specifying where coltmlS on the PHASE 1 tape should be shifted left or right to realign the coltmlS. This is essentially the same as eliminating extra words (long records) or filling in missing words (short records). PHASE 2 also translates all data words into engineering units using ac=ate polynomial calibration equations based on calibration constants determined for each inst:rt.ment by the Northwest Regional Calibration Center. These constants are stored on a calibration tape which is read by PHASE 2. The data, now in engineering units, are written onto a 9-track, 1600-BPI tape in an efficient, large block format. With the PHASE 2 listing, a careful titre validation is done manually. The operation of assigning the correct time to each data record in each file is critical, and is done by two different people as a safeguard. Tw-o tinE check operations are done by each person. The first check compares the number of intervals actually recorded by the reter with the number of data intervals expected. The number of expected intervals is detennined by the times of first and last recorded data points and the sampling rate. The second check compares the number of data intervals expected fran the first record after the reter goes into the water to the first record after the reter is out of the water again, with the actual number of intervals recorded for that time period. \u2022 The point at which the reter first enters the water (or leaves the water) is clearly indicated by the sudden changes in conductivity, tanperature, and pressure. If the tim:! check for a file of data works out exactly, i.e., there are no missing or extra data points, that file is ready for the next processing phase. If there are missing or extra data points (due to reter malfunction), their locations in the tire series data record must be fotm.d, and data points added or deleted as necessary; othe!:wise the data record carmot be used because titre assigment will be uncertain. If the Aanderaa =ent reter that produced the data record was equipped with a titre counter TlXldule, finding the locations of missing or extra data words is an easy task. This consists of rerely finding intervals Ylhere one hour mark falls less than (or roore than) six intervals after the previous hour mark. For Aanderaa reters not equipped . with marks' one must visually analyze a plot of the data file and hope that either an obvious malfunction oc=ed, or that by comparing the progression of maximum flood tinEs to other reter plots (at different depths) at the same station, one can determine the location of the missing or extra intervals. The next stage of processing incorporates a software program called PHASE 3. Arr:j extra data words that must be deleted, or any missing data words that must be added, are done with this program. Periods during which the reter was recording while sitting on the ship (before and after deplo~t) are el:inti.nated fran the file. Finally, the entire data file is statistically edited. This canputerized editing scheme uses a Wiener-predictor algoritlm and edits only those data words with erroneous values that could only have been caused by mechanical or electronic malftmction. No s=ound:ing data words are changed (no data srroothing is done) , and all edited words are flagged. The tape created by PHASE 3 (which has the same efficient data storage format as the tape created by PHASE 2) is the final data tape. At least one duplicate backup tape is made, and at the end of a survey, several PHASE 3 tapes are usually combined onto one tape for storage efficiency. Dt.n:ing this entire processing procedure, careful doctliilentation records are maintained for each processing stage. This includes tape numbers, file numbers, time-checking results, data quality COIIlllents, and time series plots for each station depth. The final data are stored in canpact form for future use, and are sent to the National Oceanographic Data Center. Reduction of the ENDEOJ-174 current meter data was performed by the USGS on a data processing system structured around a microcanputer and an .ENDEOJ-173 tape translator (Cheng and ,Gartner, 1980). The system consists of . . an LSI-11 microcanputer, two floppy disk drives, a 9-track tape drive, a line printer, a cathode-ray-tube (CRT) terminal, and the data tape translator. The CRT terminal performs the main input-output (I/O) control of the system and hard-copy output is produced on the line printer. System software resides on one floppy disk whereas the other is utilized for translation and storage of the binary raM data recovered fran the current meter tapes via the tape translator. The translator sequentially reads one block (one hour) of four bit data,-stores it in nao:>ry, combines pairs of four bit data series into bytes, and sends the block of data to the microcanputer for storage on the floppy disk. Once the raM binary data are stored on disk, various checks are performed to examine the data quality. These include an examination of the daily conductivity reference values and 24-hour record marks, in addition to a check of data canpleteness by canparison of the logged meter on and off times with the number of data readings. Any missing data are added as \"dumny\" readings to correct the t:iming of the remaining series. Questionable temperature and conductivity readings are also identified and hand-edited where necessary, and any erroneous readings due to mechanical failure are eliminated. The twominute data are then translated and a:veraged, utilizing calibration data wique to each current meter. The 30-minute a:verages (speed and direction vector a:veraged) are plotted to pemit a visual check for any e=oneous readings not previously determined during examination of the ra:vv data files. As a final step, the edited data files are translated into engineering units and stored on 9-track tape in the standard NODC format. The data files were provided unedited to NOM/NOS for further analyses. All current meter data processed by the USGS are stored on computer retrievable media in 2-minute and 30-minute form. 3.0.

Six of the tide stations listed were in continuous operation\u2022 and are part of the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON); a network of continuously operating stations operated by NOS in United States coastal zones including the Pacific, Atlantic, Carribean, and the Great Lakes \u2022 During the time period of the survey, two other NOS projects were ongoing during which tide station installations and removals were coordinated. The first project was the Q1BP liEiltioned in section 1.2., and the second was an ongoing NOS hydrographic survey, during which a hydrographic survey party installed and operated stations in portions of the survey area. These stations are indicated on table 7. NOAA Ship McARTHUR persormel were responsible for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the circulation survey tide stations. 1!-bst of the tide stations were installed and rerroved to coincide with the ct=ent station schedule to maximize the arwunt of simultaneous vertical and horizontal data.       \"' . .,... .c...., \"'\" u \"1\"')0.   ..."}, {"section_title": "20'", "text": "38-oD'\n37'00' ... ...\n122'\"00'"}, {"section_title": "Tide Station Locations", "text": "The total number of stations in operation, and the total number of station days of occupation during the time period from Jarruary 1979to December 1980  All except three of the short-term stations were historical stations occupied during the CMBP. l-bst of the published datums are based on occupations which oc=ed prior to the circulation survey. A m:in:imum am::nmt of reconnaissance and bench mark establishment was required for this survey because IIXJSt stations were recent historical stations with established bench marks and 'Well documented tide gage locations ."}, {"section_title": "Instrumentation and Installation", "text": "All tide stations established by the MCARTHUR for the survey consisted of the following carq:>onents : 1. analog-to-digital (ADR) tide gage, float, and floatwire; 2. stilling well; 3. support structure(s); 4. tide staff; and 5. tidal bench mark nettrork. The ADR tide gages used in the program were pro=ed from two manufacturers, Fischer & Porter and Leupold & Stevens. Both types of gages, in general, employ identical principles of operation and 'Were thus used interchangeably throughout the program. Each has a maximum range of 50 feet and records water level heights to hundredths of a foot, mechanically converting angular positions of a rotating shaft with a float, wire, and float reel assembly into binary coded ( 8, 4, 2, 1) decimal output. This information is recorded on a 16-channel foil-back data tape being punched every 6 minutes. The data sampling interval of 6 minutes is controlled by a solid-state t:i.lmr. The gages are powered by a 7 .5-volt battery and are protected fran the elements by weatherproof se=ity covers. The stillmg well is a vertical tube with a relatively small opening (orifice) in the bottcm. It is used in a tide gage installation to. dampen high frequency waves while freely admitting the tide to actuate a float which, in turn, operates the tide gage. It extends to a water depth well below, if possible, that of the lowest tide. A schedule 40, 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was used in IIDSt cases. Occasionally, however, stilling wells already established by other agencies, such as U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and California Departlllent of Water Resources were available and were utilized by the field parties. These stilling wells varied in size and type. The tide. staff is a nonrecording tide gage consisting of a vertical graduated staff fran which the height of the tide can be read directly. It is graduated in feet and tenths of a foot with the length va.rying, dependent upon type and manufacturer. Owing to marine fouling, the tide staff is l.lSUS.lly made of or coated with an easily cleaned surface such as fiberglass or vitrified enamel. It is used as a reference standard for canparative observations (staff to gage differences) and is related to local bench marks by differential levels. At each station, a network of at least five tidal bench marks was established through evaluation of historical bench marks and/or the setting of new bench marks . The standard tidal bench mark of NOS, to which the tide staff and tidal datums are referred, is a brass disk 3-5/8 inches in diameter, either set into a permanent structure such as a bridge abutment or bedrock, or set on a deep-driven rod. The gas-purged pressure gage, ccnm:mly kriown as a ''bubbler,\" is an analog-type gage which was occasionally used as a backup gage at the NWLON stations. It is a portable pressure-recording instrl.lr!Ent that produces a continuous strip chart record of water level changes. The 1.mderwater part of the gage consists of a small orifice chamber attached to a gas supply tube. The shore end of the tubing is cormected to the gas system (pressure regulation mechanism and nitrogen gas storage tank) and to the transducer (temperature-compensated pressure bellows) and a strip chart recorder. The Metercraft Model 7601 was typically used. Additional information on this tide gage is contained in Metercraft's \"Instruction: Dry Purged Pressure Recording Tide Gauge by Metercraft.\" The first step in establishing a tide station was a thorough reconnaissance of the prospective site. A reconnaissance :irnrolved traveling to the site and performing the foll<l'~ tasks: 1. Evaluation of all historical tidal bench marks (if any) and any other bench marks which were set in the area by other agencies . Any National Geodetic Vertical Control Network (NGVCN) bench marks within a 1-mile radius of the site also were recovered. If additional bench marks were needed, prospective sites were designated. 2. Locating a suitable support structure with sufficient water depth and accessibility. If no support structure was available, the selection of a suitable site for the construction of a support structure was necessary. In both cases a detailed list of materials and equipment needed to install the tide station was compiled. "}, {"section_title": "Locating a potential tide observer.", "text": "The next step was the actual establishment of the tide station. A typical installation consisted of the stilling well being attached by various types of brackets and/or stainless steel bands to a pile. Piles were utilized frcm piers (figure 8) , fenders, channel markers, bridges, railroad trestles, or were scmetimes freestanding. If a pile or a previously established stilling well (frcm another agency), or scme other suitable structure, was not available, a support structure had to be constructed. The support structures \u2022constructed were either freestanding piles jetted into the bottcm with bracing batters or a three-or four-corner platform. The tide staff was fastened to a support backing, usually a 2-by 6-foot treated plank, and was preferably attached to a different pile than the stilling well in order to isolate any settlement proble:ns. The tide staff was placed so that it covered the full range of tide, was easily visible to the tide observer, and accessible for cleaning and surveying. Most of the tide stations were installed at lCJ~o~er low waters to allow the c~ stilling wells and staffs to be se=ed to the support structures as far down ' ;o as possible. In scme cases, this was not feasible and scuba diving was required to make the proper installation. Bench marks at each tide station were established in accordance with the \"User 1 s Guide for the Establishment of Tidal Bench Marks and Leveling Requirements for Tide Stations (User 1 s Guide) . \" A network of at least five tidal bench marks was established at each tide station by recovery and/or the setting of new bench marks. The types of bench marks set, at least 200 feet apart, were bedrock, deep rod, and = t (large man-made structures).. They were standard NOS brass survey disks stamped with the last four digits of the respective tide station rrumber, a designating letter, and the year. All differential leveling an:ong the tide staff, tidal bench marks , and the NGVCN bench marks was performed to the data quality standards (frequency,  Differential levels to all five bench marks -were nm at each tide station upon installation. The instrumentation available were Zeiss Ni 2 autcm:~.tic levels. At NWLON and stations installed for the CMBP, Second order, Class I differential levels were ~ using the 3-meter Zeiss precise rod 112 with an invar scale and half-centimeter graduations . At all other stations, third order differential levels were nm using the Metagrad Philadelphia rods graduated in centimeters. The hiring and training of the tide observer was one of the llXlSt important aspects of the tide station installation. A canpetent, well-trained tide observer makes a significant difference in the quality of the tidal data produced by a tide station. In many instances, ship personnel served as tide station observers. Tide station documentation forms; photographs; a largescale map section indicating the station location, a sketch of the bench marks, tide gage, and staff locations; and a description of how to reach the tide station from a major landmark, were forwarded to Rockville, Maryland, as a tide station package. To install deep rod bench marks, different equitxnent and procedures were anployed. After a site was selected, and permission obtained, the local utility companies were contacted (if deemed necessary) to determine if any cables or pipes were located in the area. This was accomplished during recormaissance. Installation was begun by digging a hole approximately 1-~ feet deep by 1 foot in diameter. A section of 5/8-inch diameter, 8-foot long galvanized steel rod (NOS is now using 9/16-inch diameter type 304 stainless steel rods in 4-foot sections) was held vertically in the center of the hole and pushed in as far as possible by hand. A gasoline-powered rock drill with a pipe tamper attachment elevated by a portable aluminum \"A\" freme (or by standing up on the side of a truck's utility body) was used to drive the rod down (figure 9d). Rods were cormected to each other by couplers sealed with pipe joint ccmpotm.d. When the rod had been driven to refusal or 50 feet, the excess was cut off and the bench mark disk cr:imped on below grade, using a hydraulic hand pump. A short section of 4-inch PVC pipe was placed armmd the bench mark and a cement kickblock was poured armmd the pipe. A witness post was also installed if circumstances warranted it."}, {"section_title": ". .. Operation and Maintenance", "text": "Once a tide station was installed, it was incorporated into a regular cycle of m:>nitoring and maintenance. Monitoring was accomplished in two steps. First was a m:>nthly roll scan by field personnel performed during the first part of each m:>nth after all the tide rolls had been collected. Upon receipt, the rolls were scanned for data defects such as Jrechanical, time, and/ or observer problems . The problems were noted for corrective action as a processing aid for data quality assurance and data tabulation. All but the m:>st subtle problems were identified and remedied in a timely fashion by this first step. The second step was performed by the Tidalllnalysis Section in Rockville. If additional problems were identified during the processing of a roll, the ship was notified by telephone and a follow-up prel:il!l:inary evaluation form. Emergency repairs were performed on a tide station if either of the previous steps revealed a problan. In addition, the ship was notified of problems by telephone by the tide observer responsible for the tide station. At tide stations of sufficient duration, saniannual inspections were performed. These involve leveling to three bench marks, a visual inspection of the tide gage and the past week of ptmched data, contact with the tide observer, and if the ADR gage was a Leupold & Stevens, a torque test to measure the bearing friction. Torque tests were performed rrore frequently at tide stations susceptible to bearing deterioration, such as tide stations in areas of low tidal range and/or high salinity. Amrual inspectionS were performed at tide stations of sufficient duration. The anrrual inspection was identical to the sanianrrual inspection e.'tcept that all five bench marks were leveled and their descriptions verified. The remJVal of a tide station involved leveling to all five bench marks, rerroval of all equipment except the bench marks, and restoration of the site to its original condition, unless requested otherwise by the property owner."}, {"section_title": "Tidal Datums and Data Products", "text": "Tidal . datums are canputed for each station after tabulation and verification of the tide data, and after verification of the geodetic levels. Datums are canputed using procedures detailed in the NOS Special Publication No. 135, Tidal Datum Planes, by H. A. Mamer. Tidal datums are vertical datums defined in terms of observed tidal phenomenon over a specific 19-year cycle called a National Tidal Datum Epoch. The present epoch in use is 1960 -1978. The computation procedures use a method of simultaneous comparison in which stations with shorter series (less than 19 years) are compared with nearby primary control stations, to derive equivalent 19-year datums. The primary control stations for the San Francisco Bay Area Circulation Survey were Presidio (941-4290) and Alameda (941-4750). These two stations have datums determined from observations over the 1960 -1978 epoch. Typical tidal datums computed for the San Francisco Bay area are mean higher high water, mean high water, mean tide level, mean low water, mean lower low water, and mean sea level. If a valid geodetic level connection from the tidal bench marks to the geodetic bench mark network has been made, the tidal datums are referenced to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) . This type of information is provided on a published bench mark sheet for each station. These bench mark sheets also contain information on how to reach the stations and individual bench mark descriptions. The following data products are available from each of the tide stations: 6-m:i.rrute height tabulations (liDR gages only), hourly height tabulations, t:i.Ire , and height of high and low water tabulations, published bench mark sheets, harm:mic constants and reductions from 29-day Fourier hal:m::lnic analyses, and tidal predictions.

The data\u2022 will provide for construction of offshore cotidal charts for offshore tidal zoning for future hydrographic surveys through interpolation with, as opposed to extrapolation from, onshore data. 'llilo. deep-sea tide gage (DSTG) systems were deployed from the NOAA Ship McARTHUR on April 8, 1980, at the locations shown on figure 10. During deployment, the canponents shown in figure ll were first attached to a surface float by a length of nylon line and an acoustic release to test for leaks and tilting. Following the tests, the systems were released to descend to the ocean floor. During retrieval, the releases connecting the gage to the tripod base were fired (activated); the gage and flotation '!IDit ascended to the surface; and a flashing light and radio beacon transmitter were activated to aid in recovery."}, {"section_title": "20.", "text": "37\"00.  Both DSTG deploym:nts went sm:Jothly with both systems operational when released for descent. Only one of the two systems was retrieved in August 1980 during the recovery operation. MUltiple attempts to interrogate and fire the acoustic releases on the second 1.mit were made, and following an -exhaustive search effort, retrieval operations were terminated. The cause of system failure is tmknown. Excellent data were obtained from the deep water location, 941-4093, figure 10. The data were reduced, and hourly heights were tabulated for the time period, April 8 to August 6, 1980. Harmmic analyses (29-day) were perforned and hanooni.c constants are available for May, Jnne, and July, 1980. The NOAA deep-sea tide gages used in these two deploym:nts were manufactured by Gulf General Atcmic Corporation and designed by Jean H. Filloox (1970). The sensor is a temperature independent Bourdon tube pressure transducer with a frictionless optical readout. The relative pressure was recorded at half-hourly intervals on a Rustrak strip chart recorder. An Accutron timer controls the reference timing marks and the sampling rate. Figure 11 is a schematic of the !IXXlring configuration as the system appeared on the ocean floor. The housing of the gage is a 66-cm diameter aluminum sphere =ted on an aluminum instrument base. The two AMF acoustic releases flanking the gage are connected by a chain arrangement such that if either release is fired, the instrument base and gage would be freed from the tripod base. A syntactic foam buoy attached to the instrument base by 40 meters of cable provides floatation. The gage systems are equipped with leak and tilt detectors which are tested through appropriate interrogations of the acoustic release transponders. The intense abyssal pressure enc0tu1tered at operating depths causes creep of the Bourdon tube. Previous observations (Pearson, 1975) show that the creep, which results in an apparent mmotonic increase in sea level pressure, can be approximated by a logarithmic curVe. The rate of creep is generally less than 1 meter in the first mmth of deploym:nt and decreases with time. A data reduction computer program is used to apply calibration constants and scale shifts to the raw data, and then to correct for creep by a least,-squares fitting of the data to a creep =ve. This =ve is then subtracted fran the data. The corrected data were tabulated at hourly int~ls to fonn the time series analyzed for this survey."}, {"section_title": "7. Water-Level Records", "text": "The llnderaa water-level recorders, Model WLR-5, were lll01.IDted with special brackets on bottan platfonns (section 2. 2. ) . These instruments, whose specifications are shown in table 8, employ a quartz crystal pressure sensor capable of resolving variations in water level at depths of several lnmdred m=ters . The instruments average the pressure over an integration time to eliminate effects due to waves. At the end of the integration time, the recording of data starts first with a fixed 10-bit reference reading, followed by a 10-bit block number, and then the pressure, which is recorded as two 10-bit words. The WLR records were be processed with the new Circulation Measurements Data Processing\u2022 (CMDP) system. For a detailed doCU!IEiltation of the system, see \"Certification of the Circulatory Measurements Data Processing System\" (Patchen, et al. , 1982). The\u2022 system can display raw data, plot it graphically, convert it to engineering mrits, and perfonn autanated time checking. Instrument malftmction statistics are also collected and made available in graphic fonn to the shipboard electronics personnel for IIDre rapid diagnosis of those instruments in need of maintenance or repair. The system can process data fran Aanderaa current m=ters, m=teorological stations, water level recorders, Grtmdy current m=ters, and.Applied Microsystems, Ltd. (AMI..) CID mrits. CMDP output tapes are converted to a fonn canpatible with the NOS UNIVAC mainframe which integrates the CMDP tapes into the NOS in-house processing and analysis system. Conductivity and temperature data at specified depths (CID) are important in understanding the effect of density structure on circulation, especially on nontidal circulation. Salinity is computed fran conductivity and temperature during the processing of the ClD data, resulting in S'ID data. A comprehensive S'ID program defines temporal and spatial variations in the density field. Variations over large spatial scales, both tr~se and longitudinal, temporal variations over complete tidal cycles, and seasonal variations are derived fran the S'ID data. The three types of IDS STD stations are as follows: (1) Time-Series Stations (TS), where observations are obtained at fixed locations, taking a surface-to-bottan cast at approximately half-hour intervals over a 25-hour period. These observations describe the variability of the density field versus depth over a tidal cycle. The results are also used in the evaluation of the synopticity of the transect (ST) type stations. :': The TS station locations ;vere chosen to provide comprehensive spatial coverage, as ;vell as seasonal variations, when operationally feasible. (2) Transect Stations (ST), where S'ID casts are made along either a transverse or longitudinal line at slack-before-flood and at slack-before-ebb. This information indicates the density structure at one \"synoptic\" stage for a specified cross section. As with the TS station locations, the ST stations were chosen, and the transects nm, to provide comprehensive spatial and seasonal coverage. (3) Single Stations (S), where casts are obtained at various o=ent station locations throughout the region to complete the spatial picture and to investigate whether local anomalies might exist in the density regime. As discussed earlier in section 1. 0. , the NOS S'ID effort was greatly enhanced by the USGS water sampling program (section 5. 0. ) . Following the spring 1979 field season, the NOS STD program was generally limited to TS stations and deep water transects . Figure 12 displays the NOS S'ID transects and t:ime-series stations, and tables 9, 10, and 11 provide the following NOS S'ID information: station !1l11Ilber and coordinates, date and t:ime of cast, water depth, type of cast, the depth at which the deepest record was acquired for each cast, instrument type, and present data products. For those stations which were part of a transect (ST), the transect !1l11Ilber (figure 12) and run !1l11Ilber are listed under type of cast.

During the period of the San Francisco Bay Area Circulation Survey, the USGS established four rem:>te meteorological station locations in addition to the three station.location5 maintained by NOAA/NOS. The NOS stations were located in San Francisco Bay proper and the USGS stations were located in South San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and Suisnn Bay (figure 3). The NOS stations recorded average wind speed, direction, temperature, and anoospheric pressure. In addition to the NOS station parameters, the USGS stations also recorded maximum wind speed, visible radiation, and solar radiation. The USGS is using the meteorological data in conjnnction with the water-sampling data (section 5. 0. ) to support ongoing physical, chemical, and biological studies in the estuary.

HISTORICAL DATA"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The National Ocean Service, fomerly the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, created in 1807, has been responsible for the acquisition of a=ent, tide, temperature, and salinity data for allrost 180 years. This section will include those data that have been collected for the San Francisco Bay area during the history of NOS. As discussed in section 1.1. , there bas been a significant !l!roUilt of sedimentation, land reclamation, and dredging in the Bay since 1850, which bas resulted in substantial physical changes. The historical tide and current data are extre!!mly valuable in that they show how the water properties have changed as a result of the changing coastline and Bay bat:b.ynetry. In comparing the historical data to present data, one nust consider the constantly improving state of the art of data acquisition and analysis over the past 100 years. Details concerning these historical data are presented throughout the remainder of this section. Of significant importance are the historical tidal neasurements in the Golden Gate. The leveling corm.ections am:mg the bench marks of the tide stations at Fort Point, Sausalito, and the Presidio, between 1854 and the present, provide a continuous set of tidal measurements at the C-olden Gate area (Smith, 1980). This is the only location in the United States with over 100 years of continuous tidal rreasurements, making the data set important for global sea level analysis, variability of water level relative to land over long periods, and historical tidal boundary determination."}, {"section_title": "2.

The data taken from the 277 stations between the years 1856 and 1930 are not SUIIlnarized in t.'ri.s report but are available on request; these data were generally less than 5 days duration and were measured with Price current meters and a=ent poles.    ........
