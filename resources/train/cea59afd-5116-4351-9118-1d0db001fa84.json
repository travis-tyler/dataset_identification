In addition, results from surveys are subject to nonsampling errors. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, and other systematic error.

It recently released fi ndings from two of these assessments, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) (formerly known as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), both conducted in 2003, which are the focus of this issue of the Quarterly. TIMSS, organized internationally by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), is an assessment in math and science. Much like the National Assessment of Educational Progress in this country, TIMSS tests students' mastery of the curricula expected to be taught. Beginning in 1995 and with subsequent assessments in 1999 and 2003, TIMSS is conducted on a 4-year cycle. Testing was conducted in the United States at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades in 1995; at the 8th grade in 1999; and at the 4th and 8th grades in 2003. The framework that guides the development of TIMSS is based on expert judgment of the content that is expected to be taught at the 4th and 8th grades in participating countries. The same assessment is administered in each participating nation, except for the language that it is given in, and can help to distinguish the knowledge level of students in the same grades in different countries. Although the makeup of the groups of nations participating in TIMSS has varied, the United States has participated in each administration at each grade level. In 2003, 46 nations participated at one or both grades. For 15 nations, trend data are available for 4th-graders from 1995 to 2003; for 34 nations, trend data are available for 8th-graders from either 1995 or 1999 to 2003. PISA, which is organized internationally by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is on a 3-year cycle and was conducted in 2000 and 2003. PISA assesses students at age 15, regardless of grade. Three areas are assessed in each administration of PISA-reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy-with one area being the focus of the assessment. The focus area includes more items in the assessment and receives a more detailed analysis and reporting of results. In 2003, the area of focus was mathematics literacy. Literacy is defi ned in PISA as the ability to apply knowledge and skills gained in school or elsewhere to a broad range of situations. To test students' literacy, assessment items are therefore set in situations, or use materials, from everyday life whose solutions require the application of subject-area knowledge. Math items, for example, often use charts or graphs that students need to understand in order to solve the problem that is presented. Participating countries are required to draw samples that are nationally representative. In 2003, almost 19,000 U.S. students participated in TIMSS and almost 5,500 U.S. students participated in PISA, drawn from public and private schools sampled across the country."}, {"section_title": "How TIMSS and PISA Differ", "text": "What is assessed Perhaps most signifi cantly, TIMSS and PISA differ in what they test. Whereas TIMSS tests students' mastery of the specifi c knowledge, skills, and concepts that are typically taught as part of school curricula, PISA tests students' ability to apply what they have learned to real-life situations. Thus, assessment items in PISA are presented in a variety of situations that students might encounter. The different emphases also are refl ected in a difference in the format of the assessments: About two-thirds of the items in TIMSS are multiple choice, compared to about one-third of the items in PISA. PISA relies more heavily on constructedresponse, or open-ended, items."}, {"section_title": "Students and countries assessed", "text": "Another important distinction between the two assessments is that TIMSS student samples are selected by grade, whereas PISA student samples are selected by age. While TIMSS focuses on assessing curricular learning at consistent grade levels in participating countries, PISA focuses on assessing the \"yield\" of education systems as students make the transition from school to society at large. PISA assesses students only at age 15; in 2003, 61 percent of the U.S. students participating in PISA were in the 10th grade. Similarly, most PISA students in other participating countries are also in a grade that is near the end of compulsory schooling. Finally, the characteristics of the groups of participating countries differ. The 46 countries that participated in TIMSS in 2003 represent a wide range of development, with only 13 belonging to the OECD, and the international averages that are reported include all participating countries. In contrast, in 2003, participants in PISA included all 30 member countries of the OECD as well as 11 other countries. Thus, the participants in PISA are weighted toward developed countries. Furthermore, the international averages that are reported for PISA include only the OECD countries. Because of these differences, TIMSS and PISA provide different kinds of information about different sample populations. The studies are complementary, but the results are not directly comparable."}, {"section_title": "Assessing problem-solving skills", "text": "In TIMSS, the assessment frameworks for grades 4 and 8 in 2003 included \"problem-solving and inquiry\" tasks. These tasks assessed how well students can \"draw on and integrate information and processes in mathematics and science to solve problems.\" The problemsolving and inquiry tasks were embedded in the TIMSS math and science items and did not receive a separate score. In PISA, each administration, in addition to literacy areas, assesses a different cross-curricular competency that is not repeated in following administrations. Unlike the problem-solving and inquiry tasks in TIMSS, the cross-curricular items are distinct from the literacy items and receive a separate score. In 2003, the competency that was assessed was problem solving. To solve problem-solving items, students apply multistep reasoning to novel situations. Three types of problem-solving items were presented: \"system analysis and design, where students had to use information about a complex situation to analyze or design a system that met stated goals; troubleshooting, where students had to understand the reasons behind a malfunctioning device or system; and decisionmaking, where students had to make decisions based on a variety of alternatives and constraints.\" * * * * * * * The results for TIMSS tell us that U.S. 4th-and 8th-graders scored higher than the international averages in math and science in 2003; however, between 1995 and 2003, while U.S. 8th-graders' scores and international standing increased, U.S. 4th-graders' scores remained the same and their standing decreased. The results for PISA show us that U.S. 15-year-olds in 2003 scored lower, on average, in math literacy and problem solving than the OECD averages. Despite the differences between the two assessments, both document that a number of Asian and European countries outperformed the United States in these critical areas in 2003. Joan Ferrini-Mundy, University Distinguished Professor, Michigan State University, discusses these and other fi ndings as well as their implications in the invited commentary in this issue of the Quarterly.

TIMSS can be used to track changes in achievement over time. Moreover, TIMSS is closely linked to the curricula of the participating countries, providing an indication of the degree to which students have learned concepts in mathematics and science they have encountered in school. In 2003, some 46 countries participated in TIMSS, at either the fourth-or eighth-grade level, or both. This summary highlights initial fi ndings on the performance of U.S. fourth-and eighth grade students relative to their peers in other countries on the TIMSS assessment. The summary is based on the fi ndings presented in two reports published by the IEA: 2003 International Mathematics Report: Findings From IEA' s Trends in International Mathematics andScience Study at the Eighth andFourth Grades (Mullis et al. 2004); and  Eighth and Fourth Grades (Martin et al. 2004). These two IEA reports were simultaneously published with this summary report and are available online at http://www. timss.org. This summary report describes the mathematics and science performance of fourth-and eighth-graders in participating countries over time. For a number of the participating countries, changes in mathematics and science achievement can be documented over 8 years, from 1995 to 2003. For others, changes can be documented over a shorter period of time, 4 years (from 1999 to 2003). Table A shows the countries that participated in TIMSS 2003, and their participation in earlier TIMSS data collections.* The fourth-grade assessment was offered in 1995 and 2003, while the eighthgrade assessment was offered in 1995, 1999, and 2003. Average student performance in the United States is compared to that of students in other countries that participated in each assessment: All countries that participated in TIMSS 2003 were required to draw random, nationally representative samples of students and schools.

TAB provides descriptive information about children born in the United States in 2001. It presents information on certain child and family characteristics, on children's mental and physical skills, on children's fi rst experiences in child care, and on the fathers of these children. The report profi les data from a nationally representative sample of children at about 9 months of age, both overall and for various subgroups (i.e., male and female, children from different racial/ethnic groups, and children living in different types of families).\nIn  Beginning in 1995, the PSS defi nition of a school was expanded to include those schools for which kindergarten was the highest grade, referred to as kindergartenterminal (k-terminal) schools. Estimates presented in this report, except those presented in appendix D of the complete report, are for schools (traditional schools) meeting the more restrictive pre-1995 PSS defi nition of having at least one of grades 1 through 12. 2 For a description of typology, see the glossary in the complete report.\nThis report presents fi ndings from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) winter 2002-03 data collection that included both primary occupational activity information for staff 1 employed in fall 2002 and salaries and fringe benefi ts of full-time instructional faculty 2 for academic year 2002-03. The data included in this publication were collected through the IPEDS web-based data collection system. IPEDS began collecting data in 1985 from all postsecondary institutions in the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) and its outlying areas. 3 Prior to that, institutions of higher education provided data through the Higher Education General Information Surveys (HEGIS), which began in 1966. IPEDS defi nes a postsecondary institution as an organization that is open to the public and has a primary mission of providing education or training beyond the high school level. This includes institutions that offer academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs and excludes institutions that offer only avocational (leisure) and adult basic education programs. Since 1992, participation in IPEDS has been required for all postsecondary institutions and central or system offi ces that participate in Title IV federal student fi nancial aid programs, such as Pell Grants or Stafford Loans. 4 During the 2002-03 academic year, 6,508 institutions and 80 central or system offi ces were required to participate in IPEDS.

Respondents who reported being married are coded as \"Married.\" Respondents living in households with another adult member (over age 16) and who were separated, divorced, widowed, or never married were asked if they were currently living with a partner. If the respondents reported that they were living with a partner, they are coded as \"Living with a partner, not married\" regardless of their current marital status (i.e., separated, divorced, widowed, and never married).

Respondents not living with a partner or living in households with no other adults who reported being separated, divorced, or widowed are coded as \"Separated/divorced/widowed.\" Respondents not living with a partner or living in households with no other adults who reported never having been married are coded as \"Never married.\" A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine whether the relationships observed in the bivariate analysis are also observed when they are examined simultaneously. The results of the regression analysis were consistent with the bivariate analyses for marital status, prior educational attainment, occupation, employer size, continuing education requirement, race/ethnicity, and household income.\nProfessional or managerial occupations include executive and managerial occupations, engineers, natural scientists, social scientists, teachers, health diagnosing, registered nurses, writers, health technologies; service, sales, or support occupations include technologists, marketing and sales occupations, administrative support, service occupations, miscellaneous occupations; trades occupations include agricultural occupations, mechanics, construction occupations, precision production occupations, production working occupations, transportation and laborer occupations.\nThe estimates in this Issue Brief were produced using F4PNLWT, the panel weight for eighth-grade members of the NELS:88 base-year sample who also participated in the fi rst, second, third, and fourth follow-ups. The unweighted sample size was 10,827 cases, representing the approximately 2.9 million people living in the United States in the year 2000 who were members of the eighth-grade class of 1988. This sample size is smaller than that used in Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman's (1998) analysis and may yield slightly different results. 32 percent reportedly not enrolled or not working toward a diploma or equivalent. 6 Consistent with Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman's (1998) analysis of high school completion status as of 1994, this analysis shows that high school dropouts' characteristics as of eighth grade (socioeconomic status, test performance, and expectations of eventually earning a bachelor's degree or higher) were associated with earning a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000. As shown in table 2, 7 percent of dropouts whose families were in the highest socioeconomic status quarter in 1988 had not attained a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000. In contrast, 31 percent of dropouts in the middle socioeconomic status range and 49 percent of dropouts in the lowest quarter had not done so as of 2000. As of 2000, 43 percent of dropouts whose NELS reading and mathematics composite test score was in the bottom quarter had not earned a diploma or alternative credential and were not working toward a diploma or equivalent, compared to 26 percent of dropouts who scored in the middle range and 16 percent of dropouts who scored in the highest quarter. Dropouts who reported in eighth grade that they expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher were more likely to have earned a high school diploma or alternative credential by 2000 than their peers with lower educational expectations. As shown in table 2, some 50 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would fi nish high school or less had not earned a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000; in contrast, 25 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would earn a bachelor's degree or higher had not earned a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000. By 2000, 23 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would earn a bachelor's degree or higher had not earned a high school credential and were not working toward one; by comparison, 44 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would fi nish high school or less had not earned a high school credential and were not working toward one.\nIncludes students who earned a high school diploma or alternative credential between the NELS third follow-up and the NELS fourth follow-up in spring 2000.

Estimates presented in this Brief may be biased slightly if these nonrespondents were less likely to have received a high school credential than those who responded to all surveys.

A snapshot of the nature of curriculum and the nature of instruction available to students would provide additional useful context for interpretation. The uneven progress overall in the 8 years between TIMSS 1995 and TIMSS 2003 may indicate that efforts to improve mathematics performance in the United States lack collective focus, coherence, intensity, or scale-and that continued efforts to make improvements, together with research designed to understand the interventions and track their impact, are needed. The fi ndings in these reports suggest the importance of secondary analyses and additional studies that probe in detail to better understand the contexts, conditions, and interventions that may have been at play in settings where improvement in achievement is occurring and the achievement gap is narrowing.\nStates that reported completers but not 4 consecutive years of dropout data cannot have a 4-year high school completion rate.

Four-year completion rates for 9th-grade public school students, by state: 2000-01 For youth to fulfi ll their potential in school, schools should be safe and secure places for all students, teachers, and staff members. Without a safe learning environment, teachers may have diffi culty teaching and students may have diffi culty learning. Gauging the safety of the school environment, however, may be diffi cult given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence nationwide. Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and periodically monitoring and updating these indicators. Indicators of School Crime and Safety is designed to provide an annual snapshot of specifi c crime and safety indicators, covering topics such as victimization, fi ghts, bullying, classroom disorder, teacher injury, weapons, and student perceptions of school safety. In addition to covering a wide range of topics, the indicators are based on information drawn from a wide range of sources, including surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections by federal departments and agencies such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe combined rate of degree completion and persistence includes the small percentage of students enrolled in a less-than-4-year institution. For students who started in a 4-year college, being enrolled in a less-than-4-year institution would not be an indication of persisting toward a bachelor's degree. Figure B.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1990 It is diffi cult to pinpoint what accounts for the increase in persistence between the two cohorts and to determine whether or not it is a temporary occurrence. Changes in the demographic composition of the two cohorts may be related to the changes in persistence. Black, Hispanic, and low-income students gained greater representation between 1989-90 and 1995-96. Such students have historically been underrepresented in postsecondary education and often face additional barriers to completing a degree. However, the data indicate that low-income students in public 4-year institutions actually increased their likelihood of succeeding as evidenced by an increase in their 5-year persistence rate. Also, the percentage of students whose parents graduated from college rose over time, which would typically be associated with higher completion and persistence rates. Changes in students' reliance on loans may also have infl uenced their decision to stay enrolled. Students who entered college in 1995-96 were more likely than their counterparts who enrolled 6 years earlier to have taken out student loans to help fi nance their education. Over the course of their postsecondary studies, nearly one-half of these students borrowed, compared with about one-third of their counterparts who had enrolled earlier. The prospect of leaving college in debt may have motivated these students to stay enrolled and complete a degree. It is also possible that the economy played a role in changing the rates at which students persisted. Students who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90 and who were still enrolled in college 5 years later (in 1994) encountered a growing economy with plentiful job opportunities (Schwenk and Pfuntner 2003). Those students who had not yet fi nished their degree may have been attracted to the high-tech industry job market and thought they could join the labor force and return later to fi nish their degree. On the other hand, students who began college in 1995-96 and who were still enrolled 5 years later (in 2000) faced an economy in the beginning stages of a recession (Martel and Langdon 2001). With fewer job options and greater debt, these students may have been less willing to take a break from their studies and leave without a degree.\nAdults who did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent or who received a high school diploma in the past 12 months are included in the participation rate.\nParticipants include those who participated in college programs on a part-time basis (an estimated 886,384 adults) as well as those who participated on both part-time and full-time bases in the previous 12 months (an estimated 1,981,794 adults).

If a sampled child had no mother and no father in the household, parent information was collected about the guardian responding to the interview. path, data were collected about enrollment in school, school characteristics, student academics and behavior at school, before-and after-school care arrangements and programs, before-and after-school activities, self-care, parental care during the out-of-school hours, program continuity, parental perceptions of the quality of arrangements, and factors in parental choice of arrangement.

PISA was fi rst implemented in 2000 and is carried out by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization of industrialized countries. Each PISA data collection effort assesses one subject area in depth, even as all three are assessed in each cycle so that participating countries have an ongoing source of achievement data in every subject area. In addition to the major subject areas of reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy, PISA also measures general or cross-curricular competencies such as learning strategies. In this second cycle, PISA 2003, mathematics literacy was the subject area assessed in depth, along with the new cross-curricular area of problem solving. Major fi ndings for 2003 in mathematics literacy and problem solving are provided here, as well as brief discussions of student performance in reading literacy and science literacy and changes in performance between 2000 and 2003.

The United States also performed below the OECD average on each mathematics literacy subscale representing a specifi c content area (space and shape, change and relationships, quantity, and uncertainty). This is somewhat different from the PISA 2000 results, when reading literacy was the major subject area, which showed the United States performing at the OECD average (Lemke et al. 2001). Along with scale scores, PISA 2003 also uses six profi ciency levels (levels 1 through 6, with level 6 being the highest level of profi ciency) to describe student performance in mathematics literacy and three profi ciency levels (levels 1 through 3, with level 3 being the highest level of profi ciency) to describe student performance in problem solving. In mathematics literacy, the United States had greater percentages of students below level 1 and at levels 1 and 2 than the OECD average percentages (fi gure A). The United States also had lower percentages of students at levels 4, 5, and 6 than the OECD average percentages. Results for each of the four mathematics content areas followed a similar pattern. In problem solving, the United States also had greater percentages of students below level 1 and at level 1 than the OECD average percentages, and lower percentages of students at levels 2 and 3 than the OECD average percentages (fi gure B). This is also somewhat different from the PISA 2000 reading literacy results, which showed that while the percentages of U.S. students performing at level 1 and below were not measurably different from the OECD averages, the United States had a greater percentage of students performing at the highest level (level 5) compared to the OECD average (Lemke et al. 2001).

Reports such as these are crucial in efforts to maintain focus and sustain initiatives that can address our national challenges in key areas of the school curriculum. The availability of these and associated reports from the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Mullis et al. 2004;OECD 2004aOECD , 2004b serves as yet another \"call to action\" both to the research community and to K-12 practitioners of the need to improve mathematics and science teaching and learning. Making good use of the data provided in these reports, especially in the context of the No Child Left Behind Act, where interpretation of state assessment results in both mathematics and science is a central component of ongoing improvement efforts, is likely to enrich our collective understanding of the overall picture of mathematics and science education. The databases that have been assembled in TIMSS and PISA-as well as the theoretical perspectives and the tools and instruments that were employed in these studies-have great potential as resources for making informed judgments about where to place the emphasis in ongoing K-12 improvement efforts. The problems inherent in improving mathematics and science education are complex, and, while the most prominent features of international comparative studies are often the achievement results and international rankings, it is important to note that data on achievement are not suffi cient for capturing this complexity. The additional contextual information available in the TIMSS and PISA reports-information about the performance of particular population groups, as defi ned by socioeconomic status and other variables-is helpful in making interpretations and conjectures about these problems. The studies alone can point us to some descriptive conclusions about the present state of affairs; an even greater contribution is the wealth of ideas they can provide that warrant more specifi c exploration and study. The involvement of mathematics and science researchers and K-12 practitioners-in collaboration with mathematicians, scientists, and psychometricians-in interpreting these reports, undertaking secondary analyses, and conceptualizing related follow-up studies is a promising pathway for making optimal use of the resources provided in the TIMSS and PISA suite of studies.

In the content areas, U.S. fourth-and eighth-graders performed above the international averages in four of the fi ve mathematics content areas measured in 2003. 2 U.S. eighth-graders also demonstrated signifi cant improvement between 1999 and 2003 in two of the content areas-algebra and data. Looking at population groups, U.S. eighth-grade boys, girls, Blacks, and Hispanics improved their mathematics performance between 1995 and 2003-and the improved perfor-  mance of Black eighth-graders resulted in a narrowing of the gap in achievement between White and Black students. The data suggest that the improved performance of U.S. eighth-graders in mathematics, combined with a decline in performance among some of the countries that were the top performers in the earlier assessments, resulted in a higher relative standing of U.S. eighth-graders in 2003 compared to 1995. Whereas U.S. eighth-graders showed improved performance in mathematics between 1995 and 2003, U.S. fourth-graders showed no measurable improvement. Between 1995 and 2003, fourth-graders in 6 of the 15 countries participating in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1995 demonstrated improved performance, but the United States was among a set of seven countries whose students' scores did not change measurably over the period (Gonzales et al. 2004, p. 6). Moreover, the data suggest that the performance of U.S. fourth-graders in mathematics was lower in 2003 than in 1995 relative to the 14 other countries that participated in both studies. Students in two countries (England and Latvia-LSS 3 ) who performed below U.S. fourth-graders in mathematics in 1995 improved their performance to such a degree that they outperformed U.S. students in 2003. The one positive fi nding at grade 4 was that U.S. Black students improved their mathematics performance between 1995 and 2003, resulting in a narrowing of the achievement gap between White and Black students (Gonzales et al. 2004)."}, {"section_title": "U.S. mathematics literacy and problem-solving performance in PISA 2003", "text": "In contrast to TIMSS, which is part of a long-standing series of international comparative assessments that have sought to measure achievement as it relates to the implemented and intended curriculum, PISA is not so explicitly focused on curricular issues. Rather, it \"provides a unique and complementary perspective\" by focusing \"on the application of knowledge in reading, mathematics, and science to problems with a real-life context\" (OECD 1999, cited in Lemke et al. 2004, p. 2). By choosing to address mathematics literacy, and by providing the associated defi nition 4 together with an accompanying conceptual framework, PISA has made a major contribution to the international comparative literature in mathematics. In PISA 2003, the U.S. averages in mathematics literacy and problem solving were lower than the averages for most OECD countries. However, in mathematics literacy, the United States showed no measurable changes in the trend areas of space and shape and change and relationships from the 2000 administration of PISA. Comparisons in performance by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status are also available. In mathematics literacy, U.S. males outperformed females at the high profi ciency levels, although females were not overrepresented at the lowest profi ciency levels. In problem solving, there were no gender differences in performance for U.S. students. Across profi ciency levels in mathematics literacy and problem solving among U.S. students, the performance of Blacks and Hispanics was generally lower than that of students who were White, Asian, or of more than one race. Some commentators have viewed the mathematics results of TIMSS 2003 and PISA 2003 as confl icting, with a sense that the TIMSS results are more positive than the results for PISA. The TIMSS results may suggest that U.S. students' performance is at least holding steady, and possibly improving, in relatively traditional school mathematics content. PISA is explicit about testing knowledge that may not be part of the intended curriculum and that refl ects students' ability to apply mathematics in context. U.S. standardsbased reforms in mathematics education in the past two decades have emphasized the importance of being able to use mathematics in real-world situations; U.S. students' performance in PISA thus provides a much-needed baseline for future examination of the ability of U.S. students to apply mathematics in context."}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Related Research", "text": "The fi ndings presented here, as well as others in the TIMSS and PISA reports, suggest that additional analyses of curriculum and the opportunity to learn might help to explain the differences in performance in certain subareas of TIMSS and PISA. In both assessments, the patterns of differential performance by specifi c subgroups and in specifi c subareas might lead researchers to revisit conjectures they have had about the nature of the curricular (and extracurricular) opportunities that are afforded to students to use mathematics. The conceptual framework of TIMSS 2003 (Mullis et al. 2003) (which closely mirrors the National Assessment of Educational Progress framework) and that of PISA 2003(OECD 2003 can be helpful tools for researchers conducting alignment analyses of instructional materials and state frameworks similar to those performed by Schmidt and colleagues (e.g., Schmidt et al. 1997;Schmidt et al. 2001) 3 Designated LSS because only Latvian-speaking schools were included in 1995.

The periodic opportunity to benchmark U.S. performance against that of countries around the world provides the impetus needed for an ongoing examination of all aspects of the U.S. education system, including curriculum, instruction, and teacher education and preparation. In addition, the ongoing development of conceptual frameworks such as those produced for TIMSS 2003 and PISA 2003which push collective thinking about what is appropriate in the K-12 curriculum for mathematics and science-is a welcome contribution to the literature in mathematics and science education that comes from a source outside of the U.S. education community-the international comparative studies community.\nEducation, employment and occupation, and household income were consistently associated with participation in adult education. Prior educational attainment is positively associated with overall participation and with participation in the two most common forms of formal learning-workrelated courses and personal interest courses-and with participation in work-related informal learning activities. In addition, having worked in the previous 12 months and having a professional or managerial occupation are characteristics associated with participation overall, in workrelated courses, in personal interest courses, and in workrelated informal learning. Also, higher levels of household income are associated with overall adult education participation, and participation in work-related courses, personal interest courses, and work-related informal learning. The characteristics of educational activities in which adults participate are associated with the type of adult education activity in which they engage. The participation of adults in educational activities encompasses a variety of providers, with business and industry being a leading provider of instruction for work-related courses. Intensity of participation (e.g., number of courses and hours of instruction) varies considerably among all education types. The use of automated technology in instruction is quite common in college or university degree programs, work-related courses, and, to a lesser extent, personal interest courses. Knowles, M.S.

These estimates offer an early look at the postsecondary experiences of students who ever dropped out of high school, particularly for those who delayed entry into a postsecondary institution. Some dropouts who were enrolled in a postsecondary institution in 2000 may eventually earn a certifi cate or degree, and others who dropped out of high school may decide to further their education at a later date.

Therefore, the techniques and inferences made from the data are tentative and are subject to revision. While charter schools are similar to other public schools in many respects, they differ in several important ways, including the makeup of the student population and their location. For example, in comparison to other public schools, higher percentages of charter school fourth-grade students are Black and attend schools in central cities. Thus, when comparing the performance of charter and other public school students, it is important to compare students who share a common characteristic. For example, in mathematics, fourth-grade charter school students as a whole did not perform as well as their public school counterparts. However, the mathematics performance of White, Black, and Hispanic fourth-graders in charter schools was not measurably different from the performance of fourthgraders with similar racial/ethnic backgrounds in other public schools. In reading, there was no measurable difference in performance between charter school students in the fourth grade and their public school counterparts as a whole. This was true even though, on average, charter schools have higher proportions of students from groups that typically perform lower on NAEP than other public schools have. In reading, as in mathematics, the performance of fourth-grade students with similar racial/ethnic backgrounds in charter schools and other public schools was not measurably different. There are also instances where the performance of students with shared characteristics differed. For example, among students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, fourthgraders in charter schools did not score as high in reading or mathematics, on average, as fourth-graders in other public schools. When considering these data, it should be noted that the charter school population is rapidly changing and growing. Future NAEP assessments may reveal different patterns of performance. Further, NAEP does not collect information about students' prior educational experience, which contributes to present performance.

They are useful for studying the possible effects of particular phenomena, or events, on the propensity to drop out. Such events might include the introduction of new education policies or changes in economic conditions. The event dropout rates presented in this report estimate the percentage of high school students who dropped out of high school between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), event dropout rates are presented that describe the percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 who dropped out of grades 10-12. Demographic data collected in the CPS permit event dropout rates to be calculated across various individual characteristics, including race/ethnicity, sex, region of residence, and income level. \u25a0 Five out of every 100 students enrolled in high school in October 2000 left school before October 2001 without successfully completing a high school program. The percentage of students who were event dropouts decreased from 1972 through 1987. 1 However, despite some year-to-year fl uctuations, the percentage of students dropping out of school each year has stayed relatively fl at since 1987 (table A and fi gure A). \u25a0 From 1990 through 2001, between 347,000 and 544,000 students in grades 10 through 12 left school each year without successfully completing a high school program. \u25a0 In 2001, students living in low-income families were six times more likely than their peers in high-income families to drop out of high school over the 1-year period of October 2000 to 2001.

In order to look at variation in event dropout rates at the state level, a second data source is necessary. Using data from the Common Core of Data (CCD), event dropout rates are presented that describe the percentage of public high school students who dropped out of grades 9-12 in the 2000-01 school year. \u25a0 Among those states for which CCD dropout data are available, event dropout rates for public high school students ranged from 2.2 percent to 10.9 percent."}, {"section_title": "Status Dropout Rates", "text": "Because event dropout rates look at what happened over a relatively short period of time, they are not well suited for the study of broader and less time-sensitive educational issues such as the general educational attainment level of a population. For example, an event dropout rate can indicate how many people dropped out last year, but cannot show how many Americans lack a basic high school education more generally. Status dropout rates are better suited to study more general questions of educational attainment. Status dropout rates measure the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high school and who lack a high school credential, irrespective of when they dropped out. Using data from the CPS, status dropout rates show the percentage of young people ages 16 through 24 who are out of school and who have not earned a high school credential (either diploma or equivalency credential such as a General Educational Development [GED] certifi cate). Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school, as well as individuals who may have never attended school in the United States (for example, immigrants who did not complete a high school diploma in their home country). \u25a0 In October 2001, some 3.8 million 16-through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school (status dropouts). These individuals accounted for 10.7 percent of the 35.2 million 16-through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001 (table A). As noted with event rates, this estimate is consistent with the estimates reported over the last 10 years (fi gure A). \u25a0 The status dropout rate of Whites 2 remains lower than that of Blacks, but over the past 30 years the difference between the rates of Whites and Blacks has narrowed. However, this narrowing of the gap occurred during the 1980s; since 1990, the gap between Whites and Blacks has remained fairly constant. In addition, Hispanics in the United States continued to have relatively high status dropout rates when compared to Whites, Blacks, or Asians/Pacifi c Islanders (table A). \u25a0 In 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacifi c Islanders ages 16-24 was lower than for other 16-through 24-year-olds. The status rate for Asians/ Pacifi c Islanders was 3.6 percent, compared with 27.0 percent for Hispanics, 10.9 percent for Blacks, and 7.3 percent for Whites (table A). \u25a0 In 2001, 43.4 percent of Hispanic 16-through 24-year-olds born outside of the United States were high school dropouts. Hispanics born in the United States were much less likely to be dropouts. Regardless of when the youth or their families immigrated to the United States, Hispanic youth were more likely to be dropouts than their counterparts of other racial and ethnic groups.

They are not designed to provide information about military personnel or individuals residing in group quarters such as prison inmates. In addition, data from the CCD are well suited for studying the public school student population in a given year. They are not well suited for studying private school students, and because of missing data from some states, are not well suited for studying high school dropouts at the national level. Legislation enacted as part of the No Child Left Behind Act has increased interest in being able to study yearly change in high school graduation rates in general, and in on-time public high school graduation rates more specifi cally. Graduation rates measure the percent of a population holding a regular high school diploma. Measuring such rates requires an analytic ability to separate regular diploma holders from GED recipients and individuals who earn other alternative credentials, and to have a clearly defi ned population that should be graduates. Existing CPS and CCD data that might be used to develop such rates on an annual basis have important limitations on one or both of these prerequisites. For example, CPS estimates of GED recipients appear to be unreliable, and it is not clear which reference population to use to determine who should be graduates for CCD-based calculations. Such limitations become even more signifi cant for developing on-time graduation rates. NCES is currently working with experts in the fi eld of high school outcomes research to develop graduation rate statistics that can be produced on an annual basis to help address this research need.

Changes in federal loan regulations expanded students' eligibility for both unsubsidized and subsidized loans (Berkner 2000). Consistent with these changes, the percentage of students who borrowed to help pay for their postsecondary education increased. During the course of their enrollment, nearly one-half of students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96 took out student loans to help pay for their education, compared with about one-third of their counterparts who fi rst enrolled 6 years earlier. Thus, beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in 1995-96 were more likely to accrue loan debt over the course of their studies than their counterparts who enrolled in 1989-90.

Specifi cally, the analysis compares the degree completion and persistence rates among two cohorts-students who fi rst enrolled in postsecondary education in academic year 1989-90 and their counterparts who fi rst enrolled in 1995-96. The study focuses on the rates at which students in each cohort completed a degree within 5 years or were still enrolled at the end of 5 years; it also examines changes in the students' demographic profi le and other population characteristics.

The more recent"}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education", "text": "cohort followed students who began in 1995-96 (BPS:96/01) and were interviewed subsequently in 1998 and 2001. 2 The later survey actually covers a 6-year period, but in order to make comparisons with BPS:90/94, which ended after 5 years, measures of 5-year degree completion and persistence are analyzed. It is important to note that the fi ndings from this analysis are entirely descriptive in nature and, while associations are noted, they should not be interpreted as causal inferences. Historical research based on data collected by the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that college completion rates have changed little since the early 1970s (Barton 2002;Adelman 2004), with completion rates of 66-67 percent for 1972, 1982, and 1992 high school graduates who ever enrolled at a 4-year college. In the current study, no overall change in the 5-year bachelor' s degree completion rate was detected. However, despite the relatively short period of 6 years between the two surveys, measurable changes in 5-year persistence rates were evident. Students in the more recent (1995-96) cohort were more likely to be enrolled 5 years after they began their postsecondary studies. As a result, the combined rate of degree completion and 5-year persistence for students who began their undergraduate education in a 4-year institution rose from 76 to 80 percent.\nan asterisk appears next to the number for the more recent (1995-96) cohort. The results indicate an increase in the percentage of students who had not yet completed a degree, but were still enrolled in a 4-year institution 5 years after fi rst enrolling. These are students who are taking longer than 5 years in their efforts to complete a bachelor's degree. This fi nding held across all institution types except those in the forprofi t sector. Among all students who started in 1989-90, 8 percent were still enrolled in a 4-year institution, while among those who began 6 years later, 12 percent were still enrolled. The increase in enrollment after 5 years was accompanied by an overall decline in degree completion from 50 to 47 percent. However, for both cohorts, bachelor's degree completion remained at about one-quarter among all beginning students and at about 53 percent among students who began in 4-year institutions. Changes in persistence and completion rates varied across the institution types that students fi rst attended. For example, among students who began in public 4-year colleges or universities, the likelihood of still being enrolled in a 4-year institution increased (from 16 to 21 percent). Commensurate with this, the combined degree completion and 5-year persistence rate went up as well (from 73 to 78 percent). 4 This fi nding implies that given more time, the rate of bachelor's degree completion in public 4-year institutions may increase. In private not-for-profi t 4-year institutions, on the other hand, a change in the combined completion and persistence rate could not be detected even though the likelihood of still being enrolled in a 4-year institution increased measurably (from 7 to 11 percent). Like students who fi rst enrolled in the 4-year sector, those who started in public 2-year colleges increased their likelihood of being enrolled in a 4-year institution at the end of 5 years (from 5 to 10 percent). At the same time, comparisons between the two cohorts revealed no measurable change in either transfer rates from public 2-year colleges or bachelor's degree completion of transfer students. Therefore, the fact that a greater percentage of transfer students are enrolled in a 4-year institution after 5 years suggests that public 2-year college students in the later cohort may have been more persistent in pursuing a bachelor's degree. At the same time, however, the rate at which students in public 2-year colleges completed vocational certifi cates declined over the 6 years between cohorts, from 13 percent to 9 percent.\nData source: The NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), Winter 2002-03.\nFemales currently have greater success than males in attaining postsecondary education. Females have higher aspirations than males while in high school, they are more likely to enroll in college immediately after graduating from high school, and they persist and complete degrees at higher rates than males. More than half of all bachelor's and master's degrees are awarded to females. Nevertheless, gender differences in majors still exist, with female bachelor's degree recipients much less likely than their male peers to major in computer science, engineering, and physical sciences. Females also still lag behind males in enrollment in fi rst-professional and doctoral programs, but they have made gains in the past 30 years and are closing the gender gap.\n"}, {"section_title": "Changes in Student Populations", "text": "Between 1989 and 1995, total undergraduate fall enrollment in institutions of higher education increased from 11.7 million to 12.2 million (U.S. Department of Education 2000 , table 190). In addition to the increase in the total undergraduate population, the racial/ethnic composition and income level of students just beginning their postsecondary education changed over the 6-year period. In particular, as shown in table A, Black and Hispanic students made up larger proportions of beginning postsecondary students over the study period, while the proportion of White students declined over time. Although no overall change in the gender distribution was detected, when the data were broken out by the type of institution students fi rst attended, among students enrolled in private not-for-profi t 4-year institutions, it appears that the percentage who were women increased from 51 percent in 1989-90 to 57 percent in 1995-96; however, the difference is not statistically signifi cant. Coinciding with the rise in Black and Hispanic student enrollment in the 6-year period between cohorts was an increase in the proportion of low-income students. The percentage of low-income students increased from 13 to 16 percent overall for dependent students. 3 This increase held for dependent students who began in public 4-year institutions (from 10 to 15 percent) and private for-profi t institutions (from 21 to 35 percent). The age distribution of beginning students changed to some degree. As of December 31 in the year they enrolled, the percentage of 19-year-olds and students in their twenties increased, while the proportion of 18-year-olds declined. As the demographic profi le of beginning students changed, so did the level of education achieved by their parents. Students in the later cohort were more likely to have at least one parent who held a bachelor's degree or higher. Such students are typically more successful in completing college degrees than their counterparts whose parents never attended postsecondary education (Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998). The change in parents' education levels was particularly evident among students who began in 4-year institutions, among whom the percentage with parents who held bachelor's degrees or higher increased from 44 to 50 percent for those who started in public institutions and from 53 to 60 percent for those who started in private notfor-profi t institutions (fi gure A). There was some indication that students' academic preparation may have changed over time, primarily for students who began in public 2-year colleges.

Adults participate in various types of educational activities in order to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the workforce, to earn a college or advanced degree, to learn basic skills or English language skills, or to enrich their lives. Taken as a whole, these activities constitute adult education. Traditionally, full-time enrollment in postsecondary degree or diploma programs is not considered to be adult education participation. 1 This report holds to that convention. A recent study indicates that participation in adult education has grown steadily over the past three decades (Kim and Creighton 2000;Creighton and Hudson 2002). Many societal factors infl uence participation in adult education activities. Changing demographics, including the aging of the population, reentry of women into the workplace, and an infl ux of immigrants alter the base of potential participants. The effect of the global economy and technological advances on the nature of adult education has been signifi cant. This is the fi rst full report using data from the Adult Educa  Part-time participation in postsecondary programs is considered to be adult education in this analysis, and those who were enrolled in postsecondary programs on a part-time basis in the previous 12 months are included as participants. Those who were full-time postsecondary students may also have participated on a part-time basis at some point in the previous 12 months and, if so, are included as participants due to their part-time participation. Thus, reports of participation in postsecondary programs include those who participated on a part-time basis and those who participated on both part-time and full-time bases in the previous 12 months. Full-time postsecondary students may also have participated in adult education activities such as English as a Second Language, work-related courses, or personal interest courses in addition to their full-time college or vocational programs and, if so, are included as participants. the 50 states and the District of Columbia conducted from January 2 through April 14 of 2001. For the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Survey, the population of interest included civilian, noninstitutionalized persons age 16 and older who were not enrolled in elementary or secondary school at the time of the interview. Adult education is a diverse arena defi ned in a variety of ways (Cross 1984;Elias and Merriam 1984;Knowles 1980;Merriam and Caffarella 1999;Peters, Javis, and Associates 1991). Some regard adult education as noncompulsory or voluntary learning activities constituting a continuous learning process throughout life (Belanger and Tuijnman 1997). Others include required activities in their defi nitions because a fairly large proportion of adults are required to participate in work-related adult education for continuing professional development purposes (Cervero 1989). Yet another way of defi ning adult education includes not only formal coursework or training, but also informal educational activities (that is, those that do not involve an instructor). The AELL-NHES:2001 incorporates a broad approach to the range of activities that may be considered adult education. This approach distinguishes voluntary and required educational activities that are formal, as defi ned by the presence of an instructor, from activities that are informal. In the AELL-NHES:2001, respondents were asked about both formal and informal learning activities in which they may have participated during the 12-month period prior to the interview. The seven types of formal learning activities included English as a Second Language (ESL), basic skills education, college or university degree programs, vocational or technical diploma programs, apprenticeship programs, work-related courses, and personal interest courses. Workrelated informal learning activities included supervised training or mentoring, self-paced study using books or video tapes, self-paced study using computers, attending \"brown-bag\" or informal presentations, attending conferences or conventions, and reading professional journals or magazines. This report provides a broad overview of the extent to which adults participate in educational activities and their educational experiences in such activities. Major topics include participation rates overall and in various types of formal educational activities; characteristics of participating adults; educational experiences in college or university degree programs on a part-time basis, work-related courses, and personal interest courses; reasons for participation in work-related courses; characteristics of participants who received employer support; and characteristics of partici-pants in work-related informal learning activities. Because there is variation in the nature and purpose of various adult education activities, this analysis examines individual types of activities in addition to adult education overall.

In 2001, the overall participation rate in formal adult education during the 12-month period prior to the interview was 46 percent (table A). About 92 million adults participated in one or more types of formal educational activities during this period. Adult education participation rates were higher among the population age 50 and younger. The rates of participation for the three younger age groups (ages 16-30, 31-40, and 41-50) were 53 to 55 percent, compared to 41 and 22 percent for the two older age groups (ages 51-65 and 66 and older) (table A). Merriam and Caffarella (1999) noted that women have had a higher rate of participation than men since 1978. The AELL fi ndings are consistent with this observation; females were more likely than males to participate in an educational activity (49 percent versus 43 percent) (table A). The prior educational attainment of adults was positively associated with participation in educational activities. Among those who had not completed high school, 22 percent participated in educational activities during the 12-month period prior to the interview, whereas 34 percent of those with a high school diploma or equivalent, 58 percent of those with some college education, and 66 percent of those with a bachelor's degree or more education did so (table A). The overall participation rate among adults who were never married (52 percent) was higher than the rate among adults who were married (47 percent), unmarried and living with a partner (43 percent), and separated, divorced, or widowed (38 percent) (table A). Participation rates in adult education also varied by the employment status and occupation of adults. Those adults who had worked for pay or income during the 12 months prior to the survey were more likely to participate in educational activities (54 percent) than those who had not worked (25 percent). Adults in professional or managerial occupations had a higher rate of participation in adult education activities (71 percent) than those in other occupations (i.e., service, sales, or support occupations and those employed in the trades) (55 percent and 34 percent, respectively), and adults in service and sales occupations had a higher participation rate than those in the trades (table A). Adults who had an occupational or legal requirement to take continuing education were more likely to participate in educational activities than those who did not have such a requirement (64 percent versus 40 percent) (table A). Household income was positively related to the participation of adults in educational activities. Adults in households with incomes over $50,000 were more likely to participate in educational activities (56 to 59 percent) than those in households with incomes of $50,000 or less (28 to 48 percent). Participation rates in adult education activities also increased at every household income level up to $50,000 (table A). Adults who had children under the age of 10 in their households were more likely to participate in adult education activities than their counterparts. In 2001, 52 percent of adults with children under 10 in their households participated compared with 44 percent of adults without children under age 10. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine whether the relationships between individual personal characteristics and participation observed in the bivariate analyses remain when these characteristics are examined simultaneously. The regression analysis yielded fi ndings generally consistent with the bivariate analyses for age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment/occupation, income, and prior educational attainment. Bivariate fi ndings by the presence of children under age 10 in the household were not observed when the other characteristics of adults were taken into account. Somewhat different fi ndings were observed by Adults who participated in college or university degree or certifi cate programs or vocational or technical diploma programs on a full-time basis only, for part or all of the year, and did not participate in any other type of formal educational activities are not counted as participants in adult education.

Trends in Educational Equity of Girls & Women contains a selection of indicators that illustrate the educational gains made by females in recent years as well as areas where gaps continue to exist. This statistical report assembles a series of indicators that examine the extent to which males and females have access to the same educational opportunities, avail themselves equally of these opportunities, perform at similar levels throughout schooling, succeed at similar rates, and reap the same benefi ts from their educational experiences. This report serves as an update of an earlier publication, Trends in Educational Equity of Girls & Women (Bae et al. 2000). General topics covered by this report are similar to those addressed in the 2000 report. Many indicators that were included in the 2000 report have been updated with the most recent data available. In addition, a number of new indicators have been added, designed to refl ect the most current research on topics relevant to educational equity. The full report begins with an overview that summarizes the report's major fi ndings. A series of 38 indicators follow, which examine various facets of educational equity. The indicators begin with preprimary and early elementary education, move through elementary and secondary education and postsecondary education, and fi nally, consider educational outcomes. Each indicator shows the status of females relative to males. Some indicators include further breakdowns, such as those by race/ethnicity; however, the general focus of this report is on overall comparisons between males and females and not on the experiences of various subgroups, which may show different patterns. The data for the indicators are drawn primarily from surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), although several other sources of national and international data are used as well. Although these indicators provide valuable information on many aspects of educational equity, some important topics cannot be addressed with available, nationally representative data. Examples of such topics include the extent to which sexual harassment undermines the ability of schools to provide a safe and comfortable learning environment and whether girls and young women are encouraged to challenge themselves in their educational pursuits, especially in mathematics and science. The data presented in this publication demonstrate that in elementary and secondary school and in college, females are now doing as well as or better than males on many indicators of achievement and educational attainment, and that large gaps that once existed between males and females have been eliminated in most cases and have signifi cantly decreased in other cases. Women are still underrepresented in some fi elds of study, as well as more generally in doctoral and fi rst-professional degree programs, although they have made substantial gains in the past 30 years. These differences may have labor market consequences."}, {"section_title": "Preprimary and Early Elementary Education", "text": "Certain kinds of preschool experiences, such as participating in high-quality preprimary programs and engaging in early literacy activities with parents, are widely believed to help prepare young children for the more structured learning that takes place in elementary school. Therefore, whether males and females have the same access to these kinds of opportunities is of interest from an educational equity standpoint. In terms of many learning opportunities, males and females start school on a similar footing. In certain other areas, females appear to start school ahead. Between 1990 and 2001, the percentage of 3-to 5-year-olds enrolled in preprimary programs and kindergarten increased. In 2001, similar percentages of males (63 percent) and females (64 percent) were enrolled in preprimary and kindergarten education. However, in terms of early learning experiences in the home, a higher percentage of females (86 percent) than males (82 percent) had been read to three or more times in the past week. For both males and females, participation in literacy activities generally increased between 1991 and 2001. General knowledge assessments indicate that males and females are similar in terms of their general knowledge in kindergarten and fi rst grade. Males and females also generally performed similarly on the overall reading assessment; however, higher percentages of females (80 percent) than males (73 percent) could recognize words by sight in the spring of fi rst grade. Males and females had similar levels of sight word recognition in third grade. Kindergartners who entered in the fall of 1998 increased their overall mathematics performance scores by 10 points by the spring of their kindergarten year compared to their initial assessment. By the end of third grade, these students more than tripled their performance. With the exception of the third-grade assessment, males and females performed similarly on overall mathematics performance. In third grade, males scored higher than females, 87 to 83. No differences were detected between males and females on any of the assessments of addition and subtraction skills."}, {"section_title": "Progress through school", "text": "Females are less likely than males to repeat a grade and to drop out. The percentage of 5-to 12-year-old males who had repeated at least one grade declined between 1996 and 1999. In 1999, females ages 5 to 12 years old were less likely than males of the same age to have repeated a grade: approximately 8 percent of males compared to 5 percent of females had repeated a grade since starting school. In recent years, females have also become less likely than males to drop out of high school; for example, in 2001, the status dropout rate for 16-to 24-year-olds (i.e., the percentage who had not completed high school and were not enrolled in school) was 12 percent for males, compared to 9 percent for females. This marks a change from the general pattern in the 1970s, when dropout rates were similar for males and females. The status dropout rate decreased for both males and females between 1972 and 2001. When examined by sex and race/ethnicity, the dropout rate of White males and females, Black males and females, and Hispanic females decreased during this period, while no decrease was detected for Hispanic males. Males and females who have a child in high school are more likely to drop out of high school and less likely to receive a bachelor's degree. Among females who were eighth-graders in 1988, 71 percent who had a child in high school had completed high school as of 2000, compared to 95 percent who had no child as of 2000. Furthermore, only 2 percent of females who had a child in high school had received a bachelor's degree by 2000, compared to 44 percent of those with no child. Becoming a parent while still in high school was related to the educational attainment of males as well. Males who became fathers in high school were signifi cantly less likely than those who were not fathers, as of 2000, to have completed high school (65 vs. 94 percent) and to have received a bachelor's degree (4 vs. 36 percent). On a variety of measures, males seem to be more likely than females to experience serious problems at school and to engage in risky behaviors. Evidence suggests that females are less likely than males to have certain problems, such as being diagnosed with a learning disability and being victimized at school, which may negatively affect their progress through school (U.S. Department of Education 1997). In 1999, males in grades 1-5 were more likely than females to have been identifi ed as having a disability (21 vs. 14 percent, respectively). In particular, males were more likely than females to have been identifi ed with a learning disability, emotional disturbance, and speech impediment. In 2001, among 12-to 18-year-old students, the percentage of males who reported that they had experienced criminal victimization at school during the previous 6 months was higher than the percentage of females reporting the same experience (6 vs. 5 percent). Similarly, a higher percentage of males than females reported being bullied at school (9 vs. 7 percent). In addition, female students appear to be less likely than male students to engage in certain behaviors, such as drug use and violence, that may put themselves and others at risk. In 2001, females in grades 9-12 were less likely than males to report using alcohol at least once in the previous 30 days on school property (4 vs. 6 percent), as well as in general (45 vs. 49 percent). Likewise, high school females were also less likely than their male counterparts to report using marijuana at least once in the previous 30 days on school property (3 vs. 8 percent) as well as in general (20 vs. 28 percent). The percentage of students who reported being offered or given an illegal drug on school property in the previous 12 months was also lower for females (23 percent) than males (35 percent). Overall, the percentages of students who reported using cigarettes and marijuana, and who were offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property decreased between 1997 and 2001. However, there was no decrease detected during this period in the percentage of students who reported using alcohol on school property. Males in these grades were also much more likely than females to engage in certain violent activities on school property; higher percentages of males than females reported being in a physical fi ght in the previous 12 months (18 vs. 7 percent) and carrying a weapon to school in the previous 30 days (10 vs. 3 percent). High school seniors' attitudes toward school have become increasingly negative, particularly among females. Despite apparent differences in the extent to which females and males experience certain problems as they progress through school, the general attitudes of male and female high school seniors toward school were similar in 2001; 29 percent of females and 30 percent of males reported liking school very much (fi gure A). This marked a change from 1980, when females were more likely than males to report liking school. It also marked a decline, among both males and females, in these positive attitudes toward school from 1980, when 50 percent of females and 42 percent of males reported liking school very much. This decline occurred at a faster rate for females than for males."}, {"section_title": "Academic performance", "text": "Academic performance is a key measure of school success because high performance in school opens doors to postsecondary education and to well-paying jobs. For females to have the same opportunities as males in postsecondary education and in the labor market, it is important for them to be equally well prepared academically. Overall, females have done much better than males in reading and writing, but have generally, though not always, lagged behind in science and mathematics. Concern exists that this gap in science and mathematics may give them less access to high-paying jobs, although there are no data to compare this disadvantage with the possible disadvantage faced by males because of their lower reading and writing achievement. Females have consistently outperformed males in reading and writing. Reading and writing are basic skills required for most jobs and for functioning in contemporary society. Scores on the main assessment of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reveal that females in grades 4, 8, and 12 have consistently outperformed males in reading. The main assessment data from NAEP show that females continued to have higher reading scores than males at all three grades, but there were no measurable increases in females' scores when 1992 data were compared to 2003 data at grades 4 and 8, and there was a decrease in 12th-grade reading scores for females-from 297 in 1992 to 295 in 2002 (fi gure B). Gender differences in reading achievement have been observed internationally as well. In every G8 country participating in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) in 2001, fourth-grade girls scored signifi cantly higher than boys on the combined reading literacy scale. In the United States, girls scored an average of 18 points higher. In each of 28 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries participating in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2000, 15-year-old females outperformed their male peers in reading. Females in the United States in grades 4, 8, and 12 also outperformed their male peers in writing in 1998 and 2002 (fi gure C). However, females' higher achievement in reading and writing on the NAEP assessments did not translate into higher achievement on Advanced Placement (AP) examinations in English. Although females accounted for a higher proportion of students taking the AP examination in English in 2002, their average score was lower than that of males (fi gure D). There are some gender differences favoring male students in mathematics and science. Profi ciency in science and mathematics has become particularly important, as jobs in our technological society increasingly require workers to use complex mathematics skills and scientifi c knowledge to solve problems (U.S. Department of Education 2001). Although there is a common perception that males consistently outperform females in mathematics, NAEP mathematics scores have not shown this (fi gure E). In mathematics, the gap between average scale scores has been quite small and fl uctuated only slightly between 1990 and 2003.     1990, 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2003 NOTE: These test scores are from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Main Assessment. Scale ranges from 0 to 500. For both the 1990 and 1992 assessments, accommodations were not permitted.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 1990, 1992, 1996 Mathematics Assessments. In 2002, males made up a higher proportion of students taking AP exams in science and calculus. Males also obtained higher average scores on these examinations compared to females (fi gure D). Gender differences in mathematics profi ciency favoring males were observed internationally in PISA, although the differences were neither as large nor as consistent across countries as the differences favoring females in reading. In 13 of 28 participating countries, males outperformed females; however, this was not the case in the United States. Trends in science achievement have been slightly different. Among fourth-and eighth-graders, males scored higher than females on the 2000 science assessment, but not on the 1996 assessment. In contrast, among 12th-graders, males outperformed females on the 1996 assessment, but there was no measurable difference on the 2000 assessment. The score gap between males and females increased between 1996 and 2000 at the 4th and 8th grades, but there was no measurable difference in the size of the gap at 12th grade. Gender gaps in mathematics and science coursetaking appear to be shrinking. Overall, females' high school academic programs in mathematics and science are at least as challenging as those taken by males. Female high school graduates in 2000 were more likely than their male peers to have taken algebra II, biology, AP/honors biology, and chemistry (fi gure F). Males, by contrast, were more likely than females to have taken physics. The percentage of male graduates who took calculus increased from 6 to 12 percent, and the percentage of female graduates who took calculus increased from 4 to 11 percent between 1982 and 2000."}, {"section_title": "Computer usage", "text": "The computer has become a tool of vital importance in the home, classroom, and workplace. If females are less comfortable with this tool or have less access to a computer at home or at school, they could be at a disadvantage later in their educational careers or in the workplace. Based on available data, males and females have equal access to computers. Females are just as likely as males to use computers at home and at school. Refl ecting the rapid spread of technology throughout society, the percentage of students in elementary and secondary school using computers at school increased from 60 percent of students in 1993 to 84 percent of students in 2001. The percentage of students who used a computer at home increased from 25 percent of students to 66 percent of students. Similar percentages of males and females used computers at school. In addition, similar percentages of males and females reported computer use at home, both in general and for schoolwork. However, when looking at 5-through 17-year-olds, girls are slightly more likely than boys to use home computers for e-mail, word processing, and completing school assignments (DeBell and Chapman 2004). Despite evident parity in general access to and use of computers, however, there is some evidence that at least some males leave high school with greater interest in and specialized knowledge of computers. For instance, males accounted for 86 percent of students who took the AP examination in computer science in 2002, and males had higher average scores on the examination than females (fi gure D)."}, {"section_title": "Extracurricular activities", "text": "Extracurricular activities offer opportunities for students to develop skills that are important in the workplace and in society, such as team values, individual and group responsibility, physical strength and endurance, competition, and a sense of community. Consequently, equal access to opportunities to develop such skills is an important component of educational equity. Females are more likely than males to participate in various afterschool activities, except for athletics. In 2001, females were more likely than their male peers to participate in music or other performing arts, belong to academic clubs, work on the school newspaper or yearbook, or to participate in the student council or government (fi gure G). Male students, however, were more likely to participate in school athletics than female students. Roughly one-third of female seniors reported participating in music or other performing arts, and one-third reported participating on athletic teams. In contrast, 19 percent of male students reported participating in music or other performing arts, while 45 percent reported participating on athletic teams. It is diffi cult to assess the relative importance of the different types of skills learned in the various activities."}, {"section_title": "Transition to postsecondary education", "text": "High school students' plans for further education indicate the importance that young people attach to postsecondary education and their perceptions of their access to it. Aspirations are important, because they are a fi rst step toward attainment. Both aspirations and undergraduate enrollment rates of females have increased, and females have now surpassed males in both areas. Female high school seniors tend to have higher educational aspirations than their male peers. In 1990 and 2001, female high school seniors were more likely than their male peers to report that they defi nitely planned to graduate from a 4-year college (62 vs. 51 percent in 2001). By 2001, female high school seniors were also more likely than males to report that they defi nitely would attend graduate or professional school (25 vs. 16 percent). This marked a change from 1980, when a higher percentage of males than females reported that they defi nitely would attend graduate or professional school. Females are more likely than males to enroll in college the fall immediately following graduation from high school. From 1972 to 2001, the proportions of both males and females who enrolled in college immediately after fi nishing high school increased, but females' enrollment increased at a faster rate. In 1972, male high school graduates were more likely than their female peers to enroll in a 2-or 4-year college in the fall after graduating from high school (53 vs. 46 percent) (fi gure H). However, despite long-term increases in enrollment between 1972 and 2001, the proportions of females who enrolled in college after high school declined by 7 percentage points between 1997 and 2001. A majority of undergraduates are female. The proportion of undergraduates who were female increased from the minority to the majority of students between 1970 and 2000; in 1970, 42 percent of all undergraduates were female, while in 2000, 56 percent were female. In part, this refl ects an increase in the numbers of young women who enter college immediately after completing high school, but it also refl ects a sizable number of older women enrolled in school (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Since the late 1970s, at least half of all part-time students have been female, NOTE: The response rates for this survey do not meet NCES statistical standards. The response rate for this survey was less than 70 percent, and a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done to date. SOURCE: University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, Monitoring the Future study, 2001. and since 1985, a majority of full-time students have been female as well (fi gure I). In 2000, females accounted for 55 percent of full-time enrollment and 58 percent of part-time enrollment. Females make up the majority of graduate, but not fi rst-professional, students. Females have made even larger gains at the graduate level than at the undergraduate level. In 1970, 39 percent of all graduate students were female, a slightly lower proportion than at the undergraduate level, but in 2000, 58 percent of graduate students were female, a slightly higher proportion than at the undergraduate level (fi gure J). Female graduate students accounted for a greater percentage of part-time enrollment (61 percent) than of full-time enrollment (54 percent) in 2000. The majority of fi rst-professional students are still men, but women have made dramatic and consistent gains in their representation since 1970 (fi gure J). While 9 percent of students in fi rst-professional degree programs were women in 1970, by 2000, 47 percent of full-time and 44 percent of part-time fi rst-professional students were women."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and attainment", "text": "Enrollment in postsecondary education is one indicator of access. However, completion of postsecondary programs is an even more important indicator of personal success and of an education climate that fosters parity in opportunity.  Females are more likely than males to persist and attain degrees. Among freshmen who enrolled in a college or university for the fi rst time in 1995-96 seeking a bachelor's degree, a greater percentage of females (66 percent) than males (59 percent) had earned a bachelor's degree by the spring of 2001. A greater percentage of males than females were still enrolled (16 vs. 13 percent), indicating that some of the difference in attainment rates might eventually be reduced. A higher percentage of males (21 percent) than females (16 percent) had not obtained a bachelor's degree and were no longer enrolled for a bachelor's degree. Considering degree attainment more generally (not just those who started in 1995-96), females earned more than half of all bachelor's degrees in 2001 (57 percent). This statistic refl ects the increasing proportions of female students in postsecondary education, as previously noted. The proportions of Black and Hispanic bachelor's degree recipients who were female in 2000-01 (66 and 60 percent, respectively) were higher than the proportion of White degree recipients who were female (57 percent). The increase in participation by females in postsecondary education over the past 30 years has meant that, among the general population ages 25-29 in 2002, a slightly higher percentage of females than males had attained a bachelor's degree or higher (32 vs. 27 percent). Degrees in certain fi elds of study continued to be disproportionately awarded to males or to females, although changes have occurred in recent years. Historically, females have tended to account for the majority of bachelor's degrees in fi elds that often lead to lower paying occupations, such as education and health professions, while males typically have predominated in higher paying fi elds, such as computer science and engineering. While some of these disparities persist, many changes have occurred since 1970. Certain fi elds in which men received the majority of degrees in 1970, such as social sciences and history, psychology, biological sciences/life sciences, and business management and administrative services, attained relative gender parity or were disproportionately female by 2001 (fi gure K). And while other fi elds, such as computer and information sciences, physical sciences and science technologies, and engineering, continue to have a larger proportion of males, the percentages of females majoring in these areas have risen since 1970. Females have made substantial progress at the graduate level overall, but still earn fewer than half of the degrees in many fi elds. Between 1970 and 2001, the percentages of master's, doctor's, and fi rst-professional degrees earned by females increased substantially in many fi elds. However, advanced degrees conferred still tend to follow traditional patterns, with women accounting for the majority of master's and doctor's degree recipients in education and health, and men accounting for the majority of recipients in computer and information sciences and engineering. Women's progress toward earning an equal share of fi rstprofessional degrees has been notable. In 1970, 5 percent of law degrees, 8 percent of medical degrees, and 1 percent of dentistry degrees were awarded to females; in 2001, the corresponding percentages were 47 percent, 43 percent, and 39 percent. Gender differences in participation rates in collegiate sports have narrowed. One fi nal measure of gender equity at the college level is participation in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-sponsored sports. Males still outnumber females in collegiate sports participation, but the gap has narrowed. Between 1981-82 (when detailed statistics on females' sports fi rst became available) and 2001-02, the number of females participating in Division I sports increased 150 percent, compared with 15 percent for males. Female athletes are more likely than male athletes to graduate in a timely fashion. Among female athletes who entered college in 1995, 69 percent graduated by 2001, compared with 54 percent of men."}, {"section_title": "Outcomes", "text": "An examination of equity in education requires considering the benefi ts that males and females receive at the end of schooling. Higher levels of educational attainment are associated with certain labor market outcomes, such as higher labor force participation rates, higher rates of employment, and higher earnings. Labor market outcomes are not the only important outcomes of participation in formal education, but they are the most readily measured with available national and international data."}, {"section_title": "Employment rates for females have increased across all levels of educational attainment since the 1970s.", "text": "The gap between male and female employment rates has narrowed since the 1970s. Both the decline in employment rates of males who did not attend college and the increase in the employment rate of females across all education levels contributed to the overall narrowing of the gap. In 2002, the gender gaps in employment rates were smaller among people with higher levels of education compared to those with a high school diploma or less. However, males continued to have higher employment rates across all levels of education. Females with bachelor' s degrees tend to earn less than males with the same level of educational attainment, but the gap is narrowing. Among young people ages 25-34, the median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers are lower for females than for their male counterparts with the same level of educational attainment. However, over the last 30 years, women have begun to narrow the earnings gap with men. In 1970, young women with a bachelor's degree had a median annual salary that was equivalent to 71 percent of what their male peers earned; in 2000, it was 78 percent. The male-female difference in annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers may be attributable at least in part to different occupations and job tenure. Females ages 25-64 have lower labor force participation rates than males, regardless of education, but participation increases with education. In 2001, females ages 25-64 had lower labor force participation rates than males at all levels of education in the United States. This difference was also evident in other selected large, industrialized countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. However, the percentage of females participating in the labor force increased in all six countries between 1995 and 2001, while the percentage of males stayed the same or decreased. Female labor force participation rates also generally increased with educational attainment. Females are more likely than males to participate in adult education. Women not only have made important progress in terms of their formal educational attainment, but also have been actively involved in adult education activities. In 2001, the overall participation rate of females in adult education activities was higher than that of their male peers (53 vs. 46 percent). However, when examined by type of activity, the only signifi cant gender difference was in participation in personal development activities. The percentages of males and females who participated in basic skills and workrelated adult education were similar."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Various indicators have been presented here to examine the extent to which males and females have access to similar educational opportunities, take advantage of those opportunities, and have similar educational outcomes. By most of these measures, females are doing at least as well as males. Males and females begin school with similar preschool experiences, although females may have an advantage in early literacy participation experiences. Females outperform males on reading and writing assessments at 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. Throughout their elementary and secondary education, females are less likely than males to repeat grades and seem to have fewer problems that put them at risk. While females' performance in mathematics is often perceived to be lower than that of males, NAEP results have shown few consistent gender differences over the years, particularly among younger students. Twelfth-grade NAEP assessments in mathematics and science show no signifi cant gender differences in achievement scores. However, females were less likely to report liking math or science. This is true despite the fact that young women take equally or more challenging mathematics and science coursework than their male peers in high school (with the exception of physics, which females are slightly less likely than males to take). Since the early 1970s, women have made gains in postsecondary education in terms of enrollment and attainment. Female high school seniors tend to have higher educational aspirations than their male peers and are more likely to enroll in college immediately after graduating from high school. Females also account for the majority of undergraduate enrollment and the majority of bachelor's degree recipients. Gender differences in college majors persist, however, with females still predominant in somewhat lower paying fi elds like education, and males more likely to earn degrees in engineering, physics, and computer science. Females are also still underrepresented in fi rst-professional programs, although they have made substantial progress toward parity in the past 30 years. In terms of labor market outcomes, the fi ndings are mixed and depend somewhat on factors beyond the scope of the education system. Females ages 25-34 are less likely than their male counterparts to be employed, but it is unknown to what extent this is by choice. The gap between males and females in employment rates has narrowed over time, and females with higher levels of educational attainment are employed at rates more similar to those of males than are females with lower levels of attainment. Females tend to earn less than males with similar educational attainment, but this may be partly a refl ection of different patterns of labor market participation and job choice. Dropping out of high school is not necessarily the end of a student's formal education. Some students who drop out return a short time later to earn a diploma, some may pursue an alternative credential such as a General Educational Development (GED) certifi cate, and others may enroll in a postsecondary institution without having earned a high school credential. Using data on public and private school students from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman (1998) examined the educational attainment of the 21 percent of 1988 eighth-graders who had dropped out of high school at least once between eighth grade and the spring of 1994, 2 years after they would have graduated if they had fi nished with the majority of their cohort. 1 They found that about 44 percent of these dropouts had received a high school diploma or an alternative high school credential by 1994. Of the 56 percent of all dropouts who had not completed high school by 1994, 43 percent indicated that they were working on a high school credential. This Issue Brief extends Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman's analysis of the NELS:88 cohort another 6 years, by examining dropouts' high school completion status and postsecondary experiences as of the year 2000-8 years after the cohort's expected graduation from high school. 2,3"}, {"section_title": "Defi ning Dropouts", "text": "There are a number of ways to defi ne dropouts.

Generally, a student absent from school for 4 consecutive weeks or more and not absent due to accident or illness was considered to have dropped out (see Ingels et al. 1994). Members of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort were classifi ed as dropouts after they had dropped out for the fi rst time, whether or not they eventually earned a credential.

NAEP conducts assessments using three basic designs: the main NAEP, state NAEP, and long-term trend NAEP. These three basic designs are described in the paragraphs that follow. The main NAEP assessments report current information for the nation, specifi c geographic regions of the country, and (beginning in 2002) states. They include students drawn from both public and nonpublic schools and report results for student achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12. The main NAEP assessments follow the frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board and use the latest advances in assessment methodology. NAEP frameworks are designed to refl ect changes in educational objectives and curriculum. Since 1990, NAEP assessments have also been conducted at the state level. Each state that chooses to participate receives assessment results that report on the performance of students in that state. In its content, the state assessment is identical to the assessment conducted nationally. However, because the national NAEP samples prior to 2002 were not designed to support the reporting of accurate and representative state-level results, separate representative samples of students were selected for each participating jurisdiction/state and additional students needed to yield national estimates were selected from nonparticipating states. NAEP also conducts long-term trend assessments, which are designed to give information on changes in the basic achievement of America's youth since the early 1970s. They are administered nationally and report student performance at ages 9, 13, and 17 in reading, mathematics, and science, and in grades 4, 8, and 11 in writing.

The NHES collects timely information on specifi c education topics from a relatively large, targeted sample of households and has been conducted approximately every other year since 1991. The NHES gathers data on several important topics on a rotating basis. For instance, adult education and early childhood program participation have been the focus of several NHES surveys. One-time surveys on current issues, such as school readiness, school safety and discipline, and civic involvement, have been conducted as well. The NHES surveys conducted in 2001 (NHES:2001) included two that had been fi elded in previous years, the Early Childhood Program Participation survey (ECPP-NHES:2001) and the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning survey (AELL-NHES:2001). The third NHES:2001 sur-vey was the Before-and After-School Programs and Activities survey (ASPA-NHES:2001); this was the fi rst full-scale NHES survey on this issue, although questions on the topic had been included in previous survey administrations. The NHES provides data on the populations of special interest to NCES and education researchers as defi ned by age and/or grade in school for each survey. It targets these populations using specifi c screening and sampling procedures. Populations of interest include children from birth to 12th grade and civilian adults age 16 and older and not enrolled in 12th grade or below. Specifi c age or grade ranges for a given survey are determined by the survey topic and the research questions formulated for the specifi c survey administration. The NHES provides national cross-sectional estimates for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The NHES design also yields estimates for subgroups of interest for each survey, as defi ned by age or grade for children, educational participation status for adults, and Black and Hispanic origin for all populations of interest. In addition to providing cross-sectional estimates, the NHES is also designed to provide estimates of change over time in key statistics. The survey instruments are designed to address the selected issues in suffi cient detail so that analyses can be performed to help explain the phenomena of interest. The NHES surveys are random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone surveys of households in the United States. Interviews are administered using computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) technology, which is a data collection methodology specifi cally designed so that relatively complex questionnaires can be handled smoothly and effi ciently. Previous NHES surveys have been conducted in 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996. All surveys were conducted at the same time of the year, winter to early spring. The 2001 administration was conducted by Westat from January 2 through April 14, 2001. The NHES was intended by NCES to complement its institutional surveys. It also fi lls a need that existing household surveys, such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), cannot satisfy because they are designed to focus primarily on issues other than education.

Estimates can be computed for White, Black, and Hispanic children for subgroups composed of 2 to 3 years of age or two to three grades in school, depending on the survey year. In addition, the surveys were designed to support the analysis of change in early childhood care and education over time. In the ECE-NHES:1991, parents of children ages 3 through 8 completed interviews about their children's early childhood education, including participation in nonparental care by relatives, nonrelatives, or in center-based programs (including Head Start).

The civic involvement of parents of students in grades 6 though 12 and that of the students themselves, as well as a separate random sample of adults, was addressed in the PFI/CI-NHES:1996 and in two other 1996 surveys, the Youth Civic Involvement survey (YCI-NHES:1996) and the Adult Civic Involvement survey (ACI-NHES:1996). The topic of community service was expanded for inclusion in the end-of-decade 1999 Youth survey (Youth-NHES:1999). Questions related to the diverse ways that parents and other adults may socialize children for informed civic participation. The surveys were intended to provide an assessment of the opportunities that youth have to develop the personal responsibility and skills that would facilitate their taking an active role in civic life, such as through exposure to information about politics or national issues, through discussion of politics and national issues, and by the example of adults who participate in community or civic life. Questions about attitudes that relate to democratic values and knowledge about government were also included. In the YCI-NHES:1996, special emphasis was placed on the opportunities youth had for participation in community service and the extent of school efforts to support youth community involvement. The PFI/CI-NHES:1996 and Parent-NHES:1999 provided cross-sectional national estimates of the topics described above for all children in the population of interest, for White, Black, and Hispanic children, for preschoolers, and for 3-year groupings of grades."}, {"section_title": "Before-and After-School Programs and Activities", "text": "This topic, focusing on the ways that parents arrange for supervision and enrichment during the out-of-school hours for children who are enrolled in kindergarten through eighth grade, was introduced as part of the Parent-NHES:1999. It was the focus of the 2001 Before-and After-School Programs and Activities survey (ASPA-NHES:2001). Interviews were conducted with parents who reported on the before-and/or after-school arrangements in which their children participated, including care by relatives or nonrelatives in a private home, before-or after-school programs in centers and in schools, activities that might provide adult supervision in the out-of-school hours, and children's self-care. Items also addressed continuity of care arrangements, parental perceptions of quality, reasons for choosing parental care, and obstacles to participation in nonparental arrangements. The child's health and disability status and characteristics of the parents and household were also collected.

A more detailed discussion of the topics and issues for the NHES:2001 surveys follows. There were two types of instruments in the NHES:2001, the screening interview (referred to as the Screener) and three extended interviews, one for the ECPP-NHES:2001, one for the ASPA-NHES:2001, and one for the AELL-NHES:2001. (See appendix A of the full report for copies of the NHES:2001 survey instruments.) The Screener was completed by a member of the household who was age 18 or older. 1 It was used to determine whether sampled telephone numbers belonged to households, gather the information needed to sample household members to be interview subjects for one or more surveys, 2 select the appropriate respondent for ECPP and ASPA interviews, and administer some items about household characteristics in households in which no one was sampled for an extended interview. The Screener was designed to accomplish these tasks effi ciently, placing minimum burden on the respondent."}, {"section_title": "Early Childhood Program Participation Survey (ECPP-NHES:2001)", "text": "In the ECPP-NHES:2001 survey, data were collected about children from birth through age 6 as of December 31, 2000, who were not enrolled in kindergarten or a higher grade in school. 3 The respondent for the ECPP interview was the adult living in the household who was the most knowledgeable about the child's care and education. 4 In the ECPP interview, subjects were routed to one of two questionnaire paths, infant or preschool. The infant path (I) of the ECPP interview was for children newborn through 2 years of age. The preschool path (N) was for children who were age 3 or older and not yet attending kindergarten or primary school. These children were typically 3 to 5 years old, but eight were 6 years old. Information was collected about participation in early childhood care and programs (relative care, nonrelative care, center-based programs, and Early/Head Start), program continuity, parental perceptions of the quality of arrangements, and factors in parental choice of arrangement, literacy-related skills and activities, and training and support for families of preschoolers. Irrespective of the questionnaire path for the child, parents were asked basic demographic questions about the child, the child's health and disability status, parent/guardian characteristics, and household characteristics. To avoid redundancy and greater response burden in households with multiple interviews, household information was collected only at the end of the fi rst extended interview conducted in each household. Similarly, parent/guardian information was collected only once per household, unless sampled children in the same household had different parents. 5 Exhibit 1-2 shows the structure of the ECPP and ASPA interviews, which contained many parallel items, and the distribution of topics among the paths for each interview."}, {"section_title": "Before-and After-School Programs and Activities Survey (ASPA-NHES:2001)", "text": "In the ASPA-NHES:2001 survey, data were collected about children who were in kindergarten through eighth grade provided they were age 15 6 or younger. The respondent for the ASPA interview was the parent or guardian living in the household who was the most knowledgeable about the sampled child's care and education. There were two paths through the interview items, the school path and the homeschool path. All respondents were asked basic demographic questions about the child, the child's health and disability status, parent/guardian characteristics, and household characteristics in both paths of the interview (see exhibit 1-2). The subjects of the school path (S) were children currently attending a regular school in kindergarten, including transitional kindergarten and prefi rst grade, through eighth grade. The ages of the children ranged from 3 to 15; however, all but 95 of them were ages 5 to 14. In the school Any household member age 18 or older was eligible to respond to the screening interview. However, if there were no household members age 18 or older, the male or female head of the household completed the Screener.
