The proposed immigration reform of 2016, however, has prioritized reducing barriers for immigrant high-skill workers to work within U.S. On approval, this bill would resolve the massive backlog of pending Green Card applications, and would allow temporary visa holders to switch jobs more easily while waiting for permanent residency. Delays in receiving permanent residency and restrictions attached to temporary work visa may affect an immigrant's intentions to stay in the U.S. These proposed reforms may improve retention of immigrant scholars, scientists and researchers graduating from U.S universities. This study uses data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), the Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR) and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), to evaluate the impact of wait-times for permanent residency (Green Card Status) on the migration decisions of foreign doctoral recipients graduating from U.S. universities. Ph.D. recipients from some countries such as China and India have to wait five to ten years to acquire permanent residency status within U.S., in addition to the time these immigrants have already spent in the country as graduate students. The econometric analysis in the paper uses country and year fixed-effects regression specification, taking advantage of the exogenous variation in wait-time that depends on immigrant's country of origin and year of graduation. The analysis focuses on three questions: First, does wait-time for permanent residency affect an immigrant's plans to stay within U.S immediately after graduating Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 2 from a U.S university? Second, what is the impact of wait-time on actual retention of these foreign born doctoral recipients? Third, is any impact of wait-time on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients in the U.S. persistent or temporary? The SED annually surveys individuals receiving research doctoral degrees from U.S institutions in a particular calendar year. These data are used to analyze immigrant doctoral recipients' plans to stay in the U.S. immediately after graduation. The SDR surveys are biennial longitudinal data, drawn from the SED sample, that provide a seven percent sample of persons obtaining their doctoral degree in the United States. While the SED only surveys newly graduated doctoral recipients, the SDR surveys follow cohorts of doctoral graduates over time. I use 2010 and 2013 SDR surveys to estimate the impact of GC wait-time on the location decisions of immigrants receiving their Ph.D. between 2001 and 2013. The information on Green Card (GC) wait-times is available on USCIS website, and matched to immigrants using country of birth and year of graduation recorded in the SED and SDR data. The results indicate that an additional year of wait-time decreases the probability of retention of fresh immigrant doctoral recipients (0-2 years since graduation) by 5.5 percentage points. The current (Jan 2016) predicted wait-times from India and China are ten and six years respectively. This can decrease probability of retention of fresh graduates (0-2 years since graduation) from these two countries by one-half and one-third respectively. However, the results indicate that the impact of wait-time on the retention of immigrant Ph.D. recipients is temporary and not persistent. For immigrant doctoral recipients between 3 and 5 years since graduation the impact decreases to 1.2 percentage points, and, for the immigrants at least 6 years past graduation there is no effect of wait-time on immigrant's retention in the U.S. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 3 Previous studies have analyzed the impact of visa restrictions on source and receiving countries' knowledge economies. However, there is a dearth of research analyzing the impact of these visa restrictions on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients graduating from U.S. universities. Finn M.G (2012, 2014) studied trends in the stay-rates of doctoral recipients from U.S universities and concluded that stay-rates vary substantially by country of citizenship. This is the first study to analyze the impact of wait-time for permanent residency on the immediate and long term retention of immigrant doctoral recipients graduating within U.S.\nIn 2009, 33 percent of the doctoral degrees within U.S. were earned by foreign students. In all, these international graduate students accounted for 50 percent of degrees in the physical sciences, 67 percent in engineering and 68 percent in economics (Bound, Turner and Walsh, 2009). More than 65 percent of these foreign graduates continue to stay and work in U.S. after graduation (Borjas, 2009). These high skilled immigrants are initially employed in the United States on temporary work visa category (H1-B visas). While on H1-B visa status, immigrants are eligible to adjust their status to become legal permanent residents (LPR) or Green Card (GC) holders. While these immigrants apply to adjust their status to become legal permanent residents, either the change of status happens immediately or it takes years depending on their country of birth and date of acceptance of the GC petition 16 . The delays in GC compel immigrants to work on H1-B status for longer durations. While on H1-B, these high skilled immigrants are unable to change jobs or, in many cases, even accept a promotion, without losing their position in the visa queue (Mukhopadhyay and Oxborrow, 2012) 17 . This paper uses variation by country and year in the GC wait period to analyze whether longer waits for GC status negatively impact the short term and long term career outcomes of the immigrant doctoral recipient's graduating from U.S. Universities. Data 16 The wait depends on GC cutoff date. Country-wise cutoff dates are published monthly in USCIS bulletins. All applicants from a specific country who have applied and accepted before the cutoff date are eligible for GC status change rest have to wait until their application acceptance date by USCIS is less than or equal to cutoff date. post-doc appointments, job mobility, working outside the field of research and earnings. The results indicate that longer GC wait-times reduce mobility and working outside the field of research even in the long run. There is short-term negative effect on post-doc appointments and earnings that dissipates in the long run. There are studies analyzing the impact of visa restrictions on source and receiving countries' knowledge economies. However, there is a dearth of research analyzing the impact of these visa restrictions on long term and short term career outcomes of the high skilled immigrants who face these restrictions. This is the first study to analyze the effect of GC wait-times for permanent residence status on career outcomes of immigrant doctoral recipients graduating from U.S. universities."}, {"section_title": "INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND ON VISAS AND PERMANENT RESIDENCY", "text": "The paper evaluates the retention of immigrants who graduated with Ph.D.s from universities in the United States. In 2009, 33 percent of the doctoral degrees within U.S. were earned by foreign students. In all, these international graduate students accounted for 50 percent of degrees in the physical sciences, 67 percent in engineering and 68 percent in economics (Bound, Turner and Walsh, 2009). More than 65 percent of these foreign graduates continue to stay and work in U.S. after graduation (Borjas, 2009). As students in the United States, these immigrants are mostly on F-1 visas 1 , which allow international students to pursue education in the United States. After graduation, F-1 students who become employed in the United States may switch to H1-B visas, if they are sponsored by their employers. The H1-B visa program is designed for temporary workers employed in \"specialty occupations\". The specialty occupations require specialty knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. On this visa status immigrants can work in the U.S up to three years from the date of sponsorship, and then the visa requires renewal 1 Except immigrants from Canada and Mexico they get F-3 visas. These are for \"border commuters\" who reside in their country of origin while attending school in the United States. These are granted to nationals of Mexico or Canada only and these visa holders may study part time -or full time. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 4 after every three years 2 . While immigrants are on H1-B visa, they are tied to the sponsoring firm, they cannot leave their employer within U.S., and if they get laid-off they are required to leave the country, unless they succeed in finding a new sponsoring employer. While on H1-B visa status, immigrants are eligible to adjust their status to become legal permanent residents (LPR) or Green Card (GC) holders. Once an immigrant receives GC status they are free to look for other employment opportunities and can start their own businesses and consultancies 3 . Recently graduated doctoral recipients' who do not have H1-B sponsorship from the employer have an option to remain and work within United States for one to two years on the OPT (optional practical training) status. However, they cannot file for GC on this status 4 . When these immigrants apply to become legal permanent residents, the wait-time depends on their country of birth and date of acceptance of the GC petition. If an immigrant is from any country except China and India the change of status from H1-B to GC is immediate. However, for an immigrant from China and India, because of high volumes of GC petitions from these countries in the EB-2 (high-skilled) category, and limited annual per country quotas, the status change from H1-B to GC takes years 5 . For example, take two immigrants on H1-B, one from the U.K. and other from India. Assume for both immigrants the GC applications are accepted in January, 2016. There is no wait-time for the immigrant from the U.K.. Because U.K. never exceeds the quota, there is no Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 5 backlog, and his visa status is changed immediately to GC. In January, 2016 however, the USCIS was only granting GC status to immigrants from India whose application had been accepted in August 2008. Because of this backlog, the immigrant from India has an estimated wait-time of 7.52 years for permanent residency. The United States Department of State publishes a monthly Visa Bulletin 6 , which lists cut-off dates for different immigration categories and countries of birth. The Jan 2016 EB-2 cutoff date for China is March 2012, for India is August 2008, and for all other countries it is Jan 2016 (current). While waiting for GC, immigrants who remain in the U.S. must remain on the temporary work visa, and are subject to its restrictions on job mobility. If immigrants' GC applications are not approved before the expiration of their temporary visa and all its legal possible extensions, they may have to leave the country (Kirkegaard, 2007). The uncertainties attached to working on H1-B may make working in the U.S. after graduation less attractive for immigrants who face longer GC wait-times."}, {"section_title": "IMPACT OF GC WAIT-TIME ON MIGRATION CHOICES OF FOREIGN DOCTORAL RECIPIENTS", "text": "Let us assume for simplicity that after graduation new doctoral recipients have three options: One, leave to home country immediately after graduation; two, stay temporarily within the U.S. and then go back to the home country; three, stay permanently in the U.S. Case I: Let us assume that the work experience accumulated within U.S. does not have any additional value in the immigrant's home country, and that the cost of returning to home country increases over time. When the doctoral immigrants compare their expected life-time earnings in 6 Visa Bulletin is a publication regarding immigration to the United States published by the United States Department of the State. The primary purpose of this bulletin is to provide an update waiting list ( also known as Priority Date) for immigrants that are subject to the quota system. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 6 the U.S. and home country respectively, they will stay in the U.S if expected life-time earnings within U.S are higher; else they will leave immediately after graduation. Now, let us add delays in GC status for some immigrants to our assumption above. These delays will compel some immigrants to work on H1-B visas for longer durations; this will further restrict employment opportunities within U.S. for the immigrants working on H1-Bs compared to other immigrants, lowering the expected life-time earnings within U.S. compared to immigrants from countries with no GC waits. This could cause immigrant doctoral graduates from countries with long GC waits to exit the U.S. immediately after graduation at higher rates. Case II: Here we assume that immigrant doctoral recipients receive positive returns to the U.S. work experience when they return to work in their home country. In this case, in order to maximize their life-time earnings, these immigrants may choose first to accumulate U.S work experience before returning to their home country. That is, there will be some temporary stayers. Further, assuming that there are diminishing returns to accumulative U.S. experience, and the cost of transition back increases with time spent in the U.S., these temporary stayers may prefer to exit U.S. at their early to mid-career points. With perfect information and no wait-time for GC status, immigrant doctoral recipients choose their optimal stay durations in the U.S to maximize their aggregate life time earnings. However, with the long GC wait-time and the limitations on H1-B visas, the optimal-stay duration of these immigrants will likely be reduced. These immigrants on temporary work visas are likely to exit the country earlier, compared to the optimal exit duration they would have if they had their GC status.

These data files provide detailed information on educational attainment and career outcomes of doctoral recipients graduating from U.S universities 7 . The SED annually surveys individuals graduating with research doctoral degrees from U.S institutions. The SED response rate is around 92 percent. This data set is a rich source of information on new doctoral recipients. The SED asks the recent doctoral graduates if they intend \"to live, work, or study in the U.S after graduation\". I use this information to analyze whether the waiting period to procure a Green Card (GC) affects intentions to stay and work within the country after graduating from U.S universities. I restrict my analysis to immigrants who received their doctoral degree between 1990 and 2010. The data includes both immigrant doctoral graduates entering U.S. as graduate students and immigrants entering U.S. as under-graduate students and then entering graduate schools for doctoral degrees. I identify \"immigrants\" in the data set to be an individual who is either a naturalized citizen or a non-citizen. To identify native country, I use information on birth country, country of high school and country where Bachelor's degree was awarded. In order to reduce miss-measurement of home country, only individuals having high school country same as birth country or country where Bachelor's was awarded is same as birth country or all three are same were included in the sample. In most cases (95-percent plus), birth country of individuals matched with either country of high school or country where Bachelors degree was awarded. 7 The data set for these high-skilled workers is maintained by the National Science Foundations. The National Science Foundation has two websites that provide detail descriptions of the SED and SDR data sets. The SED website is http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/ssed/sedmeth.htm; and the SDR website is http://sestat.nsf.gov.

The SDR is a biennial longitudinal data of doctoral recipients drawn from the universe of respondents in SED. A sample of newly minted doctorates is added to the sample every two years and a \"maintenance cut\" of older doctorates is conducted in order to keep the sample size relatively constant at around 30,000 per wave. I restrict my analysis to immigrant graduates only. The analysis uses the 2010 and 2013 SDR waves; these waves use integrated design ensuring proper representation of PhD. graduates from U.S. universities who live outside the U.S 8 . The analysis uses the SDR 2010 and 2013 sample weights 9 . GC wait-times are calculated using the U.S. government's visa bulletins, which are available on the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. The Visa Bulletins publish country-specific GC cut-off dates for each month in a year. Here I present a simple example to explain the wait-time calculation for GC status. Let us assume that a hypothetical individual graduates on April 1 st 2013. I assume that it takes about a year to submit and get the GC petition accepted by USCIS. Adding this year, I expect that the USCIS will accept the application of this immigrant by April 1 st , 2014.

Beginning 2003, cycle the International Survey of Doctorate Recipient (ISDR) to represent U.S. trained doctorate recipients living outside U.S. was added. However there were some weighting and representation issues. From 2010 onwards National Science Foundation (NSF) developed a methodology to integrate National SDR and International SDR to assure true representation of doctoral recipients from U.S. living within or outside the country. The integrated design used in these surveys ensure coverage for all domains, thus individual migration has no negative impact on the frame of coverage.

That is 5.46 years. intend to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation 10 . An important thing to notice here is that China and India not only account for leading number of doctoral graduates, but these two countries also account for major proportion of graduates intending to stay and work in the U.S.. Table 1 and Table 2 together indicate that there is a large pool of doctoral candidates from China and India in the work force. This excessive supply of Chinese and Indian doctorate recipients quickly fills up the country-specific GC quota in EB-2 category. As a result immigrants from these two countries often face extensive wait-times for GC status. India respectively intending to stay in the U.S. immediately after graduation. For China we observe that average wait-time in months for GC is increasing over the years and, though most recent doctoral graduates (more than 80 percent) intend to stay, there is a noticeable drop in fraction of recent doctoral graduates intending to stay in the U.S. after graduation. However, for India we don't 10 observe any such patterns. There is no visible relationship between GC wait-time and intentions to stay and work in the U.S for doctoral graduates from India, graduating from the U.S. universities."}, {"section_title": "REGRESSION ANALYSIS", "text": "I first analyze the effect of wait-times for Green Card (GC) on intentions to stay in the U.S. immediately after graduation, using SED-DRF Files 1985 onwards. The regression specification is: In equation 1our unit of observation is individual (i), from country of origin (c), graduating in survey year (t). The dependent variable is an indicator variable where '1' indicates that the respondent intends to stay and work within U.S after graduation and '0' indicates that he or she plans to leave U.S after graduation. The explanatory variable Expected Wait-time (EW) varies by immigrant's birth country (c) and year of graduation (t). Kit is a vector containing demographic controls including age, age-square, age at the time of entering PhD. program, gender, and marital status. Sit is a vector of education and individual's quality controls which contains variables indicating school quality and education background.

Differences in \u03b2n ' s across the four categories reflect both time and cohort effects. For instance, it is likely that for a particular cohort, the effect of wait-time in year of graduation is different three years after graduation compared to six years after graduation. At the same time it is also possible that the impact of wait-time three years after graduation is different for cohorts who graduated in year 2004, compared to those who graduated in year 2007. Since we have two waves of the Integrated SDR data, 2010 and 2013, and additionally we have repeated observations of the same cohorts, this allows us to interact the GRnt X EWcg terms with an indicator to survey year 2013.  Equation (3) is similar to Equation (2) but includes interactions of wait-time with both graduation groups and survey year indicators ( ). Our estimates of the 's will allow us to investigate whether differences in the coefficients in equation 2are due to differences in the effect of wait-time across cohorts or across years since graduation. By adding these terms we can accomplish two goals: First, we can compare effects of waittime on the same cohort over time. That is, respondents who were in the group interval 0-2 years in survey year 2010 will move up to group interval 3-5 years in survey year 2013, and so on. This, way we can observe how the effect of wait-time varies with time since graduation for the same cohort. Second, adding graduation group and survey interaction terms will help us to observe if the effect of wait-time for a particular graduation group varies across survey years.

We see that the average age at the time of graduation is around 33 years. The percentage of males graduating with Ph.D. has declined to 64.6 percent in the year 2010 from 71.1 percent in the year 2000 and 81.9 in the year 1990. The table also indicates that more than half of these recent doctoral recipients are married at the time of receiving their doctoral degrees. The average age at the time of entering doctoral program is between 29 to 33 years for these foreign born doctoral recipients.   Table 6 provides the estimation results from regression equation 1using SED data. In column (1) we have survey fixed effects, country fixed effects and field of study fixed effects. In column (2) we add all individual and school quality controls, and in column (3) we add the interaction of field of study and survey year. Here we observe that the expected wait-time for acquiring GC status has slight negative impact on the intentions to stay of newly graduated foreign born doctoral graduates. The coefficient on the expected wait-time here is -.011 and is statistically significant at 0.01 levels. The coefficient indicates that each additional year of wait-time to acquire GC status will lead to decrease in the probability of intending to stay by 1.1 percentage points. The Jan 2016 predicted wait-times for the immigrants from India and China are 10 and 6 years respectively, which is predicted to decrease the intention to stay percentage of immigrant doctoral graduates from these two countries by 11 and 6 percentage points respectively. Table 7 is similar to Table 6 but here we restrict our data to immigrants graduating in year 2001 or after. This sample is the universal set of the Integrated SDR sample that will be used to estimate the effects of wait-time on actual retention of the immigrant doctoral recipients from Table 8 onwards. We observe that the coefficient on wait-time increases in magnitude to .015. However, the coefficient is not significantly different from the same coefficient in the Table (6) 14 . Table 6 and Table 7 show the impact of wait-time on intentions to stay of recent immigrant doctoral recipients. From Table 8 onwards the analysis is focused on impact of wait-time on actual retention (continual stay) of immigrant doctoral recipients. Table 8 examines whether the effect of GC wait-time on actual retention changes with time since Ph.D. attainment. Here, column (1) and Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 15 column (2) show results of regression specifications (2) and (3) respectively. Column (1) indicates that the impact of GC wait-time is greatest on immigrant doctoral recipients in group 0-2 years since graduation. An additional year of GC wait-time reduces the probability an individual who has graduated in the past two years resides within U.S by 5.5 percentage points. 15 Comparing Table 8 and Table 7, it is clear that the negative impact of GC wait-time is stronger on actual retention (5.5 percentage points) than the stay intensions (1.5 percentage points) for recent immigrant doctoral graduates. For immigrants 3-5 years since graduation an additional year of GC wait-time reduces the probability of retention by 1.2 percentage points. We do not observe any significant impact of GC wait-time more than five years after graduation. This suggests that the effect of GC wait-time is short term. Wait-time causes some high skilled immigrants to exit the U.S. sooner than they would have otherwise, but GC wait-time does not affect long term retention. On the other hand, the results in Column (1) may just be cohort-specific in effects. In other words, the coefficients in Column 1may decrease with time since graduation because earlier cohorts were less responsive to GC waittime than the most recent cohorts of graduates. In order to determine whether the wait-time effect is short-lived, we need to distinguish between these two interpretations. In Table 8 column (2) we take advantage of two waves of longitudinal SDR 2010 and 2013 by interacting the indicator for survey year 2013 with the graduation group and GC wait-time interaction term. This way, we can test whether impact of GC wait-time on the same graduation group varies across the survey years. We also observe how the impact of wait-time varies for the same cohort as years since graduation increases. For example, immigrants of group interval 0-2 in 2010 survey will be in the group interval 3-5 in 2013 survey. The results of equation 5 are reported in Column (2) of Table (8). For the group 0-2 years since graduation there is a small increase in the effect of GC wait-time from 5.1 percentage points to 5.7 percentage points between the 2010 and 2013 surveys. For immigrants three or more years post-graduation there is no change in the effect of GC wait-time across the two survey years. Further, in Table 8 Column (2) the coefficient on interaction term 3-5 X E (WT) X I2013 is not significant. This indicates that the impact of GC wait-time for those 0-2 years since graduation in 2010 is not permanent. As this cohort moves to 3-5 years since graduation in survey year 2013, the impact of GC wait-time falls substantially. Similarly, for individuals in the group 3-5 years since graduation in survey year 2010, the slight negative impact of GC wait-time on individual retention (-.009) disappears when they move up to the group 6-8 years since graduation in the survey year 2013. This confirms that this negative impact of GC wait-time on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients is in fact temporary and it decreases and disappears with time since graduation."}, {"section_title": "IMPACT OF MARRIAGE AND EMPLOYER'S UNWILLINGNESS TO SPONSOR GREEN CARD", "text": "There are two instances that may impact the estimation of GC wait-time computed in this paper first is marriage to a U.S. citizen or a Green Card holder the second is employers' unwillingness to sponsor Green Card.

Employer's unwillingness to sponsor Green Card may add to the GC wait-time for all immigrants irrespective of their country of origin. However, most employees hiring such high skilled employees desire to sponsor GC to add to permanency of the employment.

The current (Jan 2016) predicted GC wait-times from India and China are ten and six years respectively. This can decrease probability of retention of fresh graduates (0-2 years since graduates) from these two countries by half and one third respectively. However, the results indicate that the impact of GC wait-time on the retention of immigrant Ph.D. recipients is temporary and not persistent. For immigrant doctoral recipients between 3 and 5 years since graduation the impact decreases to 1.2 percentage points, and, for the immigrants at least 6 years past graduation there is no effect of GC wait-time on immigrant's retention in the U.S. This is the first study evaluating the impact of long waits for Green Card that immigrants from some countries face due to excess demand of residency petitions in the U.S. from their birth country, on their intentions to stay and retention within the U.S. Results of the study can be used to Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 18 evaluate a bigger policy question regarding the competence of high skilled immigrant policies to ensure retention of the foreign researchers and scientists graduating from U.S. universities. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\"\nThe results indicate that longer wait for permanent residency does affect immigrant's probability to work on a post-doc appointment. Immigrants 2+ years past graduation facing longer GC wait-times are less likely to work on post-doc appointments, have less job mobility, and are less likely to work outside the field of research. These findings clearly indicate that restrictions on temporary visa (H1-B) are binding both in short run and long run, and career paths of immigrants are steered as per these restrictions. The restrictions on H1-B and long durations involved in change of visa status from H1-B to Green Card, also impact earnings of immigrant doctoral recipients. However, the impact of earnings decreases and disappears in the long run. There are studies analyzing the impact of visa restrictions on source and receiving countries' knowledge economies. However, there is a dearth of research analyzing the impact of these visa restrictions on long term and short term career outcomes of the high skilled immigrants who face these restrictions. This is the first study evaluating the impact of long waits for green card that immigrants from some countries face due to excess demand of residency petitions in the U.S. from their country, on their long and short term career outcomes. We do observe that these restrictions do make the career of these immigrants less flexible compared to other similar immigrants, especially Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 36 in the short run. This threat to flexibility might affect the optimum career choices that these immigrants could otherwise make in the no restriction scenario; the paper leaves this question for upcoming studies in this field. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" Though there is extensive literature on the family wage-gap, this study adds to the existing literature by examining a group of women with doctoral degrees.

Former provides information on the cost of choices that are related to child bearing, and the later helps in formulation of family policies that may make motherhood less costly for highly skilled female scientists, doctors and engineers.\nThe results indicate that the family wage-gap does exist among women with Ph.D.s and is 6.8 percent. However, most of the existing wage difference can be explained by differences in human capital characteristics, adjusted experience, and current job characteristics between mothers and non-mothers for these women with Ph.D.s. This implies that there is no significant presence of wage discrimination for these high skilled women with Ph.D.s working on same/similar jobs. However, if the jobs (current job characteristics) that these women land on is because of discrimination, it is still questionable and out of scope for this study. It will be an interesting area to explore for upcoming studies in this domain. Results also show that the wage difference is monotonic in number of children; it increases with the increase in number of children. The wage-gap is highest for married women. The wage difference is most evident for women in age interval 36-45 years. Lastly, the wage-penalty is higher for women, who plan children before the completion of the degree or age 36. Though there is extensive literature on the family wage-gap, this study adds to the existing literature by examining a group of women who have substantially invested in acquiring advanced skills that are typically used in careers promising high wages. Further, both the FWG and the factors explaining the existence of FWG among these highly skilled women are interesting from a policy perspective. The former provides information on the cost of choices that are related to child bearing, and the later helps in formulation of family policies which could make motherhood less costly for highly skilled women scientists, doctors and engineers.

As students, these immigrants are on F-1 visa 18 . The F-1 visas are a type of nonimmigrant student visa that allows foreigners to pursue education in the United States. After graduation, F1 students who seek employment in the United States either directly obtain H1-B visas if they are employed or go through OPT 19 (optional practical training) status which may eventually lead to an H1-B visa. This H1-B visa program is designed for temporary workers employed in \"specialty occupations\". These specialty occupations require specialized knowledge and at least a Bachelors' degree or its equivalent. Most H1-B holders are sponsored by American employers. The duration to work in the U.S. on this visa status is 3 years. However, the visa status is renewable for other three or more years (depending on the standing of Green Card petition). When these immigrants apply to become legal permanent residents, the GC wait-times depend on their country of birth and date of acceptance of the GC petition. If an immigrant is from any country except China or India the change of status from H1-B to GC is immediate. However, for an immigrant from China or India, because of high volumes of GC petitions from these countries in the EB-2 (high-skilled) category and limited annual percountry quotas, the status change from H1-B to GC takes years 20 . For example, take two immigrants on H1-B, one from the U.K. and other from India. Assume for both immigrants the GC applications are accepted in January, 2016. There is no GC wait-time for the immigrant from the U.K.. Because U.K. never exceeds the quota, there is no backlog, and his visa status is changed immediately to GC. In January, 2016 however, the USCIS was only granting GC status to immigrants from India whose application had been accepted in August 2008. Because of this backlog, the immigrant from India has an estimated wait time of 7.52 years for permanent residency. While waiting for GC immigrants who remain in the U.S. must remain on the temporary work visa, and are subject to its restrictions on job mobility. If immigrants' GC applications are not approved before the expiration of their temporary visa and all its legal possible extensions, they may have to leave the country (Kirkegaard, 2007). The uncertainties and restrictions attached to working on H1-B may make working in the U.S. after graduation less attractive for immigrants who face longer GC wait-times. Khosla (2016) in her paper demonstrated short term negative impact of GC wait-time on the retention of immigrant doctoral recipients from U.S universities 22 . This paper is focused on finding the impact of GC wait-time on the short term and long term career outcomes of the immigrant doctoral recipients, who remain in the U.S. after graduating from the U.S. universities."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Sixty five percent of foreign graduates continue to stay and work in U.S. after graduation (Borjas, 2009). The increasing stay rates of high skilled immigrants have evoked intense debates over U.S. immigration policy. Past studies in the literature have examined whether high skill immigrants depress wages and displace native workers in the U.S. labor market or contribute to higher wages for natives by accelerating knowledge creation, factor productivity and innovation in the host country. Peri, Shih, and Sparber (2015)   (the GC wait-time is zero for these immigrants), immigrant doctoral recipients from China and India with estimated GC wait-time less than 3.5 years (median GC wait-time for immigrants from China and India) and immigrant doctoral recipients from China and India with GC wait-time more than 3.5 years. Table 11 compares the same for the immigrants from China and India remaining in the U.S. and leaving U.S. These immigrants are quite similar in terms of gender, children, age during the survey year and age during Ph.D. These immigrants are also quite similar in terms of the school quality both for their bachelor's degrees and doctoral degrees. The only observed difference between immigrants from China and India and immigrants from other countries is that immigrants from China and India are more likely to have majors in the engineering and computer science fields. However, immigrants from China and India with GC wait-time less than 3.5 years are very similar to Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 27 immigrants with GC wait more than 3.5 years for all demographic, educational background and school quality characteristics.   To analyze whether the impact of GC wait-time is temporary or permanent the following econometric specification is used: Immigrants are divided into four group intervals based on time past graduation. The intervals are 0-2 years, 3-5 years, 6-8 years and 9-11 years. This specification also includes survey year*graduation year fixed effects ( gt \uf070 ). This interaction term will help us to control for any cohort specific differences across the two survey years. Considering we have two consecutive SDR surveys 2010 and 2013, and most of the observations of 2010 survey are present in 2013 survey, in the next econometric specification we add an interaction term for survey year 2013 to our explanatory variable ( 28 . Adding this will help us in two ways: One, we can observe if the impact of GC wait-time is consistent on similar cohort intervals for the two survey years. Two, we"}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "A sample of newly minted doctorates is added to the old SDR sample every two years and a \"maintenance cut\" of older doctorates is conducted in order to keep the sample size relatively constant at around 30,000 per wave Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 29 can observe how impact of GC wait-time on career outcomes varies for a particular cohort in the survey year 2010 when it shifts to next cohort group in the survey year 2013. For instance, cohort group 0-2 years past graduation in the survey year 2010 will shift to cohort group 3-5 past graduation for the survey year 2013 and so on.  Here n \uf062 coefficients alone provides us with inter-cohort comparisons of cohorts in year 2010, and n \uf062 * provides us with inter-cohort comparisons of cohorts between the two survey years SDR 2010 and SDR 2013. Comparing the two coefficients n \uf062 's with n \uf062 *'s we can see whether the impact of GC wait-time on given career outcome of immigrant doctoral recipients is consistent between the two survey years or not.

Here the dependent variable is an indicator variable which equals to \"1\" if immigrant is working on a post-doc appointment and \"0\" otherwise. The coefficient on GC wait-time ranges between -.003 and -.006. These coefficients are non-significant (for p< .05) under various regression specifications. Table 14 reports the results for post-doc appointments by cohort using equation (2) and equation (3). For cohort 0-2 years past graduation, each additional year of GC wait-time slightly increases the probability an immigrant doctoral graduate works as a post-doc by 0.2 percentage Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 30 points. For cohort 3-5 years past graduation, we observe that each additional year of GC wait-time decreases the probability an immigrant works as a post doc by 0.9 to 1.4 percentage points. For cohorts 5+ years from graduation, we do not observe any significant impact of GC wait-time on post doc appointments. The negative effect of GC wait-time on post-doc appointment for the cohort 3-5 years past graduation, is larger in survey year 2013 than in survey year 2010. For all other cohort intervals the impact of GC wait-time is stable across the survey years 2010 and 2013. One incentive for immigrants to take post-doc is that private companies face visa caps for hiring temporary workers, but universities and non-profit organizations are not bounded by these caps. Thus, for the years when caps are binding, immigrants may choose post-doc positions to continue their stay in the U.S. as most post-doc positions are exempted from H1-B caps. This may increase the probability of individual to work as a post-doc for the first year past graduation. A big disincentive for immigrants with long GC wait-time to work on post-doc is these positions are temporary and rarely lead to GC status. Thus, those who have an opportunity to file H1-B and move to more permanent jobs may choose such opportunities over post-doc appointments. B: The impact of GC wait-time on job mobility Table 15 estimates the impact of GC wait-time on an indicator that equals one if the Individual changed jobs in the past year. According to Table 15 an additional year of GC wait-time reduces probability an immigrant doctoral recipient changed jobs in the past year by 2.3 percentage points. These results are robust under various regression specifications. Adding quality Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 31 controls and survey and field of major's interaction term reduce this impact to 1.9 percentage points 29 . Table 16 uses equation -(2) and equation - 3to estimate if the impact of GC wait-time on job mobility is short run or long term. According to Table 16 column 1we see a slight positive impact of GC wait-time on the cohort 0-2 years past graduation. For all other cohort this impact is between -.030 and -.045. This implies that for the cohorts 2+ years past graduation, an additional year of GC wait-time reduces job mobility on an average by 3.7 percentage points. C: The impact of GC wait-time on working outside the field of research  1. Here \"1\" denotes working outside the field and \"0\" otherwise. Under all specifications Table 17 (Column 1, Column (2) and Column (3)), we observe that the coefficients on cg EW ranges from -.039 to -.045. This implies that each additional year of GC wait-time decreases the probability of immigrant doctoral recipient working outside the field of research by 4.5 percentage points. According to Table18 (Column (1) and column (2)) the impact of GC wait-time on the probability of immigrant working outside the field of specialization is similar for all cohorts. The coefficient nt cg GR EW \uf0b4 ranges from-.037 to -.040. These coefficients are consistent if we add survey year interaction term to the cohort and expected wait interaction term. 29 The two coefficients are not significantly different using t-test at p = .05 . Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 32 D: The impact of GC wait-time on immigrant's earnings. In Table 19 we use log of reported annual earnings in the SDR reference year as a dependent variable in equation- (1). The coefficient on cg EW here in column 1is -.026 and in column (3) with individual quality controls and survey and field of major interaction term is -.019. These coefficients are significant at p = .05. These findings indicate that an additional year of GC wait-time reduces annual earnings of immigrant doctoral recipients by 1.9 percent. The current (Jan 2016) predicted GC wait-times from India and China are ten and six years respectively, this implies that wait for Green Card can suppress earnings of immigrant doctoral recipients from these countries by 19.0 and 11.4 percent respectively. The findings are in lower bound of previous findings by Kandilov (2007), who reported that immigrants experience a wage gain of 18-25 percent between their first job in the U.S. and their current job after receiving a green card. Table 20 column 1indicates that the impact of GC wait-time varies with cohort intervals. The coefficient on nt cg GR EW \uf0b4 is -.044 for the cohort interval 0-2 years past graduation, the coefficient diminishes to -.021 for the cohort interval 3-5 years past gradation, and the coefficient falls significantly to -.014 for the cohort interval 6-8 years past graduation. Further, we see no impact of GC wait-time on earnings for the cohort interval 9-11 years past graduation. According to Table 20 column (2) this impact follows a similar trend if we compare cohorts in similar cohort groups across two survey years 2010 and 2013. Here we also observe that when cohort in interval 0-2 years past graduation shifts to cohort interval 3-5 years past graduation the coefficient nt cg GR EW \uf0b4 falls from -.044 to -0.18 (0.025 -.007). Similar kinds of intra-cohort impacts are observed if we compare same cohort with interval shift for other intervals (based on years past graduation). From these observations we can conclude that impact of GC wait-time on the earnings of immigrant doctoral recipients is temporary. It diminishes and disappears in the long run.

Adding demographic and human capital characteristics in the second row diminishes the wage-penalty for women with children to 6.8 percent and 7.1 percent for fixed-effects and OLS regression specifications respectively. This is equivalent to a reduction of about 40 percent of the gross wage penalty for both fixed-effects and OLS regression specifications. The paper refers the results from this iteration for the fixed-effect model as FWG from here on. The next three rows consider: One, what is the impact of adjusted experience on the FWG? Two, if FWG is within a job (that is these wage differences are present for women with the same job characteristics) or between jobs (that is these wage difference arise because these women have different job characteristics)? In row 3, controlling for adjusted experience, the coefficient on motherhood indicator further reduces to 4.3 percent for the fixed-effects model and 4.1 percent for the OLS model by adding adjusted experience. The impact of adjusted experience is similar if we drop the observations with incomplete information on current job characteristics (row 4). Adding current job characteristics (row 5) reduces this penalty further to 2.4 percent and 2.2 percent for the fixed-effects and the OLS specification respectively. This indicates that most of these wage differences are between the jobs -that is, job characteristics differ between mothers and nonmothers. Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 46 children, from 4.4 percent for one child to 6.9 percent for two children, and 10.1 percent for three or more children each relative to reference category of no children. We do observe that most of this wage penalty is explained by adding additional controls for adjusted experience and current job characteristics for mothers in all categories. Next, the paper explores the heterogeneity in the FWG. Table 33 estimates the interaction of marital status and motherhood status. It is evident here that the FWG is highest for married women compared to other women with children. Controlling for demographic and human capital characteristics, it is about 6.3 percent for married women, whereas 5.4 to 4.9 percent for divorced and never-married. We do observe that the coefficients shrink by 52 to 73 percent after adding controls for adjusted experience and current job characteristics.  Waldfogel (1998), Blau & Kahn (1999), Budig and England (2001), the family gap is more prominent for women with younger children compared to others because younger children often demand more time and effort than older ones. After adding adjusted experience and current job characteristics for women with children age 6 years or older the FWG is no longer significant, and for women with children age 5 or younger the coefficient shrinks by 65 percent. FWG in the initial career years. However, once they become mothers, the FWG becomes significant. Table 35 also suggests that most of the wage penalty both in the fixed-effect model and the OLS model is explained by adding adjusted experience, and current job characteristics."}, {"section_title": "33", "text": "The SDR surveys collect information on the last year's earnings of the doctoral candidates in the sample. The analysis uses this information and reported current year's earnings to compute growth in earnings. Table 21 uses these computed values of growth in earnings as dependent variable in equation 1. We do not observe any significant impact of GC wait-time on the growth in earning of immigrant doctoral recipients working in the U.S. In Table 22 (column(1) and column(2) we observe no impact of GC-wait time on cohorts in intervals 3+ years past graduation. Conversely, for immigrant doctoral recipients in interval 0-2 years past graduation, the coefficient on nt cg GR EW \uf0b4 ranges between .029 and .041, demonstrating a positive impact. There is a strong possibility that this positive impact of GC wait-time on growth in earnings for this cohort can be explained by shifting of these immigrants from initial postdoctoral appointments to more permanent employment opportunities 30 . E: Sample Selection Issue. Khosla, P (2016) using country and year of graduation variations in GC-wait time demonstrated that for a fresh immigrant doctoral recipient an additional year of GC wait-time decreases the probability he or she still lives in the U.S. by 5.5 percentage points. This might raise a concern of selection issue driving the results of this paper. However, her findings that the impact of GC wait-time on immigrant's retention in the U.S. is temporary and is limited to five years past graduation assures that the long term impact of GC wait-time on job mobility and working outside the field of research are not driven by the sample selection issue. To confirm if the results for shortrun are affected by sample selection concern the sample of Table 11 (Demographic and Educational Background Indicators of Immigrant Graduates from China and India) is split into two groups: 0-5 30 We did observe a positive impact of GC-wait time on the probability of doctoral immigrant working as a post-doc for this cohort.

The summary statistics on demographic and background indicators for immigrants who continue to stay in the U.S and who exit for the group 0-5 years past graduation, confirm, that the immigrants from China and India, who exit are no different from immigrants who continue to stay on these characteristics. These findings are also consistent for the group 5+ years past graduation. 31"}, {"section_title": "37", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FAMILY WAGE GAP (FWG)", "text": "The family wage-gap is the pay penalty that women with children incur in relation to women without children.

Adjusted experience (AE) and current job characteristics (CJ) are often jointly determined with fertility decisions of women. These controls are not completely exogenous to the family wage-Note: \"The use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research, research methods, or conclusion contained in this report.\" 44 gap estimation. Adding these controls will allow us to explore whether and to what extent the wage gap exists because of differences in productivity, differences in job characteristics or discrimination between mothers and non-mothers for highly skilled women with Ph.D.s. In order to further investigate sources of the FWG and to identify which women from this sample are affected most by the wage-gap, the paper extends the equations 1and 2 Table 31 presents coefficient estimates from equation 1and (2). The fixed-effects model (row -1) captures the \"gross\" effect of motherhood with no controls other than personspecific and year-specific fixed effects. The results here indicate that wage penalty on mothers is 11.2 percent. The OLS model (row -1) show slightly higher gross-wage penalty, at 11.7 percent.
