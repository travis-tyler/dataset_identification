[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective Mealtime emotional climate (MEC) is related to parent feeding and mental health, and possibly to child food consumption. However, MEC has been inconsistently assessed with a variety of coding schemes and self-report instruments, and has not been examined longitudinally. This study aims to characterize MEC systematically using an observational, count-based coding scheme; identify whether parent feeding or mental health predict MEC; and examine whether MEC predicts child food consumption and weight. Methods A subsample of parents (n \u00bc 74) recruited from a larger study completed questionnaires when children were about 37 months, participated in a home visit to videotape a mealtime when children were about 41 months, and completed questionnaires again when children were about 51 months old. Maternal and child positive and negative emotions were coded from videotaped mealtimes. Observational data were submitted to cluster analyses, to identify dyads with similar emotion expression patterns, or MEC. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of MEC, and Analysis of Covariance was used to examine differences between MEC groups. Results Dyads were characterized as either Positive Expressers (high positive, low negative emotion) or All Expressers (similar positive and negative emotion). Increased food involvement feeding practices were related to decreased likelihood of being an All Expresser. Positive Expressers reported that their children ate more healthy food, compared with All Expressers. Conclusions Observed MEC is driven by maternal emotion, and may predict child food consumption. Food involvement may promote positive MEC. Improving MEC may increase child consumption of healthy foods."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Increased consumption of healthy foods-such as fruits, vegetables, and lean protein sources-is linked to lower risk for chronic disease (Bazzano et al., 2002; Esmaillzadeh et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2014) . Healthy food consumption declines from childhood to young adulthood (Demory-Luce et al., 2004) but is relatively stable from adolescence to adulthood, pointing to the importance of early habit formation and maintenance (Lien, Lytle, & Klepp, 2001) . Parents control and shape the home food environment, where children spend the majority of their time during this critical developmental phase (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Anzman, Rollins, & Birch, 2010; Fitzgibbon, Hayman, & Haire-Joshu, 2008; Krishnamoorthy, Hart, & Jelalian, 2006) . Family mealtimes provide a window of opportunity to observe whether certain behaviors or interactions-from both parents and children-are linked to food consumption and weight outcomes (Fiese, Foley, & Spagnola, 2006) . Increased family mealtime frequency is consistently related to healthy food consumption and lower risk for overweight in young children (Anderson & Whitaker, 2010; Fulkerson, Larson, Horning, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2014; Hammons & Fiese, 2011) . Mealtime quality also predicts child healthy food consumption (Fiese, Hammons, & Grigsby-Toussaint, 2012) .\nInterpersonal interactions, maternal emotional expression, mental health, and marital relationship quality have been examined previously as indicators of mealtime quality (Berge et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2011; Lytle, Seifert, Greenstein, & McGovern, 2000; Rollins, Belue, & Francis, 2010) . For example, increased maternal negative emotion expression (measured by assessing tone, body language, and facial expression) is linked to indulgent feeding styles and higher child weight (Hughes et al., 2011) . Furthermore, maternal depression is related to observed controlling feeding practices (Haycraft, Farrow, & Blissett, 2013) , and to self-report of fewer positive mealtime practices, such as being present while the child eats, child control of snacking, and food resource management (McCurdy, Gorman, Kisler, & Metallinos-Katsaras, 2014) . Observational studies suggest that the mealtime emotional climate (MEC)-positive and negative emotion expression frequency-is linked to feeding and weight (Berge et al., 2014; Fosco & Grych, 2013; Hughes et al., 2011) . For instance, families with more positive interpersonal dynamics (more warmth, higher relationship quality, and group enjoyment) have children with lower weight, as compared with families with more negative interpersonal dynamics (more hostility, food lecturing/moralizing, and indulgence; Berge et al., 2014) . Furthermore, studies with clinical samples have found success using behavioral interventions focused on feeding to improve mealtime affective management (Janicke, Mitchell, Quittner, Piazza-Waggoner, & Stark, 2008) . Collectively, findings suggest that emotional characteristics of mealtimes are modifiable, and may increase healthy food consumption or improve weight outcomes.\nHowever, measures of MEC vary, limiting our ability to compare across studies. Global observational schemes have been primarily used to examine MEC as a function of maternal (but not child) emotion expression (Hughes et al., 2011) , or family-and dyadrelationship quality (Berge et al., 2014) . Although global codes garner macro-level descriptions of behavior, it is difficult to measure changing dynamics using a global rating-based coding scheme (Chorney, McMurtry, Chambers, & Bakeman, 2015; Yoder & Symons, 2010) . Self-report measures or global coding schemes may yield foundational information about emotional climate, but these measures do not always depict a thorough representation of emotional expression. For instance, it is logical to expect that emotional climate depends-in part-on the proportion of positive and negative emotions expressed by family members during the meal. Therefore, an observational count coding system may provide a better alternative. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used this approach to measure MEC. Additionally, mealtimes may be especially challenging for parents who use unhealthy feeding practices or with mental health problems (Hughes et al., 2011; McPhie, Skouteris, Daniels, & Jansen, 2014) . Therefore, it is important to examine how parenting may influence MEC. Finally, all previous studies examining MEC have been cross-sectional; thus, longitudinal studies are needed.\nThe current study has three aims designed to address these limitations and to contribute to the body of knowledge regarding promotion of health and health behaviors in young children. The first aim of the present study is to characterize MEC using an observational count coding scheme, by examining the proportional frequency of maternal and child emotional expression during home-based family mealtimes. Given the focus in the literature on maternal emotional expression as an indicator of mealtime climate, we will examine whether child emotional expression also contributes to MEC. Second, we will examine whether parent feeding or mental health symptoms predict MEC. Finally, we will examine whether MEC predicts child food consumption or weight longitudinally. This work will contribute to our current understanding of the socioemotional context of eating behavior, by examining how observed emotional expression during home-based mealtimes is related to preschool-aged children's eating behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants for this study were drawn from the larger Synergistic Theory and Research on Obesity and Nutrition Group (STRONG) Kids Panel Study.

There were no significant or substantive differences in findings of any analyses when the seven male primary caregivers who completed surveys-but were not coded, as the coding scheme focused on mothers-were excluded or included.\nAim 1: Characterize MEC Cluster analyses identified two distinct types of dyads. The first cluster accounted for 79% (n \u00bc 59) of the dyads in this sample, and was characterized by relatively high positive emotions in mothers and children, and relatively low negative emotions in mothers (Positive Expressers). The second cluster accounted for 20% (n \u00bc 15) of the dyads in this sample, and was characterized by a similar amount of positive and negative emotions in parents and children (All Expressers). Group characteristics are reported in Table II . Maternal emotions seemed to drive cluster placement. Kruskal-Wallis H tests found significant differences between groups on maternal positive emotion ratios and maternal negative emotion ratios. Although there were trends toward Positive Expresser dyads having children with higher positive and lower negative emotion ratios as compared with All Expressers, these differences were not statistically significant.\nAim 2: Identify Predictors of MEC Kruskal-Wallis H tests (Table II) found significant differences between Positive Expressers and All Expressers on Food Involvement feeding practices and maternal depressive symptoms (Table II) . Therefore, these variables were examined as potential predictors of MEC in logistic regression analyses.\nIn the first block of logistic regression analyses, we examined demographics as independent variables, and MEC group membership as a dependent variable (Table III) . Positive Expressers were coded as 0, and All Expressers were coded as 1. As the total number of family members increased, so too did the likelihood of being an All Expresser. No other variables had a significant effect. In the second block, we submitted the potential predictor variables identified in KruskalWallis H tests to the logistic regression as independent variables, again examining MEC group membership as a dependent variable. Model fit and classification accuracy improved in this step. As food involvement increased, the likelihood of being an All Expresser decreased significantly. No other variables significantly predicted MEC group membership.\nAim 3: Examine Outcomes of MEC Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used to examine mean differences on child outcome variables based on MEC group membership. The Positive Expressers group had significantly higher healthy food consumption at W2, as compared with All Expressers (Table II) . There were no significant differences between groups on unhealthy food consumption or child BMI-P.\nFinally, ANCOVA was used to examine whether differences on W2 healthy food consumption between Positive and All Expressers persisted, controlling for covariates (Table IV) "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study expands the scientific literature on the link between emotions and food in the family context in several ways. First, this is the first study to characterize family MEC using a count-based coding scheme and proportion scores, and to examine longitudinal predictors and outcomes of family MEC. Using this novel method, we found that MEC was determined primarily by maternal, not child, emotions. Dyads were categorized as either Positive Expressers (expressing high levels of positive emotion, and little negative emotion) or All Expressers (about equal levels of positive and negative emotion). Second, we aimed to examine whether feeding practices or maternal mental health were predictors of family MEC, given the prior research finding associations between parent emotional expression, depression, feeding, and mealtime practices (Haycraft, Farrow, & Blissett, 2013; Hughes et al., 2011; McCurdy et al., 2014) . Food involvement feeding practices-but not maternal mental health or other feeding practices-predicted lower likelihood of being an All Expresser. Finally, this study examined whether family MEC predicted indicators of children's health, including food consumption and weight outcomes. Positive Expressers reported that their children ate significantly more healthy food at W2, as compared with All Expressers, but there were no differences between groups by weight outcomes. Although interpretations of these results must be tempered by acknowledging some methodological limitations, they point to several avenues for future research and practice. Overall, findings suggest that MEC should be investigated as a potential, modifiable family-level factor to target in efforts to increase child consumption of healthy foods.\nAlthough cluster analyses accounted for maternal and child emotional expression, MEC groups had significantly different emotion profiles for mothers-but not children. Previous studies have found that familychild and parent-child interpersonal dynamics were linked to reduced child overweight, but that child-sibling interpersonal dynamics had no effect (Berge et al., 2014) . Mothers' emotions may have a larger effect on MEC overall because they exert more control over and spend more time engaged in orchestrating family routines during early childhood (Kotila, SchoppeSullivan, & Dush, 2013) . Alternatively, children may have been more affected by the recording equipment during the mealtime than parents, tempering their negative emotional expression. It was surprising that a cluster of mothers and children with high negative emotion and low positive emotion did not emerge. Again, this may be because of social desirability biases, or the small and homogenous sample in the current study.\nWe also found that parent report of food involvement feeding practices-but no other feeding practices, and not maternal mental health-was related to decreased likelihood of being an All Expresser. In a longitudinal study of 10-12-year-old Australian children, child involvement in food preparation, shopping, planning, or cleanup was not related to family mealtime frequency, dietary intake, or weight outcomes (Leech, McNaughton, Crawford, Campbell, Pearson, & Timperio, 2014) . However, in a study among (n \u00bc 394) families with children aged between 18 months and 5 years, parent food involvement (or the importance, time, and value parents allocate to food) was associated with both child and parent fruit and vegetable consumption (Ohly et al., 2013) . The Food Involvement subscale of the CFPQ includes three questions, all centered on the child's involvement in food preparation, planning, and shopping (MusherEizenman & Holub, 2007) . It is surprising that our results are somewhat contrary to the findings from Leech and colleagues' (2014) study. However, involving younger children in food preparation and planning may present an opportunity for families to develop positive rapport around food and mealtimes. Indeed, a qualitative study with adult women found that negative affect was associated with lower food involvement for themselves (Jarman et al., 2012) . Together, these findings suggest that the MEC may be determined, in part, by the degree to which parents are involved with food themselves, and the degree to which they involve their children with food. However, future research is needed to ascertain (1) whether parent report of child food involvement is indicative of true food involvement; (2) whether these effects are true only in young children; and (3) whether modifying food involvement could improve the MEC, and, ultimately, child food consumption.\nIn contrast to the literature linking maternal depression to feeding and mealtime practices (Haycraft et al., 2013; McCurdy et al., 2014) , we did not find associations with MEC group membership. On the one hand, it is possible that the sample was too small to detect differences in maternal mental health. Indeed, this sample's range for stress and depressive symptoms at W2 is smaller than the range reported in a larger community sample of adults that completed the DASS (Crawford & Henry, 2003) . Furthermore, although maternal depressive symptoms may serve as an indicator for maternal depression, the DASS cannot be used to diagnose individuals with depression and may not be comparable with previous studies using diagnostic assessments (Henry & Crawford, 2005) . On the other hand, another study also found that parental depressive symptoms were not associated with mothers' report of family relationship quality or family expressiveness, but was associated with use of fewer controlling parenting practices (Foster et al., 2008) . Alternatively, it may be that family MEC is less associated with individual factors (such as maternal mental health), and more with factors related to the parentchild relationship (such as parenting and feeding practices), or the family system as a whole (such as food insecurity or household chaos; Fiese, Gundersen, Koester, & Jones, 2016) .\nFinally, we found that parents in the Positive Expressers group reported greater child consumption of healthy food at W2, than All Expressers. There were no differences for unhealthy food consumption or child BMI-P. Previous studies found that parents of overweight children engaged in more hostility and food-related lecturing, as compared with families with non-overweight children (Berge et al., 2014) . This may facilitate a counterproductive cycle, in which child overweight prompts hostility or food-related lecturing during mealtimes, which in turn may decrease healthy food consumption and eventually have an impact on weight (Francis, Hofer, & Birch, 2001; Webber, Cooke, Hill, & Wardle, 2010) . Alternatively, if parents foster a more positive MEC, they may increase healthy food consumption by making the mealtime a more pleasant environment. Although other cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have found associations between parent-child interaction quality and risk for obesity and excessive weight gain (Anderson & Keim, 2016) , this study found no association between family MEC and child weight outcomes. One possible explanation for this null finding is that the effects of MEC on weight as children age may be cumulative. For instance, although one study on families with children aged 6-12 years did find an association between the emotional atmosphere and risk for overweight (Berge et al., 2014) , a narrative review found evidence to suggest that parent-child interaction quality in early childhood or infancy was more strongly and consistently associated with obesity risk during middle childhood, than during early childhood (Anderson & Keim, 2016) . Links between parentchild interaction quality and weight outcomes were weak or nonsignificant for children under 5 years old, but associations seemed to increase in strength and consistency as children aged. Therefore, the effects of MEC on child weight may not be apparent until after the preschool years. Future research is needed to examine the longitudinal effects of MEC on child weight using observations across several time points.\nThe current study has several strengths, including use of direct, home-based observations, a count-based coding scheme, and a longitudinal design. However, some limitations bear noting. First, it is possible that family members altered their behavior in response to the observation, although some dyads clearly expressed more negative emotions during the mealtime than others, suggesting that-while some families may have changed their behaviors according to social desirability-many did not. Second, measures assessing feeding practices, parent mental health, and child eating behaviors used self-or parent-report questionnaires, rendering these constructs susceptible to bias. In particular, parent report of child food consumption has been noted previously to have low internal reliability, and because there are currently no validated observational assessments of food consumption for children in the home environment, these methodological limitations may provide fruitful avenues for future research. Finally, our findings are based on a relatively small, homogenous community sample of mostly White mothers and their children, and should be replicated in a larger, more diverse sample of families.\nAdditionally, although several male primary caregivers completed surveys, because we only coded maternal emotion during mealtimes, we cannot generalize our findings to fathers, and so focus our discussion on mothers."}, {"section_title": "Clinical and Research Implications", "text": "There are several implications from the findings of this study for practitioners and researchers. Results from this study will allow physicians and care providers to improve communication with parents about the health benefits of family mealtimes, by showing specific associations between family MEC and child food consumption. Given the challenging realities of mealtimes (e.g., food insecurity; picky eating) for many families (Malhotra, Herman, Wright, Bruton, Fisher, & Whitaker, 2013) , it would be unreasonable to simply suggest that parents should express more positive emotion at meals. Instead, practitioners may find it helpful to provide parents with information about several evidence-based strategies that may reduce parent stress and negative affect during mealtimes, and indirectly improve child food consumption. For example, increasing food involvement, practicing child behavior management (Janicke et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2011) , establishing routines and schedules (Jones, Fiese, & STRONG Kids Team, 2014) , eliminating distractions (FitzPatrick, Edmunds, & Dennison, 2007) , and engaging in direct, clear communication during mealtimes may all promote a more positive MEC (Fiese et al., 2006) . Providers may be able to communicate more clearly about the benefits of family meals, by increasing awareness about the link between family MEC and child food consumption.\nThis study identified also several avenues for future research. First, these findings should be replicated among a sample with more fathers, and in a larger and more diverse population, using multiple observations of family mealtimes in a longitudinal design. Second, studies using other measures of child food consumption (24-hr recalls, dietary intake diaries, and repeated food frequency questionnaires) are needed to validate links between family MEC and child food consumption. Third, investigators should examine how other family members or family factors (e.g., routines; distractions; communication) contribute to MEC, and ultimately, child health and well-being. Fourth, by using a coding and analytic approach that emphasizes behaviors on a moment-to-moment basis, researchers may be able to better understand the antecedents and consequences of positive and negative affect at the mealtime, thus deepening our understanding of the contributors to MEC. Finally, these preliminary findings suggest that more positive parent emotionality at meals may promote children's healthy food consumption. Parenting interventions targeting emotion socialization have been remarkably successful at improving both parent and child emotional awareness and regulation (Havighurst, Wilson, Harley, Prior, & Kehoe, 2010; Wilson, Havighurst, & Harley, 2012) . Therefore, researchers should consider assessing whether parent emotion socialization training could impact family MEC and subsequent child food consumption.\nTo conclude, MEC is coconstructed by mothers and children (with more influence from mothers), and may impact child healthy food consumption. Children who experience more positive mealtime interactions may eat a greater amount of healthy food than children who experience mealtimes with about equal amounts of positive and negative emotion. These novel findings open up additional avenues of research, and suggest that further research on mealtime quality, associations between emotional expression and child food consumption, and emotion socialization training for parents may be needed. By helping parents engage in more positive mealtime interactions with their young children, practitioners and researchers may be able to increase children's healthy food consumption."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": ""}]
