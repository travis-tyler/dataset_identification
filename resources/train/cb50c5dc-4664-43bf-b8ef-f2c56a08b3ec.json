[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] Since the late 1970s the mean temperature of the Earth's lower atmosphere has increased steadily, as has consensus within the scientific community that this behavior is largely attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [Hegerl et al., 2007] . The spatial patterns of temperature changes underlying global warming during this period have been highly nonuniform [e.g., Trenberth et al., 2007] , a result of both changes in atmosphere/ocean circulation related to the warming and the presence of natural modes of atmospheric variability whose amplitudes over interdecadal timescales are comparable to the anthropogenic signal. Along the west coast of South America (continental Chile), available records show temperature trends that are negligible or even negative at several sites, at odds with the mean global trend of around +0.33\u00b0C/ decade [Trenberth et al., 2007] . Many of Chile's water resources (especially its glaciers and snowfields) and industries (e.g., agriculture, fisheries, tourism) are significantly affected by temperature variability. Understanding the magnitude and spatial structure of recent temperature change, and reconciling these against expectations based on global warming, is therefore an important task. The intention of this article is to provide a comprehensive characterization of contemporary temperature trends in Chile (1979 Chile ( -2006 , focusing particularly on their spatial patterns and vertical structure. To accomplish this we use a diverse collection of temperature data sets and draw insight from the results of general circulation model (GCM) simulations.\n[3] A number of geographical and observational constraints make the characterization and interpretation of recent climate change in Chile a challenging but potentially rewarding task. The meridional extent of the country ($4000 km) ensures that it crosses several climatic regimes, from the hyperarid northern desert to the temperate, rainy south. In contrast, its zonal extent (150-250 km) is considerably less than the grid spacing of most observational analyses and global models and over these distances the surface topography may rise from sea level to over 6000 m. Long-term temperature records are scarce and not distributed optimally for separation of zonal, meridional, and vertical patterns. Chile's setting along the coast of a large continental landmass means that both oceanic and continental variability may modulate local climate. Several large-scale modes of natural variability, most importantly the El Ni\u00f1 o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the southern annular mode (SAM), are known to strongly influence temperatures over interannual to interdecadal timescales [e.g., Aceituno, 1988; Gillett et al., 2006; Garreaud et al., 2008] .\n[4] Among the literature describing recent temperature variability in Chile, the work of Rosenbl\u00fcth et al. [1997] is a standard reference. They examined annual temperature records for the period 1960 -1992 and found significant warming (+0.14 to +0.38\u00b0C/decade) at several stations, the majority of which were located in the northern part of the country. They noted that most of the changes were due to increases in daily minimum temperatures, as was also observed by Vincent et al. [2005] and Villarroel et al. [2006] in indices of extreme temperatures for the period 1960 -2000 and by Rusticucci and Barrucand [2004] over the adjacent Argentinean mainland (1958-98) . Other studies have documented the vertical structure of temperature change [e.g., Vuille and Bradley, 2000; Bown and Rivera, 2007; Boisier and Aceituno, 2006] , finding that high-altitude temperature trends may differ significantly from those at the surface. Many of the trends presented in the studies mentioned above are influenced by the widely documented climate regime change of 1976 -1977 [e.g., Trenberth and Stepaniak, 2001 Giese et al., 2002] that has been associated with significant shifts in mean temperature at many locations around the Pacific basin. Boisier and Aceituno [2006] examined temperature variability at several coastal sites in northern Chile. They noted that almost all of the warming in the period 1960-2000 actually occurred over a few years between 1975 and 1977 and that since this time trends have been weakly negative at all stations they considered. Marked temperature shifts in the middle to late 1970s are also evident at stations in central and southern Chile [e.g., Rosenbl\u00fcth et al., 1997; Bown and Rivera, 2007] .\n[5] This study focuses on the contemporary period from 1979 until 2006, after the climate shift of the mid-1970s and encompassing the satellite era during which the atmosphere and ocean have been sampled continuously with space based radiometers. A similar time period was chosen for the characterization of recent global temperature trends in the 2007 IPCC summary report, for essentially the same reasons [Trenberth et al., 2007] . We make use of temperature data sets (both in situ observations and gridded analyses) that sample the land and sea surface, the upper atmosphere, and the ocean. These, along with a brief description of Chile's geoclimatic setting and the methodologies to be employed, are described in section 2. The core results of the paper are then presented in section 3, where we attempt to rationalize spatial variability in observed temperature trends. We examine patterns of change in the horizontal (i.e., meridional and zonal) and in the vertical and look for consistency among the different sources of temperature data. In section 4 we use GCM output to address whether the observed temperature trends are consistent with the predicted global warming response. In section 5 we summarize our key results and discuss their significance in the context of interannual variability within the Pacific Basin.\n2. Study Area, Methodology, and Data"}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "[6] Because observational data is very sparse in the extreme south of Chile, our focus region (see Figure 3b ) extends southward only as far as central Patagonia (i.e., from 17.5\u00b0S to 47.5\u00b0S). For the purposes of discussion, we divide the study area into three segments, each 10\u00b0wide, named northern (17.5\u00b0S-27.5\u00b0S), central (27.5\u00b0S-37.5\u00b0S), and southern (37.5\u00b0S-47.5\u00b0S). The climate of each of these regions may be loosely described as arid, Mediterranean, and rainy, respectively. The eastern border of Chile follows the ridge of the Andes mountain chain, whose height varies from over 5000 m in the north to under 2000 m in the south. In central Chile a coastal mountain range, about 1000-1500 m high, runs north -south about 50 km inland. The region between this and the Andes is referred to as the ''central valley.''"}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "[7] The main variable that this article will deal with is the linear trend of annual mean temperature over the 28 year period from 1979 to 2006, calculated using standard least squares regression. As a general rule, all tendencies presented in this article are required to be based on at least 20, nearly complete (>85%), years of data. Mean trends are occasionally calculated for groups of stations and in these cases the trends are derived from a single series of station averaged annual mean temperatures.\n[8] Statistical significance is presented as a 90% confidence interval, based on a 1000 member synthetic null distribution derived by randomly reordering the annual series. The confidence limits do not take into account possible systematic errors in observational data or autocorrelation in the series. We emphasize that the word ''significant'' should be interpreted in a purely statistical sense, i.e., that a random series of data with the same variability would be 90% likely to have a smaller absolute trend and does not necessarily mean that the trend is representative of a physically significant process (such as one related to global warming, for example)."}, {"section_title": "Observational Data Sets", "text": "[9] The key characteristics of the in situ and gridded data sets to be used are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. All data sets begin at or before 1979, but not all extend until 2006. Detailed description of the processing methodologies, uncertainties, and caveats associated with each of these data sets is beyond the scope of this article. What follows is a brief discussion of what we deem to be the most important issues, and further information may be obtained in the references provided in Tables 1 and 2 . 2.3.1. In Situ Data\n[10] Our principal data set is derived from recently digitized long-term records of daily maximum and minimum temperature at 20 sites maintained by the national weather service (Direccion Meteorol\u00f3gica de Chile (DMC)). Daily mean temperatures were estimated by taking the average of the daily maximum and minimum. The DMC stations provide a reasonable sampling of Chile in the meridional direction, but sampling in the zonal direction is somewhat inadequate (e.g., Figure 3b ). In northern Chile the sites are mostly coastal, while in central Chile they are generally situated inland at several hundred meters above sea level. In southern Chile most sites are low-lying, and three (Balmaceda, Cochrane, and Chile Chico) are in the lee of the Andes. Sites at high altitudes in the Andes are rare. In the DMC network there is only Calama, in northern Chile, at 2300 m above sea level. To go some way toward improving data coverage, temperature records (available from the early 1970s) were also acquired for two privately operated sites in the Andes of central Chile: Lagunitas (2600 m) and El Yeso (2400 m). Monthly surface temperature measurements from the global historical climatology network (GHCN) provide further long-term data at several stations on the eastern side of the Andes. A network of tide gauges maintained by the Chilean Oceanographic and Hydrographic Service (SHOA) provide long-term records of sea surface temperature (SST) along the coast of central and northern Chile (Figure 3b ).\n[11] Coastal upper air data are available from three rawinsonde stations (also operated by the DMC) near the central parts of northern (Antofagasta, 23.5\u00b0S), central (Quintero, 33\u00b0S), and southern (Puerto Montt, 42\u00b0S) Chile, where soundings are made regularly at 1200 UTC (0800 local time). The temperature data are recorded on standard pressure levels and on variable significant levels, chosen so as to provide an adequate representation of the vertical temperature structure. The data were hydrostatically interpolated onto a 100 m spaced height grid.\n[12] All in situ data sets have missing observations and different strategies were adopted to mitigate their effect on trend estimations. In the case of the daily surface temperature data sets, gaps of 3 days or less were filled by linearly interpolating between surrounding data points. Longer gaps, and missing months from the monthly data, were filled with climatological values calculated for the period 1979 -2006. Missing upper air data were replaced with 1200 UTC temperatures interpolated from NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis [Kalnay et al., 1996] . Overall, the trends calculated with these data replacement strategies were not significantly different to the trends calculated by simply ignoring missing data."}, {"section_title": "Gridded Analyses", "text": "[13] Our study employs global gridded analyses of surface air temperature from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the extended-reconstructed (ERSST) and Hadley Center (HadISST) sea surface temperature analyses. Upper-air temperatures were obtained from the microwave sounding units (MSU) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites. Available since 1978, these measurements provide estimates of bulk temperatures in several atmospheric layers. Here we use midtroposphere (channel 2) data, which may be interpreted as the mean temperature within a broad region of the midtroposphere, with maximum weighting between 4 and 7 km above the surface [Mears et al., 2003] . Although the MSU data set has been a source of some controversy in the The specific temperature variables vary among the data sets. They include the instantaneous temperature (T), the daily maximum (T max ) and minimum (T min ), the time averaged (daily or monthly) temperature (T mean ) and sea surface temperature (SST).

Owing to difficulties in modeling of the diurnal range of high-altitude surface emissions, we consider the MSU data to be unreliable where the surface topography is higher than 1000 m, including the Andes of central and northern Chile.\n[14] Analyses of subsurface ocean temperature were obtained from the ocean heat content database of Levitus et al. [2005] , a gridded analysis of temperature anomalies at several depths from the surface to 3000 m, based on hydrographic observations from the World Ocean Database (WOD) [de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al., 2004] . Global and hemispherical ocean heating estimates have been successfully derived from this data set [Levitus et al., 2005; Gille, 2008] , but regional estimates of long-term temperature variability must be treated with caution as data availability is poor in many areas. A recent study [Gouretski and Koltermann, 2007] has shown that the Levitus data set may suffer from a bias toward cooling trends due to the introduction of erroneous expendable bathythermograph (XBT) data. In this study, the WOD data is used to estimate annual ocean temperature trends in rectangular sections 5\u00b0E -W and 10\u00b0N-S off the coast of northern, central, and southern Chile. Uncertainty due to uneven data sampling is a major issue. During some years only a few observations were available, and in others, several hundred. We compared the series of annual mean temperature variability at the surface level with SST series derived from the ERSST and HadISST data sets and found significant correlations (r = +0.6) and similar trends (see section 3). This gives us some confidence that the WOD data may provide a useful description of ocean temperature variability along the Chilean coast."}, {"section_title": "Climate Model Ensemble", "text": "[15] General circulation model (GCM) data were obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multimodel data set, produced for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). At the time this study was carried out, the CMIP3 database contained surface air temperature and SST output from 21 coupled ocean-atmosphere models for several GHG emissions scenarios. Outputs from two climate simulation experiments are considered: The 20C3m (Climate of the 20th Century) simulations span the period 1900 -2000 and are forced by the observed history of GHG (anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic) and solar activity. The SRESA2 simulations extend from 2000 to 2100 under the hypothetical A2 emissions scenario [Nakicenovic et al., 2000] . The SRESA2 scenario serves to most clearly identify anthropogenic climate trends as the greenhouse gas forcing is stronger than the 20C3m or any of the other 21st century scenarios with the exception of the A1F1 scenario (for which less data is available). Many models provide multiple realizations (runs) of the climate scenarios. Before calculating multimodel statistics (such as mean trends) the data from individual runs are first averaged for each model in order to prevent the statistics from being unduly weighted toward those models that provide a large number of runs."}, {"section_title": "Temperature Tendencies", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Global Context", "text": "[16] In order to provide a large-scale context for our description of recent temperature trends in Chile, we first consider the global patterns of surface and midlevel temperature change using the gridded NCDC/ERSST/HadISST and MSU data sets (Figure 1 ). During the period 1979-2006 surface warming ( Figure 1a ) has been near ubiquitous over continental areas. Over the oceans, the ERSST product ( Figure 1a ) shows significant positive SST trends in the North Atlantic, most of the Indian Ocean, and the tropical and subtropical western Pacific, while weak cooling trends are observed over much of the eastern equatorial Pacific. Cooling also prevails over the Southern Ocean in a nearcircumpolar pattern interrupted by a region of strong warming over and to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula. The SST trends from the alternative HadISST product (Figure 1b) shows a similar large-scale pattern, although there are often substantial regional-scale differences between the ERSST and HadISST products. In the midtroposphere (Figure 1c) , the MSU data show a more homogenous pattern of heating and cooling, with much less contrast between continental and oceanic regions. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), significant warming trends in the tropics and subtropics give way to significant cooling trends at higher latitudes, with the inflexion point at around 40\u00b0S on zonal average.\n[17] The patterns of warming and cooling over the tropical and subtropical Pacific bear a marked resemblance to the canonical spatial structures associated with Pacific decadal variability (PDV) of SST [e.g., Mantua et al., 1997; Montecinos and Pizarro, 2005; Burgman et al., 2008] . The spatial fingerprint of the SST anomalies related to PDV are similar to the El Ni\u00f1o patterns for interannual variability, although they are strongest at subtropical (rather than tropical) latitudes [e.g., Zhang et al., 1997; Power et al., 1999; Garreaud and Battisti, 1999; Burgman et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2008] . From 1979 to 2006 most measures of interdecadal variability in the Pacific exhibit a decreasing trend [Trenberth et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008] . Consistently, the SST trend pattern over this period shows a distinctly La Ni\u00f1a-like structure.\n[18] We focus now on southern South America, where Chile sits squarely along the interface between a cooling ocean and warming continent (Figure 1a) . The contrast is strongest in central and northern parts of the country, where the SST cooling is around \u00c00.2\u00b0C/decade near the coast, while the continent immediately to the west has been warming by roughly the same amount. The offshore cooling extends along most of the west coast of South America and forms part of a crescent shaped pattern that connects the circumpolar cooling in the Southern Ocean with the cooling region in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This structure is also evident in the HadISST data (Figure 1b) , although the southern branch of the cooling pattern is less well defined."}, {"section_title": "Horizontal Structure", "text": "[19] The coarse resolution of the gridded data sets in Figure 1 prevents any clear identification of regional vari- The surface temperatures are taken from the NCDC data set at 5\u00b0spacing, replaced over ocean areas by the higher resolution ERSST (2\u00b0spacing) ( Figure 1a ) and HadISST (1\u00b0spacing) (Figure 1b ) data sets. Note that over coastal grid points the NCDC data may include a combination of ocean-and landbased observations. The midtroposphere data are derived from the 2\u00b0spaced MSU data set. MSU trends are not calculated for grid cells where the mean topography is higher than 2000 m. The color scale of the plot is chosen to emphasize the spatial structure of the trends in the vicinity of Chile and is deliberately saturated in some parts of the world (such as the Northern Hemisphere continents, for example). Dark crosses indicate grid points where trends are estimated to be 90% significant. Purple crosses indicate grid points that were covered by sea ice during at least 1 month of the period considered. Figure 2d ). However, less than 150 km inland in the central valley ( Figure 2c ) the sign of the trend has reversed and is significantly positive (+0.18 \u00b1 0.14\u00b0C/decade). The warming is even stronger in the western Andes (+0.28 \u00b1 0.34\u00b0C/ decade), although strictly speaking this value is not quite significant due to high interannual variability (partly due to data quality issues). A similar positive trend (+0.23 \u00b1 0.24\u00b0C/decade) is observed on the eastern side of the Andes in the continental interior.\n[20] In Figure 3a temperature trends from all stations in the study area are plotted as a function of latitude. The Chilean surface stations are separated into two groups: lowlying (usually coastal) stations below 150 m altitude and elevated (always inland) stations at higher altitudes. Coastal SST trends derived from the SHOA stations and the two gridded SST products (ERSST and HadISST) are also included. Owing to the short time period considered and high interannual temperature variability (especially in northern Chile where ENSO is most influential) the uncertainty ranges of most trend estimates are large. Nonetheless, in central and northern Chile there is a good correspondence among the different sources of coastal data, which generally indicate cooling rates between \u00c00.1 and \u00c00.3\u00b0C/decade. Weakly positive trends are indicated by the HADISST data between 25\u00b0and 20\u00b0S, but these do not agree with either the in situ data or the ERSST product at these latitudes. The strong contrast between coastal cooling and inland warming is seen to extend into northern Chile, where inland sites register positive trends of +0.2 to +0.25\u00b0C/decade. In northern Chile most of the inland sites are on the eastern side of the Andes. However, the significant warming of +0.25 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C/decade at Calama provides a key fragment of evidence that the warming observed in the western Andes of central Chile may extend northward at least as far as this station (23\u00b0S). Vuille and Bradley [2000] noted significant positive trends on the western side of the tropical Andes (22\u00b0S -0\u00b0S; 1959 -1998) , suggesting that the warming pattern may in fact encompass the length of the western side of the subtropical and tropical Andes. However, the applicability of this result may be questionable as it includes the 1976 -1977 climate shift and may not be representative of the period examined in this study.\n[21] In southern Chile most temperature trends are close to zero at coastal and inland sites alike, and no obvious meridional structure is evident. There are no high-altitude stations (>2000 m) comparable to those in central and northern Chile (partly because the height of the Andes decreases rapidly at latitudes higher than about 35\u00b0S), and the southward extent of the Andean warming cannot be determined. The station distribution in southern Chile is not ideal for determining east-to-west patterns in the temperature trends. Although there are no in situ observations, both of the gridded data sets indicate that the SST cooling is present in southern Chile, although somewhat weaker than in the north."}, {"section_title": "Vertical Structure", "text": "[22] Owing to the rapid change in topographic elevation from the coast to the Andes, the strong contrast between ocean cooling and warming inland is interpretable as a change in temperature trends with altitude. Figures 4a -4c provide another visualization of the temperature trends, this time as a function of elevation. All observational data sets are incorporated, including the radiosonde profiles and ocean temperature analysis. This assemblage of data allows temperature tendencies from multiple data sources to be plotted from 700 m below to 10 km above sea level.\n[23] The radiosonde data show a transition in the midtroposphere from warming in the north (Antofagasta) to cooling in the south (Puerto Montt). The cooling at Puerto Montt is weak (\u00c00.1\u00b0C/decade) and roughly uniform from the surface to 10 km. In the central and northern sectors (Quintero and Antofagasta) the trends exhibit significant, and similar, vertical structure. Both show cooling near the surface, consistent with coastal surface temperature and SST measurements. At Quintero the strongest cooling occurs at the surface level, while at Antofagasta the maximum cooling trend (\u00c00.43\u00b0C/decade) is at 600 m. Above these levels the trends increase rapidly, switching over from cooling to warming at heights of 500 m (Quintero) and 1000 m (Antofagasta), and peaking at about 1300 m at both locations, where warming rates are +0.35 and +0.5\u00b0C/ decade, respectively. Above, the warming trends slowly decrease, but remain positive throughout the column at Antofagasta. At Quintero, temperature tendencies actually become weakly (but not significantly) negative between 4000 and 7000 m.\n[24] The lower troposphere along the north-central coast of Chile features a cool, moist marine boundary layer (MBL), often topped by stratocumulus (Sc), and capped by a temperature inversion maintained by subsidence. In Antofagasta (Quintero) the MBL is about 800 m (300 m) deep and present about 90% (50%) of the time [Boisier and Aceituno, 2006] . The differential temperature trends near the surface and further aloft observed in Quintero and Antofagasta have important implications for the MBLinversion structure. In both locations, the cooling encompasses the whole MBL and the inversion base while the warming is greatest near the inversion top, thus increasing the inversion strength and the lower tropospheric stability (LTS). In a climatological context an increase of LTS has [25] The trends obtained by the radiosonde data fit well with those derived from surface observations, implying that the variation between the coast and the Andes is largely representative of the vertical structure of trends in the free atmosphere. For example, the warming above the MBL at Antofagasta is near identical to that registered at the same altitude at Calama, some 150 km inland. The same is true in central Chile, where the warming trends at the inland stations (e.g., El Yeso, Lagunitas, Santiago, Chillan) are comparable to the positive trends exhibited by the radiosonde data within the same altitude range. Furthermore, the transition in the midtroposphere from warming in the north to cooling in the south (Puerto Montt) is broadly consistent with the large-scale zonal pattern suggested by the MSU data (Figure 1b) . The consistency between the different data sets is noteworthy given that several past studies have shown that the climatological characteristics (including trends) of surface temperatures at elevated sites in other parts of the world often differ significantly from those at the same altitude in the surrounding free-troposphere [e.g., Seidel and Free, 2003; Pepin and Seidel, 2005] .\n[26] The vertical profiles of Figure 4 include below the sea surface (OHC) temperature tendencies averaged over the regions defined in Figure 3b . For reference, the SST cooling from the ERSST data set averaged over the same regions is also plotted. At the surface, the trends are consistent with the SST data. In each of the three areas the cooling trends extend downward to depths of 250 m in the south, and 500 m in the central and northern zones, well below the mixing layer depth of $50 m [de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut Owing to the very large systematic uncertainties and sampling problems associated with the OHC analyses we do not wish to draw too much attention to these results, but it is nonetheless of interest to note that the coastal cooling may not be restricted to the near surface, but might instead extend to deeper waters below the mixed layer."}, {"section_title": "Extreme Temperatures and Seasonal Means", "text": "[27] So far we have concentrated on the spatial patterns of daily mean temperature trends. However, several past studies [e.g., Rusticucci and Barrucand, 2004; Vincent et al., 2005; Villarroel et al., 2006] have noted that trends in daily maximum (T max ) and minimum (T min ) temperatures may be significantly different. In Figure 3a the trends in T max and T min are presented at sites where daily extreme data are available. In general, the trends in temperature extremes fall within the 90% confidence intervals of those for the daily mean. In the north, most coastal stations show stronger negative trends for T max . At Arica (the northernmost station considered), the T max and T min trends are of opposite sign and fall outside the 90% confidence interval (the only station where this occurs). The differences between the trends of T max (more strongly decreasing) and T min (less strongly decreasing) suggests that the trends at coastal sites are strongly modulated by the cooling of the nearby ocean, since the low-level atmospheric flow in central and northern Chile is usually onshore during the day (bringing oceanic air to the station), and weakly offshore at night [Rutllant and Ulriksen, 1979] cally at many stations in northern Chile (see also Villarroel et al. [2006] ). The high-altitude site Calama shows no notable difference in the trend for T max and T min , and neither do the inland stations in central Chile. In the south the trends in T max and T min are often quite different, and sometimes of opposing sign, but no clear meridional pattern can be identified.\n[28] When separated into seasons the spatial patterns of temperature trends (not shown) remain qualitatively similar to those presented in Figures 3 -4 , and seasonal trends are rarely outside of the 90% confidence range of the annual mean data. Both the coastal SST and the majority of surface stations show slightly stronger cooling during the summer semester, from December to May. The semicircular cooling pattern in the SST off the Chilean coast is also most pronounced during summertime and is clearly situated around the eastern edge of the South Pacific Anticyclone (this is discussed further in section 4). In winter, the SST cooling in the southeast Pacific is weaker, has less spatial structure, and shows no clear relationship to the mean lowlevel circulation pattern."}, {"section_title": "Insight From Global Circulation Models", "text": "[29] In this section we make use of the (CMIP-3) multimodel GCM ensembles to examine to what extent the observed regional temperature variability can be interpreted as a consequence of greenhouse gas forcing. Model results from the last 28 years of the 20C3m experiment (1972 -2000) are taken to be representative of the observational period examined for this study. An assumption in our analysis is that climate change patterns common to the majority of the models should represent a response to external forcing, since other modes of internal variability (if any) should cancel out after calculating the ensemble average [e.g., Cai and Cowan, 2006] . Because the 20C3m scenario includes emissions from both natural and anthropogenic sources, along with observed solar activity, trends in these simulations cannot be uniquely attributed to anthropogenic forcing.\n[30] The mean temperature trends simulated by the CMIP-3 ensemble are shown in Figure 5 for the near surface ( Figure 5a ) and midtroposphere (Figure 5c ). These plots are roughly analogous to the NCDC/ERSST and MSU trends plotted in Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c , respectively. The warming pattern is quite homogeneous over most of the globe. At the surface spatial variability is mostly determined by the well known contrast between oceanic and continental trends [i.e., Trenberth et al., 2007] . In the SH, weaker warming at both the surface and upper levels is simulated at middle and high latitudes (Figures 5b and 5d) , and the zonal mean trend is effectively negligible south of 60\u00b0S. The slower warming rate over the Southern Ocean is expected due to the strong mixing and upwelling beneath the Antarctic circumpolar current [e.g., Russell et al., 2006] and although the ensemble mean does not reproduce the cooling that is actually observed (except for a small region south of New Zealand), several of the underlying models do indicate significant negative trends (Figure 5d ). This has lead several authors to suggest that the high-latitude cooling in the Southern Hemisphere (often associated with a well documented increasing trend in the SH annular mode) is ultimately a consequence of a combination of ozone depletion in the polar stratosphere and increasing tropospheric GHG concentrations (e.g., Gillett and Thompson [2003] , Cai et al. [2005] , and Miller et al. [2006] , among others).\n[31] Over the Pacific Ocean, the La Ni\u00f1a-like patterns, including the tongue of cooling along Chile's coast, are largely absent in the model ensemble mean. It has been suggested [e.g., Cane et al., 1997; Cook et al., 2007] that a tendency toward a more La Ni\u00f1a-like state should result from global warming in accord with the Bjerknes feedback mechanism [Bjerknes, 1969; Clement et al., 1996] . However, other researchers have suggested that more El Ni\u00f1o like conditions might be expected due to a weakening of the tropical circulation [e.g., Held and Soden, 2006; Vecchi et al., 2006] . The response of the tropical Pacific to global warming thus remains very much an open question [Vecchi et al., 2008] . The results from the CMIP-3 ensemble, which show no clear La Ni\u00f1a-or El Ni\u00f1o-like tendency, provide little support for either idea [see also Collins and the CMIP Modelling Groups, 2005] . Along the Chilean coast, the GCM ensemble mean trend is positive over both land and sea, although, as at other land-sea interfaces, the warming rates are considerably higher over the continental areas. Figure 6 plots the coastal temperature against the inland temperature of central Chile (approx 30\u00b0S) predicted by each GCM. Although there is considerable scatter among the different predictions, all but four of the simulated temperature trends fall within the positive quadrant of the graph, indicating simultaneous warming in both regions. The ensemble average tendency in the Andes of +0.26\u00b0C/ decade compares very well with the observed value of (roughly) +0.25\u00b0C/decade. However, none of the models show an ocean cooling trend near to that observed, and across the models there is a strong positive correlation between trends over the ocean and Andes. Thus the few models that do show negative temperature trends over the ocean are also those that show the lowest trends in the Andes.\n[32] Although it is clear that none of the models are able to reproduce the opposite temperature trends between coast and continent, it is notable that they do predict less warming off the coast of Chile than over the rest of the tropical and subtropical oceans. Indeed, warming rates off the Chilean coast are weaker than in any other part of the world except for the Southern Ocean. When comparing spatial patterns of temperature change it is useful to express the SST trends as anomalies with respect to the global mean trend. In Figure 7 we compare the anomalous trends in the South Pacific derived from observations (ERSST) (Figure 7a ) and the CMIP-3 GCM ensemble (Figure 7b ). Because extratropical SST variability is known to be strongly related to the lowlevel atmospheric circulation over all timescales [e.g., Kushnir et al., 2002] , the observed (NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis) and GCM ensemble mean sea level pressure (SLP) trends are also included in Figure 7 .\n[33] To the west of the coast of Chile the GCMs (Figure 7b ) show a robust region of negative SST trend anomalies (about \u00c00.07\u00b0C/decade below the global mean) that bears a tangible resemblance to the observed crescent shaped cooling pattern (Figure 7a ), albeit with a considerably smaller amplitude and no tropical signal. In both cases, the regions of relative cooling curl around the eastern side of positive D04102 FALVEY AND GARREAUD: TEMPERATURE TRENDS IN SE PACIFIC/ANDES pressure trend anomalies. In the observations, the SLP trends are roughly colocated with the mean location of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPAC) (identifiable in Figure 7a as the 1020 hPa contour), indicating that the SPAC has been gradually spinning up since 1979 [Roemmich et al., 2007; Marshall, 2003] . In the 20C3m GCM ensemble the maximum subtropical SLP trend is shifted much further to the west (45\u00b0S, 160\u00b0W). Nonetheless, the overall SST-SLP association is qualitatively similar, with weak relative cooling (i.e., reduced warming) around the eastern side of the SLP anomaly and enhanced warming on the western side. A similar pattern is obtained when considering the net SLP and SST changes predicted for the next century under the SRESA2 emissions scenario (Figure 7c) , in which the impacts of GHG concentrations are more readily detectable. In the A2 scenario the positive pressure anomaly in the south Pacific is wider and centered at 130\u00b0W. Once again, weak but significant temperature trend anomalies are seen on the eastern side of this feature.\n[34] Although natural forcing may play some role in the trend patterns from the 20C3m scenario, the overall picture presented by Figures 7b and 7c is that at least some (i.e., 20-30%) of the SST cooling along the Chilean seaboard may be interpreted as a regional response to increased GHG concentrations and is likely governed by the southward expansion and intensification of the subtropical atmospheric gyres. The physical explanation of the apparent SLP-SST relationship is likely to reside in the enhancement of meridional winds along the coast, which in turn provoke offshore transport and coastal upwelling [e.g., Garreaud and Falvey, 2009] . As upwelling currents originate well below the surface [Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994; Hormazabal et al., 2004] , an enhancement of upwelling may help explain how the negative temperature trends can extend below the mixing layer. The intensification of the SPAC is also likely to Figure 5 . Ensemble mean (a) surface and (c) midtroposphere temperature trends from the CMIP-3 multimodel data set for the last 3 decades of the 20th century (1972 -2000) . Model data were interpolated onto a common 2.5\u00b0spaced grid before calculating trends. The midtroposphere temperature is defined as the mean temperature between 700 hPa and 300 hPa, roughly analogous to the atmospheric layer sampled by the MSU instrument (Figure 1b stimulate other cooling processes such as cold advection (atmospheric and oceanic), enhanced surface heat fluxes, and mixing in the upper ocean [e.g., Kushnir et al., 2002; Sen Gupta and England, 2006] . More detailed heat budget calculations [e.g., Huang and Liu, 2001] will be required in order to better identify the relative importance of such processes and their relationships to the predicted circulation changes. Figure 6 . Scatterplot of temperature trends in central Chile ($30\u00b0S) for the simulated period 1970 -1999 (inclusive) from the CMIP-3 GCM ensemble. The horizontal axis is the SST trend at the model grid point closest to the model coastline. The vertical axis is the temperature trend above land at the highest model grid point in the Andes. The Andes are poorly resolved by all the global models and the mean model height over the land point is 1886 m (varying between about 1000 m and 3000 m for the highest and lowest resolution models, respectively), whereas the Andes actually reach well over 5000 m at this latitude. The representation of the Andes is also much wider in the global models. The mean distance between the land and sea point is 6.6\u00b0($700 km, and over 1000 m in some cases), when in reality it is closer to 200 km. Error bars represent the 90% confidence interval for the trends. For reference, the approximate observed value is also shown (red dot), derived qualitatively from the trends shown for the ocean and western Andes in Figure 3 . from CMIP-3 models SST and SLP difference minus from CMIP-3 models\n[35] It must be stressed that there is considerable uncertainty in the observed trends over the eastern Pacific, especially for the SLP. Over the entire South Pacific east of 120\u00b0W, there are only two long-term pressure records available (Easter and Juan Fernandez Islands, Figure 7a ) and none at latitudes higher than 35\u00b0. In Figure 8 the annual SLP series (taken from the GHCN) at these two island stations are presented. After a sharp drop associated with the 1976 climate shift, the SLP at Easter Island (slightly northwest of the SPAC center) has risen by about 100 Pa/ decade, twice the Reanalysis estimate at the same location. At Juan Fernandez the SLP shows no significant trend since 1983, the start of the data series (the station was moved in 1982). Thus, while the scarcity of data is clearly a major issue, both the gridded analysis and in situ records do point to a significant intensification of the SPAC, which climate models suggest may be partially related to global warming."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "[36] In this study we have provided a comprehensive description of the spatial patterns of contemporary temperature trends in Chile and over the adjacent ocean for the period 1979-2006, making use of long-term records from in situ and gridded data sets. Our key observational results may be summarized as follows:\n[37] 1. In central and northern Chile (17\u00b0-37\u00b0S) in situ temperature observations confirm the strong contrast between cooling off the coast (\u00c00.20\u00b0C/decade) and warming in the central valley and western Andes (+0.25\u00b0C/decade), only 100 -200 km further inland (and 500-2500 m higher). The warming rate in the western Andes is similar to that observed on the eastern (continental) side of the mountain range. In southern Chile (38\u00b0S-48\u00b0S) temperature trends over land are weak (insignificant at 90% confidence) and show no clearly identifiable spatial patterns.\n[38] 2. Coastal radiosonde data (Quintero and Valparaiso) show substantial vertical structure in temperature trends, characterized by cooling near the surface and a warming maximum aloft at about 1300 m, about the same height as the top of the inversion layer. The vertical profiles compare well with land based observations at the same altitudes, thus implying that the variation between the coast and the Andes is largely a manifestation of a strong vertical stratification of trends in the atmosphere to the west of the Andes.\n[39] 3. Gridded SST data (ERSST) indicate that the coastal cooling trends extend along the length of Chile's coastline. Consistent evidence of the coastal cooling is found in surface air temperature measurements, tide gauge measurements, and an alternative (HadISST) gridded product, although the HadISST trends deviate from the other data sets north of about 30\u00b0S. The coastal SST cooling forms part of a larger-scale, La Ni\u00f1a-like pattern that extends from the Southern Ocean to the equatorial Pacific, and this pattern is broadly consistent with the general negative trend in Pacific decadal variability (e.g., PDO) that has been observed over the same period.\n[40] 4. Data from the World Ocean Database indicate that the cooling near the coast may extend below the mixed layer, to depths of at least 500 m. However, this conclusion must be treated with some caution as there is considerable uncertainty associated with the WOD trend estimates.\n[41] When considering the above conclusions, it is important to bear in mind the substantial uncertainty in the trend estimates on which they are based. Owing to the relatively short time period that was examined, and the high level of interannual temperature variability, only a few of the estimated trends are nonnegligible with 90% confidence. The uncertainty range is particularly wide in northern Chile, where ENSO related interannual variability is strong. Despite these concerns, the overall consistency among different stations and measurement types suggests that the broad spatial patterns that have been identified are robust. [42] Perhaps the most important characteristic of the trends described in this article is the strong contrast between the coastal cooling and the warming in the central valley and Andes of central and northern Chile. This result clearly demonstrates that temperature trends at low-lying stations are not representative of what is occurring in the Andes, despite the relatively short distance between the lowlands and the mountains. The Andean warming trend is well observed in central Chile but its northward extent is not well characterized by the in situ data available, although the positive trend at Calama (23\u00b0S) and the prior results of Vuille and Bradley [2000] provide some indication that the warming trend may extend along the length of the subtropical Andes. The positive trends in the Andes of central Chile are of considerable interest, not least because of the strong impact the warming may have on the evolution of the Andean snowpack [Lettenmaier et al., 1996; Moore and McKendry, 1996; Lettenmaier et al., 1999] . Since much of Chile's water supply is derived from meltwater, changes in seasonal snow cover and melting rates as a result of warming may have significant impacts on agriculture and hydroelectric energy generation. The altitude dependence of the warming trends may also have implications in the understanding of the causes of glacial retreat in central and northern Chile [e.g., Vuille and Bradley, 2000; Bown and Rivera, 2007] . It is noteworthy that the observed warming trend at elevated locations in central and northern Chile is consistent with the late 20th century climate change simulated by the CMIP-3 global model ensemble. The CMIP-3 models suggest that the warming trend is likely to continue, and probably intensify, throughout the 21st century as a response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n[43] The interpretation of the coastal cooling pattern is somewhat more difficult. The large scale structure of the coastal cooling pattern suggests it is related to the declining PDV index from its maximum in the early 1980s [e.g., Hartmann and Wendler, 2005] . Although PDV is still not well understood [Gu and Philander, 1997; Burgman et al., 2008] and may be influenced by global warming, it is widely recognized as an internally forced oscillation. Nonetheless, the fact that the ensemble mean warming is weaker along the Chilean coast than other parts of the world (except the Southern Ocean) does suggest that the predicted circulation changes act to subdue warming rates in coastal Chile, leading to temperature trend anomalies (with respect to the global mean trend) of \u00c00.07\u00b0C/decade, about a third of the observed value. This may be a conservative estimate, as it is unlikely that the models are able to fully capture the SST response to circulation changes in the southeastern Pacific (due to their limited representation of coastal upwelling for example). Our study has provided a preliminary discussion of the changes in low-level circulation (via the SLP field) that appear to be associated with the cooling off the subtropical coast of South America. We suggest that the apparent intensification of the South Pacific Anticyclone, also a simulated consequence of global warming, is likely to play an important, perhaps driving, role. The separation of the natural and anthropogenic contributions to the long-term temperature trends in the coastal waters off Chile will require more in-depth analysis and careful consideration of the physical processes involved."}]
