[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT\nThere is little doubt that enrollments in MIS degree"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "here is little doubt that enrollments in MIS degree programs have been declining since the recession in the technical industry in 2001. Reagan's research (2008) indicates that enrollment in MIS degree programs is only about 25% of the 2001 level. Many MIS (IS) programs have been abandoned or combined with other related programs. While many reasons for this decline have been advanced, one of the most tenable reasons is a perception gap between what IT professors believe is important and what potential employers see as important skills for new hires. Trauth, Farwell, and Lee (1993) found this gap in their study where employers placed greater value on the \"soft\" business and interpersonal skills. Yew (2008) recommended that MIS programs include internships and partnering with community colleges as ways to improve the curriculum and, presumably, increase enrollments. Lindberg (2007, pp. 623-644) has stated that higher education \"must worry about the employability of the graduates and the efficiency of the system, even though priority is placed on making the system available for the masses.\" This study reports the results of a survey of MIS graduates of a medium size university in the midwest. Results suggest that graduates share the view that a perception gap exists and share Lindberg's view that more emphasis needs to be placed on employability. They tend to believe that their program needs to become more aligned with the needs of employers. Graduates believe that business leaders should be involved more closely in determining the direction and content of their program."}, {"section_title": "THE QUESTIONNAIRE", "text": "A survey instrument was designed and emailed to 599 graduates of the Lewis College of Business program in Management Information Systems (MIS) at Marshall University. Two hundred and thirty email addresses were no longer valid resulting in 369 questionnaires delivered. The questionnaire contained 29 questions and statement response items. One portion of the survey instrument was from a questionnaire developed by Saunders and Stivason (2010) and a second part was adapted from questionnaires used by other academic institutions."}, {"section_title": "T", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Forty-two responses were received yielding an 11.4 percent response rate. This compares with a response rate of 26.4 percent for accounting graduates, which was the highest response rate of all of the major areas. This relatively low response rate may indicate a level of dissatisfaction with their degree program. Although the response rate is low compared with response rates of graduates in other major areas it is within the range for responses to that of other survey's [The University of Washington Business School published results of their alumni survey (2006) with a \"excellent\" response rate of 22 percent and indicated that the national average is between 10 and 20 percent.]. Twelve (28.6%) of the respondents requested copies of the results.\nThe statements contained in the questionnaire and the responses in each category are shown in appendix I. The average year of graduation was 2003 and the average age when the survey was conducted (2009) was 31. This indicates that the average age at graduation was 25. The oldest respondent was 86 years old and the youngest was 22. Only 21.4% of the graduates entered a graduate program upon completion of the undergraduate program.\nOn average graduates of the MIS program searched for three months after graduation before obtaining their first position. However, almost 31% of the graduates had obtained their first professional position before graduation and 56% had obtained a professional position within three months of graduation. The National Center for Education Statistics conducted the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) survey for students who received their bachelor's degrees in 1992-93 or 1999-2000. This study showed that 27.3 percent of all students were unemployed three months after graduation with an additional 13.1 percent only worked part time. MIS graduates responding to the survey were not doing as well as the national average for all students. The Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education Survey (DLHE) is carried out by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in the UK for the 2000/01 academic year shows that six months after graduation 71% of all business school graduates seeking employment were successfully employed on a full time basis. This is greater than the success rate for the current study of our MIS students. Remarkably, slightly more than 40% searched for one year or more before obtaining their first position and graduates obtained positions in a number of different areas, many outside the MIS field.\nRespondents were asked how many times they had changed companies in their careers and, remarkably, 36% had never changed companies. Another 24% had changed companies one time and another 14% had changed two times. On average graduates had changed positions one and one-half times in the six years since their average graduation year of 2003; this suggests that graduates changed jobs every 4 years.\nGraduates were asked if they were satisfied with the progression of their career. Remember, on average they had been graduated for less than seven years. Slightly more than 78% of the graduates were satisfied with the progression of their careers. That indicates that they have achieved a measure of career success. Respondents were asked if they believed their education at Marshall adequately prepared them for their career and 83.3% responded affirmatively, a great vote of confidence in their MIS program. Seventy-eight percent indicated that they would recommend the MIS program at Marshall to their children or friends, another vote of confidence.\nA series of statements asked the graduates to evaluate their program on a number of factors. One statement said \"my program could be improved by placing more emphasis on career oriented learning.\" A somewhat surprising 85.7% agreed with the statement and one third strongly agreed. Another statement said \"more input from business leaders about the direction of my program would result in an improvement.\" Slightly more than 90% of the respondents agreed with the statement and 26.2% strongly agreed. A third statement said \"more input from business leaders about the content of their program would result in an improvement\" and slightly more than 95% agreed. Twenty-eight and one-half percent of the respondents strongly agreed. Continuing in the same vein a statement said \"faculty teaching in my program should work more closely with business leaders.\" A total of 92.8% agreed with the statement. The last statement dealing with the MIS program said \"my program had a good balance of conceptual and practical study.\" The average response was between \"no opinion\" and \"agree somewhat\" indicating that graduates were not ready to endorse the balance of conceptual and practical study. This is supported by the strong endorsement of more involvement by business leaders which, presumable, would change the balance.\nThe last series of questions related to how effective the university experience was in improving certain personal traits. These traits were:\n\u2022 Developing critical thinking ability, \u2022 Developing a sense of ethics, \u2022 Contributing to a greater understanding of people with different backgrounds, habits, values, appearances, and abilities, \u2022 Helping to become a more active citizen, and \u2022 Improving the quality of your life aside from financial benefits.\nAs can be seen in appendix I, responses to each of these questions was basically \"moderately helpful\" suggesting, perhaps, that these items were less important to respondents than were job skills."}, {"section_title": "RELATIONSHIPS", "text": "Nonparametric Kendall's tau b coefficients were calculated for the relationships between the different items in the questionnaire. The results of these tests for correlations are detailed in Table 1 . There was a significant negative (0.003) relationship between how long it took to obtain the first position and current income; and a significant positive (0.006) relationship between the opinion that faculty should work more closely with business leaders and current income. As seen in the questionnaire shown in appendix I, \"yes\" responses were coded as \"1\" and \"no\" responses as \"2.\" Responses to whether graduates believe their education at Marshall adequately prepared them for their career were significantly (0.002) related with whether they would recommend the MIS program at Marshall to their children or friends. Again, \"yes\" responses were coded as \"1\" and \"no\" responses as \"2.\" These relationships suggest that graduates are consistent in their approval and support for the MIS program."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Results of the survey cast the MIS program in a less than favorable light. More than 31% of the respondents obtained employment before graduation and 56% were employed within three months of graduation. These employment numbers are lower than those reported in other studies. One study in the US showed that 60% of graduates were employed full time three months after graduation. Another in the UK found that 71% of business graduates found full-time employment within three months of graduation. Additionally, slightly more than 40% searched for one year or more before obtaining their first position and graduates obtained positions in a number of different areas, many outside the MIS field. Despite these employment numbers, 79% of the respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the progression of their careers. When asked if they believed their education at Marshall adequately prepared them for their career, 83% responded affirmatively and 78% said they would recommend the MIS program at Marshall to their children or friends.
