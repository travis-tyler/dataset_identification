[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "With the current and expected impacts of climate change on the agricultural industry, it is important to provide information to farmers to allow them to adapt and reduce their risk of loss. Extension agents are an important resource and serve as intermediaries between scientists and farmers to provide this information. There is little research, however, related to agents' perceptions of and needs for climate change-related information and no research in the southeastern United States. Survey research was conducted in 2018 with all extension agents in Tennessee who had responsibilities in agriculture and natural resources (n = 138), leading to a response rate of 72% (n = 100). Most agents (78%) believed climate was changing and was caused by both natural changes and human activities (62%). Agents believed climate change was a greater (medium + high + very high level) priority for the federal government (72%) than for extension (58%), which may indicate needs related to understanding potential adaptation strategies for farmers and local examples of impacts of climate change. In general, across the pertinent demographic information collected, older, male agents with more extension experience were less likely to agree that the climate is changing and more likely to identify lower priority levels for climate change in extension. Specific need areas identified by agents and their stakeholders included information on weather variability, agronomic decisions, disease, and pests."}, {"section_title": "Core Ideas", "text": "\u2022 e majority of extension agents believed the climate was changing and that it was caused by both natural changes and human activities.\n\u2022 e priority of climate change for extension was lower than for the federal category, indicating potential educational need areas in relevant adaptation strategies for farmers and examples of local climate change impacts.\n\u2022 Speci c need areas identi ed for training included weather variability, agronomic decisions, disease, and pests.\nC limate scientists predict that, at the current rate, global temperatures will have risen 1.5\u00b0C from preindustrial levels between 2030 and 2052 (IPCC, 2018) . The eff ects of this changing climate are expected to have impacts on US agriculture, which contributes about US$389 billion to the US economy (USDA-NASS, 2017) . For example, in 2011, there were $7.62 billion in losses reported for agricultural producers in Texas due to drought (Fannin, 2012) . In 2012, an extreme drought in the US Midwest led to yield reductions of 15 to 25% (Burke and Emerick, 2016) , with two-thirds of US counties declared as disaster areas and losses of $14.5 billion (Gowda et al., 2018) . In 2019, rain and fl ooding caused historic delays in planting for many states in the Great Plains and Midwest regions, leading to greater uncertainty (Nepveux, 2019; . These issues are predicted to be the new normal by 2050, leading to annual losses of $6.4 billion (Burke and Emerick, 2016) . The amount of land in the United States receiving extreme, 1-day precipitation events has increased since the 1980s (USEPA, 2016) along with an increase in the number, intensity, and extent of Category 4 and 5 Atlantic Ocean-based hurricanes over the same period (Walsh et al., 2014) . At the other extreme, however, future reductions in water availability are expected for much of the Southeastern region of the United States (Marion et al., 2014) . Changes in climate are also expected to reduce crop and livestock production due to increased pressure from pests (weeds, insects, pathogens) (Hatfi eld et al., 2014) . Although plant growth may increase under a regime of greater temperatures and CO 2 , other potential changes including a reduction in solar radiation (Pan et al., 2004) , a reduction in glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) effi cacy at higher CO 2 levels (Ziska et al., 1999) , and a reduction in forage quality (Morgan et al., 2004) , may counteract these positive eff ects. Livestock can be adversely aff ected by high temperatures due to reduced feed intake (Key et al., 2014) and reduced reproduction (Amundson et al., 2006) , and blizzards can produce a signifi cant share of losses (Zhorhov, 2013) . The variability of these changes across the US agricultural landscape will likely make it challenging for farmers to adapt, thereby increasing the importance of more educational programming related to meeting these needs.\nAccording to the Fourth National Climate Assessment (USGCRP, 2018), climate change-related risks for agricultural producers will depend on the level of changes, how quickly the changes occur, and the potential for producers to implement adaptation strategies. Current and future adaptation strategies may provide the means to avoid many of these adverse effects in the short term (Hatfield et al., 2014) ; however, whether these are adopted are in large part related to farmer perceptions as well as the important role that agricultural advisors play in farmer decision-making. A number of studies have been published related to farmers' perceptions on climate change. One study found that, in general, US farmers were not altering inputs or crops with changes in climate (Burke and Emerick, 2016) . They determined that this was not due to a lack of recognition of a changing climate but believed that it may have been due to a lack of options or options that were too expensive.\nOn the other hand, Doll et al. (2017) found that even though the majority of midwestern farmers did not believe in global climate change, they were making changes to their farm based on weather-related experiences they had witnessed. For example, farmers were purchasing larger equipment to complete field activities faster; adding irrigation pivots to protect against drier, warmer summers; installing tile drainage to remove excess water from saturated soils; and implementing no-till practices to aid in reducing erosion and retain soil moisture. This is similar to another study of midwestern farmers where 53% believed that changing their practices to deal with climate variability would aid in the long-term success of their farm (Mase et al., 2017) . This study also found, however, that midwestern corn farmers were focused on new technologies, conservation practices, and crop insurance to help reduce their risks and were not making larger modifications to their farm that might be necessary if expected climatic changes did occur. A majority of farmers in California agreed that global climate was changing (54%) and could affect global agriculture (53%), although were less sure that global temperatures were increasing (38%) or that it was caused by human activities (35%) (Haden et al., 2012) . Arbuckle et al. (2013) found that 66% of midwestern farmers believed that the climate was changing, whereas those who were undecided or disagreed that climate was changing represented 31 and 4%, respectively. Across different states, Rejesus et al. (2013) identified some differences in attitudes toward climate change. For example, different proportions of farmers in Mississippi (76%), Texas (71%), Wisconsin (66%), and North Carolina (61%) believed that normal weather cycles could explain most or all of the recent changes in climate (Rejesus et al., 2013) . Across all four states, however, about 70% of producers did not believe that climate change would affect the yield of their main crop by more than 5%.\nAgricultural advisors, such as cooperative extension agents, play an important role by helping farmers in their decision-making and, as it relates to climate change, can provide much needed information and engagement related to potential effects and adaptation strategies. Prokopy et al. (2008) found that, in some studies related to adoption of best management practices, access to information was positively associated with adoption rates. However, a report by the National Research Council in 2009 described the dissemination of climate change knowledge to stakeholders as lagging \"significantly behind\" or \"entirely inadequate\" (Walthall et al., 2012) . In their farmer perception study, Doll et al. (2017) noted that a number of midwestern farmers identified they needed more help and assistance on climaterelated issues from extension professionals. As extension educators serve as intermediaries between scientists and farmers, and growing weather variability will require farmers to incorporate changes in their production systems, these educators will serve as an increasingly important lifeline to help reduce the vulnerability of their stakeholders.\nAs identified by Haigh et al. (2015) , few studies have looked at the capacity of agricultural advisors to use weather and climate-related data to help farmers manage risk. Of those that focused on cooperative extension agents, most are focused on the Great Plains and Midwest regions of the United States (Haigh et al., 2015; Becerra et al., 2016) . This coupled with the nationally identified need for more research on potential obstacles to the adoption of adaptation techniques and methods for increasing adaptive capacity (Gowda et al., 2018) , makes this type of research a high priority. Therefore, our study identified (1) climate change-related perceptions and (2) priority subject areas and training needs for cooperative extension agents, with responsibilities in agriculture and natural resources throughout Tennessee."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "A questionnaire developed by Becerra et al. (2016) was largely reproduced in Qualtrics (Qualtrics, LLC, Provo, UT) to collect the data. The questionnaire contained a standard letter of consent along with questions related to attitudes, capacity, and needs related to climate change and five demographic questions (gender, age, ethnicity, region of Tennessee, and duration of employment in extension). Among the questions posed were those that included whether the climate was changing, the cause of the changing climate, the priority level for climate change, whether agents had received inquiries from stakeholders related to climate change, and agents' training needs. A link to the questionnaire was emailed to all 138 cooperative extension agents in Tennessee who had any responsibilities in agriculture and natural resources on 29 Jan. 2018. The initial email was followed up with weekly email reminders over the next 3 weeks. At the termination of the survey on 26 Feb. 2018, there were 100 responses, giving a 72% response rate. The demographic data collected was relatively similar to official demographic information for November 2018 for extension agents with agricultural and natural resources responsibilities employed by the University of Tennessee (n = 105) ( Table 1) . As there was very little diversity for ethnicity, this category was not included in the analysis. Variation between the demographic data collected in the survey and that from the University of Tennessee may be due to the different time periods being compared and agent information from those employed by Tennessee State University who were included in the survey."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Perceptions of Climate Change", "text": "Across the state, 78% of extension agent respondents believed that the climate was changing, and 62% of total respondents believed it was changing due to both natural changes and human activities (Fig. 1 ). The belief in climate change is similar to other studies where this was found to be 81% for extension agents in Oklahoma/Kansas (OK/KS) (Becerra et al., 2016) and almost 75% for those in the Midwest region . There were differences, however, in the perceived causes of climate change between these different studies. For OK/KS agents the greatest response (60%) was for natural changes only, while for Midwest agents there was no answer that received a majority, but was instead divided between \"both\" (31%), \"unsure\" (25%), \"natural changes\" (23%), and \"human activities\" (19%) (Fig. 1) . Some of the differences in responses between the Midwest region and the current study could be due to a regional effect; however, it may also have occurred because the Midwest research was conducted before the 2012 drought that affected many farmers in these regions. Morton et al. (2017) observed that the biophysical situation (i.e., flood, drought) of farmers could have an impact on their decision-making, and this may also relate well to extension agents.\nIn the current study, majorities in the analyzed demographic groups (i.e., gender, age, experience, location) believed the climate was changing (Table 2) . However, female agents (88%), the youngest group of agents (20-29 years, 100%), those with the least amount of extension experience (5 years or less, 85%), and those located in the western portion of the state (84%) where the majority of row crops are grown, were more likely to believe the climate was changing (Tables 2 and 3) . Evans et al. (2011) observed that farmers with greater experience were more likely to disagree with climate change, which may relate well to extension agents in our study as their responsibilities revolve around working with farmers. With respect to the gender differences observed, a study on US climate change perceptions between 2001 and 2008 found a greater percentage of women (59 vs. 54%) believed that global warming was occurring (McCright, 2010) . A similar trend was also evident for responses to the causes of the changing climate where either majorities or the greatest percentage of responses across every demographic group identified \"both natural and human causes\" but those that were female (88%), in the youngest age group (86%), and had the least extension experience (78%) were more likely to respond with that answer (Table 3 ). The only difference was with respect to location, where agents in the Eastern region (73%) were more likely to provide that response. In general, the responses of \"unsure\" and \"natural causes\" increased with the age of the agent, whereas \"both natural and human causes\" decreased. This same trend also occurred for the \"natural causes\" and \"both natural and human causes\" responses with increasing extension experience. The similarity in the trends identified is expected as age and length of service are usually related. The robustness of these trends may be limited, however, due to the discrepancy between answers of \"no\" to the question of \"Is the climate changing?\" and \"None\u2026climate change is not happening\" to the statement, \"Climate change is mostly caused by\u2026\" in Tables 2 and  3 . The answers should have the same percentage of respondents, but they do not, indicating some apparent differences between the two questions. When the \"Is the climate changing?\" question was asked, respondents were also asked how sure they were of their answer. For those who answered \"no,\" there were 45% who were \"not at all sure\" and 41% who were \"somewhat sure,\" with much fewer responses that were \"very sure\" or \"extremely sure\" (data not shown). This may have led to the discrepancy identified in the next question about causes of climate change. Across four states (Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin), older producers were found to have a greater likelihood of believing that climate change was caused by humans, which contrasts with our results for agents (Rejesus et al., 2013) . With respect to gender, the study of US perceptions of climate change between 2001 and 2008 observed that more women (64 vs. 56%) believed that climate change was caused by human activities than did men (McCright, 2010) . Understanding these kinds of audience perceptions for future trainings related to climate change and its impacts are vital to tailoring training programs and curricula to specific groups that might need different kinds of information.\nWhen asked about the level of importance that climate change has for them personally and should have for the federal government and for extension, the greatest response of extension agents was the medium level for the personal (33%), federal (36%), and extension (35%) categories (Fig. 2) . When the \"very high\" and \"high\" responses were pooled together and \"very low\" and \"low\" were pooled together, it was evident that there were more lower level responses than higher level responses for the importance of climate change at the personal (43 vs. 24%) and extension (42 vs. 23%) categories; however, there were more higher-level responses in the federal (36 vs. 28%) category. This contrasts with results of Becerra et al. (2016) , who observed more responses at the medium level for the federal (\"President and Congress\") and extension categories (45 and 44%, respectively) and fewer responses at the low level (37 and 32%, respectively) (there was no \"very low\" category). Also, their high-level (high + very high) responses for the federal category were only 18%, and lower than the high level (high + very high) responses for the extension category (24%). This implies that extension agents in Tennessee may find climate change a lowerlevel priority than agents in Oklahoma and Kansas, and that it should be less of a priority for extension than the federal government. On one hand, the federal government may play a large role in mitigating the effects of climate change through specific policy. There may be some concern, however, if agents believe the priority level should be lower for extension than for the federal government since extension is directly involved with farmers who may be currently struggling with some of the effects of these changes. In other words, 78% of agents believed the climate was changing, but only 23% believed it should be a high or very high priority for extension. This may identify that agents need more information about specific ways they can assist in helping farmers adapt to changes in climate or they are unaware of the impacts of climate change on stakeholders. This type of training may involve transformative learning, which Tarnoczi (2011) found useful for farmers and allowed them to adapt to environmental uncertainty caused by climate change. These results are also similar to Haigh et al. (2015) , who found that although 73% of agricultural advisors (i.e., extension agents, state agency staff, agricultural bankers, agricultural retailers) identified more changes in weather across the Corn Belt, only 18% believed that they were hurting farmers. Mase et al. (2017) found that 57% of farmers identified more variable weather on their farm, but only 16% believed that these changes were harming their business. Training, therefore, may require a more localized approach where specific local impacts are identified and Table 3 . Extension agent responses related to their belief in climate change and its cause across extension experience and location."}, {"section_title": "Extension experience Location", "text": "Question Response future adaptation methods are proposed and made relevant to guide agents and farmers in beneficial agricultural management practices (Haden et al., 2012; Mase and Prokopy, 2014) . Others have found that focusing on local impacts of climate change can enhance communication (CRED, 2014). There were some important differences identified for priority level when compared within different demographic groups. One of the largest differences occurred with gender where female agents were more likely to identify high or very high priorities for climate change compared with low or very low priorities under the personal (44 vs. 28%), federal (64 vs. 20%), and extension (40 vs. 24%) categories (Table 4 ). This was opposite the male agents, who were more likely to identify low/very low priorities than high/very high priorities for the personal (46 vs. 18%), federal (32 vs. 27%), and extension (47 vs. 17%) categories. Though not as large a contrast, McCright (2010) found that concern for global warming by US women (35-37%) was greater than men (28-29%) between 2001 and 2008, which corroborates our gender differences.\nAmong age groups, the priority level with the greatest number of responses in the personal category was \"medium\" for most groups (35-43%); however, the 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 age groups had more responses for the \"low\" priority level (38 and 31%, respectively) ( Table 4 ). In comparing responses for the combined \"low/very low\" and \"high/very high\" priority levels, the 20 to 29 year old group was the only group with more responses in the \"high/ very high\" level compared with the \"low/very low\" level (36 vs. 21%). Prokopy et al. (2008) found that age generally had a negative relationship with adoption rates of best management practices, which may explain the results for the youngest age group in our study. For the federal category, the 20 to 29 and 40 to 49 age groups indicated a greater response to the \"high\" priority level than other levels, whereas the remaining groups identified more with the \"medium\" priority level. This trend is also found in a comparison of responses to the combined \"high/very high\" and \"low/very low\" priority levels, where the 20 to 29 and 40 to 49 age groups had more \"high/very high\" level responses than \"low/very low\" level responses (64 vs. 0% for 20-29, 45 vs. 31% for 40-49), but the 60+ age group did have an equal response level (24 vs. 24%). The trend in the \"extension\" category was the same as for the \"personal\" category for highest response and \"high/very high\" and \"low/ very low\" priority levels for each age group, although the 20 to 29 age group had similar \"high/very high\" and \"low/ very low\" responses (28 vs. 29%). This indicates that the \"extension\" category may reflect personal beliefs, because the gender group also had similar trends between these two categories. Lemos et al. (2014) observed that advisors' inclination to deliver climate-related information was partially dependent on individual factors such as behavior and perception, which may explain the link between the \"extension\" and \"personal\" categories in our study.\nThe amount of extension experience also related to the trends observed for age groups for the \"personal\" and \"extension\" categories where those with 5 or less or 21+ years of experience had the most responses for the \"medium\" priority level and those in the other groups had the most responses in the \"low\" priority level. The 6-to 10-year group, however, was spread equally between Table 4 . Extension agents' responses related to their perceptions of the importance of climate change personally, at the federal level and for Extension across gender and age groups. \"medium,\" \"low,\" and \"very low\" for the \"extension\" category (Table 5) . As stated previously, age and experience are likely to be well-related. There were greater responses in the \"low/very low\" level than \"high/very high\" for the \"personal\" and \"extension\" categories. For the \"federal\" category, the most responses for each group were found in the \"medium\" priority level, although the 6-to 10-year group was evenly divided between \"very high,\" \"high,\" and \"very low.\" There were more responses for the \"high/very high\" priority levels than \"low/very low\" priority levels for all groups except agents with 11 to 20 years of experience. Again, these results may indicate that the \"extension\" category may align closely with agents' personal beliefs.\nIn general, there were very few regional differences within the state when it came to priority levels for climate change (Table 5 ). The most responses were found for the \"medium\" level, although the Eastern region had greater variability around this level and the Central region had more responses for the \"low\" priority level for the \"extension\" category. Comparing responses for the \"high/very high\" and \"low/very low\" priority levels, state regions had greater responses for the \"low/very low\" priority level for the \"personal\" and \"extension\" categories and more responses for the \"high/very high\" priority level for the \"federal\" category, although the Central region did have an equal proportion of responses for both combined levels.\nVery high  4  13  20  7  13  10  3   High  22  25  5  12  11  7  30   Medium  44  0  20  38  32  37  30 Low 19 that some midwestern farmers were adapting by investing in technology to help them track weather, purchasing larger equipment to work faster in the field, installing more irrigation pivots and drainage equipment, implementing notill practices, spending more time scouting fields to identify emerging issues, and purchasing seeds that matured faster and had better resistance to disease, pests, and drought. A different study of midwestern farmers found that the most popular (64%) adaptation strategy farmers were engaged in was in-field conservation practices with fewer involved in new technologies (43%), edge-of-field conservation practices (35%), and diversifying production (10%) (Mase et al., 2017) . Farmers involved in the study also indicated drought, disease, heat stress, insects, and weeds as their areas of greatest concern. A majority of producers in Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas believed that, in the future, the types of crops being grown in their areas would be different due to climate change (Rejesus et al., 2013) . When compared across different demographic groups, there were some differences that were similar to the trends for climate change perceptions. Female agents differed from male agents where the higher priority for female agents was agronomic decisions (13%), followed by weather variability (12%) ( Table 7) . This was opposite to male agents, who identified weather variability (22%) as the higher priority followed by agronomic decisions (15%). Also, those in the youngest age group (20-29) and with the least extension experience (5 years or less) identified greater training needs for agronomic decisions (13 and 14%, respectively) than for weather variability (11 and 10%, respectively) (Tables 7 and 8). The youngest age group also identified soil loss (11%) and crop insurance (11%) as a need of similar importance to weather variability. The older and more experienced groups had similar trends as the male agents. There was little difference across region where the greatest needs were for training related to weather variability (16-19%) and agronomic decisions (10-16%), although the Eastern region also identified weather forecast information as one of the higher needs (10%) ( Table 8 )."}, {"section_title": "Needs for Climate Change Training", "text": "There were 26% of agent respondents who had a stakeholder who raised the issue of climate change, and about 52% of those stakeholders were moderately concerned with the remainder split between a high or low level of concern (data not shown). Becerra et al. (2016) had a similar level (35%) of agent respondents with stakeholders who raised the issue of climate change but had more stakeholders (51%) with no concern or a low level of concern. Doll et al. (2017) found that most farmers did not separate management activities related to climate change from other forms of management on the farm, which may have resulted in the low number of queries by farmers in both studies. Also, Mase et al. (2017) found that one of the important elements of adaptation success related to farmer perceptions of their own risk. This relates to agent perceptions that were mentioned previously, where training that involves local examples may provide greater context for increasing awareness and the potential need for adaptation strategies. This may also take the form of farmer-led discussion groups, which can allow farmers to learn what types of climate-related issues others are dealing with and identify potential solutions. This type of activity has proven useful for other environmental issues where a high respect for other farmers' knowledge can assist in learning new management skills (Morton, 2008) . About 64% of those agents who had stakeholders who raised the issue of climate change felt they had a moderate capacity to answer these questions, though 24% indicated a low capacity (data not shown). When agents were asked the types of questions they had received, the top four concerns were weather variability (21%), disease (13%), pests (11%), and agronomic decisions (10%) ( Table 6 ). In total, these represented the majority of the stakeholders' concerns (i.e., >50%). When all agents were asked to identify their own training needs related to climate change, the responses were similar where weather variability was greatest (18%); however, agronomic decisions were next (14%) and pests and disease were much lower at 8%. Haigh et al. (2015) suggested that advisors who provided agronomic information to stakeholders were also likely to serve as intermediaries for weather and climate information as well, which reflects the needs identified by agents in our study. Becerra et al. (2016) observed weather variability and agronomic decisions as the greatest topics of concern for stakeholders, but grazing management and alternative management practices were the next greatest issues. These additional areas may reflect regional agricultural differences where, according to the 2012 Census of Agriculture (USDA-NASS, 2012), Oklahoma had 51,043 farms with cattle/calf (Bos sp.) operations and 4.2 million cattle, Kansas had 27,568 farms with cattle/calf operations and 5.9 million cattle, and Tennessee had 38,826 farms with cattle/calf operations and 1.9 million cattle. The concerns and needs identified by farmers and agents, respectively, in our study also relate well with Doll et al. (2017) , who found Table 5 . Extension agents' responses related to their perceptions of the importance of climate change personally, at the federal level and for extension across extension experience and location. "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The overall results of this research identify some important parameters for engaging in effective training of extension agents using climate change-related material. First, the make-up of the agent audience will be a factor relative to existing perceptions where older, male agents with greater years of extension experience may be less likely to identify a changing climate and more likely to attribute a lower priority level. This could reduce trainers' ability to recruit these groups into these training audiences. The lower priority level of climate change for extension as compared with the federal government may indicate a need area exists for (1) information related to management activities or tools that can be implemented to help farmers adapt to climate change, and/or (2) specific local examples of changes that have directly impacted local farmers. Creating curricula and implementing workshops that engage these methods may also help influence those Table 6 .
