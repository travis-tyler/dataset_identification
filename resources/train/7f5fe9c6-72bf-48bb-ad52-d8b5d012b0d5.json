This vascular contribution to cognitive decline is collectively referred to as vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) [1] . VCI is a heterogeneous construct, both in terms of cognitive phenotypes and nature and severity of underlying vascular etiologies and comorbid conditions. Despite this heterogeneity, lesion location is likely to be an important determinant of cognitive impact of different manifestations of vascular brain injury. Based on early observations, certain lesion locations are considered to be \"strategic,\" including the left angular gyrus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. However, a recent statement on VCI from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association emphasized that current concepts of strategic infarction are largely based on small case series and warrant reexamination in larger imaging studies [1] . For white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), there are also indications that lesion location is related to cognitive impact, but this relationship is less clear [2, 3] .\nLesion-symptom mapping (LSM) is an increasingly utilized method in the VCI research field [4, 5] . The concept of LSM is that it examines relationships between the location of brain injury-usually at the level of individual voxels or regions of interest-and behavioral measures such as cognition. This is commonly done through statistical comparisons of patients with and without a lesion for individual voxels or by associating regional lesion volumes with cognition. LSM studies have identified strategic lesion locations for acute infarcts [6] and small vessel disease [3] . A growing number of scientific publications and lesion analysis methods have emerged over the past decades [7] . Yet, most LSM studies are hampered by incomplete lesion coverage of the brain. This is important because the cognitive impact of damage to a particular brain region can only be addressed in the statistical analyses if this region is damaged in a sufficient number of patients. Because vascular lesions are not distributed randomly across the brain, some regions are commonly affected, but others that may be relevant for cognition-such as the orbitofrontal lobes in anterior cerebral artery territory infarction [8, 9] -are rarely affected. As a consequence, previous studies (e.g., [5, 10, 11] ) found that even with several hundred subjects, large regions of the brain were not affected by vascular lesions and could therefore not be considered in LSM analyses. Thus, it remains difficult to obtain a comprehensive picture of strategic lesion locations for cognitive dysfunction.\nMeta VCI Map is a recently established consortium that aims to perform Meta-analyses on strategic lesion locations for VCI using lesion-symptom Mapping. This consortium provides an international collaborative platform for multicenter LSM projects. By integrating existing data sets with imaging data on vascular lesions and cognitive data, LSM studies can be performed on larger study samples to improve brain lesion coverage.\nMeta VCI Map has two key objectives. The first objective is to create vulnerability maps of the brain that show where vascular lesions have the most impact on cognition. Such vulnerability maps would be of diagnostic and prognostic value and could help explain why some patients with vascular lesions develop VCI while others do not. The second objective is to further establish strategic lesion locations that lead to impairment of specific cognitive functions.\nIn this study, we provide an overview of the design and objectives of this consortium. In addition, we present the methods and results of the pilot study, which aimed to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of multicenter LSM studies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Consortium design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Membership and data index", "text": "Membership is open to all research groups and consortia willing to share suitable data. Data sets are eligible for inclusion if both brain imaging and data on cognitive performance are available. Study populations typically involve patients with ischemic stroke, memory clinic patients, or population-based subjects. Data sets available from members are listed in the Meta VCI Map data index. This data index is used to select cohorts with comparable study populations and cognitive outcomes that can be used in meta-analyses. These analyses are performed on a project-by-project basis. Membership as such does not require the actual submission of data. Data are only shared in the context of specific projects (see 2.1.2).\nPotential members were identified and invited through other collaborative networks in the VCI research field, including STRIVE [12] , METACOHORTS [13] , and HARNESS (www.harness-neuroimaging.org) and asked to fill in a survey to explore their interest in participating and support creation of the data index. As of November 2018, 47 groups have joined Meta VCI Map, and the data index includes approximately 7800 patients with ischemic stroke, 4900 memory clinic patients, and 14,400 population-based subjects.

An overview of typical image processing steps is shown in Fig. 1 . Meta VCI Map provides technical support for each step, thereby allowing interested parties to contribute imaging data at different stages of processing.\nFor image and lesion data processing, Meta VCI Map promotes the use of the RegLSM image processing pipeline, which was recently developed in a collaborative LSM project between Utrecht and Hong Kong [10] . RegLSM can transform lesion maps to fit onto a standardized brain template. For the present pilot study, the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 template [63] was used, but this can be substituted by other brain templates depending on individual preference [64] . RegLSM provides custom-fit settings for CT [65] , MRI T1 and FLAIR [11] , and DWI [10] (Fig. 1) . It can also process scans from different vendors and field strengths. Furthermore, it can correct for anatomical variation (e.g., ethnicity-based morphometric differences or brain atrophy) by performing intermediate transformation steps using population-adjusted templates. The output is the same for each setting, that is, lesion maps in standardized brain space, which allows lesion data from different imaging modalities (e.g., CT/MRI) and sequences (e.g., T1/FLAIR/ DWI) to be combined into one data set.\nRegLSM and other downloadable software packages, protocols, and tutorials will be provided on the Meta VCI Map website (see 2.1.1) to facilitate and harmonize data processing. Although we strive to implement standard pipelines across projects, ultimately the selection of particular (or combinations of) pipelines will be decided on a projectby-project basis, but always with rigorous quality controls.

This includes subjects from the TRACE-VCI and Alzheimer Center Erasmus MC cohorts; thus, partial overlap between these cohorts must be noted. modality and sequence, and timing of assessment. For cognitive data, the wide variety of available neuropsychological test batteries and diagnostic criteria make this challenging to harmonize across cohorts. Meta VCI Map projects will account for heterogeneity by pooling data from cohorts that use internationally validated, commonly used cognitive tests (e.g., MoCA, Trail Making Test), or by recoding data into standardized cognitive outcomes (e.g., dementia yes/no).\nThe data index will allow cohorts to be selected based on the availability of comparable data. Meta VCI Map will implement state-of-the-art multivariate LSM analysis techniques, which show a higher sensitivity and better spatial accuracy than the original mass-univariate approach [66] .

Typical image and lesion processing pipeline for lesion-symptom mapping studies. Lesion-symptom mapping studies essentially require three image and lesion processing steps to prepare lesion maps. Examples are shown for three common imaging sequences: FLAIR, DWI, and CT. First, the lesion must be delineated on the original scan data (lesion segmentation). This can be done manually, or (semi-)automatically using computer algorithms. Next, the scan and corresponding lesion map are transformed to fit the size and shape of a brain template (spatial normalization). An intermediate registration step to an age-specific template is often used to improve registration accuracy. Finally, the resulting lesion map is projected onto the brain template. This result is compared to the original scan, to determine whether lesion registration was successful. Main criteria are that the key anatomical landmarks of the transformed scan and template should correspond and that the registered lesion map accurately represents the original lesion regarding location, size, and shape. The final lesion map can be used for group comparisons, unrestricted by type and format of the raw imaging data.

This was operationalized in the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke; (2) availability of brain imaging (CT/"}, {"section_title": "Generation of lesion maps", "text": "Processing of imaging and lesion data was performed by the project team in Utrecht. Imaging data could be submitted in different formats and at different stages of processing, ranging from raw imaging data to fully prepared lesion maps.\nFor cohorts that provided raw imaging data, lesion segmentation was performed manually with in-house developed software using MeVisLab (MeVis Medical Solutions AG, Bremen, Germany) [67] . Infarcts were delineated on MRI DWI (,2 weeks after stroke) or FLAIR (2 weeks after stroke), or on CT (1 day after stroke) if no MRI was available. The acute (symptomatic) lesion was identified based on imaging features, which needed to be compatible with the poststroke interval. In cases of uncertainty based on imaging alone, the reported neurological deficit or the clinician's localization of the infarct was used to help localize the lesion. One trained rater performed lesion segmentation for all scans (E.M.H.), which was reviewed by a second rater (N.A.W.). In case of uncertainty regarding lesion location or classification, a third rater performed a consensus rating (J.M.B.). All raters were blinded to the neuropsychological data. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement were determined using the Dice Similarity Coefficient, which expresses the degree of overlap between the segmented regions on a scale from 0 to 1, on a random subset of 15 scans (5 for CT/FLAIR/DWI each) [68, 69] . Both interobserver (0.81 6 0.08) and intraobserver (0.83 6 0.07) agreement were excellent.\nNext, segmented lesions were registered to the MNI-152 template using the RegLSM software package (see 2.1.4). Each registered lesion map underwent visual quality control. Lesion maps in MNI-152 space were compared to the original scan, to determine whether key anatomical landmarks corresponded, and whether the registered lesion map accurately represented the infarct regarding location, size, and shape.

Spatial normalization was performed for 468 patients, which was successful in all cases. Manual adjustments were made in 177 cases, which was comparable for each cohort and type of imaging data.

Every voxel that is damaged in one or more subjects in the cohort is shown in colors ranging from purple (n 5 1) to red (n 10). The right hemisphere is depicted on the right, which is conventional in lesion-symptom mapping studies. To prevent that lesion-symptom mapping analyses are biased by voxels that are only rarely affected, a minimum number of patients with a lesion in a particular voxel is commonly set. Although there is no general rule on where to set this threshold, it is typically set in the range of 5 n 10 [66] . In this figure, blue-and purple-colored voxels are damaged in less than five subjects and thus would normally be excluded from lesion-symptom mapping studies. The bottom lesion map was created by merging lesion maps from all the cohorts, which shows a considerably increased number of included voxels after integrating the data from all six cohorts. Note that the left hemisphere is relatively underrepresented; most cohorts used aphasia as an exclusion criterion because it precluded reliable cognitive assessment. Thus, subjects with (large) left hemispheric lesions were often excluded during initial inclusion of stroke patients. [63] . The bar indicates the number of patients with a lesion for each voxel. (B) Lesion size topographies for each voxel lesioned in at least five patients. The bar indicates the median lesion volume (in milliliters) per patient, given that the specific voxel is lesioned.

Voxelwise associations between the presence of a lesion and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score (C) or language domain score (D) were determined using support vector regression (SVR-LSM).

These associations are corrected for age, gender, and education. Significant clusters are shown in colors ranging from yellow (P 5 .01) to red (P , .001). To visualize the voxels that were included in each step of the analyses, voxels associated with cognition in the univariate analyses (without correction for multiple testing), but not in the multivariate analyses, are shown in light blue. Voxels with no univariate association with cognition are shown in dark blue and were not included in the multivariate analysis.

This increase was most prominent in the left hemisphere, right occipital lobe, and cerebellum. Meanwhile, coverage of the left hemisphere and orbitofrontal lobes was relatively limited. For the left hemisphere, this was likely due to aphasia being an exclusion criterion in most cohorts, because this would preclude reliable cognitive assessment. This is also reflected in the finding that left hemispheric infarcts were often smaller and did not cover cortical regions in the frontal and temporal lobes (Fig. 4A, B) . For the orbitofrontal lobes, coverage was likely limited because anterior cerebral artery infarcts are relatively rare [9] . Lesion distributions differed between cohorts, reflective of differences in inclusion criteria and recruitment strategies (Table 2 ). For example, CODECS only included patients with cerebellar infarcts. Meanwhile, DEDEMAS and MSS-II included subjects with milder stroke symptoms, who generally had smaller infarcts that showed less overlap (Fig. 3) . Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 . Both methods identified significant associations between total MoCA scores and infarcts located in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left basal ganglia and their surrounding white matter tracts, left insula, and bilateral occipital lobes.

The pilot demonstrates that this novel multicenter LSM approach is feasible and substantially improves brain lesion coverage. Our image processing and LSM analysis pipelines showed that integration of multicenter patient data is feasible, allowing for inclusion of both CT and MRI scans from different data sets.\nThis pilot study demonstrates the benefits of multicenter LSM. First, we achieved a marked improvement of brain lesion coverage by integrating individual data sets. Compared with the CU-STRIDE study, one of the largest (monocenter) LSM studies to date (n 5 410) [8] , the increased coverage in our merged data set (n 5 878) allowed us to identify strategic infarct locations in previously excluded brain areas. Furthermore, we provided a proofof-concept that multicenter LSM can identify strategic lesion locations for distinct cognitive processes. For example, infarcts in the basal ganglia and internal capsule were associated with impairment of global cognition, which agrees with the known critical role of these structures [1] , whereas infarcts in the left superior temporal lobe and frontal white matter were associated with language impairment, which agrees with well-established neural correlates for language [72, 73] .\nSeveral challenges for future multicenter LSM studies were also identified. First, achieving better brain lesion coverage of rarely affected brain regions, such as orbitofrontal regions for infarcts and temporal lobes for WMH, will require even larger study samples. However, although larger multicenter data sets will lead to an increase of statistical power by including more patients with a lesion in each voxel, it must be taken into account that regions with higher lesion frequency will be more likely to be found in the LSM analysis than voxels with a lower lesion frequency [74] . This spatial bias persists in larger data sets because vascular lesion distribution typically follows the vascular tree. Further improvement of LSM methods is therefore an ongoing endeavor of the Data Analysis Working Group. Second, preparation and processing of lesion data is labor intensive, particularly for infarcts because these require manual lesion segmentation and frequent manual adjustments after registration (approximately 25% of cases). In our experience, this issue is less prominent for WMH, where automated segmentation tools are available (e.g., at https:// software.harness-neuroimaging.org) and adaptations are generally needed in ,5% of subjects (e.g., [41, 75] ). Nevertheless, efforts to reduce requirements for manual editing are a key priority of the Data Analysis Working Group. Third, although integration of different types of imaging data at different processing stages is technically feasible, this could introduce variability that must be taken into account, preferably through implementation of standardized protocols for each processing step. Fourth, our pilot study cohort had heterogeneous characteristics in terms of time point of cognitive assessment and inclusion criteria, which might impact our LSM results. Notably, the cognitive impact of acute versus chronic stroke is known to differ due to network reorganization and\nThe names of the significant ROIs are labeled in the figure.

Finally, other contributing factors to cognitive decline, such as the presence and burden of other vascular lesions and premorbid cognitive status, should be taken into account in future projects. This should also include markers of neurodegeneration, which often accompany vascular lesions, particularly in older individuals. Of note, LSM techniques are well equipped to deal with such factors, for example, by including biomarkers for amyloid or tau in the analyses.\nFuture Meta VCI Map projects aim to include thousands of subjects to achieve even better brain lesion coverage. Several Meta VCI Map projects are in preparation. First, for patients with acute ischemic stroke, we aim to create a comprehensive vulnerability map of the brain that shows which infarct locations predict poststroke cognitive impairment, with particular focus on differences between early and late poststroke phases. Second, for infarcts and WMH, we aim to establish strategic lesion locations for domainspecific cognitive functions. Third, multidimensional LSM models will be implemented to study the interplay between MRI manifestations of vascular injury and other contributing factors to cognitive decline, such as risk factors and biomarkers for neurodegeneration.\nCurrent members and other interested parties already show a great willingness to contribute data. Future projects will benefit from a growing Meta VCI Map membership base. Therefore, we invite all investigators who are interested and can contribute data to join Meta VCI Map.
