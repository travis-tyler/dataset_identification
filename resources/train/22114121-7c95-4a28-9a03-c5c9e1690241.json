[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The supply of new doctoral graduates in Spain has increased significantly in recent times, reaching almost 9 thousand in 2011 (this figure was 6.4 thousand in 2000) -see INE (2014). This represents an average annual increase of 3.7%. This group of employees is important from an economic perspective since they are a key factor to develop R&D activities and foster economic growth (Romer 1986(Romer , 1990Auriol 2010). In addition, they have better economic condition in the labor market in terms of unemployment and earnings. For the former, their rate of unemployment is very low (considering that Spain is one of the countries with higher levels of unemployment). Thus, unemployment between doctorate holders is 4.3%, being 16.0% for those with a university degree and 25.7% the average rate (INE 2013). For the latter, employees with higher levels of education earn higher wages. In Spain, those in the higher levels of education (with a university grade, master or PhD) earn, in average, 60% more than those who just finished high school, and around the double salary of those who finished compulsory education (INE 2010). As it has been shown, PhD holders have, in average, better conditions in the labor market in monetary terms. However, job satisfaction may include non-monetary factors, such as job stability, promotion opportunities, conciliation between labor and family life, self-fulfillment, etc. (see a review of non-monetary benefits of education in McMahon 1999 andVila 2000). However, literature typically shows that the more educated have lower job satisfaction (Clark and Oswald 1996). Thus, PhD graduates are at the top of the education system and have better working conditions in economic terms, but are they satisfied with their job? The importance of analyzing job satisfaction is twofold. On the one hand, employees maximize their well-being. On the other hand, job satisfaction is associated with increased productivity and organizational commitment, lower absenteeism and turnover as well as greater organizational effectiveness (Ellickson and Logsdon 2001;Noordin and Jusoff 2009). Satisfaction may be measured in an objective and subjective way. Objective measures usually refer to the hierarchical position achieved and especially the salary level (see a review in Canal-Dom\u00ednguez and Wall 2013). Subjective measures need to ask PhDs about their degree of satisfaction in several topics related to their job. The latter is the approach of this article, which follows Maslow's typology of job satisfaction and the subsequent revision of Herzberg (see Maslow 1943Maslow , 1954Herzberg et al. 1959;Herzberg 1968). As it well-known, Maslow establishes a hierarchy of needs (in the shape of a pyramid). From top to bottom, these are esteem, affection (and love and belongingness), safety, and physiological needs. Maslow points out that the most basic level of needs (safety, and physiological needs) must be met before the individual will strongly desire the secondary or higher level needs (although both levels are interrelated and not only sharply separated). Likewise, esteem has two levels: the lower one is the need for the respect of others, status, recognition, or attention, and the higher one (self-actualization) is the need for self-respect, mastery, self-confidence, independence and freedom. Herzberg (1968) adds a dual approach by which not having job satisfaction does not mean dissatisfaction, but rather no satisfaction. Thus, the lack of achievement of lower order needs (in Maslow's typology) generates dissatisfaction but their achievement do not motivate. The latter is achieved when higher-level needs (related to the job itself) are satisfied. Herzberg defines factors related to working conditions as 'hygiene' factors, which are related to the work environment and may generate job dissatisfaction. These needs require satisfaction before higher-level needs emerge and determine motivation. Thus personnel policies should focus on the satisfaction of higher-level needs (once lower levels are achieved) in order to increase individuals' motivation It has to be pointed out, however, that Herzberg's taxonomy is questioned by different authors that consider a different typology of factors that generate satisfaction and dissatisfaction (see a review in Shin and Jung, 2014). In this study we analyze job satisfaction of doctorate holders in Spain. Specifically, we consider the determinants of job satisfaction. In the analysis we consider overall job satisfaction, and we also split satisfaction between basic and higher level or motivational needs following Herzberg's typology. The analysis is carried out for the whole sample as well as considering gender and work sector (university or elsewhere). Both factors seem to be relevant in previous analysis as it is shown in the literature review section. Results show that Herzberg's differentiation is not so clear for the Spanish PhD holders, since factors related with basic motivation (such as salary or working conditions referred to 'safety') have a bearing on all types of job satisfaction (not only the basic one as should be expected). It seems that these 'basic' needs are important for the job satisfaction of PhD holders. Moreover, factors related to basic needs seem to be less relevant for those working at the University. In addition, there are minor differences in the determinants of job satisfaction between men and women. We highlight the following. Firstly, there is hardly evidence that specifically consider job satisfaction of employees with doctoral degrees further than analyses of faculty members. Secondly, unlike many studies, our research contains many responses related to job satisfaction (in fact, 13). This is important since job satisfaction is a complex concept that includes several dimensions. Actually, some authors suggest that multiple-items scales are preferable to single-item scales in the case of job satisfaction (Oshagbemi, 2006;Wanous et al., 1997) Thirdly, we consider a less common perspective in the definition of satisfaction in educational research (basic or 'hygiene' and motivational), which is closer to a human management perspective. Finally, we divide the sample in several groups allowing to a better understanding of the determinants of job satisfaction for different groups of employees. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section considers the literature review. Then, data and the econometric strategy are shown. Finally, results and a conclusion section are displayed."}, {"section_title": "Literature review on the determinants of doctorate holders' job satisfaction", "text": "Most studies examining job satisfaction do not focus on the case of PhD graduates, but usually include all type of employees. In this review, we only include studies focused on doctorate holders (see a review for determinants of employees' job satisfaction in general in Bender and Heywood 2006). We also do not consider studies in which doctorate holders explain the factors that generate satisfaction but do not analyze causality (see a review in Raddon and Sung 2009). Moguerou (2002) and Bender and Heywood (2006) analyze job satisfaction (defined as a categorical response to a general question about the feelings of the individuals with their job) in the United States. The authors consider the same data sample: the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) carried out by the National Science Foundation (a branch of the United States government). It has 35,000 individuals with a PhD in sciences ('hard' and social) and engineering. The authors show that a U-shaped age profile for job satisfaction is found (especially for males). With regards to gender, the analyses of Moguerou (2002) and Bender and Heywood (2006) show that female doctorate holders have a greater job satisfaction that men. This result is in line with the general evidence usually defined as the 'paradox of the contented female worker': the fact that female employees have higher levels of job satisfaction is related to women's lower expectations (see Clark 1997;Bender et al. 2005). Also with data from SDR, Sabharwal and Corley (2009) show that job satisfaction (which is a composite index based on the combination of the satisfaction of employees in several job domains) gender gap disappears when all demographic, institutional and job-related characteristics are included. Also with regard to gender, a specific framework of analysis is related to job satisfaction of academics. Sabharwal and Corley (2009) review 14 analyses and report that the majority of studies show that male faculty members have higher levels of overall job satisfaction than female faculty members, particularly in terms of benefits and salary received as well as in promotion opportunities. However, in their own study with data from the 2003 SDR, Sabharwal and Corley (2009) found no significant difference in satisfaction levels for men and women in some fields (such as engineering and social science) but that men were significant less satisfied than women in science and health studies. In addition, Kifle and Desta (2012) report that no consensus can be reached by the existing studies on gender job satisfaction between academics. Considering age and gender, Sloane and Ward (2001), who analyze academics in Scotland, find a negative effect of being a female among those younger than 35 years but a positive effect among an older cohort. In a previous analysis, also for Scotland, Ward and Sloane (2000) show that gender (being a man) has only a bearing on promotion prospects. Moguerou (2002) emphasizes job security (both for men and women) defined in terms of job temporality as an important predictor of job satisfaction. However, Bender and Heywood (2006) report the opposite sign for those who work in the business sector. In this framework of analysis, Oshagbemi (2006), who considers university instructors in the United Kingdom, shows that although the length of employment in higher education does not correlate with job satisfaction the longer the employment at their current university the higher the level of job satisfaction. In the study of Moguerou (2002), the number of hours worked have a positive effect on the satisfaction of males (especially if they work in the industry sector) but a negative effect on females. However, Bender and Heywood (2006) report no effect of the number of hours worked for the whole sample, being positive only for those working for the Government. Likewise, earnings increase job satisfaction of all interviewed in both analyses. Finally, the studies that consider the sector where PhDs work show that it affects the level of their job satisfaction as well as that some of the determinants of job satisfaction may vary according to the sector where doctorate holders have their job (Sabharwal and Corley 2009). Thus, in their study for the United States, and Bender and Heywood (2006) show a very slightly higher level of job satisfaction among those working at the University than in a nonacademic sector. This positive effect is also reported by Moguerou (2002) in his subsample of PhDs in science and engineering of the sample used by Bender and Heywood (2006). For Spain, in their study of a sample of Spanish PhD graduates not working at University, Cruz and Sanz (2004) show that they value job stability. Canal-Dom\u00ednguez and Wall 2013use a previous wave of the survey used in this study (for 2006). In their analysis they create an indicator of job satisfaction from PhDs' answers to a questionnaire referred to intellectual challenge, contribution to society and social status. The authors show that, compared to being employed in the private sector, working in the public sector (Government or University) or non-profit institutions increases the level of male and female PhDs satisfaction. This effect is also true for that doctorate in sciences but not in humanities and social studies. Likewise, following international evidence, being a woman increases the job satisfaction of PhDs employees. Moreover, age, having dependents at home or a permanent contract has a positive effect on employees' satisfaction. However, the presence of over-education or overqualification creates dissatisfaction in line with international evidence. The latter is also true for seniority. Finally, civil status has a bearing on satisfaction: compared to being single, married women are more satisfied than married men, whereas this is the opposite in the case of being widow or divorced. In this context, the analysis of Di Paolo (2012)  Each of these items is assessed with a Likert type scale, ranging from 1, for none satisfaction, to 4 in those cases the worker feel highly satisfied. In order to validate the internal consistency of this construct we compute the Cronbachs' alpha. For the basic satisfaction this composite scale was 0.68. For motivational satisfaction the scale reliability was 0.73. These values are similar to the one reported by Canal-Dominguez and Wall (2013) for their definition of overall satisfaction, which was 0.68, and they are considered as acceptable in the literature (see Rosenthal et al. 2000;Malhotra, 2010). In addition to these composite scales, the Survey on Human Resources in Science and Technology included a question about overall job satisfaction in 2009. This is an important difference respect to the previous edition because it gives the possibility to compare differences between the determinants of overall, basic and motivational job satisfaction. Previous empirical literature uses both, single and multiple-item to measure job satisfaction, although, in general, comparative analysis between them recommends the use of the later. Wanous et al. (1997), perform a meta-analysis to assess single-item measure for job satisfaction and recommend the use of multiple-item scales, based on their internal reliability. More recently, after comparing single versus multiple-item of job satisfaction, Oshagbemi (2006) indicates that \"single item measure tend to exaggerate the results obtained for satisfaction while their underestimate results obtained for dissatisfied workers and those who show indifference\" (pp. 398-399). However, he also concludes that \"where possible both single as well as multiple measures of job satisfaction should be used in the same study\" (p. 401). Given that data at hand provides the possibility to do this, single and multiple-item are used in the estimation. The survey uncovers several individual characteristics of doctorate holders as well as some aspects related to doctorate training and labor conditions. In order to identify determinants of basic, motivational and total satisfaction in doctorate holders we consider seven categories of variables (see all descriptives in Table A1 in the annex). We analyze all data displayed in terms of basic, motivational and overall job satisfaction. As it is shown in Table 1, men are more satisfied than women in overall satisfaction, although this difference is not statistically significant. Moreover, men are also more satisfied in all types of elements composing the scale of basic satisfaction (except in the case of salaries where men and female report the same level). With regards to motivational satisfaction, when differences are statistically significant, men are more satisfied in terms of career opportunities and job autonomy. By employment sector, doctorate holders working in the university are more satisfied in most of elements in both basic and motivational satisfaction. Those working outside the university have higher levels of satisfaction only in salary and fringe benefits (basic satisfaction) and responsibility (motivational satisfaction). Our analysis also considers gender by employment sector. At the university, males are more satisfied in terms of basic satisfaction but motivational satisfaction is more evenly distributed by gender. Ne employed outside the university are more satisfied than women when basic satisfaction is considered but there are hardly differences with regards to motivational satisfaction. (Insert Table 1)"}, {"section_title": "Econometric strategy", "text": "We have three measures for job satisfaction. Two of them correspond to the scales created to assess basic and motivational satisfaction (as previously described), and one comes from a specific question about overall job satisfaction in the questionnaire. In the cases of basic and motivational satisfaction, both indexes are arithmetic means of different variables, being continuous variables. We propose Ordinary Least Squares regression to identify the determinants of basic and motivational satisfaction at job. In addition, considering the ordered response for the variable overall job satisfaction, an ordered logit model is estimated in this case, as in previous similar studies (Bender & Heywood, 2006;Mohr & Zoghi, 2014;Ward & Sloane, 2000). In total, we propose the following estimations. First, three models to identify determinants of overall, basic and motivational satisfaction taking the whole sample. Second, estimations by gender considering only the subsample of doctorate holders working at universities, using overall, basic and motivational satisfaction as dependent variable. Third, estimation by gender using the subsample of those who do not work at universities. According to this, three model specifications are formulated (see equations 1 to 3): . = 0 + 1 1 . + 2 2 . + 3 3 + 4 4 . + (1) . ( ) = 0 + 1 1 . + 2 2 . + 3 3 + 4 4 . + (2) . ( . ) = 0 + 1 1 . + 2 2 . + 3 3 + 4 4 . + 5 5 + Following these specifications, job satisfaction is analyzed for the total sample of doctorate "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Tables 2 to 4 show the determinants of PhD holders' satisfaction. In each table the analysis considers the determinants of overall, basic and motivational satisfaction by gender. Table 2 considers the entire sample, Table 3 includes only employees working at University, and Table 4 those employed elsewhere. As indicated in the previous section, in overall satisfaction ordered logit estimations are considered, taking \"low level of satisfaction\" as base for comparison, whereas the analysis of the determinants of basic and motivational satisfaction follows OLS estimations. Table 2 shows the results for the whole sample. With regards to individual characteristics, only one of the variables is significant (married men), and at 10%, in one of the six regressions, so we can conclude that these type of variables are not significant determining job satisfaction. The same applies to doctoral training variables since most variables are not statistically significant. However, most labor conditions have a bearing on job satisfaction. Thus, the higher the wage level the higher the level of overall, basic and motivational satisfaction in both men and women employees. whereas having a full time job is significant only for females. Finally, there are hardly differences between types of satisfaction (overall, basic or motivational) in those variables expected to have a special incidence in basic satisfaction (those related to income and basic needs, as pointed out by Maslow, such as type of contract, hours worked, and workday). However, variables related to motivational satisfaction hardly affects basic motivation. Table 3 consider only those working at the University. Similar to the general case, hardly individual and doctoral training characteristics are statistically significant. With regards to labor conditions, results are the following. The influence of wages is less clear in the case of university sector (especially in overall and motivational satisfaction). As regard to permanent contract, it has a positive effect in satisfaction for both male and female in the case of overall and basic satisfaction. The number of weekly hours reduces all kind of satisfaction but only for men. Full-time job is significant especially in the case of basic satisfaction. The relation of job with doctoral studies is significant positively only in the case of high relation (and especially in the case of male doctorate holders). No effect of mismatch education and qualification is found, since it is difficult that this is the case in PhDs working at university."}, {"section_title": "Results in", "text": "With respect to variables related with the academic job position, being professor increases all type of satisfaction, but this occurs only in the case of male doctorate holders. Moreover, being supervisor of Master or PhD thesis increase motivational satisfaction in men. As for the whole sample, residence in some regions is also significant. For university employees, these are (positive sign compared to Catalonia): Castile-La Mancha and Navarre. Results on doctorate holders not working at the University are displayed in Table 4. Again, estimations show few differences with previous analyses with respect to individual characteristics and doctoral training. Labor conditions are more relevant. In comparison with previous estimations, results in Table 4 show that wages have a bearing on satisfaction similar to the one described for the whole sample. Thus, this variable is more relevant than for those employed at the University sector: low wages reduce significantly the three types of satisfaction in men and women. High wages increase satisfaction (especially in the case of male doctorate holders). Permanent contract increases satisfaction (especially overall and basic). Full time job also increases job satisfaction (especially the basic one). As in previous cases, the number of hours worked reduce satisfaction. The grade of relation between doctoral studies and work is again significant. However, it mainly increases motivational satisfaction. Results for educative and qualification mismatch confirm, in certain manner, those found for the total sample: overqualified women have lower levels of motivational satisfaction, whereas . In our study we analyze whether they also have a higher level of job satisfaction. In this analysis, job satisfaction follows Maslow's typology and the subsequent revision of Herzberg. Maslow (1943, 1954) establishes a hierarchy of needs (in the shape of a pyramid). From top to bottom, these are esteem (self-actualization and recognition), affection, safety, and physiological needs. Maslow points out that the most basic level of needs (safety, and physiological needs) must be met before the individual will strongly desire the secondary or higher level needs. In this context, Herzberg (1968) adds a dual approach by which the lack of achievement of lower order needs (in Maslow's typology) generates dissatisfaction but their achievement do not motivate. The latter is only achieved when higher-level needs (related to the job itself) are satisfied. Thus, in the study we analyze the determinants of satisfaction of doctorate holders in Spain. Specifically, we consider overall job satisfaction as well as basic and motivational satisfaction following Herzberg's typology. The analysis is carried out for the whole sample as well as considering gender and work sector (university or elsewhere). The analysis carried out shows several interesting results. Thus, when the whole sample is considered the variables that may be related with basic motivation (salary, type of contract and workday) have a bearing, with the expected signs, on both basic and motivational job satisfaction (as well as overall satisfaction). However, the variables that may be related to motivational satisfaction affect mainly this type of job satisfaction. Thus it seems that the differentiation between basic and motivational satisfaction is not so clear in the case of the former for Spain, since wages and labor stability increase all type of job satisfaction among Spanish employees. Results do not show significant differences by gender. In addition, other variables related to individual characteristics and doctoral training are neither significant. The sample of university employees allow us to conclude that the differentiation between factors related to basic and motivational satisfaction a bit clearer. In this context we highlight the minor role of wages in employees' satisfaction. Moreover, variables related to mismatch are not significant (as it is expected in PhD holders working at the University). In this context, some 'motivational variables' related to status and mastery, such as being professor and PhD advisor, increase males' motivational satisfaction (as well as basic satisfaction in the case of the former). The sample of employees not working at the university shows a relevant role of wages to increase all types of satisfaction (as for the whole sample). In general, results are more similar than those for the whole sample (as expected since almost 60% of all employees work outside the university). The rest of variables (personal and related to training) are hardly significant in both subsamples, as this is the case for the whole sample. Likewise, no significant differences by gender are found in any subsample.  Purcell and Sisson (1983) terminology as in other European countries. Factors related to basic needs seem to be less relevant for those working at the University.    "}]
