There are presently no approved pharmacological treatments that can stop the progression of AD. Treatment is likely to be most effective during the preclinical or early prodromal stages of AD, before substantial permanent neurodegenerative and cognitive damage has occurred. Therefore, there has been considerable recent interest in measures to identify older adults at highest risk for progression to AD who may benefit most from early intervention [2, 3] .\nAdults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in the presence of normal neuropsychological test scores are at an increased risk of progression to AD. These adults have been shown to progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventually AD or a related dementia at a higher rate than cognitively normal (CN) adults who do not have SCD [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Adults with SCD also show subtle, subclinical differences in objective cognitive performance compared to adults without SCD and experience more functional decline over time [9] . Therefore, it has been suggested that SCD is potentially a preclinical stage of AD [9] . However, SCD has also been linked to depression, other affective disorders, and personality traits [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, it is necessary to determine the factors that influence the clinical and prognostic significance of SCD.\nIn addition to capturing self-based estimates of SCD, investigators often also assess the extent of concerns about cognitive decline from an informant (spouse, child, other caregiver, or clinician). Informant-based cognitive concerns are particularly important in the later stages of cognitive decline, when individuals' insight into their own cognitive problems diminishes and informant perceptions of cognition are more accurate [12, 14, 15] . In CN adults, however, selfand informant perceptions of cognitive decline are both predictive of future progression to MCI or AD, and the use of both measures together is a better predictor than either measure alone [5] . This finding suggests that, in very early stages of disease, both at-risk adults and their informants can provide important information about subclinical cognitive decline. Thus, using both sources of concern together may provide complementary information regarding subtle pathological changes in adults in very early preclinical stages of AD.\nMany adults with SCD exhibit structural and pathological changes that are typically associated with MCI or AD. For example, adults with SCD show patterns of neurodegeneration, such as decreased gray matter and hippocampal volumes, that are similar to those seen in adults with MCI [16] [17] [18] . Similarly, some adults with SCD and early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) show AD-related pathology, such as amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles that are similar to those observed in AD (decreased levels of amyloid and increased levels of total and phosphorylated tau; [19] [20] [21] ). Adults with SCD or EMCI who also show AD-like pathology are more likely to progress to later stages of MCI or AD [21, 22] .\nTau aggregation is an important biomarker of disease severity along the spectrum of preclinical and clinical stages of AD. It has been previously established from measurements of tau in CSF and postmortem studies of brain tissue that tau aggregation correlates with both neurodegeneration and the resultant cognitive decline temporally and spatially during progression of AD [23, 24] . The recent development of tau-specific radiotracers has allowed in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) measurement and visualization of the spatial distribution of tau aggregation for the first time [25] . Tau radiotracers have permitted in vivo correlation of tau aggregation and other markers of disease progression, including increased cognitive decline, amyloid deposition, and CSF measures of amyloid and tau [26] . Spatial information about the tau anatomical distribution has also been shown to provide important clinical information; brain regions with high levels of tau aggregation often correspond to declines in cognitive functions related to those regions [27] .\nBecause tau aggregation correlates spatially with brain areas implicated in cognitive decline, it is possible that self-based memory concerns correlate more strongly with tau aggregation in brain regions involved in introspection or internal thought processes, for example, the medial prefrontal cortex. More generally, the frontal cortex has been implicated in several aspects of conscious internal processing, such as planning, decision-making, and inhibition of actions by thinking through consequences. It is possible that preclinical pathological changes in frontal brain regions would be noticeable to the patient before causing outward changes in behavior due to impacts on the processes of internal thought. On the other hand, informant memory concerns may correlate more strongly with tau aggregation in brain regions typically seen in patients with MCI and AD, as these may be involved in common initial symptoms of AD (i.e., memory decline) that are more likely to be noticed by an observer.\nTo determine how self-and informant perceptions of cognitive decline are each related to tau deposition in the early stages of AD, we assessed the relationship between self-and informant scores on the memory subscale of the Test of Everyday Cognition (ECog; [28] ), as well as the association of each with regional and global tau aggregation as measured by the tau PET radiotracer [ 18 F]flortaucipir (T-807; AV-1451). Our goal was to evaluate the relationship between self-and informant memory concerns and tau deposition to investigate the biological basis for the predictive power of cognitive concerns and whether the self-and informant concerns could be utilized as part of a screening protocol to assess preclinical AD in individual adults. We included older adults enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who were defined as CN controls, had significant memory concerns (SMCs), or had EMCI. These adults comprise a continuum of risk for developing clinical AD. A subset of the CN older adults are amyloid negative and apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) \u03b54 noncarriers and thus are at risk for AD due to age alone and are on the \"low-risk\" end of the continuum. On the \"high-risk\" end are adults with EMCI who have subtle cognitive decline, presence of self-and informant cognitive concerns, and are amyloid positive and/or APOE \u03b54 carriers. We examined the association of self-and informant ECog memory scores with one another and with tau aggregation in all participants. Following these analyses, we completed a subanalysis using only participants who are amyloid positive because these participants are at a relatively higher risk of developing AD. We hypothesized that self-and informant ECog memory scores would be mildly correlated with one another, and that higher ECog memory scores (indicating greater perceived memory decline) would be associated with increased levels of tau. Finally, we also hypothesized that self-and informant scores would potentially correlate with the distribution of tau aggregation in spatially different patterns of association throughout the brain."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu; Supplementary Material).

We found that self-and informant ECog memory scores are only mildly correlated with one another in atrisk adults and are not correlated with one another in the subset of amyloid-positive adults, suggesting that the two measures of subjective memory complaints may be somewhat independent and provide complementary information. The results from our ROI-based analyses suggest that selfbased memory complaints are most strongly associated with tau aggregation in the frontal lobes, whereas informant memory complaints are most strongly associated with tau aggregation in the parietal lobes. These differences in patterns of correlation were enhanced when only amyloidpositive participants were included, and significant sourceby-region interactions were found in both the full analysis and the subanalysis of amyloid-positive individuals. There were no correlations found when only amyloid-negative participants were included, suggesting that the patterns of association found are specifically present in adults at higher risk for developing AD, which supports the idea that these subjective memory tools may be useful for optimizing screening techniques in the population of at-risk adults. In addition to our regional analyses, we evaluated the associations with voxelwise analyses to lessen the bias imposed by our predetermined ROIs. Although these analyses revealed regions of overlap between the correlations of tau aggregation with self-and informant memory concerns, they resulted in the same general patterns found with the ROI-based analyses. Specifically, both self-and informant memory concerns were associated with tau aggregation in the frontal and temporal lobes when all participants were included, while the informant memory concerns were also associated with tau aggregation in posterior brain regions, including the parietal and occipital lobes. When only amyloid-positive participants were included, the self-based memory concerns were significantly associated with tau aggregation in bilateral frontal lobes and the right temporal lobe, while the informant memory concerns were also correlated with tau burden in the left parietal lobe and bilateral occipital lobes.\nOur data suggest that self-based memory concerns correlate more strongly with tau aggregation in regions typical of conscious internal thought processes (i.e., frontal lobe, specifically the medial prefrontal region), while informant memory concerns correlate more strongly with tau aggregation in posterior regions typical of more progressed MCI and AD patients. These posterior regions may be involved with the more outward signs of cognitive decline that can be noticed by an observer who knows the individual well. In support of this implication of our results, the voxelwise analysis revealed that only self-based memory concerns were correlated with tau aggregation in the bilateral anterior cingulate, while only informant memory concerns were correlated with tau aggregation in the supramarginal gyri. The anterior cingulate has been shown to be involved in decision-making [32] , while the supramarginal gyrus is involved in language perception and processing [33] . While correlations within these specific brain regions are interesting, future research focused on the relationship between subjective memory concerns and regional pathology will be necessary to confirm the relationships that we observe here.\nBecause both self-based cognitive complaints and pathological changes in the frontal lobe have been shown to be correlated with depression [7, 10, 11, 34] , we used GDS scores as a covariate along with age, sex, and years of education to ensure that depressive symptomology was not a confound in the observed correlations. The inclusion of this score as a covariate did not significantly change the patterns of association; the self-based memory concerns were still significantly correlated to tau in the frontal region (data not shown). Individuals' depressive symptoms have been shown to increase informant-based cognitive complaints in other studies as well [15, 35] , but the pattern of association between informant based memory concerns and tau was not changed when GDS scores were used as a covariate (data not shown). It is still possible that some of the participants experienced subtle depressive symptoms that were not reflected in the GDS scores but still influenced their perceptions of their own cognitive functioning. Future studies exploring the interactions between depression, cognitive concerns, and AD pathophysiology are warranted.\nOverall, our findings suggest that subjective memory concerns have the potential to be optimized and used as part of a screening protocol for AD-related pathology and disease progression in adults with preclinical or prodromal stages of AD. Along with the differing regions of tau association between the two measures of subjective memory concern, this finding suggests that using both self-and informant measures together may provide important complementary information, such that high scores on both measures may suggest a greater overall tau burden in the brain. Finally, these results provide a potential biological explanation for the previous finding that using self-and informant memory concerns together is a better predictor of future progression to MCI or AD than either measure alone [5] .\nThis study does have some potential limitations. First, our sample size, especially in the amyloid-positive subanalysis, was relatively small, which could lead to bias. Although we included all available CN, SMC, and EMCI participants in ADNI-2 who had tau scans at the time of our analyses, we recognize that the CN group had more APOE \u03b54 carriers than expected in the general population and that the amyloid positivity surprisingly did not differ between the diagnostic groups. Second, we also acknowledge that there may have been unforeseen selection bias in the ADNI-2 study. Future studies in larger samples will help to support the present findings. In addition, the SMC group from ADNI-2 was defined on the basis of subjective-or self-based memory complaints but not informant-based concerns. Therefore, there was not a group in this study for participants who had solely informant-based complaints in the context of normal or above average cognitive functioning. Third, this study only evaluated cross-sectional data; future studies with longitudinal data are needed to address changes in self-and informant concerns across the disease spectrum and their association with changes in AD pathophysiology. Evaluating whether CN individuals who later progress to AD show different patterns of self-and/or informant cognitive concerns and differing patterns of association of these concerns with AD pathology could further validate quantitative assessment of memory concerns as a useful screening tool. Finally, we used Talairach Daemon to define the brain regions from our voxelwise analysis. Although this atlas is not specific to our study or to an aging population, we felt that it was the most appropriate tool to use in this case. A standardized atlas specific for older adults has not been defined in the literature, and our small sample size kept us from producing our own study-specific atlas. We do not expect that extensive atrophy should confound the results of the Talairach Daemon atlas in our preclinical AD population, and we visually inspected labeled regions for accuracy. However, we acknowledge that use of this nonspecific atlas may have caused minor labeling issues in our aging participants.\nIn summary, we demonstrated that both self-and informant memory concerns are associated with tau aggregation in adults at risk for AD. Furthermore, we found that self-and informant memory concerns correlate with tau aggregation in spatially different patterns of association throughout the brain. Overall, these findings suggest that both self-and informant memory concerns have the potential to be used as part of a screening process for preclinical AD and that they may also provide complementary information about both future conversion and AD-related pathological patterns. Although future studies are needed, it may be the case that the discrepancy between self-and informant memory concerns could help determine the location of tau aggregation for individuals, thus adding information for better detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of future decline. Future studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal data will help to further elucidate which measures of perceived cognitive decline and which patterns of tau aggregation are most accurate at predicting progression to AD."}]
