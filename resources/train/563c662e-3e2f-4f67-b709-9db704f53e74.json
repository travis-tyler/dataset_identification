[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Both in the aims of the Lisbon strategy and the development plans for EU Member States (including Estonia), the movement towards a knowledge-based and innovative economy is emphasized. Therefore, the role of science in the organization of society is becoming increasingly important. Accordingly, the role of individuals with academic degrees (primarily those with a PhD) in society will start to grow in the future, and it is important to change the stereotypical public opinion that PhDs are exclusively needed in the academic sector to fill professorships. Individuals with academic degrees are needed both in public and private sector institutions that undertake analytical work (including, for instance, economic analysis or the estimation of environmental impacts) because the presence of the doctoral degree assumes a command of the analytical tools of the respective area. The demand for doctorates 2 originates thus both from the academic, public and private sector. Earlier statistics and studies have shown that most of the graduates of doctoral programmes start working in the academic sector (medical specialists are an exception) 3 . For instance, in the US in 2003, 47% of all doctoral scientists and engineers worked in educational institutions, 31% in the business sector and 16% in central and local government (National Science Foundation, 2003). In other countries, the share of PhDs working in the academic sector is even higher 4 . Proceeding from that, earlier studies have asserted that the most important (and growing) share of the demand for scientists comes from the academic sector and that will be so also in the future (Boddy, 1962). However, more recent studies point out growth in the demand for doctorates in the private sector (Cruz-Castro and Sanz-Menendez, 2005). Similarly, in Estonia most of the doctors engaged in research and development activities (hereinafter also R&D) 5 are employed in the higher education sector (in 2003, 82%). Another 10% were employed in the state sector, 6% in business and 1% in the non-profit private sector. That is also reflected in the survey of Estonian PhD students where 74% of respondents indicated that \"Orientation towards an academic career\" was a reason for starting doctoral studies; perhaps as expected, that reason was more important in the humanities and less important in the technical sciences (Puura et al, 2004). Similarly, most PhD students associated their future career with the academic sector and during their studies already 74% worked either in higher education or research institutions. Though PhDs are of crucial importance for research and higher education, their exact demand is hard to predict because many factors impacting it (educational and R&D policy decisions, technological changes, etc) are either hard to predict or fundamentally unpredictable. Balancing PhD supply and demand might be complicated due to the long period of time needed to obtain a PhD degree, and this complicates the adoption of supply to meet the demand. A shortage of staff with a doctoral degree may adversely affect the quality of teaching, but even more importantly, the amount and quality of research. Higher teaching loads may reduce research productivity, larger classes may decrease interaction between students and professors, increased retirement ages can also have a negative impact (Basil and Basil, 2006). We are convinced that based on previous studies the total demand for doctorates can be divided into three basic components -firstly, research and development institutions and higher education institutions, both in the public and private sectors; secondly, the rest of the public sector; and thirdly, the rest of the private sector, which in our context signifies mostly business activities. This paper focuses on the first component 6 . The aim of the current paper is to estimate the need for new PhDs in the academic sector of Estonia, a small country in Eastern Europe with a catching-up economy, over the 5-year period 2007-2012. Our estimations will be based on a survey of employers, such as universities, institutions of applied higher education and research institutes. The demand for PhDs may come either from the necessity to replace faculty leaving due to retirements or other reasons, or the growing level of employment of PhDs. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we aim to evaluate the usefulness of the surveys of employers for predicting the demand for PhDs. While the advantage of such an approach is that the respondents have lots of inside information about developments in their sector, the disadvantage of such a survey is very subjective nature of the answers and the answers being dependent on the particular person interviewed. Secondly, the existing studies seem to be exclusively made in highly developed countries and there is not much information on PhDs in developing and transition countries. Eastern-European transition economies face many common challenges, such as the ageing of academic staff in higher education, and need to increase the current low levels of research and development expenditure and restructure their economies in order sustain competitiveness in the context of a vanishing low labour cost advantage. Thirdly, we will estimate whether the targets set in national policy documents for the PhD defences match the actual needs of the academic sector 7 . The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section reviews existing literature on the demand for PhDs; here we mostly focus on the need for PhDs in the academic sector. However, we also pay attention to the more general issues of PhD employment. The third section provides background information for the study by presenting the main trends in research and higher education policy in Estonia. The fourth section describes our research methods and data, and the fifth section presents the results. The final section concludes with policy implications."}, {"section_title": "Overview of the literature on the demand for PhDs", "text": "Discussions surrounding the future demand for PhD holders and the current and future imbalance of their supply and demand have been around for several decades. Regardless, there is so far no consensus on the appropriate methodological approach to the problem and thus studies employ methods varying from econometric models to interviews, questionnaires and informal discussions of factors affecting the supply and demand of doctorates. Considering the huge variety of fields within the scientific sphere and breadth of the labour market for PhD holders, most of the studies concentrate either on particular fields 8 or a particular part of the labour market -public sector, academic sector or private sector. Due to the high concentration of doctorates in the academic sector, the largest number of studies deals with that sector. Many studies have also focused more broadly on the category of scientists and engineers or the total staff working on R&D instead of singling out PhDs. Interest in predicting PhD supply and demand first emerged in the 1950s in the US (Forecasting demand\u20262000). In fact, almost all papers analyse PhD supply and demand in one country. The concern and motivation for many studies is the possible undersupply of PhDs, and most studies discuss a potential deficit rather than the overproduction of PhD holders. It has been found that the US labour market for doctorates is characterized by huge fluctuations and imbalances of supply and demand. One of the reasons for this could be the long period of time needed to obtain a PhD degree, which complicates take up according to demand; lengthy training periods for PhDs may lead to varying spells of over-supply and undersupply (cob-web) 9 . Concerning the causes for the shortage of doctorates, it is also argued in the literature that the production of PhD's might be a financial loss for schools, thus the situation emerges of the tragedy of commons where they are not interested in producing PhDs (Basil and Basil, 2006). An example of overproduction can be drawn again from the US, where in the 1980s many students started their PhD studies on the basis of prognoses that expected great numbers available academic positions due to retirements. In reality, these developments did not take place and the overproduction resulted in lower wages for new doctorates in the labour market. Another reason for overproduction might be that PhD students frequently create additional value for the faculty and the university by engaging in research and other obligations, so the problem of overproduction is very sensitive because universities often need to have PhD students even if there is not a matching demand in the labour market (Jones, 2002-03). Another factor is that producing PhDs might help stimulate further demand for research (McIver Consulting, 2004). Both under and oversupply might be costly (as we described in the introduction). However, forecasting in this market is not easy. While some factors are relatively easy to predict (demographic changes), some others, such as future technological changes are quite difficult to predict (Forecasting demand\u20262000). Given that, Leslie and Oaxaca (1993) summarized that the literature seems to imply that forecasting models are of questionable value in the longer term, and thus it is necessary to understand the factors behind the supply and demand for scientist and engineers. Also, there are no forecasts, but rather projections (predictions conditional on assumptions regarding future economic and labour market conditions). Often, the relative shortage or over-supply is analyzed using indicators like relative wages, vacancies, unemployment rates, field of employment, etc. (Borthwick and Murphy, 1998;PhDs in Finland\u2026 2003). Due to the characteristics of the academic and business sector, the approaches used to estimate PhD demand differ. In the academic sector, PhD demand results mainly from the retirement of the older generation on the one hand, and on the other hand from future developments in research and higher education financing by the public and private sector (Pauli and Savunen, 2004). One classic paper on PhD demand in the academic sector is the study by Cartter (1966) on the supply and demand of instructors in higher education institutions in the USA. The total number of necessary lecturers can be expressed through the number of students (enrolment) and the inverse of the student-lecturer ratio 10 . His model consisted of the independent forecast of the number of undergraduate students and new doctors, the assumed ratio of students to instructors, the assumed percentage of new teachers with PhD, and the presumable replacement rate to correct for deaths, retirements and movements to other sectors 11 . The main drawback of that approach is that the only determinant of changes in the faculty size is changes in enrolment 12 , and other factors like R&D activities are ignored (Shapiro 2001). Another drawback was the focus on full-time PhD holding faculty positions while many faculties were also employing part-time faculty and graduate students as instructors. Later, that approach was also used by Hermanson and Miles (1976) to study the supply and demand of PhDs in accounting. Cartter (1971) studied the demand for academics in economics in the US during 1957-1985 by using analogous factors -demographic developments (changes in size of the age cohort 18-21), the desired percentage of academic staff with a PhD and the need to replace deaths and retirements. The advantage of the study by Hansen et al (1980) over previous approaches was the involvement of wages as a market adjustment mechanism. The study modelled and forecasted the labour market for doctorate economists in the US by looking at the supply and demand of doctorate economists in the public sector on the one hand and admission and graduation figures on the other. The demand for new PhD holders was set to be dependent on wages, the number of students, national research grants in economics and different national and state level costs (R&D costs, defence costs). Thus, most studies have distinguished between replacement demand and growth demand. The first includes new PhDs to replace retirements, deaths and net movements between academia and other jobs. The results of different studies have shown that the most significant component of replacement demand results from the need to replace retirements; the demand to replace deaths and net movements between academia and other jobs form a rather modest share (Campbell et al, 1990); thus, data about the age structure of PhD holders has been used to study the retirement demand component. The growth demand is equal to the change in the total number of PhDs employed. Growth demand has been assumed to follow past growth demand (Campbell et al, 1990), but at the same time should consider demographic factors (e.g. smaller growth of students because of the end of the baby boom generation at the beginning of 90s), employment costs, changes in required student-to-lecturer ratios, pressure on academics to publish more which inevitably leaves less time for teaching and other fieldspecific factors. Both supply and demand of PhDs are also affected by international mobility; which, however, cancels out at the world level. It has been stated that one of the major faults of discussions of the demand for PhDs has been the lack of consideration of the backlog of demand. Backlog of demand results when, at some point in time, the shortage of labour force has emerged, meaning that the demand exceeds the supply cumulatively and gaining a balance takes more time. Similarly, there could also be a backlog of supply if the PhDs who could not find employment in the academic sector in previous periods return to the academic labour market (Shapiro 2001). Although traditionally, the academic sector has been the greatest employer of PhDs, the share in the private sector is growing. In the private sector, PhDs are first of all needed in R&D activities; however, what is important is also the mobility of PhDs between science and industry, and not only their employment level at some point in time 13 . The analyses of PhD holders in the private sector have concentrated on the industry. Bosworth (1981) modelled the demand for qualified scientists and engineers in the UK manufacturing industry by assuming that qualified scientists and engineers are employed in four different functions: 1) production, 2) R&D, 3) installing and testing new technologies, and 4) advertising and marketing. The empirical results showed rather low levels of elasticity of substitution for scientists and engineers on the one hand, and other inputs on the other implying that entrepreneurs face difficulties in replacing scientists and engineers with less qualified labour. The demand for scientists and engineers was expectedly most sensitive to R&D costs. The results from Mace and Taylor's (1975) assessment of the demand for engineers in UK firms via interviews with large companies revealed by contrast that engineers positions were filled by employees with different qualifications and qualified engineers were not necessarily working in positions in accordance with their profession. McIver Consulting (2004)  In addition to general macro models, methods based on questionnaires and interviews of people in institutions (universities, government agencies, private firms), job candidates, as well as expert opinions have been used to find out the demand for PhD holders (Freeman et al, 2000;Shawver, 1973;PhDs in Finland\u2026 2003 etc). The advantage of these methods is their consideration of real situations and future trends since the individuals working in the field routinely have the best insight into the matter. Expert opinions can, however, be at the same time too subjective, be based on untested assumptions or incline towards the expert's favourable direction. In order to avoid this, a consensus of opinions from an expert group (so called Delphi method) has sometimes been used. The forecasts of the demand for qualified scientists and engineers based on interviews with employers have also been criticized for not revealing the reasons behind the decisions made by firms, and the lack of information on the sensitivity of demand within the firms towards changes in economic conditions (Bosworth,13 For knowledge and skills to be able to move between the academic and industrial sphere, in addition to scientific publications, datasets and computer programs, people also need to be mobile. Part of the knowledge (so-called tacit knowledge, cf. codified knowledge) is always attached to the individuals through their competences and experience. Therefore, the location and mobility of the competence become very important in analyses of technology transfer, especially between universities and enterprises. (Lanciano-Morandat and Nohara 2004). The positions of PhD holders in firms give vital information about which type of knowledge obtained in universities are applied and which university-industry networks are created (Sumell et al, 2005). 1981). Informal analyses of different assumptions have also been used to forecast the demand for PhD holders. Assumptions are made about possible factors affecting employment in fields with a high concentration of scientists and engineers and the factors influencing the share of scientists and engineers in branches of industry (Braddock, 1992). Another method for analysing demand in the private sector is benchmarking. In that case, a country is chosen to serve as an example that is considered to be the desired target considering future developments, and the respective indexes or employment/graduation coefficients are then projected for the country under observation. The limitation of this approach is that there are no two identical countries. The volume and the quality of data available for researchers as well as the experience of analysis in this field vary significantly between countries. Most of the studies conducted on the demand for PhD holders originate from the US. The reason for this is the decades of data collection on the subject there including surveys like the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) 14 . In the UK, the first studies on the demand for scientists and engineers were carried out in 1950s (Godin, 2002), in other countries it was later. Aside from the study of PhD supply and demand, research has also been conducted on the labour market for young scientists (see Recotillet (2003) for databases and research made in Europe on that topic), young scientist entrance into the labour market shortly after graduation (like the \"What Do PhDs Do\" study in the UK, UK GRAD Programme (2006)) 15 , the international mobility of highly qualified labour and factors affecting (see Brain Drain -Brain Gain (2002) for Germany; see Auriol (2007) for an international comparison of OECD countries). The labour-market performance of PhDs in various fields differs as well. Based on the US National Science Foundation different aspects in the employment of doctorates of different fields have also been found. For example, in 1999, after 1-3 years of working experience, doctorates of physics, astronomy and mathematics experienced more involuntary inactivity than others. Physics and biology doctorates were most frequently in post-doctorate positions and doctorates of political science had the highest unemployment and inactivity rates (Jones, 2002-03). According to Pauli and Savunen (2004), doctorates in technology, medicine and natural sciences have been the most successful in finding employment in Finland. Various indicators have been used for the comparison of the success of the doctorates of different fields. For example, high numbers of doctorates of discouraged status in the labour market and in post-doctorate positions have been seen as an indication of the difficulty of finding jobs. However, both of these indicators can be interpreted in several subjective ways (Jones, 2002-03)."}, {"section_title": "Science policy, higher education policy and PhD employment in Estonia", "text": "The total employment of PhDs is certainly connected to total expenditure on research and  (Reid, Walendowski, 2006); this is due to the rather high level of economic growth in Estonia during recent years. Increases in government expenditure have remained significantly below target (Reid, Walendowski, 2006) 17 . Although the ratio of business R&D to GDP is growing (in 2000 0.15, in 2005 0.44%), it is still almost 3 times lower than the EU15 (1.22% of GDP). Thus, a relatively lower proportion of R&D expenditure is made by 16 For instance, Kobayashi (1999) found for Japan a strong positive relationship between the number of researchers in the private sector and the private sector R&D expenditure as a proportion to Gross National Product. 17 The reasons might be that the EU structural funds replaced Estonian government funding but they were not added to the former; national technology programmes in the key sectors have not been launched; the financing has been based of the results of the annual negotiations instead of following the targets set in R&D strategy (Knowledge Based Estonia 2007-2013, 2006. businesses (though in recent years business expenditure has grown faster than government expenditure). Compared to R&D funding, funding for higher education relative to GDP in Estonia is much closer to the EU average. According to Eurostat, total public expenditure on tertiary level higher education was 1.05% in Estonia in 2003, the EU-25 average was 1.15%. Again, neighbouring countries Sweden and Finland are far ahead (in Finland 2.05%, in Sweden"}, {"section_title": "2.16% of GDP).", "text": "In all countries of the world, PhDs constitute a rather small proportion of the total workforce. According to the census in 2000, there were at the age group of 25-64 years 1,906 persons with a PhD or equivalent degree, or 2.7 doctorates per thousand; that is a relatively low number if compared to countries like the USA (8.4), Canada (6.5) or Germany (15.4) (Auriol, 2007). The number of those in the economically active population was 2264 and those employed, 2237. The unemployment rate for PhDs was remarkably low compared to other educational levels. While the general level for unemployment was 13.9%, among those with a higher education, 5.1%, among those with a masters degree it was 1.9% and among the doctors a mere 1.2% in 2000 18 . This indicates the good performance of PhDs on the labour market. It has also been observed elsewhere that unemployment among PhDs is much lower compared to national averages; however, the Estonian numbers are also low in comparison with international figures 19 . Similarly PhDs are also characterized by a relatively low rate of inactivity (in 2000 20%; in OECD countries in the range of 7-23 %, Auriol, 2007). Another observation is that unemployment among PhDs is relatively unrelated to unemployment in the general population, and is less dependent on business cycles and macro-economic fluctuations (Shettle, 1997). Although we can't construct a time series for PhD unemployment in Estonia, the same should also hold for Estonia given that unemployment among the general population was as high as 13.9% in 2000 following the economic downturn in 1999 caused by the economic crises in Russia. In 2000, PhDs constituted about 0.4% of the total workforce in Estonia; concerning other countries, the percentage was 1% in USA, 2.8% in Switzerland and 2% in Germany (Auriol, 2007). PhDs were employed mostly in education (45%), research and development (20%) and public services (17%, see also Figure 1). In the non R&D business sector there were 17% of PhDs employed. Also these facts plus some anecdotal evidence from other former post-soviet countries tell us that due to low wages many promising PhD holders have left the academic sector and moved to the private sector. Given also the relatively low share of business R&D, the high-proportion of PhDs working in the business sector is thus due to reasons other than their engagement in business R&D."}, {"section_title": "Primary sector 2%", "text": "Education 45% Research-and development 20% Business services 11%"}, {"section_title": "Public services 17%", "text": "Secondary sector 5% Another important indicator of the performance of doctors on the labour market concerns their wages. For Estonia, analysis has been conducted based on income taxes paid on wage income after graduation (Kraut, 2005). The figures showed that the higher the level of higher education obtained, the higher also the sum paid as income tax (and hence wages). Relative to applied higher education, in the 2 nd year after graduation those with a bachelor degree earned 38% more, those with a masters degree 86% more and those with a PhD degree 128% more 20 . Concerning the age structure for doctors, the population is relatively old in Estonia compared to other countries. According to the 2000 census, the share of the population below 45 was 16% and over 55, 62%. Among 6 OECD countries, the USA had the oldest PhD population with 39% above the age of 55 (Auriol, 2007). The Estonian Statistical Office gathers data about employees involved in R&D in various sectors (business sector, non-profit private sector, state sector, higher education sector). In 2004, the total volume of R&D personnel made up 1.32% of the total employment in Estonia; the average for EU-15 was 1.59% and for EU-24 1.49%; the proportion has increased recently in Estonia from 1.08 % in 1998. The proportion of those working in the higher education sector has decreased from 68% in 2002 to 58% in 2005; at the same time the share employed in the business sector has increased from 17% to 28%. There is a remarkable variation in the proportion of PhDs in total R&D personnel -while in the higher education sector 41% had a PhD, then in the state sector only 7% (Table 1). That indicates that on the basis of the same total R&D expenditure at the aggregate level, the higher share in business R&D implies a lower need for PhDs. Concerning other European countries, the share of total R&D personnel employed in higher education was much lower, in 2004 it was 43%. Thus, further growth in the volume of research personnel in Estonia should come from the private sector rather than higher education.  Source: Eurostat. Note. The measures are a ratio of students to academic staff at ISCED levels 5-6. The average for the EU is calculated without Luxembourg, Greece and Denmark, for which the data on academic staff was missing. One particular indicator of the employment of PhDs in the higher education sector is the student-to-teacher ratio. Figure 2 presents these ratios for different European countries. As we can see, the value for Estonia (14.1) is quite close to the average for European Union countries (18.5). Thus, we cannot say that the number of teachers is low relative to students at the aggregate level, though across different disciplines the situation might differ considerably. The measure had the lowest value in Sweden and Germany (12.9) and the highest value in Slovenia (44.6). In the future, the number of students is expected to drop sharply due to demographic changes; although the ageing of population is visible in all developed countries, the changes are especially sharp in the Baltic States (Schlitte, Stiller 2007). A sharp drop in the number of students is foreseen because the sharp drop in birth rates at the beginning of the 90's will very soon be reflected in the size of the 16-18-year age group -forecasted to decrease from 64 thousand in 2003 to 44 thousand in 2010 and 33 thousand in 2015 (PRAXIS 2003). Still it will take a few more years before the impact will be visible on the number of university students. It is our conclusion that many academic staff need to move from teaching to research activities in order to preserve their employment in the academic sector. There was a growth trend in the number of PhD defences in the 90s, when the number of PhD problem by increasing the number of PhD candidates accepted. We will discuss later whether that is an appropriate strategy. Concerning the structure of the Estonian higher education and R&D system, there are currently 11 universities and 20 institutions of applied higher education. To a large extent, PhDs are employed mostly in universities rather than in institutions of applied higher education. The graduate programmes exist in 10 institutions 22 . Many of the formerly independent research institutes (those under the Academy of Sciences) have now been integrated into the universities; although there also still exist some independent research 21 One positive example in this respect was the introduction of doctoral schools in Finland; the first schools were created in 1995 and in 2003 there were already 114 graduate schools with 1,426 student places (PhDs in Finland\u20262003 "}, {"section_title": "Method and data", "text": "Our analysis is based on the opinions of academic institutions about their current and future need for doctorates. Therefore, our study mostly involved analysis of the demand. Actual needs can also be estimated using other methods, such as quantitative models (as we showed in the literature review section). The method we used has both advantages and shortcomings. First of all we obtained direct information from employers actually hiring people with PhD degrees. They provided inside information about developments within the sector, future trends, potential student numbers, etc. Secondly, the majority of PhD holders are working in the academic sector, so we to a large extent covered the labour market for PhD holders. The negative side of such a survey is the very subjective nature of the answers. The quality of the answers depends on the person who responded; if the respondent in particular institutions would have been different, also the answers might have been somewhat different. One question is how realistic are the prognoses and how sustainable are the institutions. The latter point mostly concerns small private institutions that entered the market recently. For example, the Estonian demographic situation is worsening, and the number of students will decline in the future (see last section). At the same time, many private schools did not see the declining number of students as a problem; also, they did not plan any increase in research activities at the same time. But they all saw an increase in the demand for PhD holders. The information was gathered from the institutions using a form where questions were mostly with given answer choices (a few open-ended questions were included as well). There were 115 structural units interviewed, including 20 R&D institutions and 95 higher education institutions (see also  The proportion varies greatly across fields and is lower among the real-and technical sciences. The proportion being higher than 100% in medical sciences as well as in the humanities is possible because, firstly, our data is on the basis of head counts, while the statistical office data considers full-time equivalent employees and in the latter source only the work-time devoted to research and development activities is taken into account; thus, for example, instructors need to divide their working time between research and teaching. Secondly, medical science institutions, for example, also employ researchers from fields other than medicine, such as biology, physics, etc. Thus, it is only a rather rough estimation of how representative our sample is. Still, we may infer that we have succeeded to cover most of the population. In the category of doctorates, we included all those who had a doctoral degree or any other academic degree that has been assigned an equivalent status. In our case, the latter category included mostly those with a candidate degree ( The survey of the academic sector was undertaken in the spring of 2006. The data gathering procedure was as follows. At first the survey was sent to the respondents by e-mail and was followed by a face-to-face interview, if necessary. The individuals interviewed were sometimes the heads of the institutions, for instance, in smaller institutions; in larger institutions, such as universities, the leaders of subdivisions (departments or faculties) were interviewed ( Table 3). The respondents were not employees of the personnel department, but individuals managing the institution or the department, so we can assume they had some idea about future developments or the future prospects of the institution. Although we directly interviewed only one person in each of the institutions, in many cases the questions were discussed with several individuals within the institutions and thus the answers reflected the collective opinion of the staff. In our study, our analysis was made across four scientific fields. These are the social sciences, humanities, real and technical sciences, and medical sciences. Such a distribution is in compliance with the classifiers of the scientific disciplines (Frascati Manual 2002. A similar division is also used by the University of Tartu, the largest university in Estonia. Next we will say a few words about the quality of our survey. One possible factor affecting the results might be self-selection: the institutions that have the greatest shortage of PhDs, might also be more willing to respond to the survey than those that do not need (or do not want) to hire additional doctorates (Basil and Basil, 2006). Some other problems were revealed from the feedback by the institutions refusing to fill in the questionnaire. For instance, one research institution claimed it is not possible to answer questions on vacancies, mobility, and so on, because the staff are not employed permanently, but for specific projects. Some institutions of applied higher education claimed they have no need for doctors because of the lack of master level curricula. Most of the respondents were, however, quite cooperative. The total demand for doctorates has been decomposed as follows (see also Table 4). Firstly, we distinguished the replacement demand and growth demand. The replacement demand is connected to the replacement of the doctorates currently employed; that is, how many PhD defences we would need in order to keep the number of doctors employed at its current level. The second component is the growth demand, indicating the necessary growth in the total number of doctors based on the number of students, the volume of research and development activities and the desired proportion of doctors among all instructors and scientific workers. While the growth demand and total demand could be either positive or negative, the replacement demand is defined to be non-negative. Thus, in case leavers are not replaced with new faculty, there is a positive replacement demand that is offset by a negative growth demand, resulting in zero total demand (Shapiro 2001). Both, in the case of the replacement and the growth demand we distinguished current demand and future demand. The first shows the demand at the current moment, the second, at some point of time in the future by proceeding from some possible developments in the research and teaching activities. Estimating the need for doctorates is a complicated research task because it involves forecasting the future. The latter involves a subjective component and the actual outcome (future developments) need not coincide with current opinions. There is inevitably considerable uncertainty in estimating the future. One factor that is fairly impossible to predict is future educational and economic policy decisions and their impact on the development of particular fields. While such decisions cannot be foreseen, we are able to analyze the future demand for doctors from the current situation. The current replacement demand according to our approach involves people at or close to retirement age. Some individuals that have already reached the retirement age will, of course, continue to fulfil their functions for some time; however, sooner or later it will be necessary to find a replacement for them. The replacement demand in the future is connected to future retirements and the mobility of employees to other sectors (public sector, private sector) or to positions abroad. For instance, the employees currently close to retirement age will reach retirement age in the near future. In the case of a growth in demand we distinguished replacement demand similarly between the readiness to hire new doctorates at the time of inquiry and the recruitment planned in the next 5 years. Growth in demand can be approached in different ways. One option is to ask the institutions, how many new doctors they would be ready to recruit if they had sufficient financial resources. The other option is to look at the unfilled positions or vacancies (e.g. Basil and Basil (2006) used job advertisement data). Unfortunately, experience has shown that without any financial guarantee, vacant positions will not be maintained. To some extent the logic of vacant positions works in the case of professorships, because there simply are no individuals with the necessary qualifications available. The nature of the vacant positions is, therefore, another caveat we need to keep in mind. Next we will present some background information about the institutions and individuals surveyed. As shown in Table 5, on average 44% of all positions are filled by PhDs 28 . The lower the position, the lower the proportion of positions filled by doctorates; this stems from the logic of the positions at higher education and research institutions. As expected, the proportion of doctors is high, both among full professors (82%) as well as docents (77%); as a rule, the requirement of having a doctoral degree is also prescribed for professors and docents in the relevant job descriptions. The humanities are an exception, because in the case of some fields in the humanities (creative specialities) there is also no formal requirement in the law that professors are required to hold a doctorate, instead, it has been specified that the professorship should be filled by a creative person that has achieved international 28 Concerning other countries, in Finland PhDs were estimated to account 25% of university staff (PhDs in Finland\u2026 2003), in US accounting departments 55% (Campbell et al. (1990) and in US economics departments 73% (Cartter 1971). recognition 29 . Thus, in the case of the humanities only a bit more than half (54%) of all professors hold a doctors degree, which is entirely due to the creative professions (fine arts). Source: own calculations based on the survey among Estonian higher education and research institutions. Note. The group \"other teaching staff\" includes two categories, \"Assistants\" and \"Lecturers\". The group \"Research staff\" includes the categories \"Research Fellow\", \"Senior Research Fellow\" and \"Lead Research Fellow\". The proportion of PhDs is expected to be lower in institutions of applied higher education compared to universities. For instance, in a study in polytechnics in Finland, just 5.2% of the full-time teaching staff had a PhD (PhDs in Finland\u20262003). In Estonia, the same figure is much higher for institutions of applied higher education at 12.3%. By field of study, the proportion of PhDs is higher in the real-and technical sciences, and lower among the humanities. The striking fact is that in institutions of applied higher education, the number of docents and professors that lack a PhD is not negligible (and that is not just in the humanities). Finally, the institutions of applied higher education have practically no research staff, which is not surprising. The staff in the category \"Other teaching staff\" as a rule do not have a doctorate degree. In the humanities, about one fifth of assistants have a doctors degree, but we can assume that these are mostly individuals at retirement age that are finishing their academic career lower positions than their candidate degrees obtained long ago would actually allow. 30 In medical sciences the proportion of \"Other teaching staff\" with a PhD is also not negligible. Appendix 1 also presents the results of a Tobit model for the proportion of PhDs. In institutions of applied higher education, the proportion of PhDs is significantly lower (by 30%) than in universities. In social science institutions, the ratio is 14% higher than in universities. It has been noted that the employment prospects outside the public sector and universities are more limited in the humanities because this area is also divided into several smaller fields, and it is also more difficult to consider their needs in science policy planning (PhDs in Finland\u20262003)."}, {"section_title": "Demand for PhDs in the academic sector in Estonia", "text": "Vacancies Table 6 provides information about vacant positions. Generally, we can say that in about 60% of institutions or subdivisions there are unfilled positions, but the proportions are somewhat different across scientific fields. In terms of the total number of vacancies, the shortage of doctors is greatest in the social sciences and the situation is the best in medicine. In most cases the positions remain unfilled for 2-5 years. We can assume, that if a vacant position is unfilled for more than 5 years, then the position will be abolished at some point from the structure of the institution. The total number of vacant positions is 245, which constitutes 18% of the total number of doctors. That can be considered as a rather high proportion. The number of vacancies indicates the actual current need for doctors; there simply are not enough people with adequate qualifications. On the other hand, in many if not most cases, when indicating the number of vacancies, the respondents may have focused exclusively on unfilled professorships. 30 According to the survey, in the humanities all the assistants with a doctoral degree worked in the Language Centre of the Faculty of Philosophy at Tartu University. Here we cannot rule out that the information reported in the survey is not entirely correct; for instance, some of these individuals might actually work as lecturers. The data from the personnel department of the University of Tartu on PhDs employed refer to that possibility. According to this source of data, these are indeed relatively aged employees. Note. Among units that indicated the presence of vacancies, there were a number of cases where the number of vacancies was not indicated, but it was indicated that there exists at least one since there was a reason for the existence of vacancies. We considered such institutions to have vacancies. The reasons for the vacancies vary. Overall, the most common reasons were that the \"our employees do not qualify\" and \"there is no one in Estonia with the appropriate qualification\" -both were mentioned in 40% of cases. When taking these two reasons together, then in 55% of cases the problem was that there simply is no one in Estonia with adequate qualifications. At the same time, other problems were also mentioned, such as the low level of compensation for the work (the latter reason was indicated more often among technical and real sciences). Another factor, indicated by 36% percent, was that the specificity of the research work and the working conditions make employing foreigners impossible. That variant was chosen less often in research institutions compared to higher education institutions. That finding is in every way logical, given that in must curricula the studies are undertaken in Estonian. Perhaps an even more important conclusion we can make from these responses is that for most of the universities and R&D institutions that we surveyed, the academic job market is limited to Estonia. They did not mention budget restrictions as the main barrier to hiring new people (except in the real-and technical sciences). If they had thought internationally then with sufficient funding they could have afforded to hire people from Europe. But very few considered this as an option. We were interested to discover the proportion of positions requiring a doctoral degree that have been filled as a result of genuine competition; that is, where there was more than one candidate for the position. As we can see from the table, the proportion of such positions is only 14%. Thus, till now the dominant practice is that there is only one suitable candidate for the position. This could also be interpreted that if there is a candidate with suitable qualifications, then the position will be created for him or her. In institutions of applied higher education, there seems to be relatively more vacancies compared to universities. These vacancies constitute 63% of the total number doctors employed compared to 16% in universities (see Table 7). The numbers are also somewhat higher for research institutes, though the difference from universities is not so striking. There are many more vacancies in public and state owned institutions, than privately owned institutions. Thus, all-in-all, the situation seems to be the best in large public universities. The story behind this is most likely that the institutions that educate the doctors, seem to employ the majority of the PhD graduates themselves, and in that way there are not sufficient doctors for the other institutions. Another issue is the attractiveness of the working and salary conditions. Also, the surveys among doctors indicated that 75% of respondents considered their future to be connected with work in the academic sector (Puura et al, 2004).  Figure 3; that is, given these numbers, we would still consider the current age-structure in Estonia as abnormal. If we consider that there is a net departure of PhDs from academia 33 at some rate, then this would further increase the proportion of PhDs from the younger generations. 32 According to the Auriol (2007), the average age at graduation ranged among OECD countries for men from 31.7 years in Italy to 38 years in Portugal, for women from 31.6 years in Italy to 38.1 years in USA. 33 It might be non-feasible for PhDs to re-enter academia after working in other sectors due to evaporating skills or the motivation to work in academia having decreased due to better salary conditions elsewhere. The previous evidence is in accordance with the fact that in the past the most important reason for leaving the job has been retirement (that has also been found to be true for other countries, e.g. Cartter, 1971): 48% of PhDs leaving in the last 5 years have done so due to retirement. Somewhat surprisingly, the other reasons for leaving, like going to work to abroad or transfer to the private sector, have a relatively low importance, respectively 10.4% and 6.4% of all leavers (see Figure 4). Leaving to go abroad has been more important among the humanities (4%) and social sciences (3.5%) than among medicine (2.6%) and real-and technical sciences (1.2%). The lower leaving rate in medicine might be a bit surprising, given the intensive emigration of doctors in Estonia to older EU member States (especially Finland and Sweden) 34 . This variation is probably connected to the different age structure in different institutions (younger doctorates are more willing to go abroad); however in our data there was no correlation between the number of leavers and the proportion of doctorates younger than 10 years away from retirement age. Most of the respondents (59% in higher education institutions, 67% in research institutions) indicated that they expect the number of leavers to be the same in the future as it has been among the past; among others, those that expected the number of leavers to increase dominated somewhat over those that expected it to decrease (30% versus 11% in higher education institutions). Retirement, 47.5 Private sector, 6.4 Public sector, 5.4 Other higher education, 18.9 Abroad, 10.4 Health, 9.6 Unknown, 1.8"}, {"section_title": "Figure 4", "text": "Replacement demand: reasons for leaving the job in the last 5 years, percentage of all leavers Source: own calculations based on the survey among Estonian higher education and research institutions From the reasons for the resignations we can also forecast the replacement demand for doctors over the 5 next years. Because we analyzed the demand for the entire academic sector, in constructing the forecast we did not take into account mobility between different higher education institutions -this represents a movement within the sector that cancels out at the aggregate level and does not have any impact on the final results (total demand for PhD's in the academic sector). The expected number of leavers in the next five years has been calculated as follows. The number of persons leaving due to retirement has been calculated as the sum of two categories, staff above retirement age currently employed and employees with up to 5 years till retirement age. For those leaving for other reasons, we proceeded from the actual number of leavers in the last 5 years; this is justified by the fact that most respondents expected the number of leavers to be roughly the same in the future. The results presented in Table 9 reveal that in the next 5 years, about 560 new doctors will be needed to replace the doctors currently employed in the academic sector -that makes about 40% of all doctors currently employed. Source: own calculations based on the survey among Estonian higher education and research institutions. Note. In this and the following tables, the value in the last column (Total) need not equal the sum of the demand in the sub/categories (here academic fields) due to rounding -the difference being just 1, however. The replacement demand is much higher in institutions of applied higher education compared to universities (see Table 10); this is mostly related to the more unfavourable age structure in the latter. The differences between public or state, and private institutions are rather small. The replacement rate over 5 years is thus 40% and the annual average rate 8%. That estimate falls rather towards the upper end of the range of the values that earlier studies have either usually assumed or derived 35 . Source: own calculations based on the survey among Estonian higher education and research institutions"}, {"section_title": "The desired proportion of doctors in total research and teaching staff", "text": "Another factor affecting the demand for doctors is the desired proportion of doctorates among all persons involved in teaching and research activities. The proportion of PhDs can be taken as a proxy for the quality of the research and teaching staff. We can see that on the average, 91% of institutions have indicated that their desired proportion of doctorates exceeds the actual proportion; so we can assume that in these institutions extra doctorates might be needed. However, the desired proportion may also be achieved by firing those staff without the doctoral degree. The desired proportion varies quite broadly (see Figure 5), however the majority has indicated that doctors should constitute 60-80% of all research and teaching staff. Concerning different academic fields, the desired proportion of doctorates is much higher in medical sciences and real-and technical sciences; the gap between the desired and actual proportions is quite large in all fields, though somewhat higher in medical sciences and the humanities. Based on this information, we have also calculated how many doctors would be needed to increase actual proportions to the desired level without firing any workforce without PhD degrees. As we can see from Table 11, the number is about 605 or about 45% of the current number of doctors, and that is definitely a rather high number. In such a situation, it is expected that employees without a PhD be expected to work towards a PhD; on the other hand, the question remains whether the heads of departments might still prefer to hire non-PhD workers in order to save on wage costs.  Not surprisingly, the desired proportion of PhDs is much lower in institutions of applied higher education than in universities (respectively 72% and 25%). There is practically no difference between universities and research institutions, but in the latter the wedge between the desired and the actual proportion is much larger. The desired proportion is higher in public and state institutions (68%) than in private institutions (45%), probably because among the second group there are more institutions of applied higher education that do not have such ambitions for undertaking research. This is also confirmed via the regression analysis, where in the Tobit model for the desired proportion of PhDs, the only significant variable was the dummy for applied higher education (Appendix 1)."}, {"section_title": "Growth demand and total demand for PhDs", "text": "As we have already mentioned, the growth in demand can be estimated in two ways, according to vacancies or, according to the stated readiness to hire new doctors in addition to those already employed at the institution. But, how many doctors do we need in order to increase the number of doctors currently employed (not considering the replacements for the currently employed workforce leaving for some reason). In our questionnaire we approached this issue in two ways. First, we asked respondents to report the number of additional people with PhD degree that are needed at the known level of funding, existing research projects and forecasted teaching load; that is, the need realisable within current resources. Secondly, we asked the respondents to report the need for PhDs if the financial constraints are discarded; such a figure could be determined by and originate from the development plan of the institution, for instance. This presents a kind of ideal situation. The results were in some sense surprising because the differences between the two were not perhaps as large as we would have expected. Within current actual resources, the institutions surveyed preferred to hire 588 additional doctors during the next 5 years, without funding constraints the number would be 828 (see Table 12, Table 13). Both of these numbers are rather high given the current number of doctors, the annual growth demand is respectively 8% and 11% over the next five years. Concerning previous estimates for other countries, this is a rather high figure, and the growth demand constitutes a remarkably high proportion of the total demand 36 .   Table 14 and Table 15 summarize the numbers on growth and replacement demand. We can generalize, that in the academic sector, total demand is in the range of 1100 to 1400 additional employees with a PhD degree, either for replacing the leavers or for increasing the total number of doctorates employed. That is a remarkably high number relative to the current number of PhDs (the total demand is almost 100% of the current number of PhDs). In the case of private institutions the ratio is 125% and in the case of institutions of applied higher education, 204%. We already referred earlier to the very optimistic expectations of some private institutions whose sustainability is questionable in the context of demographic changes and their limited research activities. Given that more than 90% of the demand for PhDs comes from universities and research institutes, these issues do not impact our final conclusions very much. of growth demand is remarkable high, in a study on the faculty demand in the USA during 1987-2012 growth demand accounted for 3-14% of total demand (Shapiro 2001 Figure 6. The components of the total demand on the basis of academic fields: relative proportions Note. The growth demand has been calculated based on the need without financial constraints. Comparing the demand, on the one hand, between private and state, and on the other, between private institutions reveals that private sector institutions have hired relatively many employees in the past as well as intend to hire quite many new employees in the future. Thus they have a relatively optimistic view of the future. Such optimism might be unjustified if the private institutions are not able to increase their engagement in research 37 . Does such a structure of estimated demand correspond to the current structure for the supply of PhDs in Estonia? As we can observe from Table 16, in the state financed study places the share of real-and technical sciences exceeds the share of graduates. That priority seems to be justified given the structure of the estimated PhD demand. In terms of replacement demand, the share of real-and technical sciences is even slightly higher. We might argue that in the case of the state being able to assign limited total funding to the financing of PhD education, attention should focus on the structure of the replacement demand. In general, the state financed study places still corresponds surprisingly well to the demand for PhDs. The next issue is to what extent is the future demand for doctorates related to the expected future amount of and financing for research activities. The respondents' expectations for the volume of research work are presented in Figure 7 and Table 17. We can see that slightly more expect an increase in finances available than those who expect research funding to decrease. The vast majority still thinks that research funding will be approximately at the same level in the future. Research institutes are more optimistic compared to higher education institutions (the proportion of those expecting an increase in funding was 84% versus 19%). Concerning different scientific fields, the expectations are more optimistic among medical sciences; otherwise there are no significant differences between the disciplines. Growth in research funding is connected not only to PhD demand, but also the supply of PhDs; according to the survey of PhD students 1/3 mentioned difficulties because the supervisor did not have a targeted financed research budget 38 , 71% indicated a shortage of funding for surveys, experiments, etc. (Puura et al, 2004). The previous result is somewhat surprising given that the national policy documents have foreseen growth in research funding, namely that the total R&D budget should grow from the level of 0.88% of GDP to the level of 3% by 2013 (Teadmistep\u00f5hine Eesti \u20262006). That may indicate either a low belief among academic staff in the government's willingness to achieve set targets or that the respondents believe that funding will be directed to other fields than that of the respondents.  We can note that the estimated growth demand is quite closely associated to expectations of future research funding: the Spearman correlation coefficient is statistically significant at 0.24. The relationship is much stronger among universities than institutions of applied higher education, and surprisingly, research institutes (where the correlation coefficient is practically zero). While it is natural that institutions of applied higher education are not research oriented, in the case of research institutes, it may indicate either that their estimated future needs are unrealistic (the institutions did not consider the presence of funding when evaluating the demand) or that the necessary research funding for additional PhDs is already there. In order to analyze the reliability of our findings, we hereby also present the correlations between various components of demand in Table 18: these are 1) vacancies, 2) estimated current replacement demand, 3) estimated future replacement demand, 4) estimated current growth demand, 5) estimated future growth demand, and 6) the number of additional PhDs needed to achieve the desired percentage of PhDs in total staff. As we can see, there is a positive correlation between the current and future replacement demand; that may appear mostly as a result of the age of PhDs -in institutions with a relatively high proportion of Next we present the results of the regression analysis where various components of demand have been regressed on the basis of the different characteristics of the institutions. The results presented in Table 19 indicate that in none of the cases does the R-squared exceed 50%, indicating that a significant proportion of the demand is related to institution-specific factors not captured by the independent variables. The various components of demand are negatively related to the current number of PhDs. Note. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. All variables have been expressed relative to the total number of PhDs in the institution. An expected growth in research funding will increase the future growth demand given the current financial constraints; however, an expected decline has no significant effect. The explanation for this might be that a decrease in funding is expected by institutions that have a relatively small proportion of funding coming from research anyway. A higher desired proportion of PhDs has a positive impact on PhD demand, but the variable is always insignificant. The vacancies-to-PhDs ratio has a significant negative effect on future growth demand -this might simply be because the higher number of vacancies means a higher current growth demand at the expense of a lower future growth demand. Concerning institutions of applied higher education, they have a much higher total replacement demand; but in the total demand the difference is no longer statistically significant. Not many significant differences can be observed between various scientific fields. In the real and technical sciences, the total replacement demand is significantly higher than in other disciplines (this is also reflected in Table 9); that seems to be the reason also for the higher total PhD demand."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and implications", "text": "The aim of the current paper was to estimate the need for new PhDs in the Estonian academic sector (universities, institutions of applied higher education, research institutes) in the next five years (2007-2012) by using the results of a survey undertaken among academic employers. As with earlier studies, we distinguished between the replacement demand (the demand resulting from the need to replace PhDs leaving due to retirements, deaths and net movements between the academic and non-academic sectors) and the growth demand (increase in the total number of PhDs employed). The results of our survey showed that the demand for new PhD's is rather high. The total number of new PhDs needed to replace leavers (mostly those retiring) and to increase the number of employed PhDs to the desired level constitutes almost 100% of the current number of PhDs employed in the Estonian academic sector. The rather high replacement demand has been caused by an unfavourable age structure within the PhD workforce that will cause high retirement rates in the coming years. In spite of that, the growth demand constitutes a higher proportion of the total demand than in many earlier studies. The shortage of PhDs in the academic labour market is evidenced also by the high proportion of vacancies (about one fifth of the total number of doctors) and the low proportion of positions filled via actual competition between applicants (in only 15% of all cases). The respondents also found that the proportion of PhDs in the total research and teaching staff should increase from the current 45% to about 60-70%. Differences between scientific fields were not particularly noticeable. Privately owned institutions and institutions of applied higher education claimed to have a proportionally higher need for PhDs than public universities and research institutes. Their optimistic expectations for the future need not be realistic in the context of declining numbers of students and given their limited engagement in research activities. However, their share in total PhD demand in the academic sector is quite limited. In general, in the context of the expected decline in the number of students due to demographic changes, the level of research funding is expected to become a more important determinant of PhD employment. Although an increase in R&D funding is foreseen in national policy documents, the majority of respondents expected that funding would remain at its current level. Thus, according to our estimations, the total demand for PhDs (the sum of the growth and replacement demand) in the academic sector will be in the range of 1100-1360 persons in the next 5 years. Such a need corresponds to the 220 to 270 PhD defences each year (about 15-18 % of the current number of PhDs employed). The total number of PhD defences in Estonian universities in 2005 was 131. In this study we only focus on the needs of the academic sector. Given earlier studies on PhD demand in other countries and the limited business R&D in Estonia, demand in the public sector (ministries, government agencies) and the private sector is very likely to constitute only a relatively low proportion of the total demand. Thus, the total annual demand for new PhDs in all three sectors might be relatively close to the figure of 300 that is the expert estimate suggested by the Ministry of Education and Research. Such a target is also written down in the national policy documents: according to Knowledge-Based Estonia 2007-2013(2006, the number of PhD defences should reach 300 by the year 2013 39 . Given our results, the latter figure is rather an underestimation than an overestimation of the need. Thus, there seems to exist a significant unsatisfied demand. The topic of this paper is not which policy measures should be used to close the gap. On the one hand, the domestic supply of new PhDs may increase if more individuals with master degrees choose to pursue a PhD due to reduced employment opportunities outside academia 40 . On the other hand, though the low public funding of higher education and research in Estonia is mostly considered an issue, in our survey the respondents sometimes seemed to forget that as the reason for the shortage of doctorates. 41 If the compensation for the scientific workforce was at an internationally competitive level, the international mobility of PhDs could solve the current shortage 42 . International mobility is therefore an important tool. More generally, a complex solution and policy mix is required to create a system that ensures the production and employment of PhDs in numbers that correspond to the foreseen growth of R&D expenditures and the establishment of a knowledge based society. 39 Similar targets have also been set in other countries, for instance in Finland the development plan for education and university research set the target of 1,400 new PhDs during -2004. The R&D strategy document Knowledge-Based Estonia 2007-2013(2006 specifies that the number of R&D employees should grow by 2013 to the level of 8 scientists and engineers among 1000 employees from the level of 5 in 2004. If sustaining the current proportion of PhDs among all scientists and engineers at 50% (in 2005 49%) and using the Ministry of Finance forecast for total employment (660 thousand in 2013), that assumes about 220 additional PhDs. 40 In the case of Estonia, we have lots of anecdotal evidence that currently only mention that a slow-down in the Estonian economy (the GDP growth rate of 11.4% in 2006 is hardly sustainable) may increase the number of master students who choose to pursue a PhD through the lower opportunity cost of obtaining a PhD. 41 Naturally, the attractiveness of the academic sector also involves other issues, such as how the positions for new PhDs are funded, are they permanent or temporary, etc. For instance, in Finland it was found that new PhDs have been recruited into universities mostly via external project funding allocated on a fixed term basis (PhDs in Finland\u20262003). 42 The mobility of researchers in Estonia is studied in Archimedes (2007). The demand for PhDs in the economy (especially in the public sector and business sector outside academia) is still minimised by a poor understanding of the meaning of a PhD degree and the role of PhDs in society. There is a widespread opinion in society that the only possible career for PhDs is within academia. Actually, a PhD is a sign of a rather highly qualified specialist who knows the theoretical foundations of his/her field and commands the necessary methodology in order to undertake empirical studies, critically analyze and evaluate new ideas and communicate with colleagues, the academic community and society. Employment either as an analyst in a ministry, as a scholar in academia or a top manager in a private company is a matter of the choice for each individual and the attitudes of society. In our future research we plan to continue with the study of PhD demand in other sectors of Estonia. The demand for PhDs in the public sector will be studied by means of a survey among ministries and government agencies, and the need for PhDs in the business sector will be estimated by means of modelling."}]
