[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "T here has been a recent wave of interest in the role that noncognitive skills might play in explaining educational achievement, labor market success, and other significant life outcomes. Jencks (1979) was among the first to document that factors, such as study habits, industriousness, perseverance, and self-control matter as much as cognitive skills in explaining occupational achievement. Since then, other studies have confirmed the central role played by behavioral and socio-emotional factors in explaining schooling and labor market outcomes ( Jacob (2002) shows that controlling for the greater incidence of school disciplinary and behavioral problems among boys explains a substantial share of the female advantage in college enrollment.\nWhat is less well understood are the sources of the gender gap in noncognitive skills. Some researchers have stressed biological influences-many of the differences that exist between male and female brains have been shown to occur in areas related to mood, emotions, and emotion regulation. The development of the frontal cortex (which is associated, among other things, with inhibitory control and hence a decreased risk of externalizing problems) and temporal lobe has been shown to be considerably faster among girls than boys. Moreover, prior research has established that variation in in utero exposure to sex hormones, particularly testosterone, is associated with such structural and functional brain differences, even within gender groups. Higher levels of prenatal exposure to testosterone have been linked to slower maturation of parts of the temporal cortex, but also lower empathy levels, higher disinhibition and lower quality of social relationships (see, for example, Baron-Cohen 2002 Geary 1998 Geary , 2002 McClure 2000; Knickmeyer et al. 2005; Maccoby 1998 ).\nNevertheless, it remains unclear whether systematic gender differences in childrearing inputs or in the production function of noncognitive skills are also contributing factors. A case for a possible role of social influences is warranted in light of earlier work showing that noncognitive skills are not fixed but are in fact quite malleable, and can be shaped by early intervention programs.\n3 The primary goal of this paper is to assess the explanatory power of such social or environmental influences for the gender gap in noncognitive development. In particular, we focus on externalizing behaviors, which encompass disruptive and acting-out behaviors, such as aggression and delinquent behavior.\nExisting research lacks a systematic look into whether and how the home and school environments contribute to gender differences in noncognitive skills. Many of the earlier studies documenting how environmental factors contributed to disruptive behavior focused exclusively on boys (as this is the \"at risk\" group), and relied on very small sample sizes (Zahn-Waxler, Shirtcliff, and Marceau 2008). In contrast, the core of our analysis is based on a large representative sample of boys and girls in the United States that started kindergarten in 1998 and was followed until eighth grade.\nWe start by documenting the gender gap in noncognitive skills among children, and how that gap evolves over the course of children's development. What is immediately remarkable is the size of these gender gaps. score about half a standard deviation below boys in teacher-reported externalizing problems and 0.45 of a standard deviation above boys in teacher-reported selfcontrol. For comparison, the widely discussed gender gap in math is about 0.15 of a standard deviation in fifth grade and the (reverse) gender gap in reading is about 0.2 of a standard deviation in fifth grade. The gender gap in all noncognitive skills widen in the early years of school. While the data allows us to track the gender gap in many types of noncognitive skills, our primary interest is in the set of noncognitive skills that map into future educational and labor market outcomes. We show that externalizing behavior is a crucial determinant of school suspension, which itself has been shown to directly matter for long-term educational outcomes. Therefore, our analysis will focus on explaining gender differences in externalizing behavior, which is based on the frequency with which a child argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, or disturbs ongoing activities.\nWe test various socialization theories for the gender gap. We consider both homebased and school-based influences. We fail to uncover any compelling evidence that any of the early school-based influences that we consider matter. In particular, while it has been argued that boys might be at a particular disadvantage in more regimented early schooling environments (because of the slower maturation of key brain areas), we find no systematic differences in the gender gap based on key features of the kindergarten environment. Also, we find no systematic differences in the gender gap based on age of kindergarten entry, or teacher gender, or share of disruptive peers in the school or classroom.\nIn contrast, our analysis of the home environment uncovers richer patterns. Family structure is an important correlate of boys' behavioral deficit. Boys raised outside of a traditional family (with two biological parents present) fare especially poorly. For example, the gender gap in externalizing problems when the children are in fifth grade is nearly twice as large for children raised by single mothers compared to children raised in traditional families. By eighth grade, the gender gap in school suspension is close to 25 percentage points among children raised by single mothers, while only 10 percentage points among children in intact families. Boys raised by teenage mothers also appear to be much more likely to act out.\nIn the remainder of our analysis, we ask why boys raised by single mothers are at a higher risk of developing behavioral problems. First, it is possible that single mothers invest disproportionately less in their sons, or feel less warm toward them. Indeed, we show that single mothers seem relatively more emotionally distant from their sons and are also more likely to have reported spanking their sons. Accounting for these endowment effects explain a small part of the difference in the gender gap in externalizing behavior (in fifth grade) and grade suspension (in eighth grade) between children growing up in intact families and families headed by single mothers. Most important though are gender differences in the noncognitive returns to parental inputs. On average, across children, broken families are associated with lower levels and lower quality of parental inputs. The noncognitive development of boys, unlike that of girls, appears extremely responsive to such inputs. 4 Overall, 4 A limited literature in psychology has focused on gender differences in the family determinants of externalizing problems. The findings of this literature have not been consistent. Some research has found that the determinants VoL. 5 No. 1 35 bertrand and pan: the trouble with boys our findings strongly suggest that boys' deficit in noncognitive skills is not purely biological but, instead, subject to very strong environmental influences, particularly from the home.\nThe main data source for our analysis is The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). ECLS-K is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 children entering kindergarten in 1998. Information on these children has been gathered until they complete eighth grade. The full sample was interviewed in the fall and spring of kindergarten, spring of first grade, spring of third grade, spring of fifth grade, and spring of eighth grade. About 1,000 different schools are included in the sample, and 20 children were interviewed per school. Information was collected about children's cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development from children, families, teachers, and schools. In addition, information about the children's home environment, educational practices at home, environment at school, curriculum, and teacher qualifications was also collected (National Center for Education Statistics 2003).\nWe use teacher-reported measures of five behavioral and social-emotional skills: externalizing problems, self-control, approaches to learning, interpersonal skills, and internalizing problems. These noncognitive skill measures are adapted from the Social Skills Rating Scale, a widely used survey technique for detecting social and behavioral problems in the classroom (Gresham and Elliott 1990). As Neidell and Waldfogel (2010) note, the ECLS-K noncognitive measures appear to have relatively high \"validity based on test-retest reliability, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and correlations with other, more advanced behavioral constructs (Elliott et al. 1988) and are considered the most comprehensive assessment that can be widely administered in large surveys such as the ECLS-K (Demaray et al. 1995) .\" Each of the noncognitive measures averages answers to a series of questions that are rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 4 (very often). The measurement of externalizing problems is based on five questions assessing the frequency with which a child argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, and disturbs ongoing activities. The measurement of self control is based on four questions assessing the child's ability to control behavior by respecting the property rights of others, controlling his or her temper, accepting peer ideas for group activities, and responding appropriately to pressure from peers. \"Approaches to learning\" measures behaviors that affect the ease with which children can benefit from the learning environment. It averages six items that rate child's attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, flexibility, and organization. Interpersonal skills rate the child's skill in forming and maintaining friendships; getting were very similar for boys and girls (e.g., Dishion et al. 1994; Huizinga, Esbensen, and Weiher 1991; Rowe, Flannery, and Flannery 1995) .

Boys are known to perform worse than girls on many noncognitive dimensions. Boys have well documented attention and behavioral difficulties (Beamen, Wheldall, and Kemp 2006; Gilliam 2005; Ready et al. 2005) , have lower levels of inhibitory control and perceptual sensitivity (Else-Quest et al. 2006) , are less able to delay gratification (Silverman 2003) , and are more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (see, for example, Szatmari, Offord, and Boyle 1989) . In fact, a few recent papers have claimed that the (reverse) gender gap in college attendance that currently exists in the United States and many other developed countries might be best explained by gender differences in noncognitive skills (see, for example, Becker, Hubbard, and Murphy 2010; and Goldin, Katz, and Kuziemko 2006) . In support of this claim, Jacob (2002) shows that controlling for the greater incidence of school disciplinary and behavioral problems among boys explains a substantial share of the female advantage in college enrollment. 2 What is less well understood are the sources of the gender gap in noncognitive skills.

(2006) . 3 For example, in their study of the Perry preschool program, which was targeted toward disadvantaged innercity youth, Heckman et al. (2009) document sizable increases in future employment and earnings among treated children, and attribute most of these gains to the program's positive long-run effect on noncognitive development. In a similar vein, Chetty et al. (2011) study the long-run effects of the Tennessee STAR class size experiment and document that increases in kindergarten class quality increased earnings, college attendance, and other long-run outcomes, even though gains in test scores faded over time. They show that the long-run effects of kindergarten class quality operate primarily through the noncognitive channel by increasing effort, motivating initiative, and reducing disruptive behavior. score about half a standard deviation below boys in teacher-reported externalizing problems and 0.45 of a standard deviation above boys in teacher-reported selfcontrol.

The sample is restricted to children who have nonmissing data on key background characteristics, such as gender, race, age at assessment, region, urbanicity, sibling composition, family structure, mother's age at first birth, and family SES in the fall of kindergarten. 6 As there is substantial attrition in the ECLS-K panel, we further restrict the sample to children who have valid teacher ratings of externalizing behavior in the fall of kindergarten and grade five as well as the parental reported measure of school suspension in grade eight. 7 In all our specifications, we weight the observations using the eighth grade panel weights provided in ECLS-K."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "Summary statistics for these noncognitive traits are presented in Table 1 .

Similar gaps exist for \"approaches to learning\" and \"interpersonal skills.\" The gender gap is smallest for internalizing problems, a trait that captures anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness. Finally, girls are less likely to have repeated a grade and to have been suspended 6 While we have measures of some of these background characteristics at multiple points in time (e.g., family structure and family SES), throughout the paper, we use the fall-K measures to ensure consistency and to limit potential endogeneity concerns. Results are generally not sensitive to whether we use the fall-K measures or the year-specific measures. 7 We have also replicated the results using the sample of children with valid information in each wave separately. The results are similar to those we obtain from imposing the sample restriction. These results are available from the authors upon request.\n8 Because of the complex sampling procedure utilized by ECLS-K, different weights are suggested depending on the set of variables used. We use the eighth grade parent panel weight (C1_7FP0). This weight is recommended to be used for the analysis of parent interview data from six rounds of data collection (fall-kindergarten, springkindergarten, spring-first grade, spring-third grade, spring-fifth grade, and spring-eighth grade), alone or in combination with (a) child assessment data from any of these six rounds (b) data from any of the six waves of the teacher questionnaire (teacher-level or child-level) (ECLS-K Combined Eighth Grade and K-8 User's Manual 2009).\n9 Note that the teacher-based gender gaps in at least some of these noncognitive skills might be even larger than they appear in Table 1 because of gender differences in retention. More boys than girls in a given wave of ECLS-K are not in their \"wave\" grade but instead in a lower grade with teachers comparing them to younger, and hence, in general, more unruly, children.\n10 A similar widening of the gender gap in externalizing problems can be found using child-reported ratings (which are only available for third and fifth grades). bertrand and pan: the trouble with boys 11 Girls outperform boys with respect to reading but lag behind in math. While the (reverse) gender gap in reading is already present in kindergarten, the gender gap in math only emerges in first grade.\n12 What is remarkable is how large the gender gaps in noncognitive skills are compared to the gender gaps in reading and math scores. The (reverse) gender in reading ranges between 0.2 and 0.27 of a standard deviation, while the gender gap in math ranges between 0 and 0.18 of a standard deviation. This is in contrast to the gender gaps in noncognitive skills, which are all closer to 0.5 standard deviations (with the exception of internalizing problems).\nWhile we do not, as indicated above, directly use parental ratings of noncognitive skills in our analysis below, the top panel of online Appendix Table A3 reports gender gaps for those ratings as well. 13 The questions asked to parents do not perfectly match those asked to teachers, but the patterns we observe in online Appendix Table A3 are qualitatively similar to those in Table 1 , even though the magnitude of the parent-reported gender gaps in noncognitive skills are smaller. Parents rate daughters as relatively less likely to act impulsively, which maps into the teacherreported gender gap in both externalizing and self-control problems.\n14 Girls are also more likely to exert self-control and score higher than boys when rated by their parents on their \"approaches to learning\" and social skills. Consistent with the small teacher-reported gender gap in internalizing problems, parents do not perceive any systematic differences in sadness or loneliness between their sons and daughters.\nOne might expect that not all of the early childhood noncognitive skills discussed above feed the same way into future educational and labor market outcomes. Unfortunately, the ECLS-K data does not go beyond eighth grade, and it is therefore impossible to directly relate educational achievement or earnings to these various early childhood noncognitive measures. Instead, we relate these noncognitive measures to school suspension in eighth grade, which has been shown to be predictive of college attendance and college completion (Segal forthcoming; Bertrand and Pan 2011) . The results are reported in online Appendix Table A4 . Controlling for reading and math scores, we find that the strongest and most robust predictor of eighth grade suspension is externalizing behavior. There appears to be some influence of fifth grade interpersonal skills, but not kindergarten interpersonal skills. We also see some influence of self-control when measured in kindergarten, but not when measured in fifth grade. Finally, there are no statistically significant influences of fifth grade math and reading scores on the likelihood of eighth grade suspension. A different pattern emerges when we look at the relationship between the different measures of teaching reported noncognitive skills and reading and math test scores in 11 The reading and math test scores reported are item response theory (IRT) scores provided in ECLS-K, which we convert into a standardized normal with mean zero and standard deviation one in the weighted sample after imposing the sample restrictions.\n12 See Fryer and Levitt (2010) for an analysis of the gender gap in math scores using the ECLS-K data. 13 Ideally, we would have liked to use the parent reported measures of noncognitive skills in the main analysis as well. Unfortunately, this data was only collected in kindergarten and first grade.\n14 For externalizing behavior/impulsive behavior, the correlations between teacher and parent ratings range between 0.27 (fall-K) and 0.31 (grade 1). grade 8-a child's \"approach to learning\" appears to be the most important predictor of his or her future cognitive test scores. Internalizing behavior also seems to matter, although to a much smaller degree. 15 Overall, the evidence in online Appendix Table A4 motivates our focus in most of the analysis on the gender gap in externalizing problems, or in the tendency to \"act out.\""}, {"section_title": "II.

The Home Environment", "text": "Summary statistics by gender for the home environment variables and child's background characteristics that we exploit in the analysis are presented in online Appendix Tables A5 and A6 . There are only very small differences in family structure, parental SES and sibling composition across genders, consistent with the expectation that gender is essentially randomly assigned across families. 17 In other words, it is not the case that boys are disproportionately likely to grow up in disadvantaged families, and thus differences in family background cannot be a direct factor in explaining the overall gender gap in noncognitive skills. We also see no systematic differences across gender in region of residence or rate of urban living. 18 We do, however, observe some differences with respect to the level of inputs these families are investing in their children. For most of the analysis that follows, we measure these parental inputs in kindergarten. Parents are significantly more likely to read to their girls, and there are generally more books around girls. They are also more likely to take their girls to a concert and to sign them up for some extracurricular activity. Overall, the parental input composite that averages these various components of parental investments (see online Appendix Table A2 for details) shows an advantage for girls. Parents are slightly more likely to have reported spanking their boys as compared to their girls in the past week (in kindergarten), although this difference is not statistically significant. Finally, there is a small but statistically 15 Duncan et al. (2007) also fail to find an association between early externalizing behavior and later test scores. 16 In analysis not reported here, we also considered the likelihood of school retention (in grade 5 or grade 8) as an alternative outcome variable. The patterns we uncover throughout this paper on school suspension essentially extend to school retention. 17 There is some evidence that boys and girls may be raised in different family environments due to a small degree of son preference in the United States. For example, Dahl and Moretti (2008) find that girls are more likely to have absent fathers and tend to have more siblings. Similar evidence is also found by Fortin, Oreopoulos, and Phipps (2011) . The gender differences are generally quite small and our failure to find gender differences in the family environment in our sample is likely due to the relatively small sample size in ECLS-K. 18 We find some small gender differences in family SES. In this sample, boys are slightly more likely to be in the lowest two SES quintiles as compared to girls. However, the magnitude of these differences are very small and are only marginally significant at the 10 percent level. significant gender gap in the emotional distance composite we constructed based on questions relating to how close parents feel to their kindergarteners (see online Appendix Table A2 ). In the kindergarten survey, parents of daughters are less likely to report being too busy to play with their child relative to parents of sons. They also feel more loved by their daughters than their sons."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "Directly controlling for the differences in the home environment we observe between boys and girls has a minimal effect on the gender gaps in externalizing behavior and school suspension. This is demonstrated in Table 2 . The first panel of Table 2 presents the estimated gender gap (female dummy) in externalizing behavior in fall of kindergarten (column 1), externalizing behavior in fifth grade (column 2), and school suspension in eighth grade (column 3), controlling for race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birth weight, number of older brothers, number of younger brothers, number of older sisters, number of younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. The second panel (panel B) replicates the same analysis but restricts the sample to those children for which we have nonmissing information on family background and other parental inputs. Panel C adds controls for family type and socio-economic background, all measured at fall-kindergarten: dummies for family structure (single mother, both biological parents, and other family structures), a dummy for teen motherhood, and five dummy variables indicating the family's SES quintiles. As expected based on the evidence in online Appendix Table A5 , adding these controls pretty much leaves the estimated gender gaps in externalizing behavior and school suspension unaffected. Panel D further controls for the parental input measures presented in online Appendix Table A5 , again all measured at fall-kindergarten: the HOME index, the emotional supportiveness index, and parent's disciplinary style. Overall, the addition of controls for family quality and parental inputs (e.g., from panel B to panel D) increase r 2 values by between 0.03 and 0.07. The parental input controls do contribute to reducing the estimated gender gap on both externalizing behavior in fifth grade and suspension in eighth grade, but this effect is quantitatively very small. The gender gap in externalizing behavior in fifth grade goes from \u22120.50 to \u22120.48, and the gender gap in school suspension goes from \u22120.15 to \u22120.14. The estimated gender gap remains virtually the same when we control for these parental input measures in a more flexible manner (results not reported here). Hence, we see little systematic evidence of differences in family background or parental inputs between boys and girls that would directly contribute to boys' conduct problems. Perhaps not surprisingly, to a first degree approximation, boys and girls are raised in fairly similar families and receive fairly similar parental inputs, at least to the extent that these variables are adequately captured in the data.\nYet, similar backgrounds for boys and girls may hide important home influences for the gender gap in noncognitive development. For example, some have raised the possibility that boys raised by single mothers are at a particular disadvantage in terms of behavioral development. This could arise, for example, because single mothers have a preference for girls and disproportionately invest in them. 20 Another possibility is that even if single mothers invest equally in the development of their 20 For example, Lundberg, Pabilonia, and Ward-Batts (2007) find that single moms spend more time with daughters relative to sons than married moms. We report similar evidence in Section III. Notes: Each cell corresponds to a different regression of the outcome (indicated in each column) on a female dummy and background covariates that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. Each row includes a different set of controls. Panel A reports the raw gender gap controlling for the above list of background covariates. Panel B reports the raw gender gap excluding observations with missing observations for parental inputs. Panel C reports the gender gap after controlling for measures of family quality (all measured at fall-kindergarten) that include dummies for family structure (single mother, both biological parents, and other family structures), a dummy indicating whether the mother is younger than 20 at first birth, and five dummy variables indicating the family's SES quintiles. Panel D includes additional controls for parental inputs which include the HOME index, the emotional supportiveness index, and parent's disciplinary style (see online Appendix A2 for details on the construction of these indexes). Panel E further includes controls for school environment (variables listed in online Appendix Table A7 ). Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights (C1_7FP0).

Similar arguments may apply to young and immature mothers who could be less invested in their sons or less effective at controlling their behavior. Another possible argument is that boys, because they are born at a greater risk of developing behavioral and socio-emotional problems (as suggested by the medical literature discussed in the introduction), benefit more from the greater average level of inputs that is typically provided in more educated, richer, or intact families. 21 In other words, boys' noncognitive development may be more responsive to parental inputs as compared to girls.' Hence, while we may not observe any differences in the home environment between boys and girls on average, this does not necessarily imply that the home environment is not a contributing factor to the gender gap in noncognitive skills.\nTo explore this issue, Table 3 focuses on variation in the gender gap in noncognitive skills across family types and other key features of the home environment. Each row corresponds to a different subset of the data and each cell corresponds to a different regression. Reported in each cell is the estimated female dummy based on a separate subsample of the data. Background covariates include race dummies, age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birth weight, number of older brothers, number of younger brothers, number of older sisters, number of younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. We report robust standard errors in brackets. Column 1 reports the estimated gender gap in externalizing behavior in fall-K, column 2 reports the estimated gender gap in externalizing behavior in fifth grade, and column 3 reports the estimated gender gap in the likelihood of any suspension during eighth grade. The various aspects of the home environment are all measured in the fall of kindergarten.\nPanel A focuses on family structure. We compare the gender gap in noncognitive skills across three family structures: intact families (two biological parents), single mothers, and other family structures. 22 Looking across family structures in column 1, the size of the gender gap in externalizing behavior in the fall of kindergarten appears relatively similar across intact and nonintact families. This is confirmed by a formal test of the equality of the gaps, which yields a p-value of 0.269. Strikingly, differential patterns by family structure appear to emerge in grade 5 and grade 8 for externalizing behavior and grade suspension, respectively. In grade 5 (column 2), the gender gap in externalizing behavior more than doubles among children in single mother families and remains constant among children in intact families and those in the \"other\" family structure. The gender gaps in externalizing behavior in fifth grade and suspension in grade 8 (column 3) is smallest in intact families. All other family structures appear detrimental to boys. For example, the gender gap in externalizing behavior in fifth grade goes from \u22120.41 standard deviations among children in intact families to \u22120.77 standard deviations among children raised by a single mother. Also, while the gender gap in eighth grade suspension is only about \u22120.10 among children raised by two biological parents, this gap grows to 21 Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney (2008) show that college-educated and noncollege educated parents allocate different amounts of time to their children, with highly educated parents devoting much more time to their kids compared to lower educated parents. 22 The \"other\" family structure includes a range of family types, such as children with a biological father only, one biological parent and one nonbiological parent, adoptive parents, related guardians, and nonrelated guardians. Notes: Each row corresponds to a different subset of the data. Each cell corresponds to a different regression of the outcome (indicated in each column) on a female dummy and background covariates that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. The p-value for difference at the bottom of each panel tests whether the gender gaps for each subset of the data is statistically different. Sample is restricted to those with nonmissing observations on family structure, mother's age at first birth, family SES, gender, the background covariates, fall-K, and grade 5 teacher ratings of externalizing behavior and parental reports of school suspension in eighth grade. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights. Robust standard errors reported. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.\n\u22120.25 and \u22120.27 for boys raised by a single mother or in other family arrangements, respectively. The p-values reported at the bottom of panel A in columns 2 and 3 strongly reject that the gender gaps are equal across family structures. Of course, family structure correlates strongly with other family background characteristics. One obvious candidate is the family's socio-economic status. For example, the share of children raised by a single mother is about 40 percent in the lowest SES quintile, while that share is only 9 percent in the highest SES quintile. Similarly, only about 44 percent of children in the lowest SES quintile are raised by two biological parents, while more than 80 percent are in the highest SES quintile. In other words, what might be interpreted as the (negative) influence of a missing biological father on boys' noncognitive development might in fact reflect differential returns to other socio-economic inputs by gender. We directly examine the potential role of socio-economic background in the remaining subsamples presented in panel B of Table 3 . We see some evidence of a negative socio-economic gradient in the gender gap in noncognitive skills in the later grades. For example, the gender gap in externalizing behavior in fifth grade is about \u22120.63, \u22120.53, \u22120.53, \u22120.42, and \u22120.35 among children in the lowest, second, third, fourth, and fifth SES quintiles, respectively. Similar to the comparison across family structures, these differential patterns by family SES are not evident in the fall of kindergarten.\nPanel C of Table 3 compares the gender gap in noncognitive skills based on mother's age at first birth. This is another variable that is likely to be strongly correlated to family structure. Indeed, we find that about 47 percent of children raised by a single mother are also children of a mother who was less than 20 years old at the time of a first birth. In contrast, only 19 percent of children in intact families have teenage mothers. Panel C confirms that mother's age at first birth is another strong correlate of the gender gap in noncognitive skills. For example, the gender gap in externalizing behavior in fifth grade is \u22120.78 among children raised by mothers who first experienced motherhood in their teens. It is only \u22120.40 among children raised by mothers that did not experience motherhood until their twenties. The equivalent figures for the gender gap in eighth grade school suspension are \u22120.26 and \u22120.11, respectively. Figure 1 provides some graphical evidence on externalizing problems among boys and girls based on these three family types. We include here all the years in which externalizing behavior is measured in ECLS-K. Panel A contrasts single mothers to intact families. Panel B contrasts families in the lower two and higher three SES quintiles. Finally, panel C contrasts families with mothers that first gave birth in their teens and those that first gave birth in their twenties or later. While females have a much lower incidence of externalizing patterns in all grades, in each panel, the size of the gender gap is similar across family types as kids enter kindergarten. The only group that appears to \"trend\" negatively over time is that of boys raised in \"lower quality\" families (single mothers, lower SES, teenage mothers). Across the other three sets of children, the gaps in externalizing problems remain stable over time. These figures, in combination with the analysis in Table 3 , are consistent with the idea that some features of the home environment are particularly detrimental to boys' noncognitive development. Particularly striking is the widening deficit we observe for boys raised in disadvantaged families over time. In Section III we will explore what drives these relationships. In particular, we will focus on why boys raised by single mothers seem to be at such a disadvantage."}, {"section_title": "B. The school Environment", "text": "Both the home and school environments affect children's early socialization. Therefore, we now turn our attention to possible influences of the early school environment on the incidence of behavior problems among boys. In particular, some psychologists have discussed the possibility that boys are at risk of developing behavioral problems because schools expect too much from them from a very young age, when their brain maturity is not quite on par with that of girls. Parents might be somewhat aware of this, or at least believe in the relevance of this argument in that, as others have pointed out before, they are more likely to hold their sons back when it comes to starting school (a pattern we confirm below). In a popular but controversial book, Sax (2007) argues that many boys develop negative attitudes toward school and exhibit conduct problems because of challenging experiences in kindergarten. He further argues that recent changes in early education are placing more demands on children, with the unintended consequence of disadvantaging many boys. Others have pointed out that the early school environment might be particularly problematic for boys because of the overwhelming share of female teachers, who may either discriminate against boys or be less able to adapt their teaching or disciplining styles to the specific needs of boys (Dee 2006). Finally, it is possible that boys' conduct is particularly responsive to negative peer effects. Boys might be particularly at risk of developing behavioral problems if placed in a classroom with more disruptive kids. We assess the relevance of these various theories by comparing the gender gap in externalizing behavior across these features of the kindergarten and early school environments. In online Appendix Table A7 , we compare average characteristics of the early school environment by gender. There is little difference in the early school environment by gender. Parents are slightly more likely to hold their sons back, but the difference is not very large. The average girl is about 0.25 months younger than the average boy when she starts kindergarten. By and large, it appears boys and girls start their education at schools that are very similar in terms of their academic demands, teaching style, and teacher gender. We also see no differences in average peer characteristics, in particular the share of peers with externalizing problems.\nNot surprisingly, simply controlling for these school-related variables does little to the estimated gender gap in noncognitive skills. This is shown in the last panel of Table 2 , where we present the estimated gender gap in noncognitive skills after controlling for both the home environment and the variables reported in online Appendix Table A7 . The estimated gender gaps in externalizing problems in kindergarten, externalizing problems in fifth grade, and the likelihood of school suspension in eighth grade are essentially unchanged after controlling for these features of the early school environment.\n23 Table 4 assesses whether there are any systematic differences in the gender gap in noncognitive skills based on these features of the early school environment. Again, while these elements of the early childhood environment are essentially balanced across gender, it is still possible that boys are particularly at risk of developing conduct problems in some early school settings.\nWe first compare the gender gap in externalizing behavior and grade suspension across two groups of children based on whether their actual kindergarten entry age was above or below the median age of kindergarten entry among all the children in the sample. 24 The gender gaps in externalizing behavior and grade suspension are 23 Due to the large number of missing observations for some of the school environment variables, in the bottom panel of Table 2 , we use all the observations (with nonmissing values for parental input measures) and include indicator variables for children with missing values on each of the school environment variables. 24 The child's age of entry in kindergarten is a potentially endogenous variable as parents may be more likely to hold their boys back if they judge them to be less ready for school, which is likely to be related to their behavioral maturity. In results available upon request, we also consider a breakdown of the gender gap in noncognitive skills by predicted age of kindergarten entry. The child's predicted age of kindergarten entry is computed based on the child's month of birth and the state cut-off age for kindergarten entry (Elder and Lubotsky 2009) . Children in states where the cut-off is set by local school districts are excluded from the calculation. This measure tells us the age at which a child should enter kindergarten if he/she fully complied with the state cut-off based on his/her month of birth. We have also estimated specifications where we compare children based on whether their actual or predicted kindergarten entrance age is above or below the median kindergarten entrance age in their state of residence. The results are very similar and are available upon request. broadly similar across the two groups of children regardless of whether we use the child's actual or predicted age. This suggests that kindergarten entry age has a limited influence on the gender gap in noncognitive skills. Panel B compares the gender gap in noncognitive skills between public and private kindergartens. Boys' noncognitive deficit appears to be somewhat larger in a public school environment. Of course, this raises the question of the extent to which this has to do with the school or the home environment, as we expect children from more disadvantaged families to be more likely to attend public schools.\nThe next rows of Table 4 focus on specific features of the kindergarten environment. We are particularly interested in comparing how boys are faring behaviorally in more and less regulated kindergarten environments. Again, one of the arguments that has been brought forward by \"pop psychologists\" and relayed in the media is that boys might be unable to cope in kindergartens that force them to pay attention for long periods of time and demand more regulated learning, as their brain might not be mature enough to deal with such structured learning at an early age. To proxy for this, we separate kindergartens based on whether they put above or below median emphasis on reading and math in the full sample, put above or below median emphasis on homework, put above or below median emphasis on achievement and behavior, how much time they spent on physical activity and, how much time they spent on recess. We see strikingly little difference in the Notes: Each row corresponds to a different subset of the data. Each cell corresponds to a different regression of the outcome (indicated in each column) on a female dummy and background covariates that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. The p-value for difference at the bottom of each panel tests whether the gender gaps for each subset of the data is statistically different. Sample is restricted to those with nonmissing observations on family structure, mother's age at firstbirth, family SES, gender, the background covariates, fall-K, and grade 5 teacher ratings of externalizing behavior and parental reports of school suspension in eighth grade. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights. Robust standard errors reported. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level. gender gap in noncognitive skills across these dimensions of how regulated the kindergarten environment is. Similarly, when we separate kindergartens based on whether or not they have a formal retention policy (with the view that a formal retention policy proxies for a more regulated environment), we see little systematic differences in the gender gap. Not surprisingly, a breakdown of the data based on a summary index of how regulated the kindergarten is (which loads positively on emphasis on math and reading, emphasis on homework, and having a formal retention policy) also fails to show large differences. 25 In contrast to the popular claims discussed above, boys appear to be doing relatively better behaviorally and face a smaller risk of school suspension in higher grades when placed in a more regulated kindergarten environment."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "The next characteristic we consider in Table 4 is peer quality. In particular, we compute the gender gap in externalizing behavior and school suspension for children whose kindergarten classroom scored above or below the median in terms of the average level of externalizing problems.\n27 Again, we fail to find any evidence that boys are particularly at risk of behavioral problems if surrounded by more disruptive peers in early school settings.\nFinally, in the remaining rows of Table 4 , we consider another feature of the kindergarten and early school environment, teacher gender. Indeed, as we discussed above, some have also raised the possibility that kindergarten teachers, a large share of them being women, are simply less able or willing to attend to the behavioral and emotional needs of boys. Such a possibility might be a further concern as our measures of noncognitive development are based on teachers' evaluation. So, two things are possible: female teachers do a poor job at emotionally guiding boys (e.g., real effects on boy's behavior), or female teachers are unduly harsh in judging boys (e.g., the gender gap in noncognitive skills we observe is in part the result of biased teacher assessments).\nWe first compare the gender gap in noncognitive skills based on the gender of the kindergarten teacher. Note that the sample of children with a male kindergarten teacher is very small and therefore standard errors are quite large. The gender gap in externalizing behavior in fall-K and school suspension in grade 8 appears smaller among children with a male kindergarten teacher relative to those with a female teacher, although these differences are not significant at conventional levels. Nevertheless, we do not find systematic differences in externalizing behavior in grade 5. If we separate children based on whether all their teachers from kindergarten to grade 5 are female or whether they had at least one male teacher over those grades, we find no systematic difference in the gender gaps. In these tabulations, if anything, the gender gaps appear to be larger among those with at least one male teacher from kindergarten to grade 5 relative to those with all female teachers. 25 We find some evidence that kindergartens that spend more time on recess are associated with smaller gender gaps in externalizing behavior in grade 5, however, this is only marginally significant at the 10 percent level, and we do not see similar patterns for suspension in grade 8. 26 Bertrand and Pan (2011) also considered the possibility that a more regulated kindergarten environment might be only deleterious to boys that enter such an environment at a very young age, but found no evidence for this. 27 We exclude the focal child when computing the average externalizing behavior of a child's peers in the classroom.\nOverall, the evidence in Table 4 is in sharp contrast to the evidence in Table 3 . While we find large differences in the gender gap in noncognitive skills across key features of the home environment, we do not observe systematic patterns across features of the kindergarten environment. These findings motivate the deeper investigation into the parent-children dynamics that we perform in the remaining sections of the paper."}, {"section_title": "III. Why Are Boys Raised by Single Mothers Particularly at Risk?", "text": "One of most striking patterns we have documented so far relates to the especially large gender gap in noncognitive skills in nonintact families that emerge by middle school. Why is this happening? One possibility is that boys raised without a biological father receive especially low levels of parental inputs, parental warmth and emotional supportiveness, or parental expectations, compared to girls raised in similar families. While we already established that there are only small differences in the home environment between boys and girls, it is still possible that this aggregate analysis hides more systematic differences when we hold family structure constant.\nIn online Appendix Table A8 , we therefore reproduce the summary statistics reported in online Appendix Table A5 separately by family structure (single mothers, intact families, other). Again, we prefer to measure these parental inputs in kindergarten to limit reverse causality concerns. For completeness though, we also report averages over the kindergarten to third grade interviews. When it comes to the home environment composite, which loads on parental inputs, such as reading to children or engaging children in extra-curricular activities, we find no evidence that single mothers invest disproportionately more in their girls, while daughters tend to receive slightly more inputs than sons; but this is true both in intact families and in families headed by a single mother.\nHowever, we do observe somewhat larger gender gaps in emotional supportiveness and disciplining style in families headed by single mothers. Specifically, while parents in both intact and broken families report more emotional distance with their sons as compared to their daughters, the gap is larger in broken families. While there is no evidence of a gender difference in the likelihood that parents in intact families spanked their child, boys in broken families are about 13 percentage points more likely to have been spanked in the last week as compared to girls. We see somewhat similar patterns when we measure average parental inputs from kindergarten and third grade. The most robust difference across family structures appears to be with respect to emotional distance. Single mothers appear especially distant from their sons.\n28 One concern with these results is that the incidence of spanking and the lack of emotional support could be a consequence of the child's misbehavior. Note, however, that both these measures were asked in fall-K, and we did not find any evidence of gender differences in externalizing behavior across family structures in the fall of kindergarten. The differences only emerge in the later grades. Therefore, it is unlikely that the gender differences in parental inputs across family structures are simply a response to the child's behavior in fall-K. We will address this concern more formally by including the child's prior externalizing behavior in fall-K as a control in some of our later specifications.\nComplementary evidence of a larger gender gap in investment in families headed by a single mother can be found in other surveys. Using data from the [2003] [2004] [2005] American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID-CDS), Lundberg, Pabilonia, and Ward-Batts (2007) find that single mothers spend more time with daughters relative to sons compared to married mothers. We extend the results of Lundberg, Pabilonia, and Ward-Batts (2007) to the longer time period (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) that is now available in the ATUS (see online Appendix Table A9 ). We find that mothers in stable family structures do not appear to spend significantly less time with their sons than they do with their daughters. In contrast, single mothers spend between 1.2 and 1.4 hours less per week with their sons than their daughters in the sample of kids under 5. In the sample of children under 3 (where endogeneity concerns about parent time allocation are more limited), single mothers spend between 2.1 and 2.3 fewer hours of total childcare with their sons. In summary, the evidence in online Appendix Tables A8 and A9 suggests that boys raised by single mothers might be particularly disadvantaged as they receive lower levels of parental inputs compared to all other groups of children in the sample.\nBut how much of the disparity in the gender gap in noncognitive skills across family structures can these differences in the gender gap in parental inputs explain? Tables 5A and 5B address this question. Specifically, columns 1 and 4 report, by family structure, the estimated female dummy in a regression of externalizing behavior in fifth grade (Table 5A) or suspension in grade 8 (Table 5B) , where we only control for background variables (race dummies, age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birth weight, number of older brothers, number of younger brothers, number of older sisters, number of younger sisters, and number of dummies for region and urbanicity). These gaps are very similar to the raw gaps reported in Table 3. 29 Among children raised by single mothers, boys score about 0.77 of a standard deviation below girls in terms of externalizing behavior in fifth grade. They are about 0.25 percentage points more likely than girls to be suspended in eighth grade (see column 1 in Table 5A and 5B, respectively). The equivalent figures among children raised in intact families are 0.40 and 0.10, respectively (see column 4). Columns 2 and 5 show how this estimated gender gap by family structure is affected by controlling for the parental inputs listed in online Appendix Table A8 . Among children raised by single mothers, the gap in externalizing behavior goes down to 0.71 (column 2, Table 5A ), while the gap in school suspension goes down to 0.23 (column 2, Table 5B ). Not surprisingly, given our findings in online Appendix Table A8 , controlling for parental inputs has a limited impact on the estimated gender gaps in intact families (column 5). The gap in externalizing b ehavior in fifth grade goes down to 0.39, and the gap in school suspension remains at approximately 0.10. Hence, what started as a (0.77 \u2212 0.40)/0.40 = 93 percent larger gap in externalizing behavior among children raised by single mothers has been reduced to a (0.71 \u2212 0.39)/0.39 = 82 percent larger gap. Similarly, the original (0.25 \u2212 0.10)/0.10 = 150 percent larger gap in suspension has been reduced to a (0.23 \u2212 0.10)/0.10 = 130 percent larger gap. In other words, our results are consistent with the view that a small but nontrivial share of boys' higher rate of behavioral problems in single mother families might be due to differences in inputs by child gender. Nevertheless, these findings remain speculative due to the relatively large standard errors of the estimates. Notes: Each column is a separate regression of the female dummy on externalizing behavior in grade 5 (Table 5A) and suspension in grade 8 (Table 5B) for children in two biological parent families and single mom families, controlling for various subsets of variables. Columns 1 and 4 control for background characteristics that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. Columns 2 and 5 include controls for parental inputs (home index, warmth index and discipline harshness) and family quality (mother's age at first birth and family SES). Columns 3 and 6 control for externalizing behavior in the fall of kindergarten. Sample is restricted to those with nonmissing observations on family structure, mother's age at first birth, family SES, gender, the background covariates, fall-K, and grade 5 teacher ratings of externalizing behavior and parental reports of school suspension in eighth grade. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights. Robust standard errors reported. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.\nNext, we explore the possibility that the remaining (large) unexplained difference in the gender gap by family structure may be due to gender differences in the returns to parental inputs and parental quality. We begin by exploring the relationship between externalizing behavior (Table 6A , columns 1-4) and suspension (Table 6A , columns 5-8), and parental inputs across both single mom and intact families, separately by gender. Columns 1 (girls), 2 (boys), 5 (girls), and 6 (boys) of Table 6A include three measures of parental inputs-the HOME index, parental warmth index, and whether the child was spanked last week. The most striking finding is that there is a stronger relationship between parental inputs (measured in kindergarten) Notes: Each column is a separate regression of the female dummy on externalizing behavior in grade 5 (Table 5A) and suspension in grade 8 (Table 5B) for children in two biological parent families and single mom families, controlling for various subsets of variables. Columns 1 and 4 control for background characteristics that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. Columns 2 and 5 include controls for parental inputs (home index, warmth index and discipline harshness) and family quality (mother's age at first birth and family SES). Columns 3 and 6 control for externalizing behavior in the fall of kindergarten. Sample is restricted to those with nonmissing observations on family structure, mother's age at first birth, family SES, gender, the background covariates, fall-K, and grade 5 teacher ratings of externalizing behavior and parental reports of school suspension in eighth grade. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights. Robust standard errors reported. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.\nand further noncognitive development for boys than there is for girls. For example, for boys, above median levels of the HOME index and parental warmth index decrease the likelihood of externalizing behavior in fifth grade by 0.08 and 0.2 standard deviations, respectively. In contrast, we see virtually no relationship between these input variables and girls' externalizing problems in fifth grade. The reliance on harsher disciplining in kindergarten feeds into more conduct problems and a higher likelihood of school suspension in eighth grade for boys. Again, in contrast, there is a much weaker relationship between spanking and noncognitive problems for girls. These findings are particularly relevant in that, as we saw in online Appendix Table A8 , intact families score, on average (across children), higher than broken families on both the HOME index and the warmth index. Notes: Each column is a different regression with teacher reported externalizing behavior in grade 5 (columns 1 to 4) or suspension in grade 8 (columns 5 to 8) as the outcome separately by child gender. The sample is restricted to single mom and two biological parent families. All regressions control for background covariates that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. Columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 includes three variables for parental inputs measured in the fall of kindergarten-the HOME and Warmth Indexes are dummy variables that indicate 1 if the child has a HOME or Warmth score that is below that of the median child in the sample. Spanked child last week is a dummy variable indicating that the parent reported spanking the child at least once in the past week. Column 3, 4, 7, and 8 includes two additional variables that proxy for family quality. The first is a dummy variable that indicates that the child's biological mother was less than 20 at first birth, the second variable is a measure of family SES which comprises five dummy variables that indicate the family SES quintile (the fifth quintile (highest SES), is the reference category. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights. Robust standard errors reported. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.\nColumns 3, 4, 7, and 8 further control for family SES and teenage motherhood. We view these two variables as additional proxies for the quantity and quality of parental inputs. Family SES and teenage motherhood appear to have a larger effect on boys' noncognitive development compared to girls'. Particularly striking is the effect of teenage motherhood. Holding all else constant, boys raised by teenage mothers have externalizing behavior scores (suspension rates) that are 0.55 standard deviations (21 percentage points) higher than boys raised by a nonteenage mother. The equivalent figure for girls is about 0.05 standard deviations (5 percentage points). The fact that boys do especially poorly behaviorally when raised by teenage mothers is particularly relevant to us given the lower share of such mothers in intact families. Table 6B replicates the analysis in Table 6A separately for single mother families (columns 1-4) and families in which both biological parents are present (columns 5-8). The differential returns by gender documented in the first four columns are broadly similar across family types. If anything, they are somewhat larger among children raised by single mothers, especially for teenage motherhood. Although for a number of the other parental input measures, the estimates are often noisier (likely in part reflecting the smaller sample sizes in this subgroup of the data).\nOnline Appendix Table A10 presents the results of the Oaxaca-decompositions associated with the estimation of these regressions. Model 1 considers columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 in Table 6B ; and according to this, it appears that boys' higher returns to the HOME index, parental warmth index, and discipline can explain up to 13 percent of the larger gender gap in externalizing behavior in fifth grade in broken families, and 15 percent of the larger gender gap in eighth grade suspension. Model 2, corresponding to columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 in Table 6B , includes family SES and teenage motherhood; and together, these additional factors explain up to 60 (51) percent of the larger gender gap in externalizing behavior (grade suspension) among broken families. In Table 7 , we present the results of a final model (Model 3), where we replicate the analysis from Model 2 but include one additional control: the child's level of externalizing problems as measured in the fall of kindergarten. In other words, we now hold children's behavior in kindergarten constant and estimate the returns to Table 6A . Columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 includes three variables for parental inputs measured in the fall of kindergarten-the HOME and Warmth Indexes are dummy variables that indicate 1 if the child has a HOME or Warmth score that is below that of the median child in the sample. Spanked child last week is a dummy variable indicating that the parent reported spanking the child at least once in the past week. Columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 includes two additional variables that proxy for family quality. The first is a dummy variable that indicates that the child's biological mother was less than 20 at first birth, the second variable is a measure of family SES which comprises five dummy variables that indicate the family SES quintile (the fifth quintile (highest SES)) is the reference category. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights.

This specification addresses the possibility that differences in the levels and returns to parental inputs could be merely picking up gender differences in initial externalizing behavior. For example, mothers could be spending less time and be less warm toward their boys because boys are more ill behaved than girls, especially in single-parent families. Another possibility is that gender differences in returns could arise because noncognitive problems are more persistent among boys than among girls. By controlling for the child's initial behavior (in fall-K), this gets us closer to being able to interpret our estimated coefficients in Table 7 as evidence of gender differences in the returns to parental inputs. The results in Table 7 and the Oaxaca decompositions in Model 3 in online Appendix Table A10 indicate that controlling for the child's behavior in Notes: Each column is a different regression with teacher reported externalizing behavior in grade 5 (columns 1-4) and suspension in grade 8 (columns 5-8) as the outcome separately by child gender and family structure (single mom and two biological parent families). All regressions control for background covariates that include race dummies (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), age at assessment at fall-K, age-squared, birthweight, number of older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, younger sisters, and dummies for region and urbanicity. Sample is restricted to those with nonmissing observations on family structure, mother's age at first birth, family SES, gender, the background covariates, fall-K, and grade 5 teacher ratings of externalizing behavior and parental reports of school suspension in eighth grade. Observations are weighted using eighth grade parent panel weights. Robust standard errors reported. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.\nthe fall of kindergarten leaves our main findings virtually unchanged. We continue to observe larger returns to higher levels of parental inputs and parental quality for boys compared to girls. Finally, one potential reverse causation story for the differential returns we observe is that parents may systematically adjust their input in response to the behavior of their boys and girls. For example, one possibility is that parents spend more time with boys who are well behaved but do not discriminate when it comes to spending time with girls. Online Appendix Table A11 sheds some light on this issue by estimating dynamic specifications that relate future parental inputs (in grade 3 and grade 5) on past behavior (externalizing behavior in the fall of kindergarten). 30 We estimate these regressions separately for boys and girls in single mother and intact families. We find little evidence that parental inputs, as measured by the HOME Index, are affected significantly by a child's externalizing behavior in kindergarten. This is true for both boys and girls and across family types. When the outcome variable is replaced by the parental warmth index in each grade, unlike the HOME Index, it appears that parental warmth in kindergarten and grade 3 is negatively affected by the child's past behavior. The overall patterns, however, run counter to the idea that parents respond more negatively to boys' misbehavior. For intact families, parental warmth in grade 3 is similarly negatively affected by past behavior for both girls and boys, while for single mom families, an opposite pattern emerges-single moms appear to be more likely to be less warm to their girls who misbehave, but appear unaffected by boys' past behavior. When we look at whether the child was spanked last week as the outcome, we do not find any systematic evidence that the effect of past behavior on spanking is larger for boys than for girls. Overall, the findings from the dynamic regressions suggest that the differential returns documented cannot be fully explained by reverse causation."}, {"section_title": "IV. Conclusion", "text": "While a study of the gender gap in noncognitive skills is of intellectual interest per se, our primary motivation for undertaking this study is the accumulating evidence suggesting that boys' noncognitive deficit might be a primary factor holding them back from completing the higher levels of education that are demanded in the skill-biased economies that now characterize most developed countries. We suggest that boys' higher tendency to act out and develop conduct problems might be particularly relevant to their relative absence in colleges.\nThe biological and medical literatures have rather convincingly established nature-based explanations for boys' noncognitive deficit. The fact that we fail to isolate any subsample of the data where there is no gender gap in noncognitive skills certainly reinforces our belief that biological forces are at play. However, our findings suggest that social, or nurture-based, influences are also important. In particular, we find that boys' higher likelihood to act out and eventually experience a school suspension is about twice as large in the sample of children raised by single mothers, as well as in the sample of children raised by teenage mothers. On the other hand, we fail to find any large or systematic variation in the gender gap in noncognitive skills across some key features of the early school environment, such as age of entry in kindergarten, how regimented or intellectually demanding the school environment is, teacher gender, or peers' noncognitive skills.\nWhen we look deeper into the reasons as to why boys are doing especially poorly when raised by single mothers, we find evidence suggesting that a small but nontrivial part of their disadvantage might be related to differential inputs, with single mothers investing more in their girls and feeling emotionally closer to them. Nevertheless, these findings are imprecise due in part to the small sample sizes, and imperfect input measures available in this dataset.\nMost striking though are our findings regarding gender differences in the noncognitive returns to parental inputs. Across all family structures, we observe that boys' likelihood to act out is sharply reduced when faced with larger and better parental inputs. For girls, the relationship between parental inputs and behavioral outcomes appears to be much weaker. As these parental inputs are typically higher and of better quality in intact families, this largely contributes to why boys with single mothers are so much more disruptive and eventually face school suspension.\nOne noteworthy finding is the widening of the gender gap over time in disadvantaged families. Boys raised in such families appear to be losing more ground after the beginning of formal schooling. This is surprising from the perspective that children spend more time in the home prior to the beginning of formal schooling, and hence, one may have expected home influences to be strongest in those early years. One possible explanation is that the returns to early parental investments are not fully reflected in boys' behavior until later ages. Also, high levels of early parental investments may improve the noncognitive returns to schooling. In any case, this finding seems to warrant further research.\nFrom a broader perspective, our findings are particularly relevant in light of a recent literature documenting a growing socio-economic gradient in the amount of time parents spend with children, with highly educated parents spending increasing amounts of time in childcare-related activities (Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney 2008) . If one takes our findings at face value, higher amounts of parental time might be extremely beneficial to the noncognitive development of boys. Assuming that a certain share of boys are born at the risk of developing behavioral problems, higher levels of parental investment may prevent more of these at-risk boys from developing conduct problems. The fact that the growth in parental time is concentrated among more educated or higher SES families suggests we might see a growing socio-economic gradient in the gender gap in noncognitive skills and, consequently, college completion, and future outcomes."}]
