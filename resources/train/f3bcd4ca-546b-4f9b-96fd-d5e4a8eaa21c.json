[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose-Though clinical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are established risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia, less is known about the relations between vascular health and cognition among individuals without these diseases. Carotid intimal medial thickness (IMT), a measure of subclinical vascular disease, is associated with concurrent decrements in cognitive function, but relatively little research has examined longitudinal relations between carotid IMT and prospective cognitive decline. Methods-We examined relations of carotid IMT to prospective trajectories of cognitive function among 538 (aged 20 to 93, 39% male, 66% white) participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) free of known cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and neurological disease. Participants underwent initial carotid ultrasonography and repeat neuropsychological testing on up to 8 occasions over up to 11 years of follow-up. Mixed-effects regression analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, education, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, smoking, depressive symptoms, and cardiovascular medication use. \nResults-Individuals"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "C linical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are established risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. 1, 2 Reduced cerebral perfusion, metabolic dysfunction, a proinflammatory state, or shared genetic, behavioral, or cardiovascular factors may account for these associations. 2, 3 Relations between vascular health and cognition among individuals without clinical cardiovascular diseases remain less explored. Measures of subclinical disease allow assessment of vascular risk in asymptomatic individuals, providing opportunity for early intervention. 4 Carotid artery intimal medial thickness (IMT), a measure of subclinical vascular disease, predicts future clinical coronary events, coronary heart disease deaths, stroke, frailty, physical decline, and all-cause mortality. 5, 6 Carotid IMT has also been associated with concurrent decrements in cognitive function among community and clinical samples, 7, 8 although findings are equivocal. 7 Longitudinal research linking carotid IMT with prospective cognitive function is more limited. A small number of studies have identified longitudinal relations in populationbased samples, 9,10 but these associations have been restricted largely to performance on brief cognitive screening measures such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Knopman and colleagues found no evidence for an association between carotid IMT and cognitive decline over two time points among middle-aged adults. 11 We investigated relations of carotid IMT to trajectories of cognitive function among participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) free of known cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and neurological disease. Participants completed neuropsychological testing on up to 8 occasions over a span of up to 11 years of follow-up. We examined the association between carotid IMT and prospective performance on 2 cognitive screening measures and an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests assessing verbal and nonverbal memory, attention, concentration, perceptuo-motor speed, executive functions, language, and visuospatial function. To account for potential confounding by variables highly related to carotid IMT or neuropsychological outcomes, 12, 13 we included age, education, gender, race, smok-ing, mean arterial pressure (MAP), body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and depressive symptoms as covariates in all analyses."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were enrolled in the BLSA, a prospective study of community-dwelling volunteers initiated in 1958. Approximately every 2 years, participants visit the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore for medical, psychological, and cognitive testing. Data collection for the present study began in 1994 when carotid ultrasonography was introduced to the BLSA protocol. A total of 804 participants were available for the present study. We excluded participants with coronary artery disease (n\u03ed150), congestive heart failure (n\u03ed6), peripheral arterial disease (n\u03ed30), diabetes (n\u03ed42), carotid endarterectomy (n\u03ed0), cerebrovascular diseases including stroke (n\u03ed23), dementia (n\u03ed14; following protocol published previously 14 ) , and other neurological diseases (n\u03ed1) across all assessment visits.

After exclusions, 538 participants were available for analyses. Because the BLSA uses continuous enrollment procedures, participants have differential start times, numbers of visits, and follow-up times in the project (see Table 1 ). Participants had an average of 2.3 visits (SD\u03ed1.3 visits; range\u03ed1 to 8 visits), and the average time between visits was 2.1 years (SD\u03ed0.9 years; range\u03ed0.5 to 5.5 years).

Mixedeffects regression analyses examined longitudinal relations of carotid IMT to cognitive function. This statistical approach handles inconsistent measurement intervals within and across BLSA participants and accounts for the correlation among repeated measurements on the same participants. 17 Carotid IMT measures were obtained only at one visit, whereas cognitive function and covariates were assessed at that visit and on up to 8 subsequent occasions. Mixed-effects regression adequately handles variable numbers of data points per participant, as one of its strengths is its use of all available data, regardless of length of individual trajectories. Results demonstrate whether carotid IMT predicts trajectories of age-related change in cognitive performance thereafter.\nEach cognitive measure was entered as a single outcome variable in separate sequential mixed-effects regression models. For consistency with prior literature, we first examined the 2 cognitive screening measures (MMSE, Blessed I-M-C) as outcome variables, although significant results were unexpected because of their limited sensitivity in nondemented samples. 12 Primary analyses then examined each neuropsychological test individually. Age, years of education, MAP, BMI, total cholesterol, and depressive symptoms were treated as continuous covariates, and gender, race, smoking, and 18 Carotid IMT (representing overall differences in carotid IMT regardless of longitudinal changes) and a 2-way interaction of carotid IMT with age (representing longitudinal change in cognitive outcomes associated with carotid IMT over time) served as fixed terms of interest. Table 2 shows sample characteristics at first assessment. As expected, preliminary mixed-effects regression analyses revealed nonsignificant findings for Blessed I-M-C and MMSE. In subsequent mixed-effects regression analyses (Table 3) , significant interactions of carotid IMT and age (indicating change over time) were found for BVRT (b\u03ed0.169, P\u03ed 0.049), CVLT immediate free recall (b\u03ed\u03ea0.653, P\u03ed0.026), CVLT long-delay free recall (b\u03ed\u03ea0.185, P\u03ed0.024), RCFT immediate recall (b\u03ed87.0, P\u03ed0.035), RCFT delayed recall (b\u03ed87.9, P\u03ed0.026), and Category Fluency (b\u03ed\u03ea0.373, P\u03ed0.023). A significant main effect of carotid IMT (that was not qualified by an age interaction) was noted for CVLT short-delay free recall (b\u03ed10.4, P\u03ed0.031). For complete results, please refer to supplemental Table II (available online at http://stroke.ahajournals.org). Of note, because raw tests scores were used in analyses, regression coefficients are not directly comparable across test measures. Several outcome measures, including MMSE, Blessed I-M-C, Boston Naming Test, and Trail Making Test Part B, did not meet regression distributional requirements. Following logarithmic transformation (base 10) of these outcomes and associated resolution of distributional violations, we observed no meaningful changes in results."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The Figure depicts significant carotid IMT\u03ebage interactions for BVRT, CVLT immediate free recall, RCFT, and Category Fluency, respectively.

Over time, individuals with greater carotid IMT showed significantly greater prospective decline in performance on multiple measures of verbal and nonverbal memory, including CVLT immediate free recall, CVLT delayed free recall, RCFT immediate recall, RCFT delayed recall, and total errors on the BVRT. In addition, individuals with greater carotid IMT showed a performance decline in Category Fluency, a measure of semantic association fluency and executive function. These findings are important in the context of previous work linking risk of stroke with diminished cognitive performance among individuals without clinical vascular disease or dementia. 19 Subclinical vascular disease is considered a potential mechanism by which stroke risk may translate into reduced cognitive function, 20 and the present study corroborates such a pathway.\nOur findings extend previous longitudinal work relating greater carotid IMT with poorer performance on measures of cognitive function among community-dwelling populations. 9 -11 Our results linking carotid IMT with memory function are consistent with the findings of at least one previous longitudinal study, 10 although there are also discrepant memory findings. 11 Additionally, our findings are an extension of the literature linking various forms of clinical atherosclerosis with diminished cognitive function and decline. 21, 22 Associations between subclinical atherosclerosis and cognition provide further support for a continuous, rather than threshold, effect of suboptimal vascular health on cognition. 23 That is, vascular disease is not required to exceed a certain threshold of severity (clinical or otherwise) to impact cognitive function; instead decrements in cognitive function are likely to be proportional to the degree of underlying vascular disease.\nOur finding that carotid IMT was most pervasively associated with measures of memory, both verbal and nonverbal, is interesting in light of recent evidence linking vascular risk factors with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. 2, 24 Evidence indicates that individuals with vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease demonstrate more considerable overlap in risk factors, brain pathology, and cognitive profiles than previously thought, 2, 25, 26 and individuals with memory difficulties are at particularly increased risk for all-cause dementia. 27 At first glance, the Semantic Fluency finding in the present study is consistent with the decrements in executive function associated with clinical vascular disease. 1, 28 However, it remains difficult to draw a strong conclusion linking carotid IMT with lower levels of executive function in the absence of significant Letter Fluency and Trail Making Test-Part B results, which also measure primarily executive functions. Semantic Fluency may be a more sensitive diagnostic test than Letter Fluency for individuals with Alzheimer disease and other types of neurological disease. 12 This discrepancy may indicate enhanced assessment of memory deterioration by Semantic Fluency than Letter Fluency 29 -a pattern that is consistent with our otherwise pervasive memory findings. Subclinical vascular disease may directly or indirectly affect cognitive function through a variety of mechanisms. Measures of carotid atherosclerosis have been associated with various cardiovascular risk factors, including demographic, metabolic, immunologic, and lifestyle factors, which have been associated with lower levels of cognitive function. 3, 4, 30 Other hypothesized mechanisms include a common genetic vulnerability (eg, presence of apolipoprotein E 4 allele), chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, silent micro-and macrocerebrovascular disease, and other associated structural brain changes, such as cortical atrophy. 8, [31] [32] [33] For example, among asymptomatic individuals, greater carotid IMT is associated with increased frequency of silent cerebral lesions, 34 which in turn are associated with reduced cognitive function. 35 Strengths of this investigation include its longitudinal design, that minority participants constituted about one third of the sample, frequency of testing, length of follow-up, and extensive neuropsychological battery. Our inclusion of timedependent covariates also represents a strength. Limitations include a single assessment of carotid IMT and use of an ever/never definition of cigarette smoking. Also, the study was based on a convenience sample of typically highly educated participants. The homogeneity and nonrepresentative nature of the sample may limit the generalizability of the study, although the sample's homogeneity may also restrict the influences of confounding demographic variables. Future research should continue to examine which cognitive domains are particularly related to carotid IMT and other subclinical vascular disease measures. Current inconsistencies across findings in this area are likely a byproduct of variability in study populations, follow-up times, number of follow-up visits, domains tested, and neuropsychological tests used. Future longitudinal investigations would benefit from careful examination of these factors and their associated effects on study results and interpretations. Variables mediating or moderating the relation between carotid IMT and accelerated cognitive decline also necessitate further examination."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Our findings suggest that relatively healthy individuals with greater carotid IMT demonstrate more pronounced memory decline over time than those with lesser carotid IMT. Evidence that carotid IMT predicts accelerated cognitive decline among such persons underscores the importance of early intervention to delay or reduce atherosclerosis and improve vascular health before symptom manifestation. Such intervention (eg, pharmacological, behavioral) may delay onset of cognitive decline, slow cognitive aging, and perhaps delay or protect against clinical cognitive diagnoses."}]
