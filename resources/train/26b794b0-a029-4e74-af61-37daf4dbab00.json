However, these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are usually not the functional variants driving the association and, in many cases, regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) prevents identification of a single candidate gene in the region. Often, additional studies are required to demonstrate unambiguously that the gene and/or variant implicated in disease risk is functionally related to pathogenesis.\nRecently, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) identified 11 new loci (p < 10 \u00c08 ) associated with risk for\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), and 13 additional suggestive loci (p value between10 \u00c06 and 10 \u00c08 ) . Among the latter group, there is an inter-genic SNP (rs9381040; p < 6.3 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 ) located 5.5 Kb downstream from TREML2 and 24 Kb upstream from TREM2. The TREM and TREM-like receptor genes clustered on chromosome 6p21.1 (Ford and McVicar, 2009 ) have different patterns of LD among them . This genomic region has previously been implicated in genetic risk for AD Bertram et al., 2013; Cruchaga et al., 2013; Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2012; Reitz and Mayeux, 2013) . A low frequency missense variant in TREM2 (p.R47H, minor allele frequency \u00bc 0.003) was reported to substantially increase risk for AD Guerreiro et al., 2013) . SNPs in this region were also found to be associated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for AD (phospho-tau 181 levels) . Because of the design of the IGAP study (a meta-analysis) and the low frequency of the TREM2 variant, it was not possible to determine whether the GWAS signal of this variant (rs9381040) was independent of the TREM2-p.R47H variant. In this study, we used exome-sequencing data to identify the most likely functional variant in TREML2 responsible for the GWAS signal and to determine whether this signal is independent of TREM2-p.R47H (rs75932628) variant."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Exome sequencing Knight-Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC)", "text": "Enrichment of coding exons and flanking intronic regions was performed using a solution hybrid selection method with the SureSelect human all exon 50 Mb kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's standard protocol on 46 unrelated AD cases and 39 unrelated controls from the Knight-ADRC.\nThis was performed by the Genome Technology Access Center at Washington University in St Louis (https://gtac.wustl.edu/).

Conditional analysis was performed to identify additional independent signals by conditioning on the top case-control GWAS hits. We first estimated the odds ratios for SNPs across cohorts. These models calculate crude odds ratios and confidence intervals from counts of heterozygous in case patients and control subjects in each study. Then we performed a fixed-effect model to combine the odds ratios from study-specific estimates into a summary measure. No multiple-testing correction was used in our analyses.

Briefly, CSF ptau values were log transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Because the CSF levels were measured using different platforms (Innotest plate ELISA vs. AlzBia3 beadbased ELISA, respectively), we were not able to combine the raw data. We extracted from the log-transformed value, the mean within each series for the log-transformation. No significant differences in the transformed CSF values of the different series were found.

Only 3 variants exhibit a MAF % higher than 1%: p.V25A (MAF \u00bc 5%), p.T129S (MAF \u00bc 4.5%), and p.S144G (MAF \u00bc 30%). Interestingly, according to our exome sequencing results all these variants are more common in control subjects than in AD cases, however they did not reach statistical significance with our whole-exome sequence sample size, although the three of them are more common in control subjects than AD cases (Table 1) , respectively) (Fig. 1, panel D) , suggesting that the TREML2 and TREM2 signals are independent from each other.\nWe also performed a linear regression analysis for rs9381040 and rs3747742 with CSF levels of tau and ptau (n \u00bc 1269 individuals) . rs9381040 (p \u00bc 4.11 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , beta \u00bc \u00c00.02) and rs3747742 (p \u00bc 1.4 \u00c2 10"}, {"section_title": "\u00c04", "text": ", beta \u00bc \u00c00.02) both exhibit a strong association with CSF ptau levels. The respective associations with CSF ptau are no longer significant when either SNP is included as a covariate in the conditional analysis. These results confirm via 2 independent datasets that the associations of rs9381040 and rs3747742 with CSF biomarker levels and with AD risk represent the same signal. The TREM2-p.R47H variant was also genotyped in a subset of the CSF samples (n \u00bc 835). In these samples, 3 variants, rs9381040 (p \u00bc 0.04, beta \u00bc \u00c00.02) (Fig. 2 , panel A), rs3747742 (p \u00bc 0.02, beta \u00bc \u00c00.02) (Fig. 2, panel B) , and rs75932628 (p \u00bc 0.0016, beta \u00bc 0.2) (Fig. 2 , panel C) demonstrate a nominally significant association with CSF ptau levels. To determine whether the TREML2 signal (rs3747742) is independent of TREM2-p.R47H, we removed all of the p.R47H carriers from the analysis. rs3747742 remained significantly associated with CSF ptau levels (p \u00bc 0.03) (Fig. 2, panel D) . Furthermore, when TREM2-p.R47H was included in the model as a covariate for rs3747742 analysis, the association remained significant (p \u00bc 0.02), which suggests that the TREM2 and TREML2 signals are independent. Importantly, these associations confirmed the direction of the effect on CSF ptau levels: the minor allele of rs3747742 is associated with lower ptau levels (beta \u00bc \u00c00.02) and is predicted to be protective for AD risk (OR \u00bc 0.91; CI \u00bc 0.86e0.97), while the minor allele of TREM2-p.R47H is associated with an increased risk for AD (OR \u00bc 1.91, CI \u00bc 1.85e1.97) and higher levels of CSF ptau (beta \u00bc 0.2).\nIn addition, TREM and TREM-like receptors modulate the innate immune response by either amplifying or dampening Toll-like receptor-induced signals, playing critical roles in fine-tuning the inflammatory response (Ford and McVicar, 2009 ). TREM and TREMlike receptors demonstrate different patterns of expression and are likely to play different roles in the inflammatory response. To further understand the relative expression of TREM2 and TREML2, we analyzed gene expression in primary mouse microglia and astrocytes stimulated by IL-1b. Treatment of microglia with IL-1b repressed expression of TREM2 (Fig. 3, panel A) , but increased expression of TREML2 (Fig. 3, panel B) . The opposing effects of this inflammatory cytokine on TREM2 and/or TREML2 expression is consistent with our genetic data and with evidence that TREM2 and/or DAP12 antagonizes inflammatory signaling in microglia while TREML2 is not coupled to DAP12 signaling and plays a proinflammatory role (Ford and McVicar, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In summary, these results demonstrate that the associations of missense variants in TREM2 and TREML2 with AD risk are independent. Moreover, our analyses suggest that the AD-associated GWAS signal is likely driven by the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742); it results in a similar odds ratio to rs9381040. We also validated 2 other coding variants p.V25A and p.S129T in TREML2 gene in moderate LD (r 2 \u00bc 0.05 and D 0 \u00bc 1) with the GWAS SNP, which both exhibited a higher frequency among control subjects than in AD cases (Table 1) . However, for both variants we only obtained data by whole-exome sequencing which limited our analysis about the role that these variants may play in the association of TREML2 with AD risk. To prove that these additional variants are associated with AD risk we will need a larger sample size. Additionally, the purpose of this study was to find a functional coding variant in the TREML2 gene that could explain the association for TREML2 which was found in the recent IGAP metaanalysis. Our data suggest that there is a coding variant in TREML2 that could explain the GWAS signal, but our data cannot rule-out of the presence of functional variants outside of the coding region. We conclude that at least 2 genes in this gene cluster influence risk for AD: TREM2-p.R47H is associated with increased risk for AD (OR \u00bc 1.91, CI \u00bc 1.85e1.97) and TREML2-p.S144G is associated with reduced risk for AD (OR \u00bc 0.91; CI \u00bc 0.86e0.97). The mechanisms by which these variants influence AD risk are not currently understood, but it has been suggested that modulation of microglial activation might influence clearance of Ab (Benitez et al., 2011) . These results underline the importance of the inflammatory response in modulating risk for AD and suggest that other genes in this gene family may also harbor risk alleles for AD."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors report no conflicts of interest.
