In this sense, teacher and students negotiate the actual curriculum -as opposed to the ideal or intended curriculum (for example, as written up in a curriculum guide). Superficially, this negotiation is visible in the give-and-take of classroom talk (Flanders, 1970) . However, such ostensible interaction clearly is pedagogically less significant than the cognitive interaction that occurs -or does not occur, as the case may bebetween teacher and students. When minds meet in this way, the result is a sequence of shared understandings of subject matter among members of the class, and the course of instruction, whether considered on any given day or examined over an entire school year, may be analyzed in terms of how classroom talk and activities modify and expand these understandings. In this sense, dialogic instruction is a negotiation of meaning by and between teacher and students.\nWe observed hundreds of eighth-and ninth-grade lessons over 2 years. In all our observations, we never found the \"perfectly dialogic classroom\"; indeed, such a perfect classroom probably does not exist in the real world.

Surpeys and interviews. We sought first to determine practices and attitudes toward classroom discourse by surveying both students and teachers on various classroom practices; in addition, we interviewed the teachers to learn about their instructional methods and the context of instruction. 2. Class observations. Through direct observation, we investigated teachers' allocation of class time to various types of classroom discourse, including recitation, discussion, and small-group work. We collected data allowing us to gauge the quality of teacher-student interaction by focusing on the characteristics of questions asked by both teachers and students."}, {"section_title": "OPENING DIALOGUE", "text": "\n\nCognitive Level. Our project also sought to assess whether the cognitive level of questioning affects student learning. In this way we examined whether instruction stressing higher-order thinking is necessarily dialogic. We therefore coded the level of cognitive functioning that each question sought to elicit, judging it high to the extent that the question could not be answered \"through the routine application of previously learned knowledge\" (Newmann, 1990, p. 44; see also Polanyi's (1958) distinction between routine performances and heuristic acts). Like autiienticity, the cognitive level of questions cannot be judged altogether from words alone. For example, if the teacher expected students to answer questions by reciting information found in textbooks, we coded questions as reports regardless of their linguistic structure. Hence, although a why-question normally will elicit an analysis, it will elicit a report if the teacher's focus is the recitation of a textbook's analysis rather than the class' reflection; then \"Why?\" really means, \"According to your text, why did it happen this way? Do you remember?\" Factors affecting the cognitive level of any question include the following:\n1. Source of the question. The same question that elicits an analysis from a person who has to figure things out may well elicit a report from another, more knowledgeable individual who already knows and simply needs to explain. For example, \"Why did Odysseus and his men plan deliberately to blind Polyphemus?\" may elicit an analysis from students (assuming, of course, that they have to figure out the answer and not merely recite their textbook on the point), but most likely will elicit a report if a student asks a teacher who already knows the answer. When we were unclear, we asked about it after class.\n2. Experience, ability, and prior knowledge of the person answering the question, whether student or teacher. If student answers seemed to require routine cognitive operation, we coded questions as eliciting reports. We defined prior knowledge as \"prior to the previous night's homework.\"^ 3. Nature of the instructional activity. When an episode was devoted to review, our normal expectation for responses was a report, even if questions had the linguistic form of higher-level questions (e.g., \"What's the difference between a symbol and an image?\" when asked as a study question). We coded questions as records if they elicited descriptions of what students were observing, feeling, or diinking at the time of the question. Examples include: \"Any questions on that?\" and \"What [or why] are you thinking about that?\" If the question required students to think and not just report something already Imown or previously thought by someone else, then we scored cognitive level higher than 2. Determining the level involved judging whether the student answering the question was building up a generalization, in which case we scored it a 3, or breaking down an argument, in which case we coded it as an analysis and rated its cognitive level as 4. Generalizations display inductive reasoning, building up ideas rather than breaking them down. They address questions such as: \"What happens?\" and \"What do I make of what happens?\" They tie things together; they are not restatements of information. Analyses display deductive reasoning, brealdng concepts, ideas, and arguments down rather dian building up ideas. To be scored as analyses, questions had to require more than restatements of known information. Questions were judged to be lower order (i.e., ehciting records or reports) if they elicited old information, or higher order (i.e., eliciting generalizations, analyses, or speculations) if they elicited new information and could not be answered through the routine application of prior knowledge.'^ Unless texts explicidy stated the answers to teachers' questions, we judged most questions about literary texts to be either generalizations or analyses. Hence, from a ninth-grade class session on To Kill a Mockingbird, the question, \"How does Tom die?\" ehcited a report since the answer is stated in the novel. By contrast, \"What's the overall reaction of most of Maycomb's citizens?\" ehcited an analysis since the answer required taking into account and relating disparate information from the text. We found that questions like, \"What is die meaning ofx.?\" or \"What is x?\" ehcited either (a) a report if, in recitation, the teacher's intent was to see whether students knew it; (b) a generalization if x was a word and the teacher's intent was to elicit an original definition; or (c) an analysis if x was a phrase in a book, a line in a play, a symbol, and so forth, and the teacher asked students to situate or relate a part of the text (phrase, line, symbol) to the whole, for example, \"So how do we explain x?\" In these cases we coded recitations of meaning as reports, and explications of meaning as generalizations and analyses.\nNonetheless, most of the teachers in the urban schools said discussion and small-group work were impossible. They generally had resigned themselves to worksheets and newspapers as the best they could offer. Most just tried to keep order in their classrooms, especially through seatwork, which was the dominant mode of instruction, averaging more than 21 minutes a day. On top of this, eighth-grade urban teachers lectured about 6 minutes a day. Even question-answer exchanges involved too much interaction for these teachers, and it averaged only about 9 minutes a day versus 14 minutes for suburban students and nearly 19 minutes for rural students. Unsurprisingly, discussion was rare in these classes, averaging only 45 seconds a day.\nEighth-grade urban teachers asked about as many authentic questions (13%) as suburban teachers did (12%) but twice as many as rural teachers (6%). In ninth-grade classes, these differences were even more pronounced: 33% of teacher questions asked in urban classes were authentic compared with 22% in suburban classes and 9% in rural classes, although in a subsequent analysis (see p. 58), we discovered that many authentic questions did not concern literature or anything academic. Tables 2.5 and 2.6 summarize these and other data.\nIn grade 9, seatwork in urban classes diminished to about 7 minutes a day, whereas lecture increased to almost 9 minutes a day and question-answer increased to 18. This was the case even though, unlike the eighth-grade classes, the average number of students in ninth-grade urban classes (about 25) was notably higher than either suburban (22) or rural (19) classes. Tables 2.4 and 2.6 summarize these and additional data.\nSuburban Classes. Most suburban teachers in our sample said they prized student autonomy: the ability and willingness to articulate and defend ideas. The suburban teachers were clearly more up-to-date on leading-edge pedagogy and professional buzzwords than were the urban teachers. The fundamental province of their instruction, as they saw it, was the life of the mind.\nDiscussion commonly was cited as a goal for all classes; one teacher represented the expressed views of the others when he said, \"It is important for students to participate, to feel free to voice their opinions, to present divergent opinions without feeling intimidated, to do the work, be motivated, and be free and willing to discuss literature.\" His goals for students were excitement and depth of understanding. Another teacher wanted all his students to \"discuss, contribute, and offer original ideas.\"\nIn fact, we observed more teacher-student interaction in the suburban than in the urban schools, especially in eighth-grade classes. The suburban teachers did less lecturing than the urban (4 minutes a day versus 6), and their students did less seatwork (15 minutes a day versus more than 21). Yet"}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.1A.

Results of groupwork cannot be predicted before class.\nStudent Production of Knowledge. In addition to promoting coherent conversation, the second example encourages students to generate insights and understandings far more than the first session. In activities such as completing worksheets and answering study questions, students are required mainly to manipulate and master information provided by the teacher or a textbook. This work calls only for lower-order cognitive activity, characterized by questions with prespecified right and wrong answers, and it tends not to be very coherent because it does not build on student responses. It consequently fails to result in student production of knowledge. Here is an example.\nEveryone put their name in the upper right. Put your name and your period and the group number in the upper right-hand corner. Now I've gone over two or three times your group number so you should remember it -when you get into your groups, if you have forgotten it, maybe somebody in there will remember it. Now you are to combine eight sentences to form the kind of sentence shown in parentheses, okay? And I mean that . . . when I say a simple sentence, that's what I mean: a simple sentence that has one subject and one predicate. When I say compound sentence, I mean two sentences of equal value and equal importance, put together with a conjunction or a semicolon or a transitive adverb, okay? Complex sentences: you will be asked to either write one with an adjective clause or an adverb clause. And because there were no noun clauses, I have given you a task down below here to write two sentences with noun clauses. Now, all of the sentences up above -the first eight -are all about Niagara Falls and the river and stuff like that, and though it isn't absolutely important that you focus on the Niagara River, it would be kind of nice if you did it, all right?\nIn another example, from another class, the teacher puts students to work in groups on a worksheet concerning Greek gods.\nI know you won't finish the entire chart, but we will be starting . . .\nsharing, because what we want to be sure is that everyone has the same items on the chart. So I will give you the next 15 minutes ... to just work on what you have. Be sure if you haven't -some of you maybe start from the back; we won't get them all checked today so that you have the chart. This is the chart that you will have to memorize, you will be tested on it... I want to make sure you all have the same information.\nIn both these examples, the groupwork involves little or no production of knowledge. In other groups, by contrast, students must sustain a coherent discussion in order to work out problems that generate new understandings.\nTypically, this groupwork proceeds in response to open-ended questions with more than one acceptable answer and involves higher-order cognitive activity.\nIn the following transcript, for example, the teacher asks students to predict the ending of an Agatha Christie novel. To get them thinking, she first asks them to write a brief plot summary.\nIn a paragraph, write out what happened, what you think happenedand talk it out first, because there are a lot of lights going on in your eyes, and some of you are still saying, \"I have no idea.\" Get together in your group, and on a sheet of loose-leaf tell me what happened.\nAs students work, the teachers says:\nAs I came around, a lot of you picked up a lot of the clues as to how she might have been killed and, so then, who would have done it. Whoever you're accusing, think about a motive -so some of you are saying."}, {"section_title": "224", "text": "Number of coded questions 12,033 11,043"}, {"section_title": "Discourse Episodes and Segments", "text": "Data from each class session were organized according to episodes and segments.

For example, in addressing a particular objective, a teacher might initiate a question-and-answer session that then would be interrupted by brief periodic lectures and culminate in a homework assignment. When something like this happened, we divided the episode into segments, defined as any coherent part of an episode that differed from other activities of the episode.

Observers wrote a brief description of each episode and recorded and coded each question asked by either the teacher or students.\nWe defined discussion as the free exchange of information among students and/or between at least three students and the teacher that lasted at least a half minute. Typically discussions came about during question-answer exchanges when a student would volunteer an observation (rather than ask a question) that the teacher allowed to substitute for normal evaluation. These discussions, which interrupted or violated the normal initiation-responseevaluation (IRE) sequence of recitation, included few questions, and those that were asked typically clarified ideas and information (\"By that do you mean . . ."}, {"section_title": "Questions", "text": "Bakhtin's conception of discourse encompasses far more than just questions and the utterances immediately preceding and following them: As we saw in Chapter 1, Balditin's chains of utterances also encompass frames of mind and core beliefs, including those related to students' experience out of school. Dialogic analysis is most direcdy accomplished through close analysis of transcripts of individual lessons and other forms of qualitative analysis, especially of the sort Dyson undertakes in her Social Worlds of Children Learning to Write (1993) . Although our study undertook some such analysis (see Chapter 3), the main focus of our research was a comprehensive analysis of classroom discourse, generally with a special focus on teacher and student questions. We did this for several reasons. First, we wanted to capture the general dimensions of instruction, requiring us to examine hundreds of instructional episodes and lessons. We focused on question-answer exchanges because they provide an effective method for such a general analysis, and because they are so central to instruction, occupying 30% of class time in the eighth-grade classes we studied and 42% in the ninth-grade classes. Question-answer exchanges between teachers and students clearly dominate instruction for most students. They play a key role in both accommodating and excluding student voices in the public, authoritative discourse of the classroom, and they are the central instructional mechanism in American classrooms for assigning epistemic roles to students. As such, they significantly regulate the extent to which teacher-student interaction can be dialogic.\nTwo features of questions were of particular interest to us: authenticity (whether or not teacher questions had \"prespecified\" answers) and uptake (incorporation of previous answers into subsequent questions). Each is a critical variable affecting the salience of student voices in classroom discourse, and reflecting how far the horizons of classroom discourse extend beyond the question-answer sequences themselves to draw on student experience central to student engagement. While these data cannot detail the dynamics of particular teacher-student interactions, they nonetheless provide a powerful index of the extent to which teachers open their classes to student voices when they ask the questions they do.\nQuestions are not everything, of course, and authentic questions, we found, do not invariably produce learning. Nonetheless, one must not underestimate the role teachers' questions play in shaping the character of classroom discourse as it affects learning. Questions presume answers. As negotiations of sorts, question-answer sequences reveal important features of teacherstudent interaction and hence the character of instruction. Much can be learned about teacher-student interaction and talk in a classroom by determining the source of questions, the extent of authenticity and uptake, the level of cognitive activity that questions elicit, and so on. Even the pace of a teacher's questioning can be revealing: Carlsen (1991) cites studies finding that a slow pace of teacher questioning and extended wait times correlate with greater numbers of student responses (Honea, 1982) , as well as more sustained student responses of greater complexity and higher-order thinking (Fagan, Hassler, & Szabl, 1981) .\nEarly in our study, we learned that the vast proportion of teacher questions (a) are test questions, (b) get a response, (c) do not involve uptake, and (d) elicit a report of what is already known. Indeed, this is the very profile of monologic classroom discourse, and we soon began to describe such questions, unfortunately, as normal teacher questions. The following questions, all from Mr. Schmidt's lesson described in Chapter 1, are examples:\n\u2022 \"According to the poet, what is the subject of The Iliad?'' \u2022 \"Where does the action of the first part of Book I take place when we enter the story?\" \u2022 \"What is the result of the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles?\"\nWe used data about questions to build profiles of instruction and classroom discourse, coding more than 23,000 questions, and examining each question in the context of the whole lesson at the time it was asked.^ Ninthgrade classes were tape recorded. Whenever observers were uncertain about how to interpret classroom activities and code questions, they consulted with the teacher after class. Questions were coded for Coding reliabilities were based on paired readings of a sample of questions.^ During the ninth-grade study, observers collected data using a specially written computer program, CLASS 2.0,'* during class. This program helped with question coding, as well as the allocation and timing of various instructional activities, which the observer recorded by selecting from a menu and then briefly described. Every 5 minutes during question-answer exchanges and every 2 minutes during seatwork and lecture, the program prompted the observer to record the number of students obviously off task,^ as well as the number actively participating, and to make adjustments in the number of students in case any recendy had entered or left the classroom.\nDuring question-answer exchanges, the observer typed in and coded the questions that teachers and students asked during instruction. As observers entered each question into computer memory, the program prompted them for codings. When data collection was completed, CLASS-EDIT 2.0, a companion program to CLASS 2.0, allowed proofreading, editing, and revising of each file for inappropriate codings, and then computed basic statistics for each episode. Generally, we were satisfied that these procedures were minimally intrusive to instruction during our observations. Authenticity. Authentic questions are questions for which the asker has not prespecified an answer and include requests for information as well as open-ended questions with indeterminate answers. Dialogically, authentic teacher questions signal to students the teacher's interest in what they think and know and not just whether they can report what someone else thinks or has said. Authentic questions invite students to contribute something new to the discussion that can change or modify it in some way.\nBy contrast, a test question allows students no control over the flow of the discussion. Because authentic questions allow an indeterminate number of acceptable answers and open the floor to students' ideas, they work dialogically. By contrast, a test question allows only one possible right answer, and is hence monologic (in Lotman's terms, univocal; see Chapter 1).\nBefore we started our observations, we worried that determining the authenticity of questions might be complicated and unreliable since such determination requires assessing teachers' intentions; authenticity cannot be determined from words alone. For example, \"Who won the World Series in 1928?\" can be either a test question or an authentic question depending on (a) whether the asker knows the answer and wants to see if the person asked also loiows, in which case it is a test question, or (b) whether the asker doesn't\nThe character of instructional questions in the classes we observed was consistent with the monologic organization of class time. More commonly than not, students were treated as \"empty vessels\" to be \"filled\" by teachers. In virtually all classes, the teacher asked nearly all the questions; few about literature were authentic, and equally few followed up on student responses. In the eighth-grade classes (see Table 2 .5), about 35 questions on average were asked during each class, 92% of them by the teacher. Only 12% of the teacher questions were authentic, and only 11% exhibited uptake.'^ In the ninth-grade classes (see Table 2 .6), teachers asked more than 52 questions each class period on average, or about 50% more than in the eighth-grade classes: 54% of all questions involved recitation. These results help explain National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) results, which perennially show that American students are far more proficient at literal comprehension than at analysis and critical thinking (see, e.g., Applebee, Langer, Mullis, Latham, & Gentile, 1994).\nGiven the infrequency of authentic questions in eighth grade, we were surprised to find that the proportion in ninth-grade classes was twice as high. Indeed, authentic questions were asked in all the ninth-grade classes we observed; half the classes routinely had 25% or more. In subsequent analysis, we discovered that much of the increase was due to the use of authentic questions to inquire about nonacademic topics. Uptake also was more common in ninth-grade classes, exhibited by 26% of all questions. Like eighth-grade instruction, however, most ninth-grade classroom interaction tended to be monologic, permitting littie opportunity for substantive exchange."}, {"section_title": "LANGUAGE AND LEARNING IN HUNDREDS OF ENGLISH LESSONS 39", "text": "know and wants to find out by asking someone who does know, in which case it is authentic.\nThe nature of the activity, that is, the genre of classroom discourse, we discovered, is the most reliable indicator of authenticity. Hence, when teachers began a lesson by saying, \"Okay, class, let's check the answers to your study questions,\" we quickly learned that the questions were invariably test questions (although follow-up discussions of students' answers were sometimes authentic). By contrast, when teachers asked about students' personal experiences as lead-ins, for example, to open-ended discussions of a poem or short story, we found that these questions were authentic. In Chapter 1, Ms. Turner's initial question, \"Can you recall things from Huck Finn that, um, seemed racist to you?\" is an example. Questions asked during discussions, for example, the question Tom asks John in Ms. Lindsay's class, \"Is it Mr. Hollings's store? Is that it?\" are also authentic since their purpose is not testing someone's knowledge but rather exchanging only that information the person asking the question actually needed to know.\nWhenever the authenticity of a question was unclear or ambiguous to us, we consulted the teacher. In practice (and somewhat to our initial surprise), coding authenticity proved to be generally quite straightforward. We quickly learned that most classroom discourse is not subtie: The vast proportion of questions teachers ask are test questions, whereas student questions are virtually always authentic (except when students role play teachers; then they ask test questions!).\nUptake. Uptake occurs when one conversant, for example, a teacher, asks someone else, for example, a student, about something the other person said previously (Collins, 1982) . Here is an example of uptake from a ninthgrade lesson on The Iliad: The teacher asks, \"What do they have to do to Polyphemus?\" A student replies, \"Blind him.\" The teacher then follows up, asking, \"How come the plan is for Winding Cyclops?\" Uptake occurs here when the teacher picks up on the student's response, asldng about \"blinding\" him. Uptake often is marked by the use of pronouns, for example, \"How did it work?\"; \"What caused if?\"; \"What city grew out of this?''

In 1912, Stevens complained that the widespread practice of recitation made \"the classroom the place for displaying knowledge instead of a laboratory for getting and using it\" (p. 16).

Our data also show that lowtrack students, in contrast to high-track students, engaged in far more clerical as opposed to compositional tasks; indeed many of their so-called \"writing\" tasks, such as filling-in-the-blanks, were not discourse at all. Their writing was more formulaic, and the level of response to their writing was low. In these low-track classes, the terms of reciprocity were limited mainly to procedures.\nTo examine differences between high-and low-track classes, we compared the two groups on allocation of instructional time and all discourse variables. In eighth grade, both groups spent 40% or more class time doing seatwork. The biggest differences were in time devoted to lecture -the teacher lectured to low-track students 40% more than to high-track students -and to discussion, which occupied nearly twice as much time in high-track classes than in low, hence giving a more dialogic tone to the high-track classes (even though the proportion of authentic teacher questions and uptake did not differ much). In ninth grade, seatwork occupied almost 13 minutes a day (29% of instructional time) in the low-track classes but less than 4 minutes (8%) in the high-track classes. Both groups spent close to 9 minutes in lecture and less than 1 minute in discussion, but the high-track classes spent more time doing small-group work and answering questions. (Tables 2.3 These results are consistent with our earlier research (Nystrand &: Gamoran, 1988) , which found that students in low-achieving classes are far more likely than their higher-achieving counterparts to be involved in fragmented, contrived learning. Using survey data, we found that students in low-achieving eighth-and ninth-grade English classes In their responses to the papers of students in low-achieving classes, teachers commented\n\u2022 2.3 times as much about spelling (in marginal and terminal comments)\n\u2022 1.8 times as much about punctuation\n\u2022 2 times as much about grammar"}, {"section_title": "LANGUAGE AND LEARNING IN HUNDREDS OF ENGLISH LESSONS", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nAs we examined the range of activities that we had coded as small-group work, we confirmed our initial impression that \"small-group time\" was a misleading category because of important differences among the activities that occurred in small groups. We can illustrate these contrasting activities by focusing on two dimensions of work in small groups: student autonomy and student production of knowledge. Small-group activities occurred in only 29 of the 216 class sessions we observed. The small-group sessions averaged about 15 minutes when they occurred, but because they were so infrequent, small-group time accounted for less than 2 minutes of the average 50-minute period among all the classes. The groupwork we observed was usually closer to collaborative seatwork than to student problem-solving and autonomous groupwork.\nStudent Autonomy. Teachers shape groupwork by assigning tasks and establishing parameters of interaction. In highly \"prescripted\" groupwork, the parameters are defined entirely by the teacher, and the task could just as easily be done without interaction among students. The group setting is gratuitous, used perhaps more for the teacher's convenience. Here is an example from a ninth-grade English class.\nToday while you are working in groups you will keep the same groups that you had yesterday. The same rules will apply, and those are: You must, as a group, form a tight circle; you must bring all of your materials with you to that group and you may NOT get up from your seat; your voice must stay at a whisper -if I can hear you above anyone else's, that means you are too loud and your name will go up on the 66 OPENING DIALOGUE board. You may do one of two things in your group. You may continue to work on your paper -there are five, probably six people I have to see yet in conference. If you are as far as you can go in your groups with your papers -that is, editing, proofreading, all of those -then as a group, I would hke you to see if you can fill in the blanks on this handout on five basic sentence patterns: how to find them, what questions to ask. And we will go over this. Remember one section of your binders should be sentence patterns.\nThis groupwork, so completely structured by the teacher, promotes neither ownership nor coherent discussion.\nIn more autonomous groups, the teacher gives students some latitude in their interactions with each other, and although students may remain on a \"short leash,\" the groupwork nonetheless displays spontaneous student interactions concerning the substance of the lesson. In the most autonomous groups, the teacher clearly defines group tasks but without prescripting the groupwork. Typically the teacher (a) defines the goal of the group, for example, arriving at a consensus concerning some controversial issue; (b) oudines the tasks to be accomplished, for example, the group composition of a letter outlining the group's views to a public official; and/or (c) assigns roles to group members, for example, two group members argue one side of the issue while two others argue the other side and one student acts as the recorder. In the following transcript, for example, the teacher initiates groupwork after students have written some original verse. Referring to the students' poems, the teacher says:\nIf yours is the best it can be -instead of counting off, because we'll run out of time, will you just group together with the three or four -three or four maximum -people around you. Read them over, and choose the one [poem] that. . . looks the most specific to you -see that person that the)^re talking about.\nA little later, this teacher reminds students that she wants to hear what you've picked out in your groups so that you're hearing some of the real strong images of these people. . . . I'm asking you to brag; I want to hear the three or four REAL good ones, so people who are having difficulty get a good sample before they go home.\nThis skillfully organized groupwork starts with expressive student writing, thus promoting ownership. Not only because students must work together to find good examples but also because the teacher encourages them to articu-\n\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "49", "text": "In their responses to high-achieving students' papers, however, teachers commented\n\u2022 1.7 and 1.9 times as much about content (in marginal and terminal comments, respectively) compared with teacher comments on lowtrack papers\nTeachers held writing conferences with low-ability students about as infrequentiy (about once a month on average) as with high-achieving students. However, in these conferences they discussed spelling 2.6 times as much with students in low-achieving classes, and they discussed content 1.9 times as frequentiy with high-achieving students.\nWhy these differences.> To answer this question, we looked closely at interviews of the teachers in our study and then compared what they said with what we observed in their classes. First, despite considerable hp service to \"discussion,\" we observed little discussion in any classes in the sense of indepth exchanges of ideas in the absence of teacher evaluation. Most teachers who spoke readily of their value for \"discussion\" -and indeed there were a great many-really enacted some version of recitation. Discussion almost always turned out to be what one teacher described as \"question-and-answer discussion\" involving a prescripted, teacher-set exchange. Such discussion was rarely collaborative, thoroughgoing, pushed-to-the-limit sharing and exploration of student ideas unfolding in class -what Britton (1970) described as a \"struggle to organize . . . thoughts and feelings, to come up with words that . . . shape an understanding, [a] struggle to rise above the limitations of [the] language\" (p. 12). What mainly varied in the lessons we observed was the length of students' responses as they answered teachers' questions.\nSome other teachers expressed a conception of discussion best described as forensic. One teacher, who taught academically talented ninth-grade English in a large urban high school, believed that schooling too much favors docile, cooperative students; in contrast, he liked aggressively expressive, openly assertive students who could readily state and defend their points of view and were willing to argue in class, even with him. Right answers weren't enough in his classes, he said; students had to be able to support them and prevail. Needless to say, this conception of discussion as debate favored the most confident, verbally articulate, and competitive of students. This was a view most commonly heard in suburban schools and was expressed almost exclusively by male teachers (most of the suburban teachers in our study were male; most of the urban teachers were female).\nGiven these conceptions of discussion -one recitation, the other debate-it is perhaps not surprising that students tracked into low-ability classes proved hesitant or \"reticent\" in the classroom, as their teachers often de-scribed them. In observations, these students often seemed unsure of what teachers were looking for, and responded to teachers' questions with shy, cryptic guesses (marked by rising intonation patterns) more often than \"answers\" (as Mr. Schmidt's students did; see Chapter I). In the homogeneously grouped classes, low-ability students readily stepped out of the way of the more confident students. Many of them, especially those with reading problems, did not do homework, and some became discipline problems in class.\nWhen students did not complete reading assignments for homework, many teachers stopped assigning much and devoted substantial proportions of class time to reading aloud. They would pick very short (2-3 page) stories that could be both read aloud and followed up with either seatwork or \"discussion,\" all in the confines of a 50-minute class period. One teacher told us she deliberately avoided open-ended questions with these students because she felt obUgated to prepare them for standardized reading tests in the spring. She therefore concentrated on who, what, and when -though not so much on why-and very few of her questions focused on the special demands of literature (as opposed to nonfiction informative prose). Newspaper stories might have served just as well, and in fact did, especially in many urban classes. Needless to say, the discourse in these classes was heavily monologic, and students' recollections of these very short stories, to say nothing of their understanding, were ephemeral, as we learned when we gave our own test in the spring.\nOne eighth-grade English teacher at a junior high school in a small homogeneous midwestern town was typical of these teachers. She liked tracking because she felt it allowed her to give each of the groups the attention they needed. She previously had taught mixed-ability classes, and she said the slower students invariably \"got lost\" because they were \"unable to compete with their college-bound peers\"; as they became frustrated, moreover, they got into trouble. In her school, she said, the advanced students covered a lot more. This teacher described her idea of an ideal lesson as the engaged, authentic discussion of students expressing and defending their opinions and relating their readings to their personal experience, and she found this far easier to do with high-track than with low-track students. The high-track students were better readers, so she could reasonably assign more reading for homework; class time, then, was for discussion. The high-track class read four novels; the low-track class read two. The low-ability students needed a lot of help with reading, and they often did not complete assigned readings as homework. Hence, she devoted a lot of class time to \"decoding\" and reading aloud; this left little time for discussion. Moreover, the low-track students were far \"more reticent\" about expressing their opinions and \"less adept\" at relating their readings to their own experience than were their comparatively confident and \"garrulous\" high-ability classmates, so this made it far easier."}, {"section_title": "51", "text": "she said, to engage the high-track students in discussion. She did not seem to realize that these differences in pedagogy and interaction afforded the two groups of students significantiy different learning opportunities, especially favoring the high-ability students at the expense of the low (Gamoran, Nystrand, Berends, & LePore, 1995).\nFar more teachers supported ability grouping than opposed it. Those opposing it were far more likely to be in suburban and rural schools than in urban schools, where opposition was very rare. Rural teachers, who seemed to view school as part of extended families in their small towns, were more concerned than the other teachers about possible negative effects on the learning and self-image of their slower students, who in tracked groups would not \"have anyone to model or peers with good behavior and good sldlls,\" as one teacher put it. Several suburban teachers particularly were disaffected with high-ability students, whom one described as \"pseudo-intellectuals and pseudo-sophisiticates\" who tended to be \"abrasive.\" Another teacher said, \"Sometimes the higher-level kids get an attitude that T'm superior-I don't have to work hard.'\" Some suburban teachers felt that mked grouping could benefit average students. They diought it could improve smdent writing by expanding the stock of shared experience in the class: \"Writing is based on experience,\" said one. Others thought it could stimulate discussion and improve literature instruction. Yet these teachers were in the minority. We interviewed only one teacher who claimed that while mixed-ability groups might make it more difficult to teach, they also made it \"more fun.\" \"They're more real,\" she claimed.\nMost teachers, however, were content to teach tracked classes. Some candidly said they were better able to engage the high-ability students than the low simply because they had more in common with the high-ability students; they had more to talk about together. One such teacher taught eighth-grade reading to \"basic\" students and literature to \"academically talented\" students in a midwestern urban junior high. At her school, IQ scores played a major role in assigning students to different abilit)^ groups, and she agreed that her academically talented students were \"innately brighter,\" especially able to manipulate multiple points of view, and more likely than her basic students to go beyond the literal meaning of their readings. She believed that mixing students of different abilities shortchanged everyone: If teachers pitched things toward the higher-ability students, she explained, they lost the slower students; if they made adjustments for the slower students, their classes were not as stimulating for the faster students. Hence, she felt such students needed to be separated from the basic students \"for their own good.\" She preferred teaching the academically talented because she could do more things with them -\"more fun things and creative things.\" She spent \"too much time\" on discipline in the basic class and found that the students \"hated\" reading-they had htde interest in what she was teaching. She said she was more able to be herself with the high-ability students. In die final analysis, diis teacher's ideas on tracking had more to do with her own comfort level than with the learning needs and opportunities of her students."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Differences: Urban, Suburban, and Rural Classes", "text": "In our study, the urban classes tended to be more lifeless than the suburban and rural classes. In interviews, the suburban teachers tended to sound more progressive than the practices we actually observed in their classes. The rural teachers had often taught the siblings and sometimes even the parents of their students, and they tended to view school as an extension of their students' families.\nUrban Classes. Eighth-grade urban students in our study were involved in far fewer interactions with their teachers than either suburban or rural students; for the most part, the urban teachers seemed to \"manage\" students more than teach them in any conventional way. This was probably not due to large class sizes in urban schools since the average number of students (22) in these classes was only slighdy greater than in either suburban (20) or rural (19) schools. Rather, instruction in urban schools seems to have suffered because the teachers in them were tired and burned out by the difficulties of dealing with challenging administrative and disciplinary problems, and felt as abandoned by their school systems as the children they taught.\nIn interviews, urban teachers frequendy cited problems of truancy and attendance, discipline, short attention spans, general apathy and disengagement, and poor reading skills. A common attitude was that students \"didn't particularly care\" and \"just did what they needed to do to get by-these kids don't bring pencil and paper half the time.\" These complaints even extended to some academically talented students, who, according to one teacher, were the \"roughest kids in the school\" and had \"the attention span of a pea . . . they giggle at things even my lower-ability kids wouldn't react to.\" Some saw links between reading and discipline problems: \"That is why you have so many struggling, so many failing, and so many discipline problems.\"\nThese teachers frequendy felt orphaned along with their students by lack of support from central administration. Teachers said their schools spent litde money, and even rationed paper. They felt stymied by large classes. One teacher said.\nThe numbers will kill you. The numbers!

In fact, there isn't one. So all they have done is throw these materials at us, and no one has ever sat down and said, \"Look, this is what you should cover. This is what these kids should know,\" or whatever. They pretty much leave it to the teacher. And if you went to other schools in the district, they would be doing something totally different. It's a very poor setup for these kids. And they are the ones that need the most strucmre, and they are not getting it.\nDiscouraged, these teachers often set remarkably low expectations for dieir students. They said they needed books widi shorter chapters, lower-level vocabulary, and higher interest levels. One teacher said that morning was the best time to teach because her students' concentration was highest and she had fewer behavioral problems then. Students were more likely to be alert and fresh; there were \"no clowns to disturb anyone.\" Even though her firstperiod class did not do much work, she nonetheless judged it to be a good one because the students were obedient and \"did what they were told,\" and many of the troublemakers were \"not alert enough to be disruptive.\" Absenteeism was high, and one-third of her students were usually late. Fridays were always the hardest day of the week. Discussion was hard. Most readings in the curriculum were irrelevant to students' lives. More than anything, this teacher said, she wanted her students to know she cared about them. After that, discipline -coming to class, doing the work, and following directionswas her most important goal.\nYet not all urban teachers had given up. One teacher, specially trained to teach Tide I students, was upbeat. She liked her students and found the remediation techniques she had learned highly effective. She reported no significant discipline problems and found parents cooperative. She especially favored small-group work because there \"you can really discuss.\" She liked using newspapers because \"you could discuss recent developments,\" and she claimed success when she asked students to write questions about what they were learning. Another teacher emphasized that it was up to her as the teacher to \"discern gifts, bring out students, make them grow,\" and that she was able to do this. She looked at students as individuals -\"people worldng with me\" -and her students often came back just to \"talk about life.\" She allowed regular time for \"impromptu sessions,\" and said students became engaged when she took the time to ask, \"What do you think of this.>\" Another teacher stressed the importance of respect: \"Teaching has got to be respectful. And you have to establish that rapport early because the anger and hostilit)' are very difficult to wear off once they start.\""}, {"section_title": "55", "text": "\"discussion\" in these schools was rarely open-ended and generally took the form of question-and-answer recitation: Eighth-grade suburban classes t)^pi-cally had more than 14 minutes a day of question-answer activities versus less than 10 minutes in urban classes, and actual discussion was about 50 seconds a day on average, not much more than in urban schools. In ninth-grade suburban classes, we encountered not even a second of discussion.\nIf suburban teachers prized student autonomy and independent thought, they also said they prized sharing and cooperation. Many teachers used small groups to promote such values, and in both eighth-and ninth-grade classes, suburban students spent twice as much time as urban students in small groups.\nReading skills of suburban students were stronger than those of urban students, and this difference was evident in the fact that suburban students spent less time reading aloud in class. The eighth-grade classes spent about 2V2 minutes a day reading aloud compared with more than 3 minutes a day in the urban classes; in the ninth-grade classes, this difference became even more pronounced: The suburban classes spent only 43 seconds reading aloud, whereas urban classes spent more than 2 minutes. While urban teachers often sought simplified reading materials, suburban teachers sometimes did just the opposite. As one told us, \"Last year I used a basic reader. . . . There were good stories, but they were so watered down that I said I can't use this book. I realize that the stuff I use now, the kids are frustrated with the vocabulary, but that's life.\" The suburban teachers said they spent more time on interpretation than on reading skills. They told us they encouraged students to give opinions, explain why, and go \"beyond remembering\" to \"using\" texts. Yet the cognitive level of questions asked in eighth-grade suburban classes was no higher than in urban classes, and in ninth grade it was actually lower. Nor did suburban teachers ask more authentic questions: In eighth grade, about 12-13% of all teacher questions were authentic in both suburban and urban classes; in ninth grade, urban teachers asked about 50% more. Tables 2.3-2.6 summarize these and other data.\nRural Classes. Schools in small, rural towns were a lot like the towns themselves -places where everybody knew everybody and where secrets could sometimes be hard to keep. Teachers often knew the siblings of their students and kept in close touch with the parents: One teacher regularly recognized his students as \"chips off the ol' block.\" Because the same students often spent the day together through all their classes, they often knew each other's grades, and this was sometimes a problem. Also, because the schools were so small, there was often no ability grouping; everyone was just mixed together. Virtually all the teachers approved of this. They felt that \"the slower 56 OPENING DIALOGUE kids don't learn as much if they're grouped,\" and believed that mixed groups provided these students widi role models. They also said it was important for the smarter kids to \"learn the other side of life.\" Teachers told us they prized \"question-and-answer discussion,\" which averaged approximately 18 minutes a day in both eighth and ninth grades.\nWe found more open-ended discussion in eighth-grade rural classes than in anv of the other schools, on average a litde less than 2 minutes a day Also, seatwork in grade 8 occupied much less time in rural than in urban and suburban schools. Tables 2.3-2.6 summarize these and other data."}, {"section_title": "ANALYZING THE DATA: THE EFFECTS OF DISCOURSE ON LEARNING", "text": "How concerned should we be with these bleak figures? Our data enabled us to test specific hypotheses concerning the overall effects of dialogic elements on learning. There is clearly a trade-off between research, such as our study, diat comprehensively depicts the big picture and examines general effects, on the one hand, and case studies that examine the dynamics of individual cases and episodes, on the other. Ideally these different perspectives complement each other. Our large study enabled us to test empirically many widely debated hypotheses about the effectiveness of different instructional practices and discourse environments (e.g., recitation, discussion, smallgroup work) for learning.\nIn a series of analyses, we examined the effects of many of these practices on literature achievement. To assess student learning, we administered a literature test in the spring to each class. The test required students to answer a series of questions about five works of literature (stories, novels, dramas, and short plays) they had read during the year.^* The questions ranged from simple recall (e.g., \"Who were the main characters in Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry?') to ones requiring in-depth understanding (\"Relate the conflict of Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry to the ending and to the theme\"). The same types of questions were asked of each class, but the stories varied, depending on what students actually read during the year. For the ninth-grade test students also wrote a brief essay on a character from their reading whom they admired. An example of an eighth-grade test is found in Appendix A.\nThe literature tests were scored for the following: Readers read the entire test and then determined a single score for each of the above variables. Each student's literature score was the sum of the individual scores. Each test was scored by two readers and the scores were averaged. The overall reliability of the assessment in grade 8, computed as a correlation of the two readings, was .90; in the grade 9 assessment, the reliabihty was .82. The rubric used for scoring the tests is shown in Appendix B.\nWe then examined the effects of instruction and classroom discourse on learning through a statistical technique called regression analysis. Regression analysis makes it possible to examine the effect of one condition (e.g., the amount of time spent in discussion) while statistically holding constant other important conditions (e.g., prior abilities m writing and readmg, socioeconomic status, and characteristics of students in diflferent classes). For example, if authentic questions are found to be related to higher achievement, regression analysis can reveal whether this is because teachers ask previously higherachieving students more authentic questions, or whether authentic questions actually promote higher achievement. Regression analyses systematically estimate the effect of each variable while statistically holding constant each of the other variables. Our analyses controlled for the effects of both background variables (sex, race, ethnicity, family socioeconomic status) and prior achievement (as measured by fall tests of reading and writing skills)."}, {"section_title": "Overall Results", "text": "In none of our analyses did we ever find that a higher cognitive level of instructional activities actually enhanced learning. Instead, we could explain the relative effectiveness of different instructional practices only when we examined the ways teachers and students interacted as evidenced by authentic questions, uptake, and especially discussion."}, {"section_title": "Eighth-Grade Classes.", "text": "The results of our analyses of the eighth-grade classes, controlled for writing and reading ability, socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity, showed unsurprisingly that disengagement, including offtask behavior and failure to complete homework, adversely affected achievement. The results revealed a modest effect for time spent on homework, no effect for how many questions were asked in class, and a negative effect for level of activity during recitation. Results indicated that dialogically organized instruction, indicated by time devoted to discussion, authentic questions, uptake, and high-level teacher evaluation, had a strong, positive effect on 58 OPENING DIALOGUE achievement. Discussion in particular had a large effect, which is especially striking when it is recalled that the average class engaged in less than a minute of discussion each day Table 2 .7 summarizes these results.\nIn our eighth-grade study, we also found that effective teachers of literature regularly assigned extended pieces of exposition (Nystrand, 1991c); this practice enhanced students' recall and understanding of the literary works they read. The frequent assignment of short-answer exercises, however, actually degraded students' overall recall and depth of understanding. This result is consistent with Applebee's (1984) contention that, because writing tends to promote recall of what it focuses on, such \"narrow-banded\" activities as short-answer exercises are likely to hinder total recall -in other words, helping students to remember trees at the expense of understanding the overall shape of the forest. In addition, because they elicit cryptic, fragmented discourse, short-answer exercises promote superficial involvement with literature; in so doing, they trivialize students' experiences with literature. All in all, students learn literature best in classes that encourage substantive and personal student response to literature in both classroom interaction and writing. Ninth-Grade Classes. In analyzing data from the ninth grade (Gamoran & Nystrand, 1992), we sought to replicate our findings from the eighthgrade study, but we were initially frustrated to find that discussion had no effect on learning in ninth grade and that authentic questions appeared to have no effect or even a negative effect. We were further perplexed to discover that authentic questions had positive effects in high-track classes but negative effects in low-track classes. Table 2.9 summarizes these results.\nLooking more closely at our data, we discovered that the two different tracks used authentic questions very differendy. In the high-track classes, fully 68% of authentic questions concerned literature, whereas only 25% of authentic questions in low-track classes did. In low-track classes, teachers' authentic questions often concerned such issues as, \"How do most of you feel about tests?\"; \"What would your parents say if you got an A on next week's test?\"; \"What things would you associate with lying in the sun?\"; \"Do you ever have to take notes?\" Discussion broke down in a similar way so that discussion in the high-track classes tended to be about literature far more than did that in the low-track classes."}, {"section_title": "Tracking, Instructional Discourse, and Learning", "text": "Again and again, researchers have found that tracking and ability grouping promote inequality of achievement, as the gap between students in hightrack and low-track classes widens over time (Gamoran 8c Berends, 1987). A major purpose of our investigation was to determine wiiether inequality resulted from differences in the quality of discourse in high-track and lowtrack classes. This question is not easy to answer, for two reasons. First, prior to our study, quantitative measures of discourse quality had not been available. Second, it is hard to measure the effects of tracking because they are confounded with initial differences among students. Students assigned to different tracks have different achievement from the start, and it is important to take this into account when examining inequality.\nWe addressed the first problem by developing the scheme for measuring classroom discourse described in this chapter. We addressed the second problem with statistical controls for fall reading and writing skills, as well as controls for sex, race/ethnicity, and SES (see note 15). In addition, for this analysis, we used standardized reading and math test scores as indicators of an underlying \"ability\" construct, to add a stricter control for students' prior academic background (Gamoran et al., 1995) . Even with these controls, we found that average achievement was almost two points higher in honors classes than in remedial classes, a statistically significant difference. One standard deviation on the test was 6.8 points, so the two-point gap was almost 30% of a standard deviation, a substantial amount (Gamoran et al., 1995) . Do differences in instructional discourse account for this achievement inequality.^ Yes, to a large extent (Gamoran et al., 1995) . Part of the difference occurred because students in honors classes were more responsive -they completed more of their reading and writing assignments -which helped them learn more (see Table 2 .10). Uptake and discourse coherence also helped students learn, but these did not account for track differences in learning, because they occurred at similar rates in honors and remedial classes (see Tables 2.5 and 2.6). Authentic questions also were comparably distributed across class types, but they were beneficial only in honors classes because there they pertained to literature (see Table 2 .10). Hence, similar levels of authenticity led to inequality of learning, because the content of the authentic questions differed.\nWe further observed that students were more often off task in remedial classes, and this was detrimental to their achievement (see Table 2 .10). In honors classes, where off-task behavior was less prevalent, its effects were less harmful. Conversely, discussion occurred more often in honors classes, where it brought benefits for literature achievement, and had no benefits in other classes, presumably because it focused on topics other than literature.\nThese results contradicted the usual rationale for ability grouping. Ability grouping is supposed to allow teachers and students to engage in whatever instruction is most beneficial in each context. In actuality, we found that authentic questions occurred at similar rates in all classes, but contributed to achievement only in honors classes; off-task behavior was most common where it was most harmful, in regular and remedial classes. Discussion fit the pattern of occurring more where its payoff was greater (in honors classes); this, too, contributed to inequality."}, {"section_title": "63", "text": "In light of these results, we concluded that two changes must be considered (Gamoran et al., 1995) .

To mitigate the inequality that results from grouping and tracking, teachers and students in regular and low-level classes need higher expectations and more engaging discourse that focuses on academic subject matter."}, {"section_title": "Small Groups", "text": "In the eighth-grade study, we initially expected small groups to be dependable sites of dialogic peer interaction, but this was naive. In fact, time spent in small groups, rare as it was -39 seconds a day on average -turned out to have a prominent negative effect on achievement. We had predicted that small-group work and discussion would enhance achievement by engaging students substantively, especially compared with lecture, drill work, and recitation, which, like short-answer study questions, typically involve abbreviated responses from students. In fact, increased time spent in small-group work seemed to result in lower achievement in literature. We decided to examine this finding in more detail in a follow-up study of ninth-grade literature classes. We were particularly interested in distinguishing various kinds of small-group work and to see whether some were more effective than others.\nIn the ninth-grade study, unlike the eighth-grade study, we audiotaped the classes we observed, and although we had not placed microphones in small groups, the tapes provided a record of how each class proceeded. For classes involving small-group work, we were able to determine: (a) what preceded and what followed this work, (b) the kinds of tasks undertaken in groups, (c) the instructions the teachers gave to the groups, and (d) the roles teachers played in setting up and running the groups.\nWe learned that small-group work involved a great range of activities. Some small-group work was so highly structured by the teacher -involving, for example, students completing worksheets together -that it might best be called \"collaborative seatwork.\" Other groups, which we called problemsolving groups, required students to come to consensus concerning some issue or question that the teacher defined. Yet other small-group work, which we described as \"autonomous,\" was even more open-ended, with the groups themselves defining as well as resolving the problems and issues they discussed. Figure 2 .2 shows the continuum described by these categories.\nOur study looked exclusively at the features of small-group work that promote thinldng. Given our findings that ownership, coherence of discourse, and student production of knowledge are important features of effective instruction, we reasoned that to promote response to and thinking about literature, small groups also should manifest these traits. More specifically, we predicted that collaborative seatwork, which is essentially written recitation done by students working together, would be less effective than problem- solving and autonomous groups, which allow ownership and thereby maximize the possibility of coherent discussion. It may be that collaborative seatwork is effective for teaching facts and grammar, but our research did not examine this possibility."}, {"section_title": "67", "text": "late what \"good\" means in this context, the ensuing group talk is more likely to be coherent conversation than the first session, where students must \"fill in the blanks on this handout on five basic sentence patterns.\" Such discussions were rare in our study: Only 11.1% of all small-group work was judged either to be wholly autonomous or to display significant student interaction in producing the outcome of groupwork, whereas 70.4% of all small-group work was prestructured by the teacher.\nThe degree of student autonomy in the small groups we observed was coded from audiotapes according to the following scale:\n1\nTeacher-structured groupwork: Task parameters entirely defined, or \"prescripted,\" by teacher. Task can be done without student interaction (e.g., worksheets); group setting is gratuitous."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Prescripted task with obligatory student interaction.\n3 Limited student interaction: Groupwork involves spontaneous student interaction concerning substance but students are on \"short leash.\"\nFor example, the teacher might define some general principle that students in groups must then apply."}, {"section_title": "69", "text": "\"Oh, the inspector did it,\" or \"The colonel did it,\" or \"Pollet did it,\" or \"Ted did it,\" and that's all you're writing down. What I came around and asked you for was a motive, right? Miss Marple's got that down. So in your paragraph: who did it and a motive.\nIn In each of these latter two examples, students must not only identify some underlying principle -a motive for murder, a character trait-but also find supporting evidence for the interpretation. Once again, we discovered that such groupwork is infrequent; only about a quarter of the groupwork we observed involved discussion of open-ended questions with students actively constructing interpretations (rated a 5 on the scale in the list that follows). By contrast, two-thirds was a version of collaborative seatwork.\nIn our analysis of the extent to which students were required to actively construct new understandings during small-group work, we coded each session, using audiotapes, according to the following scale: Effective and Ineffective Croupwork. Did small-group work affect achievement, holding other conditions constant . > In our regression analysis, we held constant students' sex, race/ethnicity, SES, and fall reading and writing skills. We also took into account teachers' uses of authentic and follow-up questions, the amount of discussion time outside of small groups, as well as rates of student off-task behavior and homework completion.\nWe first discovered that, overall, classes spending more time in small groups produced lower achievement, a finding that replicated the surprising conclusion of our eighth-grade study. However, we were now prepared to go beyond simply asking how much time was spent in small groups: We could ask whether the effectiveness of small-group time depended on what was going on in the small groups. To do this, we used the two measures of the quality of group time discussed earlier: student autonomy and student production of knowledge. Although these measures differ in theory-students could be given autonomy but not take the opportunity to produce knowledge -in practice the two tended to occur together: the more student autonomy, the more production of knowledge (the correlation was .78).^^ Analysis of student autonomy showed that the higher the degree of autonomy, the more likely group time was to contribute positively to achievement. For example, a class that averaged 5 minutes per day of highly \"prescripted,\" rigidly structured group time, with little autonomy for students, would actually score about 1 point lower on the test than a class with no group time at all. By contrast, a class that averaged 5 minutes of highly autonomous groupwork, in which students worked together to define the task, would gain almost 2 points on the test over a similar class with no groupwork. This is a significant effect: It could move a student from the fiftieth to the fiftyeighth percentile on the 32-point test. We found similar results for student production of knowledge: Collaborative seatwork actually reduces achievement, but groupwork in which students actively construct interpretations promotes achievement.\nThese results are consistent with Hillocks's (1986) study, which examined dozens of empirical studies conducted over a quarter century involving nearly 12,000 students and found that the most effective writing instruction involved peer-response groups with what Hillocks called an \"inquiry\" focus: assigned topics involving analysis of readings or odier data and attention to rhetorical strategies.\nBy replicating our eighth-grade study and moving beyond it, we accounted for the unexpected results. Small-group work appeared ineffective"}, {"section_title": "71", "text": "because the groups were being used ineffectively; many of the assignments could just as well have been done individually. The follow-up study shows that when small-group time allows students to interact over the substance of their problem, defining tasks as well as solutions and construaing interpretations, students benefit from the opportunity to work in small groups.\nThese findings reaffirm the view that effective small-group work requires coherent activities that result in the sustained production of student knowledge. To promote such activities, the teacher must not overly specify group tasks. In other words, effective teachers clearly define the general parameters of the tasks, but not the precise character of the activities themselves. Teachers who promote thinking about literature may present clear objectives to students for groupwork-for example, identifying the best poems written by students in each group, articulating character traits, and finding supporting quotations -but avoid telling groups exacdy how to proceed; they do not, for example, specify a list of questions and topics students must answer in a particular order.\nWhen teachers put groups of students together to work on some problem, they send students an important message that developing their own thoughts is important. The teacher above who told her students, \"There are a lot of lights ... in your eyes,\" as she prepared them for groupwork sent exactly this message.\nThe benefits of direct instruction presumably result from higher on-task behavior when the teacher works directly with students. One could argue that this occurs when the instructional task is the same for both whole-class and small-group settings. For example, students may be more on task when they answer recitation questions as a whole class than when the recitation questions are assigned to small groups for written responses. Learning, in this example, may not differ or may be greater in the whole-class format. However, this format does not take advantage of the opportunities for intellectual collaboration that are made possible by the small-group setting. If the tasks are the same, one should expect little difference in achievement; the point of small-group instruction, however, should not be to assign the same tasks, but to design work that draws on the potential for cooperation and collaboration in the small group.\nIf successful small-group work depends on the teacher setting up openended rather than prescripted tasks and on the students having coherent conversations generating insights, then teachers must carefully match smallgroup work to suitable tasks. For example, if the objective for a given day requires presenting a lot of new information, a lecture is probably better than small-group work. If teachers want students to practice some particular skill, recitation and seatwork may be better than small-group work. On the other hand, if teachers want students to compare ideas, develop a train of thought."}, {"section_title": "72", "text": "OPENING DIALOGUE air differences, or arrive at a consensus on some controversial issue, then the forum of small groups may be just the right setting for most students to carry on intensive conversation and discussion, especially students who are too shy to say much in the larger setting of the whole class. Teachers must always remember, however, that they cannot just put students in groups and expect them to \"go to it\" with positive results. For groupwork to succeed, teachers must carefully design collaborative tasks that are interesting to students (and not just to the teacher). They also must be prepared to help students develop effective group skills; an excellent guide for teachers is Cohen's Designing Groupwork (1986)."}, {"section_title": "THE BOTTOM LINE; LEARNING TO THINK REQUIRES EFFECTIVE INTERACTION", "text": "Most of the time when teachers ask students questions, they are not asking to be informed since they already Icnow the answers themselves. When students are asked to recite for teachers who have no need to be informed, they produce \"pseudo-discourse.\" Authentic discourse occurs only when some information or interpretive stance is really at issue. Only authentic discourse can engage students.\nYet the results of our study suggest that authentic questions, discussion, small-group work, and interaction, though important, do not categorically produce learning; indeed we observed many classes where this was not the case. We also found that recitation is not categorically ineffective; rather, its effectiveness varies depending on whether and how teachers expand IRE sequences. The underlying epistemology of classroom interaction defines the bottom line for learning: What ultimately counts is the extent to which instruction requires students to think, not just report someone else^s thinking. As Leont'ev (1981) might put it, the pedagogical usefulness of each interaction needs to be gauged in terms of the particular activity or project involved and, more than this, the system of social relationships that support it. Authentic questions, discussion, and small-group work have important instructional potential, but unless they are used in relation to serious instructional goals and, more important, unless they assign significant and serious epistemic roles to students that the students themselves can value, they may be litde more than pleasant diversions.\nIn one English class in our study, for example, students engaged in several ostensibly open-ended, imaginative writing tasks requiring them to write from the point of view of a pencil eraser or a bullet. Upon close inspection of these exercises and especially the teacher's responses to the papers, we eventually came to understand that, from the teacher's point of view, the content"}, {"section_title": "73", "text": "of student responses to these prompts -imaginative or not-was irrelevant; nearly the only thing the teacher responded to in his marginal comments was whether or not all words had been spelled correcdy. As it happened, the students in this class understood the operational rubric for this exercise and played their roles more or less appropriately. However, the ostensible purpose (imaginative discourse) and the actual purpose (correct spelling) of the writing tasks significantly differed; the writers were not really speaking to a reader who was listening to what they were trying to say. These writing tasks were what Bloome and Argumedo (1983) call procedural displays. Students can be involved fully and substantively in reciprocal instruction only when the ostensible purpose of the discourse is the same as the actual purpose.\nGenerally, we may say that reciprocity in instruction occurs most often when students, as well as the teacher, have some input into and control over instructional discourse, and when their previous learning significantly affects the course of subsequent learning. This concept has been implemented in some elementary reading instruction by Palincsar and Brown (1984) in what they call reciprocal teaching. In reciprocal teaching, students take turns being the teacher. In other classrooms where students do not play the role of teacher, the teachers nonetheless honor the terms of reciprocity when they avoid prespecifying answers to their questions so that student answers potentially can affect subsequent questions and discussion. When teachers ask genuine questions of this sort, they treat students as full-fledged conversants. This is not to suggest that the dialogicality of instruction can be judged in terms of the how of instruction -question-answer sequences evidenced in face-to-face interaction -alone. The study found that the what of instruction-the content and subject matter -is critical to learning as well. Authentic questions must challenge students to think and reflect on the consequences of their ideas, not just remember their past experiences. Teachers must prize vigorous discussion in dialogic classrooms, encouraging what Bakhtin (1981) calls the struggle of \"contradictory opinions, points of view and value judgments\" (p. 281). Bakhtin teaches us that meaning and therefore learningunderstood as the expansion of a personally coherent interpretation of information and events -are actively constructed and negotiated through language use. Learning is a dialogic event, part the instructor's and part the learner's. If events and information are to acquire meaning and students are to learn, then teachers must think of curriculum not just in terms of points to be made, information to be conveyed, and abstract skills to be mastered. Rather, they must engage students in activities and projects bridging the purposes of their students and the goals of instruction. Yet instruction creating such bridges, we found, was either rare or altogether missing in the classes we observed, which overwhelmingly were given over to lecture, recitation, short-answer questions, and seatwork.\nThe Bakhtinian explanation for the relative ineffectiveness of monologic instruction in promoting learning and conceptual change, compared w^ith discussion and instructional conversation (even for basic objectives such as recall and literal comprehension), is that meaning \"is realized only in the process of active, responsive understanding\" (Volosinov, 1973, p. 102 ). Yet it is just such active, responsive understanding that teachers fail to practice -especially in low-track classes -when they determine prior to a given class the entire sequence of questions they will ask and what answers they will accept, and when they respond to correct student answers with a mere nod before moving on to the next question, often changing the topic of discourse. In doing so, these individuals make no attempt at active, responsive understanding; they \"want, in effect, to turn on a light bulb after having switched off the current. Only the current of verbal intercourse endows a word with the light of meaning\" (Volosinov, 1973, p. 103 "}, {"section_title": "Universal", "text": "Note: Score level of discourse the high point reached; that is, if one story is treated literally and two are treated in terms of cliche, record a score of 2 (for literal). Level of discourse should be scored as general if the student goes \"beyond the information given\" to treat characters, plots, conflicts, etc., in general terms, i.e., oifers more than a literal rendition of events, but nonetheless limits these generalizations to the story itself (e.g., statements about what characters are generally like in the story). By contrast, level of discourse should be scored as universal if the student seeks to apply such generalizations beyond the story to experience in general and does so in well developed terms, making an explicit case for the universality of the generalization."}, {"section_title": "118", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "NOTES", "text": "struggle and tension between self and other -\"the differential relation between a center and all that is not that center\" (Holquist, 1990, p. 18)-which in their view is why conflict is essential to the meaning we give our experience and the understandings we have of it. \"Consciousness takes shape and being,\" Volosinov (1973) claims, \"in the material of signs created by an organized group in the process of its social interaction\" (p. 13). 10. As Klancher (1989) explains, \"Bakhtin's crucial starting point-the diversity of practical languages rather than a unitary abstract structure -leads him to argue that every effort to impose unir^ on these languages is 'monologic' The institutions of the school, the state, and the church enforce monologic languages as the voice of culture, die voice of authority, the voice of God ventriloquized through the literary critic, the politician, or the priest. His terms dialogic and monologic thus describe uses of language rather than inherent properties of language itself\" (p. 85).\n11. lames Britton (1969 Britton ( , 1970 argued that conversants are most Hkely to discover insights when their talk is expressive."}]
