[{"section_title": "", "text": ", and the MERS-CoV pathogen, which was responsible for 2 494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 MERS outbreak 8, 9 . Notably, the current COVID-19 outbreak is characterized by its significant dispersal into many major urban centers in China and beyond, further facilitating its continued spread from person to person 10, 11 , and has caused considerable morbidity and mortality in China and elsewhere. As of 14 July 2020, a total of 12 964 809 confirmed cases including 570 288 deaths in 216 countries, areas or territories, have been reported globally by WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 coronavirus-2019), with USA, Brazil, India, and Russia especially hard hit. Although the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has excessed 12 million, it showed that countries had only discovered on average about 6% of coronavirus infections and the true number of infected people worldwide may already have reached several tens of millions (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-covid-average-actual-infectionsworldwide.html). Notably, there are many asymptomatic carriers remaining in humans and the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 from some convalescent patients could be tested positive again which means that the virus cannot be eradicated and can replicate again. These factors will contribute the subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks, and many scientists believe that COVID-19 outbreaks will be recurrence.\nOver the past three and half decades at least 30 new infectious agents affecting humans have emerged including SARS-CoV-2, and most of them are zoonotic. It was also reported that 61% infectious organisms affecting humans are zoonotic diseases which can infect both human and animals 12, 13 . Previous studies have revealed that both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV originated in bats [14] [15] [16] [17] , with SARS-CoV-1 jumping to humans from palm civets [18] [19] [20] and MERS-CoV jumping to humans from camels 21, 22 following intermediate transmission from bats [14] [15] [16] [17] . Research has also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, either directly or through an as-yet unidentified animal host 4 . Initial cases have been linked to Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market; however, the specific animal source is yet to be determined 11 . The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans without knowing the animal source of infection has heightened concerns not only in China, but also internationally. Therefore, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f identifying the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still a top research priority for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. The deadly pandemic has prompted a high-speed race to understand how the coronavirus is evolving and spreading. But doing so requires an unprecedented collaboration among scientists, across the globe, to decode the virus and its path.\nSince the first whole-genome sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank accession number MN908947, also named hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 with accession ID EPI_ISL_402125 in GISAID) of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was isolated from a 41-year old man who worked at Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, was shared online on 11 January, 2020, that first genome became the baseline for researchers to track the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it spreads around the world 23 "}, {"section_title": "Collation of SARS-CoV-2 genome-wide dataset", "text": "As of 19 February 2020, more than 100 genomes of human-obtained SARS-CoV-2 strains have been released on GISAID (http://gisaid.org/) 24 . No statistical methods were used to predetermine the number of genomes in the present study, we downloaded all available genomes of human-obtained SARS-CoV-2 strains. The dataset used in present study was also not randomized. Notably, due to the difficulty of sequencing samples with low virus concentrations, certain sequences were excluded from this study in order to avoid potential biases, e.g., sequences that were too short, re-sequences of the same sample, sequences with insufficient associated information, and sequences that showed evidence of artefacts due to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the appearance of nucleotide variation. The final dataset (\"dataset_112\") included 112 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Australia (n = 8), Belgium (n = 1), China (n = 53), Finland (n = 1), France (n = 10), Germany (n = 1), Japan (n = 7), Korea (n = 1), Nepal (n = 1), Singapore (n = 11), Thailand (n = 2), UK (n = 2), and USA (n = 14) with sampling dates between 24\nDecember 2019 and 9 February 2020. Of the 53 genomes collected from China, three were from Chongqing, two were from Fujian Province, 16 were from Guangdong Province, 21\nwere from Hubei Province, one was from Jiangsu Province, one was from Jiangxi Province, one was from Sichuan Province, three were from Taiwan, one was from Yunnan Province, and four were from Zhejiang Province (Supplementary Table 1 ). We first aligned the collected dataset (\"dataset_112\") using MAFFT v7.222 25 and subsequently edited the alignment manually using BioEdit v7.2.5 26 ."}, {"section_title": "Recombination screening and maximum-likelihood analysis", "text": "Recombination may impact evolutionary estimates and is known to occur in coronaviruses 27 .\nTo assess recombination of our dataset (\"dataset_112\"), we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) to measure similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1 28 and the default recombination detection methods using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) v4.100 29 . The best-fit nucleotide substitution model for \"dataset_112\" was identified according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) method with three (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10 30 . To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of \"dataset_112\", we performed likelihood-mapping analysis 31 using TREE-PUZZLE v5.3 32 , with 280 000 randomly chosen quartets for the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f dataset. Split network analysis was performed for \"dataset_112\" using Kishino-Yano-85 33 distance transformation with the NeighborNet method, which can be loosely thought of as a \"hybrid\" between the neighbor-joining (NJ) and split decomposition methods, implemented in TREE-PUZZLE v5.3 32 . Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for the dataset were estimated using PhyML v3.1 34 under a Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) 33 nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariable sites, which was identified as the best fitting model for ML inference by jModelTest v2.1.10 30 . Branch support was inferred using parameterization 42 , another exponential growth population with doubling time parameterization 42 , a Bayesian skyline tree prior (five groups, piecewise-constant model) 43 , and a Bayesian Skygrid tree prior (five population sizes across our 0.2 year interval, allowing a different population size to be estimated for 14.6 days (d)) 44 . We kept the default option of a 'Random starting tree' to start the inference process. For each tree prior, we tested two clock models: a strict clock and an uncorrelated relaxed clock with log-normal distribution (UCLN) 45 . In each case, we set an uninformative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) reference prior 46 "}, {"section_title": "Tree-like signals and phylogenetic analyses", "text": "For \"dataset_112\", a HKY 33 nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariable sites was the model of best fit across the two different substitution schemes (i.e., 24 and 88 candidate models) according to the BIC method, and was thus used in subsequent likelihoodmapping and phylogenetic analyses. The PHI test of \"dataset_112\" did not find statistically significant evidence of recombination (p = 1.0). In addition, no evidence of recombination was found using RDP v4.100 29 . Our likelihood-mapping analysis revealed that the quartets from \"dataset_112\" were primarily distributed in the center (63.2%) rather than the corners (36.8%) or sides (0%) of the triangle, indicating a strong star-like topology signal, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Fig. 1A ), in accordance with previous studies [54] [55] [56] . The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f split network generated for \"dataset_112\" using the NeighborNet method revealed the existence of polytomies, and thus was highly unresolved. This indicated that the phylogenetic relationship of our dataset was probably best represented by a star-like phylogenetic tree rather than a strictly bifurcating tree (Fig. 1B) , suggesting possible rapid early spread of SARS-CoV-2, in accordance with the likelihood-mapping results. ML phylogenetic analysis of \"dataset_112\" also showed star-like topology (Fig. 2) , indicating the introduction of a new virus to an immunologically naive population, in accordance with the likelihood-mapping and split network results. Root-to-tip linear regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best-fitting root, which minimizes the mean of the squares of the residuals, showed that \"dataset_112\" had a minor positive temporal signal (R 2 = 0.087; correlation coefficient = 0.2945), thus suggesting a minor clocklike pattern of molecular evolution (Fig. 3) . We estimated the whole-genome evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 to be (Table 1) . Notably, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 were consistent across different molecular clock models but were distinct across different coalescent tree prior models. The best-fitting combination was an UCLN relaxed molecular clock along with an exponential growth tree prior model with growth rate parameterization, as shown by the marginal likelihood estimates for \"dataset_112\" when comparing the two clock models and five tree prior models. Thus, the TMRCA date and evolutionary rate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" with the best-fitting combination were 12 November 2019 (95% BCI: 11 October 2019 and 09\nDecember 2019) and 9.90 \uf0b4 10 -4 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 6.29 \uf0b4 10 -4 -1.35 \uf0b4 10 -3 ), respectively ( Table 1 ). The estimates of the MCC phylogenetic relationships among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes for our dataset from the Bayesian coalescent framework using the tipdating method, as well as the exponential coalescent tree prior with doubling time parameterization and UCLN relaxed molecular clock, are displayed in Fig. 4 . As shown, \"dataset_112\" exhibited more genetic diversity than our previous datasets [54] [55] [56] ."}, {"section_title": "Phylodynamic analyses of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "Analysis showed that the Re estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" experienced complex phylodynamics characterized by at least two growing and two declining phases (Fig.   5 ). The mean Re estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for our dataset ranged from 0.336-4.137, and the first growth phase had more uncertainty compared to the remaining phases due to the wider 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of Re estimates. Notably, we found very low Re J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" during the recent sampling time period. The low Re estimates suggest that China's extreme lockdowns may be responsible for the successful control of SARS-CoV-2 in China."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To investigate the global epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we performed comprehensive evolutionary analyses of 112 genomes from \"dataset_112\". Our likelihood-mapping analysis confirmed increasing tree-like phylogenetic signals over time as more genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains were added to our study compared with previous results [55] [56] [57] . This indicates more complex genetic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans and greater adaptation to humans (Fig. 1A) , consistent with our earlier studies [55] [56] [57] . Split network analysis of SARS-CoV-2 based on \"dataset_112\" using the NeighborNet method was more resolved over time as more genome sequences were added to our study compared with our previous results 56 .\nThis indicates increasing tree-like evolution of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with our likelihoodmapping analysis (Fig. 1B) . These results are also consistent with our ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed a more bifurcating tree topology from \"dataset_112\" compared to our previous results [55] [56] [57] (Fig. 2 ). Our dataset still had a minor positive temporal signal based on regression analysis using TempEst v1.5 36 and ML dating analysis using TreeTime package 37 compared to our previous results 56 . Furthermore, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" were found to be nearly identical using both analyses (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure 1) , consistent with earlier results 56 . The estimated TMRCA dates of SARS-CoV-2 based on \"dataset_112\" using TempEst v1.5 36 (19 "}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "October 2019) and ML dating analysis using TreeTime 37 (19 October 2019) were also identical to our previous results 56 . However, the estimated evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" using TempEst v1.5 36 The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" were very similar across different clocks using the tip-dating method, but very distinct across different coalescent tree priors (e.g., parametric coalescent and nonparametric coalescent models) (Table 1) . Notably, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 were more similar between exponential growth population with growth rate parameterization and constant population size models than those determined using exponential growth population with growth rate parameterization and another exponential growth population with doubling time parameterization models. Bayesian analyses with the tip-dating method using an UCLN relaxed molecular clock as well as an exponential growth coalescent tree prior with doubling time parameterization model suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving at a rate of 9.90 \uf0b4 10 -4 substitutions per site per year (Table 1) . This in accordance with our prior studies 55-57 but very distinct to results based on regression analysis using TempEst v1.5 36 and ML dating analysis using TreeTime 37 , which showed that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving at a rate of 5.3504 \uf0b4 10 -3 and 5.35 \uf0b4 10 -3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. These findings suggest that the virus originated on 12 November 2019, in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f agreement with our previous studies 55-57 but distinct from earlier regression analysis 36 and ML dating analysis results 37 , which both showed that the virus originated on 19 October 2019. In summary, the TMRCA date and evolutionary rate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" are still sensitive to the tree prior, and additional genomes should make these estimates more robust towards the tree prior choice. We found Bayesian approaches to be more powerful than regression analysis and ML dating analysis. We employed the BDSKY model 52 and found that the Re estimates of SARS-CoV-2 for \"dataset_112\" experienced a complex phylodynamic history (Fig. 5) . However, the epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 had very low Re estimates during the recent sampling time period, suggesting that the introduction of effective prevention measures (e.g., joint defense and control strategies in China, particularly the extreme lockdown of Wuhan) limited viral spread within the sampled populations. If performed in real time, such analyses could provide actionable targets for prevention. The limitations of these evolutionary analyses are discussed in our previous studies [55] [56] [57] and can also be applied here. Both Bayesian coalescent and BDSKY models assume that the population is well-mixed. That is, they assume that there is no significant population structure and that the sequences are a random sample from the population. For the epidemiological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from \"dataset_112\", the non-random and non-wellmixing of the sampled population, and the non-constant sampling effort may be potential strong sources of bias in the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic parameters, which is an issue for all molecular evolutionary studies using real world data. It is important to note that there is currently not enough genomic data from the early COVID-19 outbreak period to Links of all paired genomic sequences that seem directly connected now from our phylogenetic trees in the present study are likely to be connected more closed with other genomic sequences from other countries not sampled and sometimes can be connected differently later with more genomic sequences becoming available. The phylogenetic relationships of genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the future will be much more complex than the early incomplete picture presented in this study. Therefore, our results and conclusions should be explained with caution due to the limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes presented in this study over a short time period. The 95% BCI estimates for the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates are averaged over many plausible phylogenetic reconstructions of the genome data; thus, as more patients with COVID-19 are sampled and more SARS-CoV-2 genomes become available, we expect these estimates will become narrower.\nIn conclusion, this study characterized the epidemic spread patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in China (including 10 provinces) and beyond (including 12 other countries) based on genome data generated from patients with COVID-19 between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020.\nOur results shed light on the evolutionary and epidemiological histories of SARS-CoV-2 over time, and suggest that a strategy of 'suppression' (e.g., social distancing of the entire population, case isolation, household quarantine, and school and university closure) is needed to reduce deaths and prevent healthcare systems being overwhelmed. Our results also emphasize the importance of using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses to provide "}]
