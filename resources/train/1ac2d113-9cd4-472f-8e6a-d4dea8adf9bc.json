[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "abstract Children who become overweight by age 2 years have significantly greater risks of long-term health problems, and children in low-income communities, where rates of low adult literacy are highest, are at increased risk of developing obesity. The objective of the Greenlight Intervention Study is to assess the effectiveness of a low-literacy, primary-care intervention on the reduction of early childhood obesity. At 4 primary-care pediatric residency training sites across the US, 865 infant-parent dyads were enrolled at the 2-month well-child checkup and are being followed through the 24-month well-child checkup. Two sites were randomly assigned to the intervention, and the other sites were assigned to an attention-control arm, implementing the American Academy of Pediatrics' The Injury Prevention Program. The intervention consists of an interactive educational toolkit, including low-literacy materials designed for use during well-child visits, and a clinician-centered curriculum for providing low-literacy guidance on obesity prevention. The study is powered to detect a 10% difference in the number of children overweight (BMI . 85%) at 24 months. Other outcome measures include observed physician-parent communication, as well as parent-reported information on child dietary intake, physical activity, and injury-prevention behaviors. The study is designed to inform evidence-based standards for early childhood obesity prevention, and more generally to inform optimal approaches for low-literacy messages and health literacy training in primary preventive care. This article describes the conceptual model, study design, intervention content, and baseline characteristics of the study population.

More than 1 in 4 preschool children are overweight or obese, 1 and these rates are disproportionately higher among children in low income and ethnic-minority communities. [2] [3] [4] Increased weight gain during infancy has been associated with increased obesity risk during early childhood. 5 Children who are overweight during early childhood are at least 5 times more likely than nonobese children to become overweight or obese adolescents. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Overweight adolescents, in turn, are at increased risk for adult obesity and adult-onset, obesity-related illnesses 10, 11 such as hypertension, type-2 diabetes, 12 steatohepatitis, 13 and orthopedic problems. 14 Addressing obesity during early childhood, however, requires a family-centered approach that engages children' s adult caregivers, especially their parents. 15 The US Surgeon General has identified health literacy as \"one of the largest contributors to our nation' s epidemic of overweight and obesity.\" 16, 17 At least 1 in 4 parents has basic or below-basic health literacy skills. 18 Low literacy and numeracy skills have been independently associated with poor understanding of health information, poor health behaviors, and poor clinical outcomes. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] In the context of child growth and nutrition, low parent health literacy is associated with worse knowledge of breastfeeding, problems mixing infant formula correctly, difficulty understanding food labels and portion sizes, difficulty understanding standard growth charts, and higher BMI in children. 29, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Although clinical efforts to prevent childhood obesity have had a limited effect on school-aged children, 7, [41] [42] [43] few clinical trials have specifically addressed obesity prevention during the first years of life, and none has examined the effect of an intervention that integrates a literacy-sensitive approach. 6 In this report, we describe the Greenlight Intervention Study, a cluster randomized, multisite trial to assess the efficacy of a low literacy, primary care-based intervention to prevent early childhood obesity. Specifically, we describe its conceptual model, study design, intervention components, research methodology, and baseline data."}, {"section_title": "STUDY DESIGN", "text": "We implemented a cluster randomized controlled trial design to explore 3 primary aims: (1) to assess the impact of the intervention on reducing the prevalence of overweight at age 2 years; (2) to assess the impact of the intervention on the parent health behaviors most likely to prevent child overweight; and (3) to examine the role of parent health literacy as a moderator of both effects. To avoid intrasite contamination, randomization occurred at the site level, stratified by population density, such that the 2 sites serving the higher population-density communities were assigned to different groups. A statistician, blinded to site location, conducted the sites' random assignment to intervention or activecontrol status, using a random number generator in Stata 9.0 (College Park, TX). Two sites (New York University and Vanderbilt University) were randomized to the intervention, which applied health literacy principles and focused on obesity prevention, and 2 sites (University of Miami and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) to the active-control arm, which did not apply health literacy principles and focused on injury prevention.\nAt both intervention and control sites, we enrolled caregiver-infant dyads at each child' s 2-month well-child checkup (WCC), with intervention and assessment at each of 5-to 6-interval visits at 4-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-and/or 18-month WCCs, through the study' s completion at the child' s 24-month WCC. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the 4 participating university medical centers, and a data safety monitoring board, including participants from each institution, monitored study progress. The study was registered with the national Clinical Trials Registry (NCT01040897 at clinicaltrials. gov)."}, {"section_title": "Setting", "text": "Study principal investigators (PIs) implemented the intervention or activecontrol at academic-medical-center-based pediatric primary care clinics, where pediatric trainees (residents) provide the majority of pediatric preventive care. PIs chose this setting for several reasons: (1) pediatric resident practice sites provide care for more than one-fifth of the socioeconomically disadvantaged families in the United States, 44 who are at highest risk for childhood obesity; (2) resident physicians have been shown to be more sensitive to clinical behavior change than community-based physicians 45, 46 ; (3) a majority of pediatric residents become practicing community-based physicians 47, 48 ; and (4) academic practicebased research networks, particularly the Continuity Clinic Research Network, provide the potential for rapid dissemination and quality improvement. 49 Although we considered alternative intervention settings (eg, primary-care private practices, community health centers; familymedicine practices), none offered more optimal combinations of these attributes. The model was constructed to be easily translatable, however, for implementation in community-based practices. Participating sites were located in diverse areas of the eastern United States, with 2 sites (New York University/ Bellevue Hospital and University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital) serving higher population-density communities, and 2 sites (Vanderbilt and University of North Carolina) serving less dense communities.\nStudy enrollment began in April 2010. All subjects are scheduled to complete their enrollment in the Greenlight Intervention Study by December 2014.

Infant exclusion criteria included the following: born before 34 weeks' gestational age or birth weight ,1500 g; weight , third percentile at enrollment (using the World Health Organization growth curves) 50 ; or any chronic medical problem that may affect weight gain patterns (eg, metabolic disease, uncorrected congenital heart disease, renal disease, high-calorie formula; cleft palate; Down syndrome). Caregiver exclusion criteria included the following: ,18 years old; serious mental or neurologic illness likely to impair ability to consent or participate; or poor visual acuity (ie, corrected vision worse than 20/50 with Rosenbaum Pocket Screener as assessed at the time of recruitment). Eligible physicians included any pediatric resident who provided preventive care for children in one of the study clinics.\nAt all sites, most children were insured by Medicaid or other public insurance, and most parents self-identified as having ethnic-minority backgrounds.\nNearly all participating primary caregivers (.90%) were mothers ( Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "INTERVENTION", "text": "Based on social cognitive theory (SCT) and health-literacy principles, the Greenlight Intervention targets adult caregivers with behavior-change components administered by pediatric residents at each wellchild visit from 2 months to 24 months.

The Greenlight Intervention consists of 2 main components: (1) a low-literacy toolkit for parents, including developmentally tailored, tangible tools reinforcing recommended behaviors at each well-child visit; and (2) a health-communication curriculum for child-health providers, including modules on teach-back shared goalsetting techniques."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model", "text": "SCT and health-literacy principles informed the conceptual framework for the Greenlight Intervention Study (Fig 1) . 20, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] SCT suggests that a parent (or other adult caregivers) is more likely to adopt a new health behavior in an environment that includes each of 4 features: motivation (direct reinforcement of the behavior), social cues (repeated modeling of the behavior), outcome expectancy (expectation that the new behavior will produce real child benefit); and self-efficacy (confidence in her or his ability to perform the behavior). To optimize parent adoption of specific obesityprevention behaviors, the intervention includes these 4 SCT features: (1) physicians are trained in motivationalinterviewing and shared goal-setting skills to identify and reinforce specific parent behaviors (motivation); (2) at each visit, the physician provides each parent with a written toolkit and other tangible tools that offer visual models of recommended behaviors (social cues); (3) the physician provides information to help the parent make a causal link between the behavior and a healthy child (outcome expectancy); and (4) the physician uses simple messages from the toolkit to support the parent' s confidence in adopting discreet, short-term behaviors (selfefficacy)."}, {"section_title": "Literacy and Cultural Sensitivity", "text": "Applying principles and evidence from the field of health literacy, 20,53-55 the design team reinforced the Greenlight intervention with additional lowliteracy features, to ensure that verbal and written messages are most easily understood.

Parents are encouraged to share this booklet with all adult caregivers in the child' s home. Each core booklet is tailored to the child' s developmental stage and corresponds to 1 of the routine well-child visits between 2 months and 18 months. Each core booklet or supplement measures 8.5 by 5.5 inches (8.5 by 11-inch page, folded in half). Each core booklet contains 12 to 16 pages, and each (Table 3) . 11, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] Each of these behaviors is highlighted on the cover of each core booklet within a green \"traffic light\" circle.\nAt 4 of the 6 well-child visits during study participation, the parent-child dyad receives a \"tangible tool,\" which is intended to promote intervention fidelity and to reinforce core messages (Fig 4) .\nEach tangible tool cost ,$4, with an estimated annual cost per child of ,$8.

Every 6 months after the initial training, each resident physician attended an additional Greenlight Booster Training, in person or by video-enabled webcast.\nApplying the principles of active learning, 73 ,74 the training curriculum used obesity prevention content to teach physician-parent communication skills in 3 domains: (1) clear health communication techniques (eg, plain language, \"teach back\" technique, and the effective use of printed materials) 27, [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] ; (2) cultural and linguistic competence (eg, family structure, community resources, and language interpreters), 80 and (3) shared goal setting. 81 Complementing the toolkit' s content, the physiciantraining curriculum promotes conversational dialogue with minimal jargon, reference to the toolkit' s pictures, and frequent verbal verification of understanding of information (eg, teach back). In addition to interpersonal communication, the curriculum addressed learner-centered content in each of the 6 competencies espoused by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education: medical knowledge (evidencebased behaviors associated with early childhood risk of obesity), patient care (improving anticipatory guidance into a routine preventive care visit), professionalism (respecting cultural differences in infant feeding practices), systemsbased practice (curriculum that acknowledges obesity as a public-health problem), and practice-based knowledge (integration of the Greenlight intervention into daily practice). 33, 46 The interactive training sessions were facilitated by the PI and physician champions (including attending physicians and residents). Short, \"trigger\" videos portraying physician-parent encounters were employed to stimulate discussion and to demonstrate effective use of the Greenlight Toolkit.

For TIPP materials not available in Spanish, the research team' s advisory committed translated and adapted the materials into Spanish language, following the same process as applied to the Greenlight materials.\nTo maintain equipoise in attention with the intervention group, the PIs also designed \"TIPP Tangible Tools,\" physician training modules in injury prevention, and physician observation checklists that accounted for developmentally appropriate injury prevention counseling.

We anticipate that this study will help to assess the following overarching questions:\nCan a parent counseling-based intervention delivered in pediatric primary care increase the adoption of healthy family behaviors and/or reduce the risk of childhood obesity at age 2 years?\nWhat parent behaviors and attitudes during infancy are related to child obesity at age 2 years?\nHow do parent literacy and numeracy mediate these effects?\nWe know relatively little about the role of specific family behaviors (eg, breastfeeding, recognizing satiety clues, limiting television exposure) in determining an infant' s likelihood of developing clinically significant obesity. The Greenlight study affords the opportunity to explore these relationships. Furthermore, this study will allow clinicians and researchers to assess the modifiable roles of other social and cultural factors (eg, parent acculturation, parent locus of control, parent-clinician language discordance) in the early adoption of family health behaviors. Finally, as we follow this cohort through age 5 years, we will examine the sustained impact of the intervention into the critical periods of adiposity rebound and school entry.\nDespite the large sample size and analytic approach, the sampling frame limits our ability to detect a small treatment effect and to generalize beyond low-income populations in urban and near-urban settings.
