[{"section_title": "", "text": "The economic recession that began in 2008 has affected employment for all workers, including 4-year college graduates (Carnevale, Jayasundera, and Cheah 2012). Compared with graduates who received a bachelor's degree in the early 2000s, current college graduates aged 21-24 are more likely to be unemployed and wages for all graduates are lower (Shierholz, Sabadish, and Wething 2012). Those who find employment may be working in a job unrelated to their field of study (Carnevale, Jayasundera, and Cheah 2012;Roska and Arum 2012). Moreover, the effects of graduating during a weak economy may have longlasting consequences in the form of depressed wages and slowed occupational advancement decades after graduation (Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012;Kahn 2010).  (Carnevale, Cheah, and Strohl 2013). Compensation also varies by major (Oreopolous and Petronijevic 2013); for example, graduates who major in female-dominated fields (such as education and some health care professions) earn less than their peers who major in male-dominated fields such as engineering (Roksa 2005). Finally, graduates in occupations that align with their college major earn more than those with mismatches between major and occupation, particularly in technical fields (Bender and  nal Study (B&B:93/94, B&B:00/01, and B&B:08/09). These studies followed 1992-93, 1999-2000, and 2007-08 bachelor's degree recipients identified in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). The B&B studies focus on 4-year college graduates and do not include individuals who have not completed a bachelor's degree. In addition to their base-year NPSAS interview, students in each cohort completed a follow-up interview 1 year after graduating. The Brief is based on data from the base-year and 1-year follow-up interviews. More information about the data collected for these cohorts can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/b&b. Although the latter approach avoids respondents' subjective assessments of the match, it may not accurately reflect all of the skills that graduates might gain, particularly for majors that impart skills applicable to a range of occupations (Robst 2007). All comparisons of estimates were tested for statistical significance using the Student's t statistic, and all differences cited are statistically significant at the p < .05 level. 3 1 See Hout (2012) for a review of studies on the economic and social outcomes associated with earning a bachelor's degree and how these outcomes vary among individuals and groups. 2 In this Brief, \"college graduates\" refers to graduates of 4-year postsecondary institutions who earned a bachelor's degree. 3 No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. The standard errors for the estimates can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014003.  \u2022 In 2009, recent graduates who reported that their jobs were closely related to their majors earned more than graduates reporting jobs that were either somewhat or unrelated to their major ($40,000 vs. $35,000 and $31,000, respectively) (figure 8)."}, {"section_title": "STUDY QUESTIONS", "text": "1 What was the employment and enrollment status of 2007-08 bachelor's degree recipients 1 year after college? How did the employment and enrollment status of these recent college graduates compare with that of earlier cohorts?  EMPLOYMENT AND ENROLLMENT STATUS Employment and enrollment status of 1992-93, 1999-2000, and 2007-08 bachelor degree recipients: 1994, 2001, and 2009           3 What were the relationships between college graduates' major field of study and their employment outcomes, including unemployment rates, the relatedness of graduates' majors and jobs, salary levels (among those employed full time), and occupations? How did these relationships vary over time?  In each of the 3 years examined, crossmajor comparisons revealed that unrelated employment was highest for humanities majors (44 to 55 percent). 8 Because STEM includes a range of major fields of study with different employment outlooks (Bender and Heywood 2011), these fields are disaggregated into three categories: computer and information sciences, engineering, and other STEM. The latter category includes biological and physical sciences, science technology, mathematics, and agricultural and natural sciences. Among those employed and not enrolled, percentage of 1992-93, 1999-2000, and 2007-08 bachelor's degree recipients who reported jobs that were unrelated to their undergraduate major field of study, by major field of study: 1994, 2001, and 2009 FIGURE 6.
