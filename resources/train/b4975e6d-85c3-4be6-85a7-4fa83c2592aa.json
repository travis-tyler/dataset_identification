[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Universities are suppliers of human capitalthe most important resource in the knowledge economy. Significant investments are made at the individual and societal level in doctoral education, the terminal research training degree. Realising the returns from these investments requires attaining an independent research career with a sustained ability to contribute to the scientific enterprise (Bozeman et al., 2001). Yet doctorate recipients increasingly serve longer apprenticeships, or postdoc appointments, as a result of decreased and uncertain funding for research. These modern apprentices, unlike the apprentice in Goethe's poem, are the best and brightest scientific talent in the world, yet they serve as contingent labour in the new, post-crisis academy-a situation that is likely to wreck havoc on the academic labour market. The concept of the postdocs originated at Johns Hopkins University in the late 19th century. Based on the German habilitation model the postdoc was an opportunity for a research apprenticeship at a time when most American doctoral programmes focused on teaching (Feldman and Desrochers, 2004). After a shortterm postdoc appointment, scientists were able to advance to faculty positions, making their low pay and poor working conditions a temporary sacrifice with a significant, guaranteed reward. This informal labour market provided benefit to universities in terms of low cost labour and benefits to the postdoc, who was able to focus on research before taking on the demands of a faculty position. As doctoral education changed to focus on research the postdoc became a competitive and highly coveted means to conduct specialised research in the twentieth century (Geiger, 1986, 222). More recently, the postdoc has become a precondition for a faculty position in the life sciences, where postdoc appointments are most prevalent and have the longest history (Stephan and Ma, 2005). However, the use of postdoc appointments has diffused across academic disciplines. In 2008, approximately equal numbers of recent science and engineering (S&E) doctorate recipients were employed in academic postdoc positions and full-time faculty positions (National Science Board, 2012: Chapter 5). 1 Well beyond a temporary employment situation, postdoc appointments frequently last more than 3 years, with many individuals taking multiple, sequential post doc appointments (Halford, 2013). Less than 40% of postdocs eventually move forward to faculty positions. The remainder moves to industry or leave science. Postdocs tend to be more prevalent at private universities and are geographically concentrated in New England and along the West Coast, with less employment in other regions of the country. The implications of these trends for the scientific enterprise are unknown. Doctoral students, postdocs and faculty represent sequential career stages with different skill levels and terms of employment. Prior research has established the contributions of postdocs and graduate students to academic research productivity (Black and Stephan, 2010;Corley and Sabharwal, 2007;Gurmu et al., 2010;Vogel, 1999). In fact, postdocs and graduate students have been credited with maintaining research productivity in light of expectations about decreased productivity associated with the aging of the professorate (Kyvik and Olsen, 2008;Stephan and Levin, 1992). Understanding how academic labour inputs function as either substitutes or complements in the production of knowledge has been identified as a gap in the literature, with significant implications for graduate education and the investment of public resources (Stephan, 2012b). Rather than providing a career ladder, postdoc appointments have become a form of contingent labour that absorbs the effects of fluctuations in research funding. Non-market aspects of university research, including incentives such as prestige and the possibility of a tenure-track job, allow this market failure to persist. Graduate students are encouraged to pursue careers in the sciences yet employment relationships have broken down due to fluctuating and uncertain funding. After the economic crisis we face diminished support for science that will exacerbate the trends we observed over the past 25 years. Inadequate understanding of how academic labour inputs interact could lead to a serious misallocation of resources (Siggelkow, 2002), affecting the future of the research enterprise. In this paper, we use standard economic analysis to examine the contribution of postdocs to academic research productivity. We focus on the labour mix employed in university life sciences research to determine if postdocs complement or substitute for faculty, PhD students, and for capital inputs. Specifically we ask whether these relationships in the production of research have changed over time in response to fluctuations in funding. The answer will allow us to estimate how the economic crisis may further affect employment in scientific careers and the future of the academic enterprise. In the following section, we consider trends in the funding of academic research. There is surprisingly little empirical analysis despite the fact that there are an estimated 90,000 postdocs working in the USA alone (National Science Board, 2010). Our analysis focuses on the academic life sciences labour force, as trends in this labour force are likely to also occur subsequently in other fields. 2 We then establish a conceptual framework for modelling the research production function and presents the data used to estimate cross-sectional models of research production. Our empirical results demonstrate that postdocs increasingly complement both faculty and capital equipment but are substituting for doctoral research assistants, serving as a lower cost skilled labour input. We then present conclusions and discuss policy implications."}, {"section_title": "Review of recent trends in the life sciences research production", "text": "In the last 25 years, research at academic institutions has been disadvantaged by inconsistent funding sources and amounts, including year-to-year variability and cycles of boom and bust (Boat, 2010). The largest share of academic research is funded by the federal government: 59% ($32.6 billion) of academic research in 2009, down from 68% in the 1972 (National Science Board, 2012: Appendix Table 5.2). Figure 1 examines federal funding for life science research, which provides an opportunity to examine how fluctuations in funding affect the employment of scientists. From 1999From -2003, there was a doubling of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget, which is the largest US federal funder of bioscience research. This doubling was motivated by a variety of constituencies (Sampat, 2012) and resulted in university investment in capacity as an attempt to secure additional research funding, which did not materialise. Following the financial crisis, life sciences research funding received a significant, but temporary, funding bump in 2009 from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that has, once again, not been sustained. As a result of US budgetary sequestration, federal agency research appropriations have been further cut, putting great stress on university research activity (Stafford, 2013). Fluctuations in funding create increased risk and uncertainty that encourage the use of contingent labour (Milner and Pinker, 2001). The uneven funding landscape has coincided with significant changes in the scientific workforce. Tenure-track faculty positions have become less available relative to the number of new doctorate recipients. According to the National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators 2012, only 14.3% of life sciences PhDs hold a tenure-track faculty position 5 years after completing their degree. Figure 2 shows the growth in postdoc appointments in university life sciences departments. This figure also illustrates the increase employment of immigrants in the US postdoc workforce. The percentage of postdocs who were immigrants on temporary visa status exceeded 50% for the first time in 1999, as the NIH doubling began, and reached a high of 56% in 2004, when the doubling concluded. Thus, the extent of this problem, while focused in the USA, becomes international. Postdocs are more likely to be found at private universities. Tables 1 and 2 provide data on number of postdocs employed in the life sciences at 120 major research universities. The most recent complete data is for 2006, in advance of the financial crisis, however the crisis is expected to exacerbated the use of postdoc appointments due to increased instability in the research enterprise. For the 36 private institutions in our sample, the mean number of postdocs employed (345) were almost double the mean number employed at public universities (169), although the high standard deviation indicates there is a great range within these two institutional categories, suggesting that other factors are important. To calculate trends in the use of postdocs, we examine two cross-sections in 1993 and 2006, which bracket the fluctuations in funding noted in Figures 1 and 2. Over this time period, the use of postdocs increased in aggregate by 137%, with significant variation within institutional type. The data suggest that public universities were increasing their use of post docs (Table 1, column 3). On average, there were twice as many postdocs as PhD students and faculty at private institutions (Table 1, column 4), with two PhD students for every postdoc at private universities compared to five PhD students at public institutions. A similar pattern holds for the ratio of faculty to postdocs (Table 1, column 5) Table 2 examines the regional distribution of postdocs by US Census division. On average, there are 221 postdocs in the life sciences at the average research university. The majority of postdocs are employed at universities on either coast (New England, Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic for the US east coast and the Pacific region for the west coast). Universities in New England, on average, employ 486 life science postdocs, while universities in the West South Central region (which includes Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma) employ an average of 36. For the life sciences the postdoc stipend is fixed nationally ($38.976 in 2006), while most postdoc employment is found in the most costly regions of the country, further placing a burden on individuals. The ratio of PhD students and faculty to postdocs fluctuates, indicating that opportunities are not uniformly distributed. Moreover, the correlation between the number of postdocs and life science funding is 0.25 at the university level, suggesting differences in the use of this labour input. This finding is similar to Stephan et al. (2004) and suggests a transfer between different regions of the country, with states in the Mid-west failing to capture the potential economic development advantages that come from training a skilled workforce. Traditionally the postdoc appointment was a step in an individual's career progression to a coveted tenure-track faculty position. Today, postdoc appointments may have become institutionalised as a lower cost alternative to hiring tenure-track faculty members and research staff, who command higher salaries and benefits, or training graduate research assistants, who require tuition support and greater supervision. As a reserve supply of PhD educated labour accumulated, postdocs have been employed as a lower cost form of research labour that complements faculty while substituting for research assistants and staff. As a low cost complement to faculty and a substitute for other labour inputs there is little incentive to make full use of postdocs' capabilities or to make difficult decisions about the allocation of scarce resources. Doctoral recipients receive the benefit of public funding for their graduate education and invest their own time and resources, yet there is limited payoff for them individually and society loses the potential return on its investment if they are not able to conduct independent research or leave science (Stephan, 2012a). Students, realising that the payoff of a tenuretrack position is gone, will have little incentive to pursue research careers."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual framework", "text": "A large literature focuses on the production of knowledge, specifically the relationship of public and private funding (Blume-Kohout et al., 2009;David et al., 2000). The same framework can be extended to human capital inputs in the production of knowledge, with three types of skilled labour. We modelled research as a production process, with labour inputs producing a research output. Postdoc appointments may be considered a skill-based input that further increases the productivity of faculty, graduate students or capital investments. Conversely, postdoc appointments may substitute for other forms of academic labour, crowding out faculty, graduate students or staff. We do not mean to imply that researchers are literally deciding to substitute a doctoral research assistant for a postdoc in any given setting. Rather, we see many thousands of individual admission, funding and hiring decisions determining the quantity of postdocs employed. There are reasons to expect either substitution or complementarity in the production of knowledge as the outcome of research. Hamermesh (1986) and Hamermesh and Grant (1979) argue that, as an intermediate skill level between graduate research assistants and faculty researchers, postdocs could substitute for either as the least costly form of labour. Because many postdocs are immigrants, Borjas (2004) and Chellaraj et al. (2008) hypothesise they may crowd out native workers through substitution or serve as a complement that increases native workers' marginal productivity. As a form of contingent labour, postdocs may be considered to substitute for other forms of labour (Houseman et al., 2003). Alternatively, the system of contingent employment represented by the postdoctoral workforce may complement the professoriate and increase productivity (Ko, 2003). Postdocs are one form of labour that could either substitute for capital investment or increase the productivity of capital investment, potentially attracting further investment. This open question is easy to estimate empirically. Moreover, due to funding uncertainty we would expect to see changes in the relationships over time. The consequences of misunderstanding these relationships are especially high if the inputs are in fact complements. Siggelkow (2002) argues that misunderstanding complementary relationships can have serious consequences because systems become more fragile as the relationship between factors strengthens. In the context we study, inadequate information about complementary inputs could lead decision makers to overlook important production externalities. For example, because scientific labour inputs also represent career stages, over utilisation of postdoc labour has the externality of increasing the postdoc labour supply. Non-pecuniary factors such as prestige, career aspirations and dedication to science enable this market failure to persist and labour market adjustments are not easy due to the time required to train a PhD scientist and the specialised nature of the human capital produced. Therefore we are especially concerned about We adapt Siggelkow's (2002) model to the context of life sciences research (see Figure 2). We start with levels of two inputs (for example, postdocs and doctoral students) chosen to maximise research output Q = f (A, B, \u03b1) where \u03b1 represents the interaction between A and B. If A and B are complements, \u03b1 > 0 and if A and B are substitutes, \u03b1 < 0. Assume a production function Q = A+B+\u03b1AB\u2212A 2 \u2212B 2 . Consider that the choice of input levels is made without knowledge of \u03b1. If there is no misperception of the interaction between the inputs, \u03b1 = 0 and output can be maximised by choosing A*(\u03b1, 0) and B* (\u03b1, 0). If the interaction is misperceived, input levels are set at A*(\u03b1, \u03b4) and B* (\u03b1, \u03b4), where \u03b4 represents the difference between true \u03b1 and perceived \u03b1. The decrease in output due to the misperception can then be modelled as Q\u2032 = A+B+(\u03b1+\u03b4) AB\u2212A 2 \u2212B 2 . The input levels are represented by The cost of misperception is then represented as M = \u2212\u03b4 2 /((2\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b4) 2 (2\u2212\u03b1). Figure 3 illustrates that this cost is greater when the true interaction \u03b1 is greater than 0; that is, when the inputs are complements. The analyses use a translog production function with doctoral research assistants, postdocs, faculty and capital as inputs. A production function is used rather than a cost function because it seems more likely for exogenous shocks or policy interventions, such as training programmes or immigration controls, to affect quantity than price (Hamermesh and Grant, 1979, 520). By relaxing the additivity and homogeneity assumptions, the translog functional form appropriately models a system with more than two inputs (Christensen et al., 1973, 29). Following Grossman (1982), equation 1represents the translog production function for i = doctoral, postdoc, faculty and capital and X i = the quantity of DOCTORAL, POSTDOC, FACULTY and CAPITAL. Factor shares represent the share of production attributable to each input. We calculate factor shares for each input using equation (2).  w i is the input's cost, X i is the quantity, and Q is research output. Equation 3provides an example of the postdocs' factor share."}, {"section_title": "S P OSTDOC w P OSTDOCS Q", "text": "Here, w POSTDOC represents postdoc wages, POSTDOCS represents number of postdocs, and Q represents total research output. We then estimate factor share equations for doctoral research assistants, postdocs, faculty, and capital. See equation 4 (Grossman, 1982;Okkerse, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "S DOCTORAL POSTDOC", "text": "where i = doctoral, postdoc, faculty, capital. Factor shares are scaled so the sum of the shares equals one, (S i(scaled) = S i /\u03a3S i ). The four equations are then estimated using seemingly unrelated regression with the quantity of each input as an independent variable and the factor share as the dependent variable. The \u03b3s from these estimates are used to find coefficients of complementarity (Grossman, 1982). The signs of these coefficients indicate substitution (negative) or complementarity (positive) between a pair of inputs. Table 3 provides sources and definitions for the variables used in the model. Our research output measure is publication counts for each university for each year of study, obtained from the Web of Science database in November 2011. Citation counts were weighted by using average citations per publication from the National Research Council (NRC) Assessments of research doctoral programmes conducted in 1993 and 2006. We take a weighted average of average citations per publication by a broad field within each university life sciences programme. The choice of publications and citations rather than patents as output measures avoids the measurement challenges associated with infrequent events (Gurmu et al., 2010) and long lag times (Chellaraj et al., 2008). In particular, it avoids the especially long lag times, up to 15 years, associated with patenting in some life sciences (DiMasi et al., 2003). Input quantities for doctoral research assistants, postdocs, faculty and capital are measured in the following ways. We estimate the number of doctoral students employed as research assistants based on the number of doctoral students from the NRC Assessment and the percentages of those students reporting research assistantships and teaching assistantships. 3 Postdoc counts come from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates. The faculty labour input represents the total life sciences doctoral faculty reported in the 1993 and 2006 NRC Assessments. We use net assignable square feet of life sciences laboratory space from the NSF Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities as a measure of capital input. These data are available biennially from 2003 and for 2006, we took the midpoint between the 2005 and 2007 quantities. For 1993, we assumed that universities had the same share of the total life sciences lab space as they reported in 2003. Year-to-year correlations of 93-95% support this assumption. We lag all inputs by 2 years to account for the time between conducting the research and publication (Gurmu et al., 2010;Stephan and Levin, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "Data and analyses", "text": "We assumed doctoral research assistant wages to be equal to tuition plus the value of the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Research Service Award (NRSA) predoctoral stipend ($8800 in 1993 and $20,772 in 2006). For public universities, we attempted to account for the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition. We assumed that international students (percentage available from the NRC Assessment) were funded at the out-ofstate tuition rate and that US students were funded at the in-state rate. Further, we assumed that research assistantships were half time positions, so multiplied this cost by two to get the wage for one full-time equivalent of research assistant labour. We measured postdoc wages using the NIH NRSA level one postdoc stipend ($19,700 in 1993 and $38,976 in 2006) plus 25% for benefits costs. The NRSA funds many postdocs in the life sciences and its stipends are often used as a benchmark by other funding sources. Faculty salaries and benefits costs were available from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. These figures were not specific to the life sciences, but aggregate data from the American Association of University Professors (Ehrenberg, 2004) indicate that life sciences faculty salaries are only slightly above the average salaries for all faculty. NIH stipend amounts are not geographically adjusted for costs of living, although some universities may adjust the amount they pay postdocs relative to these stipend amounts based on local costs of living. Faculty salaries are assumed to take local costs of living into account. To estimate the rental rate of lab space, we first started with data available from Facilities Construction Cost Data (R.S. Means Co., 2006) on the construction cost of lab space. These costs are available for major cities throughout the USA and an adjustment factor is provided to account for changes in construction costs from year to year. We used a published account of the 2006 rental rate of lab space in Boston (Botelho, 2008), the city with the largest concentration of postdocs, to establish a ratio of rental rates to construction costs of 0.24. A policy that may influence these economic relationships in academic research is the funding of graduate education in public and private universities. States subsidise graduate education, resulting in reduced in-state tuition rates that allow departments to more easily offer tuition waivers to in-state doctoral research assistants. These state subsidies result in different cost structures for doctoral student labour in public and private universities. Public universities typically pay lower faculty salaries and are subject to more budgetary scrutiny. Therefore, we consider whether a university's public or private status moderates the substitutability of doctoral research assistants for other inputs. Separate analyses were conducted for public and private universities to account for state subsidies of doctoral education as reflected in reduced in-state tuition at public institutions. We include dummy variables coded as 1 for public universities and 0 for private universities and as 1 if the university offers a medical degree and 0 if it does not. Analyses are conducted on 120 observations for research universities for which complete information is available for 1993 and for 2006. The matched sample allows analysis of trends in research production within a core group of prominent research universities. The extended sample can be considered a comparison of the university life sciences research enterprise at two points in time, taking into account broader participation by new entrants. Descriptive statistics and correlations are presented in Table 4. Table 5 present the results of seemingly unrelated regression models for 1993 and 2006 crosssections using citation-weighted publication counts as the output measure. 4 The models in Table 5 include all universities, and reveal that doctoral research assistants, faculty and capital are all negatively associated with the size of postdocs' factor share in both 1993 and 2006. For example, in 1993, an increase in the number of postdocs employed from 100 to 271 would be associated with a 3.0 percentage point decrease in the share of production attributed to faculty (ln100 = 4.605; ln271 = 5.605). In 2006, this would result in a 2.8 percentage point decrease. The statistically significant relationships between the labour inputs and capital indicate that capital and labour are not separable in the context of this study; it would be inappropriate to estimate the substitutability of labour factors without including a measure of capital (Berndt and Christensen, 1973). In 1993, postdocs show statistically significant relationships to the factor shares of faculty and capital, but there is no statistically significant relationship to doctoral students. In both 2006 analyses, postdocs show statistically significant relationships to doctoral students, faculty and capital. Table 6 shows similar relationships among factors and factor shares in public universities. Table 7 provides results for private institutions. All off-diagonal coefficients are statistically significant and negative. Because the quantities of input factors are highly correlated, multicollinearity is a concern. One potential consequence of multicollinearity is a lack of statistically significant coefficients (Kennedy, 2008), but that is not the case here. In addition, the mean variance inflation factors for all models are less than 10, cited by Kennedy (p. 199) as a customary level above which multicollinearity is considered problematic. Table 8 presents the coefficients of complementarity, calculated as C ij = (\u03b3 ij +S i S j )/(S i S j ) (Grossman, 1982), at the mean values of the factor shares. In almost all cases, the coefficients of complementarity are positive, indicating that the inputs are complements. For example, capital equipment is a complement to all three labour inputs and the relationship has intensified over time. There are two exceptions to these complementary relationships. Faculty and doctoral students appear to have been substitutes in 1993 (C = \u22120.078, p < 0.001), although the coefficient is small but still statistically significant. Postdocs and doctoral students appear to be substitutes in 2006 (C = \u22120.292, p = <0.001). This finding is consistent with the interpretation that, as the use of postdocs became institutionalised they have taken over work formerly done by doctoral research assistants. Table 9 presents the coefficients of complementarity separately for public and private institutions. In public universities, all inputs appear to be complements except doctoral students and postdocs in 2006 (C=\u22120.135, p < 0.001). This relationship holds for private universities but the effect is four times as strong, indicating greater substitution at private universities where the cost of tuition is higher. 5 Comparing the cross-sectional models for 1993 and 2006 suggests that postdocs have consistently complemented capital and faculty during both time periods. However, finding a complementary relationship is consistent with the idea that regular and contingent employment systems function as complements, especially in organisations where the regular employees participate in a strong internal labour market (Ko, 2003). By 2006, postdocs have come to substitute for doctoral students, primarily in universities where their work is institutionalised as part of large research programmes.

In the post-crisis era limited resources, declining public support for science and the erosion of the social contract has created instability and inefficient use of resources in the production of knowledge. Our results show that over the past 25 years, postdocs have become substitutes for doctoral students in the production of knowledge as research funding became more uncertain. The substitute relationship we observe could perversely result in students gaining less research experience during their doctoral training, leading to greater reliance on postdoc appointments for research experience. This unfortunate labour market is likely to intensify post-economic crisis, unless there is a public policy response. The logic of market fundamentalism argues that the current bleak future employment situation in the postdoc labour market should potentially counteract any incentives to train a surplus of PhD students. However, the possible response on the part of individual postdoc researchers is limited. Doctoral training requires 8-10 years of higher education, with significant public investment as well as individual sacrifice. Emphasis has typically been placed on students' awareness of future job prospects, with the idea that information would send a market signal (NRC, 2001). Yet studies of graduate student decision-making call into question whether prospective students are making career decisions based on close examination of data (Breneman et al., 1976;Fox and Stephan, 2001). Rather than respond to market forces, the salaries of postdocs have been kept low by institutional fiat, with most individuals motivated by the love of science and the prospect of a future academic career, even as these opportunities are diminished (Roach and Sauermann, 2010;Stern, 2004). Indeed, the limited opportunities for recently minted PhDs certainly contribute to lack of rewards for human capital investments at the centre of the active post-crisis debate about the value of university education. Certainly, the labour mix is affected by the policy choice of funding priorities, a topic which deserves more investigation. Because government funds the majority of academic research and graduate education, policymakers should consider how their funding choices affect the labour mix. In the USA, the NIH has initiated a New and Early Stage Investigator Program to fund younger scholars and a Pathway to Independence Award to favour independent investigation. These efforts aim to counter the trend that favours senior investigators leading large research programmes that increases demand for postdocs as a complement good.

These findings also suggest a number of directions for further research. The change in these employment relationships may be due to changes in the composition of the postdoc population, the nature of doctoral and postdoctoral training, a combination of both of these or other factors. These questions are beyond the scope of this study but certainly warrant further investigation. We do know that the composition of the postdoc population began to include more immigrants on temporary visas when funding for science was increasing, suggesting greater substitution of individuals who are the brightest from their home country and who migrate in search of opportunity that this unrealised. Unfortunately, data on the immigrant status of postdocs is incomplete. Our regression models treating native and immigrant postdocs as separate factors were unstable due to limited sample size, although this questions warrants further investigation. In addition, future research could model academic knowledge production as one of joint production with both teaching and research outcomes (Hanushek, 1979;Johnson and Turner, 2009). Additional information about specific field of study may moderate the complementary relationships we find. For example, production relationships may differ in fields like engineering where there are more research career opportunities in industry. Additional analysis could also be conducted at the laboratory level, which is a unit of production in academic research for which research allocation decisions are made. Our findings also reaffirm the value of gaining accurate information about the postdoctoral workforce. Initiatives such as the National Academy of Sciences' 'The State of the Post-doctoral Experience for Scientists and Engineers Revisited' and NSF efforts to improve data collection on postdocs, should increase understanding of both how postdoc employment affects academic productivity and career prospects. Of course, the tendency is always to want better data and more studies. The future of the academic labour market is precarious and policy intervention is warranted now in order to address the implications of decreased funding for academic research, which will only intensify post-crisis."}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "1 NSF defines recent graduates as those degreed in the past 3 years.
