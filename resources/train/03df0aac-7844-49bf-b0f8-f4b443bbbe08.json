Previous studies have focused either on the e\u00a4ect of parental investments (see Cunha et al. 2006; Cunha and Heckman 2007) or on the e\u00a4ect of children's own investments as measured by study e\u00a4ort, such as time spent on homework or studying (see Stinebrickner 2004 and Cooper et al. 2006; Eren and Henderson 2011; Kalenkoski and Pabilonia 2014) , but not on both. This is the \u2026rst analysis comparing the impact of parental and child time investments on cognitive outcomes in adolescence.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that the e\u00a4ect of parental investments on child development declines during adolescence, (see Carneiro et al. 2003; Cunha and Heckman 2008; Del Boca et al. 2014) , whereas the e\u00a4ect of time spent on homework increases (see Cooper et al. 2006 ). This implies that there is scope for policy interventions targeting adolescents rather than their families. It is during adolescence, in fact, that teenagers start taking responsibility for their own actions, and that their cognitive investments begin to depend on their own decisions, such as how much time and e\u00a4ort to spend doing homework or reading instead of watching television.\nOur paper di\u00a4ers from previous studies in that (i) we use data from time-use diaries to distinguish the e\u00a4ect of time investments made by parents from that made by children by considering the amount of time spent by the child in the mother's supervision versus the time spent alone doing formative activities, (ii) we extend the de\u2026nition of a child's own time investment to include time spent on homework as well as time spent on other activities such as playing an instrument or going to the theater, (iii) we use a new identi\u2026cation strategy that exploits both the within-family between-siblings variation in investments and the within-child between-ability variation in cognitive test scores.\nTo investigate whether parental investments or child self-investments matter more during adolescence, we estimate a cognitive production function using the Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We measure cognitive abilities using a revised version of a set of intelligence tests developed by Woodcock and Johnson in 1977 . More speci\u2026cally, we use three test scores measuring symbolic learning and reading, comprehension and vocabulary, and mathematical abilities.\nThe main econometric challenge in evaluating the e\u00a4ect of investments on child cognitive outcomes is accounting for unobserved child characteristics. Three of the most common strategies adopted are: controlling for the lagged test score in an attempt to reduce the bias caused by omitted past inputs (value-added model), considering child \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation using the within-child across time variation in a panel data approach, and using an instrumental variable estimation (see Todd and Wolpin 2003 for a review) . While papers focusing on the e\u00a4ect of parental investments on child's cognitive abilities have adopted one of these three strategies, most studies looking at the time spent by children on their homework have generally neglected the issue of unobserved child characteristics (see Cooper 2006 for a review of these papers). Among the few exceptions are Aksoy and Link (2000) , who use a child \u2026xed (as well as random) e\u00a4ect estimation that exploits repeated observations over time, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008) , who instrument the time a child spends studying with her roommate's characteristics, and Dolton et al. (2003) , who consider both a valued added model and an instrumental variable estimation. Another approach to control for unobserved child characteristics that has been adopted when inputs and test scores are subject-speci\u2026c is the within-pupil between-subject estimation (e.g. Dee 2005 and , which uses repeated observations of inputs and school test scores across subjects to control for child \u2026xed e\u00a4ects. Eren and Henderson (2011) adopt this approach to control for unobserved child characteristics when evaluating the e\u00a4ect of homework on school test scores in mathematics, science, English and history.\nOur empirical strategy is an improvement over valued added models because we relax two strong assumptions (discussed thoroughly in Todd and Wolpin, 2003) : \u2026rst, that past inputs are irrelevant after controlling for the lagged test, and second, that unobserved child-speci\u2026c characteristics are independent of lagged test scores. While we relax the \u2026rst assumption by controlling for the lagged test, current inputs and lagged inputs, i.e., by adopting what Todd and Wolpin (2003) call an augmented value-added model, we relax the second assumption by resorting to the within-pupil between-subject estimation. We implement the within-pupil between-subject estimation using three cognitive test scores rather than school test scores in di\u00a4erent subjects. More speci\u2026cally, we use test scores for symbolic learning and reading, comprehension and vocabulary, and mathematical abilities to estimate the e\u00a4ect of the lagged cognitive ability on the contemporaneous ability with a child \u2026xed e\u00a4ects approach to control for unobserved child characteristics. We then use this estimated e\u00a4ect of the lagged cognitive ability in a second-step estimation which, by exploiting within-family between sibling variation to control for family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects, allows us to evaluate the e\u00a4ect of investments. Therefore, the novelty of our procedure is to introduce a two-step estimation to evaluate the e\u00a4ect of the lagged cognitive ability as well as of the mother's and child's time investments on the contemporaneous cognitive ability. 1 Our estimation results show that adolescent cognitive development seems to be a\u00a4ected much more by the time invested by the child during adolescence than by the time invested during childhood. In contrast, maternal time investments during childhood matter more than during adolescence. When comparing the time children spend on their own versus the time they spend with their mother doing formative activities during adolescence, we \u2026nd that the child's own time investment a\u00a4ects their test scores much more than the time investment of their mother. This \u2026nding highlights the importance of self-investments during adolescence and suggests potential channels through which cognitive development can be in \u2021uenced at later ages, such as policies using \u2026nancial transfers to encourage student e\u00a4ort and educational activities."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Several surveys have shown that parental time investments on children have important impacts on child cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes (see Carneiro and Heckman 2003 , Ermisch and Francesconi 2005 , Haveman and Wolfe 1995 . Since the majority of socioeconomic surveys lack appropriate measures of parental time, most studies have been forced to use proxy measures, such as mothers'employment (Bernal 2008 , Todd and Wolpin 2007 , Liu et al. 2010 , Bernal and Keane 2011 . A more accurate measure of the time investments in children is provided by the time diary surveys, 2 which usually contain detailed information on the time children spend in di\u00a4erent activities together with their mother, their father and other adults. Nevertheless, only a few papers have actually used time diaries to measure investments in children. Among these few exceptions are Hsin (2007 Hsin ( , 2009 Carneiro and Rodriguez (2009) and Del Boca et al. (2014) , who have used the Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the US. These papers estimate the e\u00a4ect on children's skills of di\u00a4erent measures of parental time investments. Carneiro and Rodriguez (2009) consider the total time spent with the mother; Hsin (2007) de\u2026nes measures of maternal total time, engaged time and quality time; Del Boca et al. (2014) distinguish between the time the children spend with their mother and with their father and between the time when the parents are actively engaged and when they are simply around.\nAs in these previous papers, we use time diary surveys to measure parental time investments, but the novelty of our paper is that we also consider the time children spend on their own. How children spend time on their own becomes important as children grow into teenagers (Kooreman 2007) . This is because adolescents begin to take independent decisions on how to spend their time, and these decisions can a\u00a4ect their cognitive development. There are only a few examples of economic models that consider both children and parents as decision makers. Dauphin et al. (2011) estimate a collective model and provide evidence that children aged 16 and over and living with their parents in \u2021uence the household consumption and labour supply decisions. Lundberg et al. (2009) adopt a non-cooperative model to distinguish between children's decisions taken on their own and those shared with their parents, \u2026nding that the probability of taking independent decisions increases sharply between age 10 and 14.\nGiven that during adolescence children begin to take decisions on their own on how to use their time, cognitive production models for adolescents should include the time children spend on their own engaged in formative activities. The question is then how to de\u2026ne formative activities and time investments made by children.\nIn the economic literature there are a few papers that have de\u2026ned time investments by parents (see, beside the papers cited at the beginning of this section, Price, 2008 and Guryan et al. 2008) . The common approach is to consider the time parents spend with their children in formative activities such as reading, doing homework, playing sports, and exclude activities which are usually considered detrimental or not bene\u2026cial to the child's development, such as, for example, watching television. A natural extension of this de\u2026nition to time investments by the children themselves would consider the time the child spends on her own doing formal and informal educational activities, as well as socializing and sports activities which can contribute to the child's development. This is actually the de\u2026nition which we will adopt in our empirical application (see Section 3 for more details).\nDi\u00a4erent de\u2026nitions of children's time investments have been used in other papers, but none of them distinguishes between the time the child spends on her own and the time the child spends actively supervised by a parent. Fiorini and Keane (2014) consider time-use diaries from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children to estimate the e\u00a4ect of the time children spend on doing a set of di\u00a4erent activities (e.g. school-day care, educational activities with parents and social activities). There are also several studies that have looked at the time invested by children on doing homework or studying, but again they do not distinguish between the time spent by children on their own and supervised by their parents. Dolton et al. (2003) consider the time spent by children on educational activities done on their own, but they only analyze adult students using data from one university in Spain. Similarly, Stinebrickner (2004 and consider the time students invest on studying by using data from a liberal arts college in Kentucky (Berea College). Eren and Henderson (2011) and Aksoy and Link (2000) use the National Education Longitudinal Study of 88 and analyze the e\u00a4ect of homework for children in high school in grade 8 and between grades 8 and 12 respectively. All these studies \u2026nd that there is a positive e\u00a4ect of time spent studying or doing homework (especially in mathematics) on cognitive achievements. However, this positive e\u00a4ect of spending more time doing homework does not seem to extend to primary school students (see Farrow et al. 1999; Cooper et al. 2006) .\nThe above-mentioned research suggests that children's time investments are important inputs in their cognitive development process. If we split the children's investments into the time invested on their own and the time invested under the active supervision of an adult, the former will presumably be increasingly important as they get older. On the contrary, the e\u00a4ect of parental investments on cognitive skills has been shown to decrease rapidly with age (see Heckman 2007, 2008) . In particular, looking at mothers' and fathers' time investments, Del Boca et al. (2014) \u2026nd that the time parents spend actively engaged with their child has an e\u00a4ect on cognitive skills that decreases with the child's age.\nPolicies aimed at parents are still relevant to child development. In fact, when children become adolescents, parents may still have some in \u2021uence on the way their child uses her time when she is on her own. For instance, parents may set strict rules on what their child can and cannot do or they may be able to transmit to their child time-use habits (some evidence on the transmission of time-use habits is provided in Mancini et al. 2015) . Nevertheless, children during adolescence have more freedom in deciding how to use their own time and they can potentially disobey parental advice; therefore, the time they spend on their own studying or doing other formative activities can be considered the result of their own choice and a measure of self-investments. The importance of adolescents'self-investments has raised interest in policies that encourage study e\u00a4ort and educational activities. For example, Angrist and Lavy (2009) have analyzed a randomized trial where cash awards were given to students in low-achieving schools conditional on passing their matriculation exam at the end of high school, which is a prerequisite for enrolling at university in Israel. They \u2026nd that these cash incentives increase students' e\u00a4ort, measured by the number of exams taken, and ultimately the matriculation success rate. Over the last decade, similar conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have been used as a tool to reduce poverty and improve human capital development in several developing countries (see Aber and Rawlings 2011) . Some CCT programs aiming at improving child development have also been adopted in the US. An example is provided by the Opportunity New York City Family Rewards, which introduced di\u00a4erent types of cash incentives including cash transfers conditional on educational outcomes (such as school attendance and requirement levels on standardized test scores). Evaluation of this program indicates that these CCT have led to changes in the time-use of teenagers, in particular in encouraging more engagement in educational activities (see Morris et al. 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Data and preliminary evidence", "text": "Our analysis relies on the Child Development Supplement (CDS), funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The CDS covers a maximum of two children for a subsample of households interviewed in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.\n3 About 3500 children aged 0-12 (from about 2400 households) were \u2026rst interviewed in 1997, and then followed in two subsequent waves, 2002/03 and 2007. The number of successful re-interviews was quite high: 91% in the second wave, 90% in the third one. The CDS collects information on cognitive and non-cognitive development of the sampled children, as well as their time-use diaries and other individual and family characteristics. All the household and parental variables included in the PSID survey are also available for the CDS children. In our analysis we include teenagers aged between 11 and 15 and living with both biological parents. To avoid small sample size issues, we pool two cohorts of children, born respectively in 1982-1986 (adolescents in 2002) and in 1987-1992 (adolescents in 2007) and obtain a sample of 726 children. This makes available two repeated observations for each adolescent: one during adolescence, when she is between 11 and 15 years old (either in 2002 or in 2007) , and the other during childhood, when she is between 6 and 10 years old (either in 1997 or in 2002) . This is the main sample used in the descriptive statistics in this section. For the estimation of our production models we will use the subsample of siblings, sibling sample, which allows us to consider the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation. We have 202 pairs of siblings (404 children out of the 726 included in the main sample). The main summary statistics for the main and sibling samples are reported in the Appendix in Tables A1 and A2 respectively."}, {"section_title": "Time investments", "text": "Crucial to our research question is the availability of detailed information on child's time-use allocation for one randomly selected weekday and one randomly selected weekendday. Time diaries for each day contain recording of activities performed in the 24 hours on a continuous basis. 4 Each spell of a given activity comes with information on its duration, location and on whether the activity was done by the child on her own, in the presence of somebody not actively participating or in the presence of somebody actively engaged.\nThis allows us to de\u2026ne a measure of weekly parental time investment as well as a measure of weekly child own time investments.\n5 These time investments are measured in a speci\u2026c week when parents and children are interviewed, but we assume that these represent the usual or average time inputs during the last 5 years.\nWe measure the parental time investment as the time the parent spends actively engaged with the child reading, doing homework, doing arts and crafts, doing sport, playing, attending performances and museums, engaging in religious activity, having meals and talking with the child, or providing personal care for the child. This aggregate measure of parental investment corresponds to the parent's quality time de\u2026ned by Price (2008). 6 It is meant to include all the activities in which either the child is the primary focus or there is a su\u00a2 cient interaction between the parent and the child. The positive relationship between the frequency of activities such as reading, playing or eating with children and their outcomes is well-documented in the literature (see Price, 2008 , Section II for a concise review). The positive productivity of both mother's and father's active time has also been very recently documented by Del Boca et al. (2014) who have estimated a structural model of household choice on a sample of children in the age group 3-16 from the PSID CDS data set.\nIn order to take the novel perspective of the child's own investments in her development process, we select from the above-listed activities those that improve the child's human capital when performed independently by the child (i.e., either on his own or without anyone actively engaged). The resulting aggregate measure of the child's own investment includes -beside the time spent doing homework -all active leisure components such as reading, doing arts and crafts, doing sport, playing, attending performances and museums, and engaging in religious activity. Both intuition and scienti\u2026c evidence highlight that human capital includes components other than formal knowledge, such as personal interaction skills that can be enhanced by time spent with friends or engaging in physical 4 Activities are coded and registered from midnight of one day (00:00) to midnight of the following day (24:00), using a 24 hour clock. The ending time of an activity coincides with the starting time of the following activity, so that there are no gaps in time. 5 The weekly measure is obtained multiplying by \u2026ve the week-day time, and summing the result with the weekend-day time multiplied by two.\n6 Price (2008) derives parental time inputs from the parents time diaries, which are available in the American Time Use Survey.\nactivities. Cardoso et al. (2010) consider socializing, together with reading and studying, as activities related to the acquisition of human capital, as opposed to passive leisure such as television watching, often portrayed as detrimental and crowding out other useful activities. Felfe et al. (2011) report that a positive link between participation in active leisure sport activities and educational attainment is well established for adolescence, and show that sport club participation during kindergarten and primary school has a positive e\u00a4ect on school performance.\nThe upper part of Table 1 contains the composition of the child's own time investments in childhood age (6-10) and adolescence (11-15). The total active time spent by children on their own increases by about one hour a week (25%), on average, across the two stages of their life. The reading and homework activities bring the largest contribution to this increase (respectively about 16 and 48 minutes per week on average), followed by the playing category (with an average increase of about 13 minutes per week). On the contrary, sport and arts activities appear less frequently performed on average during adolescence compared to childhood. The bottom panel of the same table shows a sharp decrease in the mother's time investments from childhood to adolescence. Mothers spend on average about 9 hours and a half per week actively engaged with their children aged 6 to 10 years, but only 5 hours and a half when their children become adolescents. All categories of mother's time investment except for religious activity diminish across the two life stages. In the Appendix, Table A3 , we report the father's composition of time investments. The total time fathers spend with children declines with the child's age: on average they spend 6 hours a week with their children aged 6 to 10 years, but only 4 when the children are 11 to 15. However, time spent on helping with homework, talking and attending performances increases slightly.

The CDS provides three cognitive test scores measuring symbolic learning and reading, comprehension and vocabulary, and mathematical abilities: the Letter-Word Identi\u2026cation, PassageComprehension, and Applied-Problems test scores. These tests were administered to respondents aged 6 years and older by the interviewer, following a standardized administrative protocol and adjusting the test by di\u00a2 culty according to the respondent's age (see CDS User Guide for details). Each of these three tests provides a score which is a measure of the child's cognitive ability. The Letter-Word Identi\u2026cation Score (LWS) measures symbolic learning (matching pictures with words) and reading identi\u2026cation skills (identifying letters and words). It starts from the easiest items (identi\u2026cation of letters and pronuncia-tion of simple words), progressing to the more di\u00a2 cult items. The Passage Comprehension Score (PCS) assesses comprehension and vocabulary skills through multiple-choice and \u2026ll-in-the-blank formats. The Applied Problems Score (APS) measures mathematical skills in analyzing and solving practical problems. The test scores are available in both raw and standardized formats. The former essentially counts the number of items correctly answered, while the latter are obtained by standardizing the raw scores according to the respondent's age. 7 We use the standardized measures throughout our analysis."}, {"section_title": "Time investments and cognitive ability: preliminary evidence", "text": "In Tables 2 and 3 we provide descriptive evidence on the link between time investments and child cognitive outcomes. In Table 2 we look at the di\u00a4erences between average test scores for adolescents, dividing them into two groups: those receiving a high level of investments from their mother (higher than average) and those receiving a low level of investments (lower than average). It can be noticed that children receiving low time investments from their mothers during adolescence have essentially the same outcomes in adolescence as children receiving high time investments, while the time spent with the mother actively engaged in childhood displays some association with adolescents'cognitive outcomes (the di\u00a4erence is statistically di\u00a4erent at 1% level for PCS and marginally signi\u2026cant, at 15% level, for APS).

We also take into account the fact that cognitive development is a cumulative process, by allowing the production function to depend on both contemporaneous and past investments.\nBy assuming that the production function be additive, separable and linear in its inputs, we specify the achievement production model during the adolescent stage, i.e., between age 11 and 15, as follows:\nwhere the outcome Y ijt is a general measure of cognitive ability for adolescent i in household j at t years old, t = 11; :::; 15 and the arguments are given by: the vector of contemporaneous cognitive investments during adolescence by the child herself, X C ijt , her family, X her unobserved cognitive endowment ij ; a random (idyonsincratic) shock in period t, ijt .\nNotice that we assume that the parameters of the above model are invariant during the stage of adolescence, i.e., for children aged between 11 and 15 (t = 11; :::; 15), but we do not impose that this model is invariant across di\u00a4erent child life stages.

For the cumulative model, we discuss consistency of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects (FE) estimator and the estimator obtained taking di\u00a4erences across time, which we call the time di\u00a4erence (TD) estimator. For the augmented value-added model, we do not consider the TD estimator, which is not applicable in our context, 9 and, in addition to OLS and family FE, we discuss a two-step estimator that we propose below."}, {"section_title": "Cumulative model", "text": "Breaking down investments by children, families and schools, the cumulative model during adolescence (5) can be written as:\nwhere 0 is the intercept, 1 = [ Estimation of the above model is quite demanding in terms of data on current and past investments. In our empirical application we are able to measure parental investments by looking at the time the mother spends actively engaged with her child, whereas we measure child investments by the time children spend on formative activities on their own without the supervision of an adult (see Section 3 for details on these de\u2026nitions). We are able to observe these parental and child investments during late childhood and adolescence, whereas we are unable to observe school inputs, [X S ijt ; X S ijt 5 ; X S ijt 10 ], and early childhood inputs, X ijt 10 . For this reason we have to collapse these investments into the idyosincratic error of the model, which becomes e ijt = ijt +\nTo consistently estimate the cumulative model (7) using OLS, beside M1, the following condition must hold:\nA1 the observed inputs are uncorrelated with the unobserved endowment ij and with the unobserved inputs, i.e., with the idiosyncratic shock e ijt .\nClearly assumption A1 is quite restrictive because it is hardly credible that parental and child investments are uncorrelated with the child's unobserved endowment, the school inputs and the early childhood investments. Omitting the time investment by the child herself during early childhood, X C ijt 10 , is not a major concern, because children aged 0-5 spend zero or very little time on their own (i.e., without the supervision of an adult). On the contrary, the omission of early parental investments and of school inputs can be relevant.\nNext, let us consider the family FE estimation. In our empirical application we observe up to two siblings for each household, and we can therefore compute the family FE estimator by regressing sibling di\u00a4erences in test scores on the sibling di\u00a4erences in their inputs and endowments:\nwhere the subscripts i and i 0 denote the two siblings in household j. The consistency of the family FE estimation requires the following assumption:\nB1 sibling di\u00a4erences in observed inputs are uncorrelated with sibling di\u00a4erences in their unobserved endowment, ( ij i 0 j ) and sibling di\u00a4erences in unobserved inputs, i.e., sibling di\u00a4erences in the idiosyncratic shock, (e ijt e i 0 jt ).\nAssumption B1 is likely to be less restrictive than assumption A1, because inputs are allowed to depend on the unobserved family-speci\u2026c endowment and on unobserved inputs which do not vary between siblings. In fact, in model (8), we actually control for all unobserved family-speci\u2026c characteristics using sibling di\u00a4erences. The consistency of the family FE estimation still requires that the inputs do not respond to the unobserved child-speci\u2026c endowment. Rather than requiring a zero response of parental and child investments to changes in omitted school inputs (as assumption A1 in model 7 does), it only requires that sibling di\u00a4erences in parental and child's investments do not react to sibling di\u00a4erences in omitted school inputs. In our empirical section, we will test the validity of such an assumption in the augmented value-added model, which will be our preferred speci\u2026cation.\nAn alternative estimation strategy for model (7) is analogous to \u2026rst di\u00a4erence estimation in the context of panel data, which exploits the test scores and time investments available at di\u00a4erent points in time for the same child. In our framework the time di\u00a4erence for a variable is between the variable observed in t and in (t 5) and the corresponding estimation, we call time di\u00a4erence (TD) estimation, is implemented by di\u00a4erencing model (7):\nThe consistency of the TD estimation requires, beside M1-M2, the following assumptions:\nC1 the production models in adolescence and in childhood are identical, i.e., 0 = 0 ; 1 = 1 ; 2 = 2 , and c ij = ij .\nC2 time di\u00a4erences in observed inputs are uncorrelated with time di\u00a4erences in unobserved inputs, i.e., time di\u00a4erence in the idiosyncratic shock, (e ijt e ijt 5 );\nC3 time di\u00a4erences in observed inputs are uncorrelated with ( kijt kijt 5 ).\nWhile condition C3 is satis\u2026ed because of the assumptions M1-M2, conditions C1 and C2 are quite strong. Condition C1 is hardly credible, especially in light of recent literature which emphasizes that the child development process is a multistage process and that some inputs can be more productive in some stages and less in others (Cunha et al. 2006 , Cunha et al. 2010 ). Condition C2 is also not credible because investments in t, X C ijt and X F ijt , are taken by the child and her parents after observing Y kijt 5 , or some other correlated measure of cognitive ability, and are likely to respond to Y kijt 5 . Because Y kijt 5 depends on e ijt 5 , we cannot exclude that X C ijt and X F ijt are correlated with e ijt 5 , which implies that the assumption C2 cannot be satis\u2026ed. In other words, every time that investments in t react to cognitive ability in (t 5), the TD estimation is biased by a reverse causality issue. In the case of the family FE, this reverse causality issue does not occur because decision on investments in t, (X C ijt X C i 0 jt ) and (X F ijt X F i 0 jt ), are taken before observing sibling di\u00a4erences in test score in t, (Y kijt Y ki 0 jt ). Nevertheless, if investments respond to past cognitive abilities and past cognitive abilities are relevant in the production of current cognitive abilities, then both the TD and family FE estimation are inconsistent. For this reason, in next section we extend the production model to include past cognitive abilities as inputs."}, {"section_title": "Augmented value-added model", "text": "The family FE estimator of the cumulative model allows the inputs to depend on the unobserved endowment and characteristics that are identical between siblings, but, as with the OLS estimator, it is unable to take account of the possible dependence of inputs on the unobserved child-speci\u2026c endowment or on past cognitive achievements. Parents may respond to the child's past cognitive abilities or to di\u00a4erences in the past cognitive abilities between their children with reinforcing or compensating behaviors, and these are sources of inconsistency for the OLS and the family FE estimators.\nTo control for this dependence between lagged cognitive ability and inputs, we add the lagged true cognitive ability Y ijt 5 as an explanatory variable in the cumulative production model during adolescence (1), which yields the augmented value-added model (as de\u2026ned by Todd and Wolpin 2007) :\nwhere a ij is the new unobserved child-speci\u2026c endowment and a ijt is an idiosyncratic shock.\nFor this augmented value-added model we consider, beside M1 and M2, the following new maintained assumption:\nM3 the persistence 11 in each of the three k-speci\u2026c abilities, Y kijt (k = 1; 2; 3), k , is identical to the persistence in latent general ability, Y ijt , and equal to .\nAssumption M3 states that each of the three di\u00a4erent abilities (Letter-Word Identi\u2026ca-tion, Passage-Comprehension, and Applied-Problems) depreciates at the same rate from (t 5) to t.

Since kijt and kijt 5 are not errors but measures of extra ability of child i in subject k with respect to her general ability, Y ijt , an equal persistence in this extra ability and in the general latent ability seems reasonable.\nwhere u kijt = kijt kijt 5 + a ijt : Consistency of the OLS estimator of model (11) requires, beside M1-M3, the additional assumptions:\nD1 conditionally on the past cognitive ability Y kijt 5 , the observed inputs are uncorrelated with the unobserved endowment a ij and with the unobserved inputs, i.e., with the idiosyncratic shock, a ijt (but they are allowed to be correlated with the past cognitive ability Y kijt 5 ); D2 the past cognitive ability, Y kijt 5 , is uncorrelated with both the unobserved endowment a ij and the idiosyncratic shock a ijt . Notice that in model (11) Y kijt 5 and the error term u kijt are correlated, since both Y kijt 5 and u kijt depend on kijt 5 This correlation would generally bias the estimation, but, under the above assumptions, we can prove that the asymptotic bias cancels out, and the OLS estimator of converges asymptotically to:\n= where M X is the projection matrix on the space orthogonal to the one generated by the variables\nThe consistency is guaranteed by the fact that: assumption D2 implies that the asymptotic bias caused by the omission of the unobserved individual endowment cancels out, i.e.,\n, which is the asymptotic bias caused by the correlation between ( kijt kijt 5 ) and the lagged test Y kijt 5 , is also zero because of assumptions M1-M3:\nAssumptions D1-D2 can be quite restrictive, so we also consider family FE estimation, i.e., express model (11) as di\u00a4erences between siblings: Assumptions E1-E2 are likely to be less restrictive than assumptions D1-D2 because using di\u00a4erences between siblings eliminates the unobserved family-speci\u2026c characteristics and endowment that do not vary between siblings. Assumption E1 is in line with the view that there exists exogenous sibling variation in time investments which can explain sibling di\u00a4erences in cognitive abilities after controlling for the lagged abilities and other variables. Borrowing from the seminal paper of Ashenfelter and Rouse (1998) , this variation can be seen as originated by random deviations from optimal investment choices caused, for example, by unexpected in \u2021uence of school peers and friends (e.g. Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2008) or by experiencing events that change the child's preferences about time-use but do not directly impact test scores.\nThe assumption that the unobserved child-speci\u2026c endowment is uncorrelated with the lagged test (assumption E2) is likely to be less restrictive than assumption D2, but it is still likely to be invalid. If assumption E2 does not hold, then being unable to control for sibling di\u00a4erences in the unobserved endowment will lead to an overestimation of the e\u00a4ect of the lagged test score, the persistence , which can contaminate the input coe\u00a2 cients as well (Andrabi et al., 2011) .\nWe solve this further issue of endogeneity by adopting a two-step estimation procedure.\nIn the \u2026rst step we use the observed scores for the three di\u00a4erent skills available for each child in t and (t 5) to compute an individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects (individual FE) estimation, which controls for the child-speci\u2026c endowment, a ij . This individual FE estimation can be implemented by considering model (11) expressed in deviations from the mean:\nwhere the bar indicates the mean over the three skills. This individual FE estimation method is identical to the within-pupil between-subject estimation used by Dee (2005 and to estimate the e\u00a4ect of teacher characteristics on test scores. Because none of the right hand side variables in model (11) changes across the three skills except the test score, the individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation provides an estimate only for the persistence parameter, b IndF E :\n13 13 Notice that, if the inputs changed across di\u00a4erent skills, then we could include them in equation (15) and we would be able to estimate their e\u00a4ect directly in the \u2026rst stage estimation, with no need for a second stage.\nIn the second step, we replace in model (14) with its estimate from the \u2026rst step:\nand we use family FE estimation to produce estimates for the coe\u00a2 cients 2 . Thanks to this novel two-step estimation, we obtain results that are purged of the bias induced by the lagged test regressor. We are actually not the \u2026rst to assume that di\u00a4erent cognitive test scores are related to a same latent cognitive ability and to use the multiplicity of measures to solve the issue of endogeneity of the lagged test. For example, Cunha and Heckman (2008) use multiple measures of tests and inputs to derive three latent measures corresponding to cognitive and non-cognitive abilities and investment. Furthermore, they use multiple measures of tests and inputs to instrument the lagged tests and inputs in their cognitive development model (see Pudney 1982 for more details on this other type of estimation). Our procedure imposes some di\u00a4erent restrictions, but it is simpler and has the advantage of distinguishing between parents'and child's inputs and therefore allows us to evaluate the contribution of children's decisions to their cognitive development process.\nUnder assumptions M1-M3 it can be proven that the individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation of the persistence, IndF E , is consistent because\nThe two-step estimation, which uses the child individual estimation in the \u2026rst step and the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation in the second step is consistent under assumption E1 beside the maintained assumptions M1-M3. These assumptions are identical to those required for the consistency of the family FE estimation of the augmented value-added model, except for assumption E2, which is now relaxed.\nNotice that, as for the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation of the augmented value-added model, the two-step estimation does not require that parental and school investments be identical between siblings or that they be uncorrelated with lagged test scores. Since the seminal paper of Behrman et al. (1982) , several studies have tried to explain why parental investments di\u00a4er between siblings and have examined whether these investments compensate or reinforce children's di\u00a4erences in abilities. Bernal (2008) , for example, \u2026nds that compensating behavior seems to dominate when looking at time investments of mothers. We take into account that the mother's investment may compensate for or reinforce di\u00a4erences between her children's abilities by controlling for lagged test score realizations. However, we assume that any other unobserved ability or input is either identical between siblings or that, if a di\u00a4erence exists, it is uncorrelated with the sibling di\u00a4erences in observed inputs once controlling for their gaps in the lagged test and other variables. Clearly, sibling di\u00a4erences in unobserved characteristics that cause a response in investments would make E1 invalid and lead to an overestimation (or underestimation) of the investment e\u00a4ect if the investments reinforce (or compensate for) the sibling gap in cognitive abilities. In Section 6.1, we test empirically whether omitted inputs are a cause of concern by considering three sets of potential omitted variables: (i) school inputs, (ii) early childhood inputs, (iii) child's health shocks."}, {"section_title": "Estimation results of the cognitive production model", "text": "In Tables 4 and 5 , we report our main estimation results for the cumulative model (5) and the augmented value-added model (11). For the cumulative model, we report the results of the ordinary least squares (OLS), family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects (family FE) and time di\u00a4erence (TD) estimations (columns 1 to 3 of Table 4 ); whereas for the augmented valued added model we report the estimates of the OLS, family FE and two-step estimation methods (columns 1 to 3 of Table 5 ). Both the cumulative and the augmented valueadded models include the same explanatory variables except for the lagged test, which is included only in the augmented model. The outcome variable is measured by the three standardized test scores described in Section 3: the Letter-Word Identi\u2026cation Score (LWS), the Passage Comprehension Score (PCS) and the Applied Problems Score (APS). We treat the three tests as repeated measures of the child's ability, so that our number of observations increases from 404 (the number of siblings) to 1,212 (the number of siblings multiplied by the number of tests available for each child). We estimate the production models using the sibling sample for all estimations except for the TD estimation, which also requires information on twice lagged time investments, and is therefore based on the subsample that excludes missing cases for these investments. 14 Our main coe\u00a2 cients of interest are the e\u00a4ects of time investments, which we measure by the weekly number of hours the child and his/her mother invest in formative activities during adolescence (child's and mother's time investments) and during childhood (child's and mother's lagged time investments). We focus our discussion mainly on these four coe\u00a2 cients and on the coe\u00a2 cient of the lagged test, which captures the correlation between the contemporaneous and lagged test net of the explanatory variables and allows us to assess whether a bad test result today may create a trap into low cognitive achievements for the child's future.\nThere are di\u00a4erences across di\u00a4erent speci\u2026cations and estimations, but two \u2026ndings clearly emerge from all but the TD estimation: (i) the mother's investment during childhood matters, while the mother's investment during adolescence does not (see rows 1 and 3 in Table 4 and rows 2 and 4 in Table 5 ); (ii) the child's own investment during childhood matters less than the child's investment during adolescence (see rows 2 and 4 in Table 4 and rows 3 and 5 in Table 5 ).\nThe TD estimation is the only model for which the above \u2026nding (i) is not con\u2026rmed, but we think that this might be caused by the failure of assumptions C1 and C2. Because mothers and children take decisions on time investments in t before observing the test results in t but after observing the test results (or some correlated measures of cognitive abilities) in t 5, the TD estimation is biased by a reverse causality issue that invalidates assumption C2. We also think that assumption C1, which imposes an identical production model for children aged 6-10 and aged 11-15, is hard to believe. For these reasons, we judge the TD estimation to be inadequate for the estimation of our cumulative model. Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008) reach a similar conclusion for their \u2026rst di\u00a4erence estimation applied to evaluate the e\u00a4ect of students' study e\u00a4ort on test scores during college.\nThe \u2026nding that the mother's investment during childhood matters more than the mother's investment during adolescence in explaining adolescents' cognitive ability suggests a decreasing importance of the mother's time investment as the child grows. Empirical evidence on the decreasing importance of the mother's investment is also provided by our descriptive statistics in Table 1 , where we can see that the mother's time investment decreases from about 9 hours per week to 5 hours per week when children move from childhood to adolescence. The fact that only child self investments during adolescence and not during childhood a\u00a4ect their cognitive outcomes in adolescence suggests that the importance of child own investments increases with age, as children become more independent.\nA third clear \u2026nding emerges within the results of the augmented value-added model (see Table 5 ): (iii) the lagged test coe\u00a2 cient is always highly signi\u2026cant, suggesting a very high persistence in the test score results. Nevertheless, this coe\u00a2 cient decreases from 0.528 to 0.352 when we control for the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects (see columns 1 and 2 in Table 5 ) and to 0.279 when we also control for the individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects (see column 3), revealing that part of the test persistence is explained by the unobserved ability endowment.

This evidence corroborates our choice of including the lagged test score in the production function, obtaining the augmented value-added speci\u2026cation model. Therefore, hereafter we discuss the differences across the estimation results we obtain for this model (see Table 5 ). We are concerned with the potential omission of family characteristics and endowment, and for this reason we compare the OLS and the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimations. The results seem to change when moving from the OLS to the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation (compare columns 1 and 2 in Table 5 ) and this suggests that the OLS estimation su\u00a4ers from a variable omission problem.\nThe next question is whether considering the lagged test and family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects is enough to control for all unobserved characteristics that are associated with the explanatory variables and relevant in explaining the cognitive tests. It is certain that family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation fails to control for unobserved individual abilities that di\u00a4er between siblings. As explained in section 4.2 we have an issue of endogeneity of the lagged cognitive test, that we can address by means of a two-step estimation. The results of this two-step estimation are reported in the last column of Table 5 , where standard errors have been bootstrapped using 1,000 replications. These are our preferred results because the two-step estimation takes account of all our main econometric concerns. The main di\u00a4erence in the results between columns (2) and (3) in Table 5 is an attenuation of the coe\u00a2 cient of the lagged test, and this con\u2026rms that the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation presented in column (2) is inadequate to control for unobserved individual characteristics that di\u00a4er between siblings.\n15 Nevertheless, we \u2026nd that the coe\u00a2 cients of the time investments as well as the e\u00a4ects of all variables remain almost unaltered in size and statistical signi\u2026cance.\nConsidering our preferred estimates (see column 3 in Table 5 ), an increase of 10 hours per week in the mother's time investment during childhood seems to have an e\u00a4ect similar to an increase of 10 hours per week in the child's own time investment during adolescence: both changes lead to an increase of about 10-13% of a standard deviation of the cognitive test. The e\u00a4ect of decreasing child's time investments during adolescence by 10 hours per week is identical to the e\u00a4ect of having a mother working full-time and using child care during one year on children's cognitive tests measured in the preschool period, as found by Bernal (2008) using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 (NLSY79) in the US. A similar e\u00a4ect is found also in Bernal and Keane (2011) when evaluating the e\u00a4ect of an increase of one year in full time child care using again the NLSY79, but considering exogenous changes in the work/child care decisions caused by the introduction of new welfare policy rules for single mothers in the US.\nIn conclusion, the main results of our empirical analysis may be summarized in the following three main points. First, the time children spend on their own during adolescence explains their test scores much more than the time the mothers spend with them during adolescence. Second, time investments during childhood by the mother are relevant to explain adolescents'test scores (even after controlling for lagged test scores), while children's own time investments during childhood are not as important as the quality time they spend with their mother. Third, the test scores are highly persistent, which implies 15 We check formally whether the lagged test is independent of the unobserved individual characteristics in the augmented value added model by testing whether there is no di\u00a4erence between the lagged test coe\u00a2 cient obtained considering the family \u2026xed e\u00a4ect estimation (Table 5 column 2) and the one obtained using the individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ect estimation, i.e., the \u2026rst step estimation of our two step procedure (Table  5 column that if a child obtains a bad result on a test during childhood, there is a strong probability that she will get a bad result again during adolescence."}, {"section_title": "Testing the model' s assumptions", "text": "In this section we present a set of robustness checks providing evidence on the validity of the main assumptions required for the consistency of the proposed Two-Step Augmented value-added Estimator (see column 3 in Table 5 ).

To convince ourselves that this is not a main concern we considered a set of potential omitted variables that have been found to be relevant to explain investments as well as child's abilities by previous papers, which are: (i) school inputs, (ii) early childhood inputs, and (iii) children's health shocks (see Datar and Mason 2008; Currie and Almond 2011; Almond and Mazumder 2013; Yi et al. 2014 ).\nIn Table 6 we begin by considering the subsample of children for whom we can observe the class size and the main teacher's experience (number of years of total teaching experience) during primary school, and we evaluate the two step estimator of an extended augmented value-added model that includes these school inputs. 16 The magnitude of the time investment coe\u00a2 cients is very similar to that observed in our main estimation (compare the \u2026rst column of Table 6 and the last column of Table 5 ), despite the increased standard errors caused by the smaller sample size. In the second column of Table 6 we test for omission of early childhood inputs, exploiting information about whether the child was breast-fed and whether the mother was working in the year after childbirth. Again, we do not observe any change in our coe\u00a2 cients of interest. Finally, we check for a potential bias caused by the omission of child's health shocks by including a dummy variable capturing whether the child experienced any hospitalization in the last 5 years. Column 3 in Table 6 shows that our main results on time investments are robust to inclusion of this measure of health shocks. 17 The last column of the table reports the estimation results obtained by including all potential omitted variables and again we do not observe any relevant changes in the estimated coe\u00a2 cients of interest. We conclude from our sensitivity analysis that our results are relatively invariant with respect to these changes in the model speci\u2026cation. 16 These two school measures have been extensively used in previous papers to control for school inputs and re \u2021ect to some extent the quality and quantity of teachers (e.g. Hanushek 2006 , Jepsen and Rivkin 2009 , Altinok and Kingdon 2012 , Mueller 2013 . 17 We also used as alternative measure of health shocks a dummy indicating more than one doctor visit in the last 12 months, which leads to the same conclusion.

This supports the representation in equations (3) and (4) and suggests that the three test scores measure the same latent cognitive ability (see assumptions M1 and M2)."}, {"section_title": "Measurement errors in time investments", "text": "Our analysis builds on the assumption that the time investments we observe represent a reasonable proxy of the long-run time investments. It is acknowledged that the short reference period and the collection methodology (exhaustive recording of all activities performed) make time diary data much more accurate than retrospective survey questions that are a\u00a4ected by recall bias, but this comes at the cost of other measurement errors.\nThese arise from di\u00a4erent sources such as the day-to-day variation in time-use patterns of individuals, or from the possible low frequency of the analyzed activity, with high proportion of false zeros typically observed for infrequent activities (see Frazis and Stewart, 2012 and Foster and Kalenkoski, 2013) . Aggregation over di\u00a4erent activities and/or multiple days is a way to mitigate measurement error problems (see Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2004) . We resort to both types of aggregation in our analysis. Firstly, we adopt a broad de\u2026nition of time investments, which includes a whole set of formative activities. Secondly, we are able to de\u2026ne an aggregate measure of weekly time investment, thanks to the availability of time diary information for two days, one weekday and one weekend-day, for each child in the CDS. 19 The \u2026rst and second columns of Table 8 display the results of separate regressions where we consider time investments during weekdays and during weekend-days. It can be observed that adopting this di\u00a4erent de\u2026nition of time investments based on a single day period makes the time investment e\u00a4ects very imprecisely estimated (compare -for example -the standard errors of the child's time coe\u00a2 cient in the \u2026rst column of Table 8 and in the last column of Table 5 ). In the presence of measurement errors, it could also be argued that our result of a diminished importance of parental time and an increased importance of child's own time during adolescence might be caused by the variability over time of the measurement errors. In particular, our pattern of estimates could be explained by time investments being more variable for parents of older children (than for parents of younger children) and for younger children (than for older children). However, we were not able to \u2026nd any evidence in the literature on variability of measurement errors of time investments -as de\u2026ned in this paper -over child life periods, and therefore have no reason to expect this to be a pattern leading to our main \u2026ndings. Born 1982 Born -1987 In order to test for possible measurement error bias caused by day-to-day variation we also performed the following sensitivity analysis (the full set of results is available upon request). We purged the daily time investments from the potential e\u00a4ect of the type of the day (and of the year) by evaluating the residuals of the regression of daily time investments on dummy variables for the di\u00a4erent days of the week and for the di\u00a4erent years. 20 We then estimated two separate augmented value-added models (one for weekday, one for weekend-day) using these daily investments net of the e\u00a4ect of the type of day and year and compared the coe\u00a2 cients with the corresponding coe\u00a2 cients of the daily time investments in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8. Since we found very similar \u2026gures, we argue that the day-to-day variation does not represent an important source of bias. This evidence is corroborated by the regression results we obtain using the sub-sample of children \u2026lling in the diary on typical or very typical days (about 66% of our sibling sample), for which the observed time investments should be much less a\u00a4ected by day-today variation (column 3 of Table 8 ). The coe\u00a2 cients of the weekly time investments are of similar size with respect to our benchmark model, but are less precisely estimated because of the decreased sample size. The slightly higher value observed for the e\u00a4ect of the child investment seems to suggest the presence of a classical measurement error causing some attenuation bias in our main sample."}, {"section_title": "Measurement errors in test scores", "text": "So far we have assumed that each of the three test scores is an accurate measure of the corresponding skill (Letter-Word Identi\u2026cation, Passage-Comprehension and AppliedProblems).

When we regress Y kijt on Y kijt 5 in our \u2026rst step estimation, the classical measurement error in Y kijt 5 can lead to an attenuation bias of the persistence, . To correct for this attenuation bias we adopt an analytic correction formula (see for details Appendix B), i.e., we multiply the coe\u00a2 cient by a correction factor given by V ar( kijt 5 + v kijt 5 )=V ar( kijt 5 ): The estimation results by assuming that the correction factor be equal to 1.613 and 2.327 (see Appendix B for a justi\u2026cation of these two choices) are reported in columns 2 and 3 in Table 9 . These results seem to suggest that measurement errors in the test scores do not cause any bias in the e\u00a4ect of the mother's and child's time investments.

For the mother's investment we consider a new de\u2026nition that excludes the time the mother spends with her child playing and having meals, to take account of the fact that these two activities might be less relevant for the child's development, especially during adolescence. The results are reported in the \u2026rst column of Table  10 and show that the e\u00a4ect of the time a mother spends with her child during adolescence is still not statistically signi\u2026cant, while the e\u00a4ect of the time a mother spends with her child during childhood, which was statistically signi\u2026cant in our benchmark estimation, becomes insigni\u2026cant. This might indicate that playing and having meals are important activities during childhood that have a long term e\u00a4ect even during adolescence, but may also be in part the consequence of a \u2026ner de\u2026nition of mother's investments, leading to larger measurement errors and less precise estimates.\nWe also run two new regressions where the child's investment is speci\u2026ed, including a) two separate variables: the time a child spends doing homework or reading and the time she spends doing other formative activities, b) only the child's homework and reading time. In theory, we would expect a larger e\u00a4ect on cognitive abilities of the time a child spends doing homework and reading; but, because we are using time dairies, the use of a narrower de\u2026nition of time investment can come at the cost of larger measurement errors. The results in column 2 and 3 of Table 10 seem to con\u2026rm this and to support the adoption of a broader concept of investment, as used in our benchmark estimation."}, {"section_title": "Investments by fathers", "text": "We consider here two new model speci\u2026cations which include the father's time investments. In the \u2026rst column of Table 11 we report, for comparison, the estimates obtained by considering the mother's time investments (which were already reported in the last column of Table 5 ), while in the second column we show the estimates obtained by replacing the mother's time investments with the father's. Finally, in the last column of Table 11 , we report the results computed by using both the mother's and the father's time investments. The e\u00a4ect of the child's time investments remains the same across speci\u2026cations. Similarly, the coe\u00a2 cients of the lagged test and the lagged mother's time are almost unaffected. We \u2026nd that the e\u00a4ect of the father's time investments is not signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4erent from zero. The di\u00a4erence between the e\u00a4ect of the mother's and father's time investment during childhood might be explained in part by the fact that the father's time investment during childhood is on average much lower than the mother's (about 40% lower). We also checked whether the e\u00a4ect of the father's investment might depend on gender and be more relevant for boys than for girls (see Bertrand and Pan 2013) , but again we \u2026nd a non-signi\u2026cant e\u00a4ect (results available upon request)."}, {"section_title": "Non-intact families", "text": "In our main analysis, we have focused on families where the children live with their biological parents.

We estimate three di\u00a4erent speci\u2026cations: (i) a model where the coe\u00a2 cient of each type of time investment is allowed to di\u00a4er for levels of investment below and above the corresponding median (switching coe\u00a2 cients); (ii) a model with an additional dummy variable for each time investment, which takes value one when the time investment is zero and zero otherwise; (iii) a model where all time investments are expressed in logarithms (see respectively \u2026rst, second and third column in Table A4 ). The \u2026rst speci\u2026cation allows the e\u00a4ect of each time investment to be di\u00a4erent for values that are below and over the median. The results suggest that each of the time investments has a coe\u00a2 cient that does not vary signi\u2026cantly below and over the median, so that our linear speci\u2026cation is not rejected. The second model allows for a discontinuity at zero, so that when a time investment is zero its e\u00a4ect is not imposed to be null. The dummy variables indicating zero time investments have coe\u00a2 cients which are not signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4erent from zero, suggesting again that our linear speci\u2026cation is not rejected. Lastly, the third model allows for a further form of non-linearity of the partial e\u00a4ects, by resorting to the log transformation of the various time investment variables. In this speci\u2026cation the estimated coe\u00a2 cients are interpretable as semi-elasticities, and this explains the observed change in magnitude, which is, however, coherent with our benchmark model results."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "While a large literature has focused on the e\u00a4ects of parental time on child's outcomes, there are no studies that evaluate and compare the time investments made by parents and children. In our paper, we model the cognitive production function for adolescents using an augmented value-added speci\u2026cation and considering parental time investments alongside child time self investments. We account for di\u00a4erent sources of endogeneity that typically undermine the identi\u2026cation of the inputs'coe\u00a2 cients. First, we are able to control for the endogeneity of parents' and children's time investments arising from unobserved household-speci\u2026c inputs by way of family \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation. Second, we take account of the endogeneity of the lagged test, which is caused by its dependence on the unobserved child-speci\u2026c characteristics, by applying an individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation which makes use of the multiplicity of cognitive tests available in our data.\nWe show that the time investments made by children during adolescence a\u00a4ect their test scores much more than the time investments made by their mothers. Our results suggest that one way to improve the cognitive abilities of adolescents is to in \u2021uence their time allocation decisions and their investments in formative activities. The fact that adolescents become important actors in their development process has important policy implications, suggesting that educational policies should target adolescents directly rather than their parents. Recent educational policies such as conditional cash transfers are in line with our \u2026ndings, since they target not only parental time investments, but also children's time investments in themselves.\nAppendix A: Additional Tables   Table A1 In Section 6.4 we reported the estimation results of the production model during adolescence in the presence of measurement error on the test scores and using an analytic formula for correcting for the consequent attenuation bias for the persistence . In this section, we provide details on how to compute this correction formula.\nOur \u2026rst step estimation of the persistence is given by the individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimation of the regression of the test score observed during adolescence Y kijt = Y ijt + kijt + v kijt on the lagged test score observed 5 years earlier, during childhood, Y kijt 5 = Y ijt 5 + kijt 5 + v kijt 5 : When relaxing the assumption of no measurement errors, i.e., the assumption that v kijt and v kijt 5 have degenerate distribution with zero mean and zero variance, the individual \u2026xed e\u00a4ects estimator of the persistence converges to:\nplimb IndF E = Cov( kijt + v kijt ; kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ) V ar( kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ) = Cov( kijt ; kijt 5 ) V ar( kijt 5 + v kijt 5 )\n= V ar( kijt 5 ) V ar( kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ) :\nIn other words, the error term in the lagged test scores, v kijt 5 , is an example of classical measurement error and causes an attenuation bias of the coe\u00a2 cient estimated in the \u2026rst step. Instead, the error term in the current test score, v kijt , simply causes a decrease in the precision of the estimation of . To correct for the attenuation bias we simply need to multiply the coe\u00a2 cient estimated in the \u2026rst step by an estimate of the following correction factor: V ar( kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ) V ar( kijt 5 ) :\nWe do not observe the above correction factor, but we can compute it using information on the reliability ratio V ar(Y ijt 5 + \" kijt 5 )=V ar(Y ijt 5 + \" kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ), and on the share of the variance of the observed test score in ability k explained by the latent ability Y ijt 5 , i.e., V ar(Y ijt 5 )=V ar(Y ijt 5 + \" kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ). This is because, under our maintained assumptions there is no correlation between Y ijt 5 , \" kijt 5 and v kijt 5 , and V ar(Y kijt 5 ) = V ar(Y ijt 5 ) + V ar(\" kijt 5 ) + V ar(v kijt 5 ) = 1."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "Previous studies on the reliability of the Woodcock-Johnson Revised tests we use in this paper suggest that the reliability ratio is always above 0.8 and often above 0.9.

By considering this common factor as a measure of the latent ability Y ijt 5 , we can impute to V ar(Y ijt 5 )=V ar(Y ijt 5 + \" kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ) a value of 0.737, which is the average of the share of variance explained by the common factor across the three observed test scores.\nBy imposing a reliability ratio of 0.9 and 0.85 and V ar(Y ijt 5 )=V ar(Y ijt 5 + \" kijt 5 + v kijt 5 ) =0.737, we can assume that V ar( kijt 5 + v kijt 5 )=V ar( kijt 5 ) takes values 1.613 21 V ar(Y kijt 5 ) = 1 because our test scores are standardized by skill. and 2.327 and we can apply the analytic error correction for the estimation suggested by equation (19) . These two corrections factors are the ones used in Table 9 where we reported the estimation results corrected for measurement error in the test scores.\nIn Table B1 , we also report results for our second step estimation when imposing di\u00a4erent values for the persistence that range from a 0.1 to 0.9.
