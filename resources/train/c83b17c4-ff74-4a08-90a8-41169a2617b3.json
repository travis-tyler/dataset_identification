Using multiple modalities of biomarkers that have been proved to be sensitive in assessing the progression of AD, those proposed approaches aimed at the effective and accurate classification performance, especially for discriminating the subtler prodromal stage of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group, from the cognitively normal control (CN) group. Among those modalities, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently widely used for analyzing the gradual progression of atrophy patterns in key brain regions [1] . And utilizing structural MRI images, the recent proposed Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA)-based approaches have been demonstrated to be effective and accurate in the classification of AD and MCI [2] . Moreover, since most of the current studies assumed only binary classification, where classification experiments were based on two-group comparisons, i.e., CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD, such studies commonly applied local feature extraction methods. For different comparisons, the feature sets in the classification are very various from each other, which also limit the clinical diagnosis for a given patient, which could belong in any of the three groups [2] .\nThis study aims to introduce a novel global feature extraction model based on the recent proposed GDA-based dual high-dimensional decision spaces, so that can significantly improve the early CAD performance. Instead of extracting three different sets of features for those three comparisons (CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD), respectively, in this study, only one optimal set of features will be generated. The optimal set of features in this study indicates that the entorhinal cortex is the most significant cortical region associated with the progression of AD, which is consistent with recent studies concluding that the entorhinal cortex is the signature region to be implicated in AD [3] - [5] . And the top 5 regions of interest, entorhinal, middle temporal, inferior temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal are all AD signature regions investigated previously [6] . Furthermore, for the dual high-dimensional decision spaces, a global GDA-based classifier used for combined training will be proposed as well and achieve a significant improvement of the early CAD performance."}, {"section_title": "Material", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The data used in the preparation of this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu), as part of the ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T collection and their assessments at baseline, which includes 628 individuals (190 CN, 305 MCI, and 133 AD) [7] . The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.

Tables of morphometric data were derived from the images using the following seven shape measures for all 25 FreeSurfer labeled cortical regions for both left and right hemispheres of the brain: 1) surface area; 2) travel depth; 3) geodesic depth; 4) mean curvature; 5) convexity; 6) thickness; 7) volume. FreeSurfer pipeline (version 5.3) was applied to all T1-weighted images to generate labeled cortical surfaces, and labeled cortical and noncortical volumes.

The error analysis was performed whereby introducing the next top-ranked feature in the classifier at each subsequent phase, and recording the corresponding classification statistics, which then would be compared with the previous phase. In this study, as a machine learning classification problem, the performance was estimated by the F1 score, and until the performance can be no longer improved, the optimal sets of features should have been obtained."}, {"section_title": "Global GDA-based classifier", "text": "Taking advantage of GDA, an important generative learning algorithm for high dimensional classification problems, some proposed studies were capable of recognizing the different patterns between any given groups (i.e., CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD) [2] . The fundamental part of GDA is the multivariate Gaussian distribution or multivariate normal distribution, which could take the correlations among all features into account of the proposed global classifier. The performance of the proposed global GDA-based model was measured by some classification related statistics based on tenfold cross validation using 80% of the noise-free detected data points, including the F1 score, accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and so on. After the optimal sets of features were obtained, the remaining 20% of the noise-free detected data were utilized as held-out test data to estimate the classification performance.\nAs the same as aforementioned ANOVA-based feature ranking process, both local and global classifiers were validated. For the local model, the GDA-based classifier was applied to each hemisphere of the brain separately, and corresponding to each hemisphere, an optimal set of features was generated, and the two sets were then used as the final optimal sets of features. In contrast with the local model, the proposed global model implemented a combined incremental error analysis on the 175 features of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, so that all combinations of the two sets of 175 features were taken into consideration for obtaining the final optimal sets of features. In terms of the dual decision space CAD, if either one of the two decision spaces produced a positive result, the corresponding subject should be classified as such.\n4 Results and conclusion"}, {"section_title": "Top-ranked features", "text": "After pre-processing the MRI images, 9 subjects were eliminated because of the noisy data which included measurements with zero values, so the final data used in the classification experiment included 619 individuals, among them 187 CN, 301 MCI, and 131 AD. As mentioned earlier, in the local feature ranking, ANOVA was performed for CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD using two 175-feature vectors corresponding to the left and right hemispheres of the brain. For each comparison, all features found at 0.01 level of significance (LOS) out of all 175 features for each side of the brain were used for the tenfold cross validation. In the global case, ANOVA was carried out on the two sets of 175-feature vectors between all three groups. For each model, the number of selected features is shown in Table 1 .\nIn the local feature ranking, for each comparison, the top ranked feature sets are much different to others. Nevertheless, in both local and global feature ranking results, it could be observed that the [5] . Furthermore, the entorhinal cortex has been also proven as a major source of projections to the hippocampus [13] .
