[{"section_title": "FOREWORD D", "text": "o institutional grants affect students' persistence towards bachelor' s degrees? Answers to this question are vitally important because dollars provided by colleges and universities have become the second largest source of grant aid to students. Nearly all of the recent research on institutional grants has focused on the criteria used to distribute the aid and the economic and demographic characteristics of the recipients. Very few studies have tried to establish a link between the awarding of institutional aid and student success. This lack of research is particularly troubling given the recent suggestions by some policymakers that colleges and universities have not done enough to improve their rates of student success. To answer this question, the National Association of Student This report is the second in a series of studies on critical issues involving access to higher education for underrepresented groups and ways these barriers can be overcome. The series is being supported by a grant from the National Education Loan Network (Nelnet). The topics that will be covered in this NASFAA/Nelnet College Access Series have been decided by the NASFAA staff, in consultation with the Association' s Research Committee. In addition to Dr. Price' s and Mr. Davis' contributions to this series, NASFAA wishes to acknowledge the support of             students' ability to enroll in college. This concern has emerged because much of the growth in institutional aid spending has been directed to undergraduates with academic merit rather than to those with the greatest financial need. The amount of grant aid awarded by postsecondary institutions more than doubled between the academic years 1994-95 and 2004-05, rising from approximately $10.3 billion to over $24 billion, according to College Board estimates. The National Center for Education Statistics' recent financial aid surveys reveal that between 1990 and 2004 average merit awards to undergraduates at public four-year colleges jumped 171 percent in current (non-inflation-adjusted) dollars. At private four-year institutions, the average merit grant tripled. In contrast, the average institutional grant awarded based on students' financial need at public four-year institutions grew by only 37 percent in current dollars; similarly, at private four-year institutions, the average need-based grant amounts increased substantially slower than merit-based grant amounts."}, {"section_title": "TABLES AND FIGURES", "text": "While the effects of the shift from need-to merit-based grants on student enrollment and receipt of aid have been examined thoroughly by a number of analysts, very few recent reports have examined the effects of these grants on students' persistence towards completing bachelor' s degrees. To examine this issue, this report explores the linkages between the receipt of institutional need-and merit-based grants in the first year of college and degree completion within six years for students who began college in academic year 1995-96.  1996, 1998, and 2001. The analysis for this report was limited to students who began college at public and private nonprofit four-year institutions because community college students seldom receive institutional grant aid. The BPS data were used to examine the number and demographic characteristics of beginning students who received need-and merit-based institutional grants and average grant amounts; the percentage of tuition and fee charges that recipients covered with their institutional grants; and the percentage of institutional aid recipients who completed their bachelor' s degree programs within six years of entering higher education. Slightly more than one-third of students (37 percent) in this BPS sample received some form of institutional grant aid in 1995-96; 26 percent received need-based grants; and 16 percent received merit aid. Need-and merit-based grant awards were not mutually exclusive, as about 6 percent of students received both types of grants. About 62 percent of first-year undergraduates who initially enrolled in private fouryear colleges and universities received institutional grant aid, compared with less than 23 percent of those who initially enrolled in public four-year institutions. Moreover, students who initially enrolled at private four-year colleges and universities received need-based institutional grants that were almost three times as large as those awarded to undergraduates who initially enrolled at public colleges and universities ($6,031 vs. $2,227). Similarly, students who initially enrolled at private colleges and universities and received merit-based institutional grants had much larger awards, on average, than did merit awardees at public colleges and universities ($5,325 vs. $2,434). Although private colleges and universities awarded significantly larger institutional grants, these funds did not necessarily cover a larger share of tuition and fees charged to the awardees. At public four-year institutions, the average need-based grants were equal to about 28 percent of average tuition and fee charges; in comparison, average need grants accounted for roughly 31 percent of the average tuition for beginning student recipients at private four-year institutions. This 3-percentage point difference was not statistically significant. On the other hand, among beginning students who received merit-based institutional grants, the difference in the proportion of tuition covered by those awards was significantly higher for undergraduates who initially enrolled at private colleges and universities than for students who initially enrolled at public fouryear institutions: 31 percent versus 23 percent. Differences in student characteristics were also examined for institutional grant recipients. Students who received need-based grants at either public or private four-year institutions were more likely to have none of the risk factors normally associated with leaving college without a degree (delaying postsecondary education for more than one year after high school graduation, being financially independent, attending part-time, working full-time while enrolled, having children or dependents other than a spouse, being a single parent, and dropping out of high school). At public colleges and universities, Hispanic students and students from upper-income families (incomes greater than 452 percent of the federal poverty level) who initially started at public colleges and universities were more likely to receive need-based institutional grants, while African Americans were less likely to receive these grants. Need-based institutional grant recipients were also more likely to attend a research or doctoral institution and an institution with selective or very selective admissions criteria. At private colleges and universities, institutional selectivity was not statistically related to the receipt of institutional need-based grant aid; that is, private colleges and universities across all selectivity levels rewarded institutional need-based grants in similar proportions. In addition, students who started at private institutions and attended a baccalaureate or liberal arts college were more likely to receive institutional need-based grants. Like need-based institutional grant recipients, students at both public and private four-year institutions who received meritbased institutional grants were more likely to have zero risk factors. Beginning students at public colleges and universities who received merit-based institutional grants were less likely to be Hispanic; however, there were no statistical differences in the family income levels of merit-based grant recipients and non-recipients. Merit-grant recipients at public four-year institutions also were more likely to attend research or doctoral universities and more likely to attend selective colleges and universities. In contrast, postsecondary students who began at private colleges and universities and who received merit-based institutional grants in their first year were more likely to attend baccalaureate liberal arts colleges and to attend private colleges and universities categorized as least selective or selective. There were no statistically significant differences between institutional merit-based grant recipients and non-recipients at private fouryear institutions according to parental educational attainment, family income, or dependency status; however, merit grant awardees at private colleges and universities were more likely to be African American. Multivariate logistic regression results indicate that institutional grant aid is a positive predictor of graduating within six years, after controlling for student characteristics and institutional selectivity level. For students who began at public four-year colleges and universities: n Increasing the ratio of institutional need-based grants to tuition by one category (for example, increasing a needbased grant amount so that a student could cover more than half of tuition) would increase the probability of a student graduating within six years by 14 percent. n Increasing the ratio of institutional merit-based grants to tuition by one category (for example, increasing a grant amount so that a student could cover more than half of tuition) would increase the probability of a student graduating within six years by 22 percent.  (Horn and Berger, 2004). This report explores the linkages between the receipt of institutional need-and merit-based grants in the first year of college and degree completion within six years. The first part of the study summarizes the recent trends in institutionally provided grant assistance and how these trends compare with the growth in college prices and student loan debt. Next, the study reviews the findings of a few prior studies that have attempted to draw links between grant aid and academic success. The third part of the study analyzes the relationship between institutional aid and six-year degree attainment rates among institutional grant recipients who began at public and private four-year colleges."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "1 Grants based on financial need are generally reserved for students from low-and moderate-income families, while merit-based dollars are distributed to students regardless of their family income or financial need. Non-academic merit award criteria may include athletics or artistic talents, academic majors, state or regional residency, and religion."}, {"section_title": "D", "text": "uring the past decade, the amount of aid awarded by postsecondary institutions more than doubled, rising from approximately $10.3 billion in 1994-95 to over $24 billion in 2004-05 (College Board, 2005a. For colleges and universities, spending on institutional grants has been one of the fastest growing expense categories (Cunningham, Wellman, Clinedinst, and Merisotis, 2001). Much of the increased grant spending appears to have been directed towards merit-based aid. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (2003Statistics ( , 2005, the proportion of undergraduates at public four-year colleges who received merit grants grew from 5 percent in 1990 to 17 percent in 2004, and the average merit award amount jumped 171 percent in current dollars. At private four-year institutions, the average merit grant tripled. In contrast, the proportion of undergraduates at public four-year colleges and universities with need-based institutional grants increased more slowly -from 10 percent to 14 percent -and the average amount grew by 37 percent in nonadjusted dollars. At private four-year institutions, the average need-based grant increased by 78 percent (National Center for Education Statistics, 2003Statistics, , 2005. Put simply, while spending on both need-based and merit-based institutional grants increased in the last fifteen years, the share of students who received merit awards and the amount of merit-based grants grew at much higher rates at both public and private fouryear colleges and universities. This apparent shift by colleges towards merit-based institutional aid (and away from need-based awards) occurred at a time when the total price of attending college -tuition and fees, room and board, books, educational supplies, and transportation -rose 32 percent (adjusted for inflation) at private four-year institutions and 36 percent at public four-year colleges and universities. In 2004-05, total annual charges to students averaged $27,516 at private institutions and $11,354 at four-year public institutions (College Board, 2005b). Moreover, financial support for federal and institutional programs that award assistance based on students' financial need increased more modestly. In the last decade, for example, total appropriations for Pell Grants, the largest government program for low-income"}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN INSTITUTIONAL AID AND COLLEGE PRICES", "text": "college students, increased by 86 percent, but the average Pell Grant award rose by only 29 percent (College Board, 2005a). With these trends in mind, research on institutional aid has focused primarily on the changes in criteria and mechanisms used by postsecondary institutions to determine student awards. Researchers, educators, student advocates, and some policymakers worry that low-and moderate-income students are increasingly becoming \"priced-out\" of their first-choice institution or cannot attend college altogether. As Heller and Nelson Laird (1999) point out, students from middle-and high-income families have been the primary beneficiaries of merit-based financial aid. Horn and Peter (2003) found that institutional grant awards are increasing especially for those students in the highest income quartile at private, not-for-profit institutions. Similarly, the College Board (2005b) found that during the 1990s institutional grant aid rose most rapidly for students at the upper end of income distribution at both public and private institutions. In contrast, Davis (2003) documented that the proportion of institutional grants awarded to students from families with incomes below $40,000 declined by 16 percent at both public and private fouryear colleges and universities between 1995 and 1999. Middleand upper-income students are more likely to meet merit-based award criteria due to their greater access to rigorous high school curricula and test preparation courses (Redd, 2002). These findings suggest that public and private colleges increasingly are using institutional aid as a recruitment tool -referred to as \"tuition discounting\" -to compete for students with certain academic attributes rather than as a means to equalize college opportunity for low-and moderate-income students (Davis, 2003). One potential consequence of tuition discounting is that low-and moderate-income students and their families are becoming increasingly more sensitive to rising tuition and fees and may choose not to enroll because of rising college prices (Hossler, Hu, and Schmit, 1999). A second consequence of rewarding more institutional merit-based grants is that financially needy students incur significantly larger amounts of student loan debt.  Board, 2005b). In 1999-2000, almost 11 percent of students who borrowed the maximum Stafford Unsubsidized Loan were from the lowest-income quartile families and 42 percent were from middle-income families; 16 percent of students who borrowed less than the maximum Stafford Unsubsidized Loan were from the lowest-income quartile families, and 61 percent were from middle-income families (Clinedinst, Cunningham, and Merisotis, 2003). These data indicate that a significant proportion of low-and middle-income families are relying on Stafford Unsubsidized Loans to help pay for college. This astronomical rise in unsubsidized borrowing is especially troublesome because the students are charged interest on these loans while they are enrolled in college. If the interest is not paid, it can be capitalized, which results in a much faster accumulation of student debt. Increased borrowing has led to increased concern about higher post-college debt burdens for baccalaureate recipients. In 2002, the average undergraduate educational debt was $19,300, an increase of 60 percent since 1994 in real dollars (Choy and Li, 2005). In 2001, 36 percent of bachelor' s degree recipients had to devote more than 9 percent of their gross monthly income to repaying student loans (Choy and Li, 2005). African Americans, Hispanics, and low-income students are much more likely to have educational debt burden that exceeds 8 percent of their gross monthly income (Price, 2004b)."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH ON INSTITUTIONAL AID AND STUDENT SUCCESS", "text": "A number of researchers and policy analysts have documented the consequences of rising prices, the shift to merit aid, and rising student debt on college access and choice and on educational debt burden and social inequality (see for example, Paulsen and St. John, 2002;Heller, 2005Heller, , 2002Heller, , and 2001and Price, 2004a). Unfortunately, very few studies have considered the effect of institutional need-or merit-based grants on student success. The few reports that have addressed this topic were conducted more than a decade ago -before the substantial increase in institutional aid occurred. For example, Woodward (1988) found that renewable institutional grant awards lead to greater student persistence. Nora (1990) found that Hispanics are more likely to earn a higher grade point average as well as a certificate at twoyear colleges when provided institutional aid. One widely cited analysis of tuition discounting found that institutional expenditures on grant aid may reduce the availability of financial resources that can facilitate student retention, such as academic support programs and student support services (Redd, 2000). These effects were most pronounced at highly selective institutions where tuition discounts exceeded tuition revenue and at small liberal arts colleges that had limited endowments (Redd, 2000). One of the reasons net tuition revenue can decline as a result of tuition discounting is that institutions use money from tuition and fees collected from other students to award scholarships and grants to a small number of specifically targeted students (Davis, 2003). In short, while one of the core purposes of tuition discounting is to recruit meritorious students, the effects of this strategy can hinder institutional financial conditions with subsequent negative consequences for students (Martin, 2002). More recently, Heller (2003) found financial aid -especially the continuous receipt of work-study aid -to be a positive predictor of bachelor' s degree attainment; 2 moreover, students who received a need-based institutional grant of $1,200 in their first year of college were 6 percentage points more likely to persist into their second year than were non-recipients. Gansemer-Topf and Schuh (2005) concluded that institutional grants contribute positively to retention and graduation rates at private baccalaureate liberal arts and general higher education institutions (with the exception of elite colleges). A recently released report from MDRC (Brock and Richburg-Hayes, 2006) documents the statistically significant and large impact of a $1,000-per-term scholarship on students' credit completions and term-to-term retention. These results are from an experimental design research project called Opening Doors that examines programs and practices that contribute to student success for low-income students at community colleges. The recent studies that have analyzed the effects of institutional grant aid on student outcomes show that additional grant aid contributesand may even be a causal factor -in improving postsecondary student success."}, {"section_title": "Data and Sample", "text": "This study examines the relationship between institutional grant aid and degree attainment for students who began college in the academic year 1995-96.

For postsecondary students who initially started at public colleges and universities, the logistic regression results indicate that parents' educational attainment is a strong positive predictor of baccalaureate degree attainment within six years, while the number of risk factors students have is a negative predictor (risk factors include delaying postsecondary education more than one year after high school graduation, being financially independent, attending part-time, working full-time while enrolled, having children or dependents other than a spouse, being a single parent, and dropping out of high school). 7 As expected, institutional selectivity is a positive predictor of bachelor' s degree attainment within six years; the more selective the college, the more likely a student will graduate. 8 6 Our original intent was to use a multinominal logit model to predit bachelor' s degree attainment at the initial institution, bachelor' s degree attainment at a different institution, and no degree attainment; however, descriptive analysis revealed that more than 90 percent of our sample of beginning postsecondary students at four-year colleges and universities earned a baccalaureate degree from their initial institution within six years. In other words, there was very little variation among baccalaureate degree recipients in terms of receiving a degree from their initial institution or from another institution (although some students received bachelor' s degrees at more than one institution). 7 For more information on these risk factors, see Horn and Berger (2004). 8 We also modeled the SAT quartile rank of students; this variable is highly correlated with institutional selectivity and the statistical results are virtually identical.  Table 7 shows the categorical distribution of the ratio of institutional need-and merit-based grants to tuition and fees for institutional grant recipients who began at public colleges and universities. 9 About 14 percent of postsecondary students received a need-based institutional grant.

However, unlike the statistical model for students who began at public four-year institutions, the students' income background and Hispanic ethnicity were statistically significant predictors of graduation within six years.

Indeed, 71 percent of students who received a need-based institutional grant award graduated within six years, which is slightly higher than the graduation rate for all students who began at private colleges and universities. But only 66 percent of students who received a merit-based institutional grant graduated within six years. The average ratio of institutional grant aid to tuition at private colleges and universities was about 31 percent for both needbased and merit-based grant recipients. However, the higher prices of private colleges may contribute to the statistical results because the percentage of tuition covered by institutional merit-based grants may leave a significant amount for students and families to pay. Moreover, merit-based institutional grant recipients are unlikely to qualify for federal and state needbased grants to fill the gap. Slightly more than one-fourth of postsecondary students who began at private colleges and universities received a merit-based institutional grant in their first year; as Table 8 below shows, 72 percent of merit-based institutional grant recipients received awards covering less than half of tuition. However, the amount of total grant aid received in the first year was lower for merit-grant recipients: students who received need-based grants received more than $8,000 in total average grant financial awards, which is significantly higher than the average of $6,900 for students who received merit-based awards. One of the limitations to the BPS database is that information on institutional grant aid is available only for the first year of college; therefore, the predictive validity of the multivariate models is tenuous. Many things can happen to students during the intervening years (i.e., years two through six) before graduation. For example, financial aid packages can be adjusted annually due to changes in income, changes in family circumstances such as additional siblings in college, and changes in colleges' available resources for grant aid. Because BPS does measure changes in the amounts of federal grant and loan aid for each year the student was enrolled in college, differences in annual federal financial aid among graduates and non-graduates are examined for students who received an institutional grant in the first year of college. In addition, differences in student characteristics among baccalaureate degree recipients and non-recipients are examined. The next section describes these findings."}, {"section_title": "Federal Financial Aid and Degree Completion", "text": "Federal grants and loans represent the largest component of financial aid. Table 9 on Page 26 illustrates the average Federal Pell Grant and Stafford Loan amounts for students who received institutional need-based grants in the first year of college; federal financial aid amounts are available for each year the student was enrolled. The general pattern indicates that for students who started at either public or private colleges and universities baccalaureate degree recipients received slightly smaller Pell Grants in the first-year of college and borrowed larger amounts of Stafford Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans in the intervening years than did non-graduates. 11 Among postsecondary students who began at public fouryear institutions, baccalaureate degree recipients borrowed almost twice as much as non-graduates in the fourth and fifth 11 Stafford Loan limits rise for each year of postsecondary education.

These data raise an important question about the amount of institutional grant aid awarded to students after the first year of college: did students borrow more in subsequent years because colleges decreased institutional aid in order to provide larger grants to new entering students? Or, did students borrow more money because of the larger annual loan limits in subsequent years of college? Table 9 Average Federal Grant and Loan Amounts for Institutional Need-Based Grants Recipients, by Year and Bachelor' s Degree Attainment Status Source: National Center for Educational Statistics, BPS 1996:2001."}, {"section_title": "Type and Year of Federal Aid", "text": "Among postsecondary students who started at public fouryear colleges and universities and received a merit-based institutional grant, baccalaureate degree recipients generally received slightly higher Pell Grants than non-graduates in all but the first-year of college; however, the differences were not statistically different except in the fourth year. In addition, bachelor' s degree recipients borrowed significantly larger amounts of Stafford Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans than non-graduates in the fourth and fifth years of college (see Table   10 on page 28). These data further raise the question of the role of student loans in paying for college. If students who graduate within six years are more willing to borrow larger amounts in government loans during the final two years of college, does a hesitancy or unwillingness to borrow more to pay for college after the first year negatively affect graduation within six years? Among postsecondary students who started at private four-year colleges and universities and received a merit-based institutional grant, the general pattern was for baccalaureate degree recipients to receive slightly smaller Pell Grants than non-graduates in the first two years of college and to borrow much larger amounts of subsidized and unsubsidized loans than non-graduates in all but the first year. In fact, bachelor' s degree recipients who received merit-based institutional grants in the first year borrowed more than three times as much as non-graduates during the third and fourth years of college. These findings also raise the question about whether students are hesitant to borrow more for college during subsequent years, which may contribute to their lower six-year graduation rates. Like the pattern for institutional grant recipients at public colleges and universities, baccalaureate degree recipients who began at private institutions and received an institutional merit grant in their first year took on much larger debt levels during college than did non-graduates.  A third reason recipients of public-college institutional grant aid are more likely to graduate within six years could be a willingness to borrow larger amounts in subsequent years. In fact, among institutional grant recipients at public colleges and universities, those who graduated within six years borrowed much larger amounts than non-graduates. Baccalaureate degree recipients who received institutional grants borrowed more than $9,500 cumulative in Stafford Loans compared to about $6,100 cumulative for non-graduates (see Table 11). These data suggest that a hesitancy to borrow more in subsequent years of college may contribute to undergraduates' not completing a baccalaureate degree within six years. Institutional grant recipients at public colleges and universities who graduated within six years received almost $1,000 more than non-graduates in total aid in their first year of college, and 82 percent of this difference was in the form   Merit-based institutional grant recipients who start at private fouryear colleges are more likely to be from families with incomes below 200% of poverty; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The more likely explanation for why merit-based institutional grant aid in the first year of college did not positively influence graduation within six years is that the value of the merit grant simply did not cover a significant amount of the total charges to students. Average total aid and average total grants at private colleges and universities for merit-based institutional grant recipients were not statistically different between postsecondary students who graduated within six years and those who did not graduate; however, the ratio of total grant aid to total price and the ratio of total grant aid to total aid in the first year were statistically different between graduates and non-graduates. only 26 percent of the total price in the first year for nongraduates (see Table 12). Moreover, postsecondary students who received institutional merit-based grants in the first year and who graduated within six years borrowed almost twice as much in cumulative Stafford Loans ($13,531) than merit-based grant recipients who did not graduate ($6,797)."}, {"section_title": "Public Policy Implications", "text": "The effect of institutional grant aid on baccalaureate degree attainment and the subsequent differences in borrowing between graduates and non-graduates raises an important policy issue about the way financial aid is awarded to students. This analysis suggests that larger grants in the first year of college -especially need-based institutional grants -can increase the likelihood of students' graduating within six years. As Figure 1 on Page 33 illustrates, the proportion of total cost covered by grants is larger in the first year for postsecondary students who graduate within six years than for those who do not. Moreover, for students who begin at private institutions, the proportion of aid in the form of grants in the first year among institutional grant recipients is significantly larger for graduates.

This pattern suggests that colleges are taking advantage of increased loan limits for students who remain enrolled after the first year, thereby encouraging students who want to finish within six years to borrow higher amounts. These descriptive results underscore a growing concern about the reliance on student loans to pay for college, especially after the first year: do higher loan limits and, thus, the need to borrow more after the first year of college actually reduce the likelihood of a student graduating within six years? That is, students who did not graduate within six years may have taken fewer classes or worked more hours in order to avoid borrowing higher amounts after the first year. Working more hours while enrolled and taking fewer classes can hinder timely degree completion. In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the percentage of tuition and fees (as well as the total price of college) covered by grant financial aid in the first year has an important effect on graduation within six years. Notwithstanding the inequities implicit in rewarding institutional aid by traditional definitions of merit, it appears that improving college graduation rates is"}, {"section_title": "Figure 3", "text": "Average  1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 1999-2000 2000-2001 $3,000 less about the type of institutional grant awarded (need-based or merit-based) and more about the size of the institutional grant relative to the prices students pay for college. Put simply, one strategy to increase the percentage of students who earn a bachelor' s degree within six years is to provide larger grants in the first year of college. The amount of first-year institutional grants should be large enough when combined with other grant aid to cover at least half of tuition and fees and to pay between 20 percent and 30 percent of the total price of attendance. In addition, this analysis indicates that a willingness or hesitancy to borrow more for college after the first year may affect graduation rates. The reliance on student loans can place undergraduates in the difficult position of choosing increased debt or lower financial aid amounts in order to complete a bachelor' s degree in a timely manner. In other words, it is possible that the availability of higher loan limits in subsequent years encourages institutions to package relatively less grant aid after the first year, and this institutional policy may influence some students' enrollment decisions in the second and following years of college.
