[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It gradually increases from mild stage to severe, affecting the ability to perform common daily tasks without assistance. It is a neurodegenerative illness, presently having no specified cure. Computer-Aided Diagnostic Systems have played an important role to help physicians to identify AD. However, the diagnosis of AD into its four stages; No Dementia, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia remains an open research area. Deep learning assisted computer-aided solutions are proved to be more useful because of their high accuracy. However, the most common problem with deep learning architecture is that large training data is required. Furthermore, the samples should be evenly distributed among the classes to avoid the class imbalance problem. The publicly available dataset (OASIS) has serious class imbalance problem. In this research, we employed a transfer learning-based technique using data augmentation for 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) views from OASIS dataset. The accuracy of the proposed model utilizing a single view of the brain MRI is 98.41% while using 3D-views is 95.11%. The proposed system outperformed the existing techniques for Alzheimer disease stages."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "AD is a cerebral degeneration mental disease. Which is destructive for brain cells causing reminiscence loss affecting the ability of a human being to perform the routine tasks in a normal way. The reason for AD is not easily identified [1] due to which no proper cure has been specified. However, through early identification of this disease, the life quality of AD patients can thus be improved. Symptoms of AD usually develop slowly till they become serious enough to affect with daily errands and self-care. However, cases showing a loss in motor and linguistic skills may lead to a need for permanent support. Yearly, millions of people suffer from this disease. As per an estimate, around 5.3 Million people\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving it for publication was Oguz Elibol. suffered AD in 2015. In 2050, the number is expected to grow up to 16 Million [2] . Today in medical diagnosis, MRI is widely utilized in hospitals for AD identification because of its extraordinary resolution, good contrast and high availability [3] , [4] . Regardless of the enhancement in the initial identification of AD, structural MRI remains a challenging task for prediction of progression of ailment and needs further exploration.\nThe Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) is mostly utilized for the analysis of gradual neural aggravation. It captures the basic alteration in the brain, capturing the unavoidable damage caused due to neurodegeneration characteristic of AD alkalosis [5] . Most of the research discovered the degradation process, affecting regions in the brain such as hippocampus by utilizing the sMRI modality. The new MRI modality is centered on the movement of the water molecules in cerebral gray and white matter known as diffusion tensor imaging modality (DTI).\nAD diagnosis involves a diversity of medical tests which leads to a huge amount of multivariate heterogeneous data. It is, therefore, an exhausting activity to manually compare, visualize, and analyze this data. Although the terms of machine learning and deep learning have been coined not so long ago, for decades their ideas have been applied to medicinal imaging. Particularly in the area of Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) i.e. computer-aided diagnosis, systems performance is improved by utilizing a wide range of machine learning algorithms. To classify the characterized extracted features of AD, various conventional machine learning approaches have been proposed for the CAD. These features have been extracted from the volume of interests (VoI) and the regions of interest (ROI) [6] - [8] .\nIn the same way, features were extricated from the varying gray matter (GM) voxels [9] and regions of the hippocampus [10] - [12] . Though leaving scope for more research and studies, these approaches provided better early diagnosis of Alzheimer. For adequate training in deep learning specifically convolutional neural network (CNN), a huge amount of data samples are required [13] . If the training dataset is not adequately extensive then overfitting issue occurs [14] . Which means minimizing training iterations to improve the cost function. A 'Dropout' approach which is basically augmentation of data and regularization approach, can prevent and resolve inadequacy of the data samples issues [14] , [15] . Yet they remained limited in the case of AD studies because of small data samples. OASIS dataset though is publicly available, offers only a few data samples belonging to the demented subjects. This small dataset along with imbalanced class samples leads to unpredicted errors and even severe consequences in classification.\nIn this research, to diagnose the stages of AD, we utilized the pre-trained CNN model AlexNet for automatic classification of cerebral MRI. We assessed the importance of using natural image's features to classify the medical images addressing the shortcoming of inadequate data samples. The brain MRI scans attained from the OASIS source were augmented balancing the number of samples belonging to each class. The images were then tested under our proposed method encompassing the main MRI view as well as 3-D MRI views of the human brain. The proposed framework for AD stages detection has the following main key contributions:\n1) We designed a transfer learning-based approach by utilizing a pre-trained model for accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer stages from MRI. 2) Overcoming the imbalanced data sample distribution using data augmentation techniques with different parameters. 3) Utilizing both the main view of MRI scans and 3-D view of MRI scans of the human brain for the classification of dementia stages."}, {"section_title": "II.

In the pre-processing stage, the approach segmented the input MRI images into segments of GM, White Matter (WM), and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF). To construct the similarity matrices vector, the method utilized GM as ROI and through GM the statistical features were extracted. Wang et al. [19] proposed another technique utilizing feature selection techniques. The selected features were then classified using SVM giving an overall accuracy of 93.05%. Altaf et al. in [4] proposed a state-of-the-art technique for the AD diagnosis utilizing the bag of words model attaining 79.8% accuracy for multi-class classification and 98.4% for binary class classification.

Later they used the RNN with two levels of recurrent bidirectional cascade units formed on the MLP outputs for longitudinal extraction of the characteristics. They tested their proposed technique over ADNI datasets achieving an overall accuracy of 89.7%.

They proposed multimode-based, magnetic resonance-based and CNN-based methods of analysis that are also suitable for the analysis of single-type MRI data. To extrapolate the human brain's network connectivity, a new CNN approach was proposed to classify AD, MCI, and NC. They achieved greater precision and accuracy of 92.06% by combining multimode magnetic resonance with the CNN core. Gunawardena et al. in [26] utilized 1615 complete brain MRI scans for the diagnosis of AD. At first, they employed the existing vector carrier method for detecting AD with an accuracy of 84.4%.

Maqsood et al. proposed a transfer learning approach by utilizing pre-trained AlexNet for multi-class classification of AD. They attained 92.85% accuracy for their findings on un-segmented images. In [29] researchers proposed a crossmodal transfer learning from sMRI to DTI. They trained the model on sMRI with augmentation and then transferred the information to DTI dataset. In [30] the researchers established the efficacy of utilizing pre-trained models as a starting point of other networks. They utilized GoogleNet and inception-ResNet instead of training the network from scratch. These networks are trained over dataset which is not medical related however the last layers are fine-tuned over the samples from the respective problem. Another study [31] utilized transfer learning approaches and data augmentation techniques to resolve the inadequate data samples issue, for the identification of MCI in MR images. Here they utilized OASIS2 and LIDC3 for the pre-training phase and attained a 90.6% accuracy for MCI vs NC.\nFor the diagnosis of AD, the DTI image maps are often considered as a good modality, thus the researchers in [32] classified samples into Normal Control, Alzheimer's Disease, and MC utilizing MD and FA maps. The results of these findings showed that the FA is not a good indicator as compared to MD. In [33] they used multi-auxiliary domain by utilizing MCI vs sMCI as an auxiliary domain for classification of AD vs NC. They attained 94.7% accuracy for AD vs NC whereas a relatively low accuracy of 82.1% for MCI vs NC. A different work in [34] used the ImageNet as the source domain. All the layers were initialized with the pre-trained model except the last fully connected ones. The methodology utilized resulted in an overall accuracy of 83.5% for AD vs NC. In [13] researcher utilized transfer learning to extract joint spatial features. In [35] , researchers proposed a method using FA and MD with the Support Vector Machine classifier and utilized Plant's technique and IG measure for AD vs NC classification. They attained 80% accuracy for classification centered on FA and for MD they attained 83%.\nLooking through the literature, numerous techniques exist for the classification of AD. However, having certain limitations of not handling the class imbalance issue in multi-class Alzheimer's classification, which needs to be considered for effective results in AD classification.

Minority samples offer the least contribution to the overall accuracy of the system thus leading to ambiguous results. To enhance accuracy and confidence and to stop the overfitting issue, more data is needed to be made part of the training set. In this research, the classification issue tackled also lacks an adequate number of data samples to be fed into the CNN model.\nLooking at the insufficient and imbalanced number of samples we extend the current dataset by using distinct image augmentation approaches in both models.
