[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, due to worldwide alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19 (Bedford et al., 2020) . One of the questions studied extensively in the pandemic is the huge variation in the COVID-19 mortality rate across the globe, from over 16% in France and Belgium to less than 0.1% in Singapore and Qatar (Liang et al., 2020) . Such wide variation implies that there are factors other than patient characteristics that determine COVID-19 mortality, such as population dynamics, social and economical structure and government response.\nStudies have well established that COVID-19 mortality is positively associated with the patient characteristics such as the increasing age, obesity and underlying comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease (Chen et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Studies have also suggested that increasing COVID-19 testing has been associated with a slow viral spread (Peto, 2020) . Some epidemiologists have attributed the government response to containing the spread of the virus (Iacobucci, 2020) . Countries vary widely in terms of demographic profile, economic status, health infrastructure and ability to respond promptly to the disease outbreaks. Hence, it is crucial to design and implement rational strategies for the safety of patients, healthcare professionals and general public and to ensure all nations work together cohesively to emerge out successfully from the pandemic.\nWe have done a diverse analysis to apply the evidence based explanation for the impact of socioeconomic factors, healthcare capacity, government policy and interventions, and the disease related risk factors on COVID-19 associated mortality. In the current study, we have used the COVID mortality per million population, a stable parameter as the yardstick to correlate the COVID 19 mortality with the associated factors, and not the usual case fatality rate (CFR is the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases) because the CFR depends on the testing capacity of a country and hence does not reflect the true mortality."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Method", "text": "This is a worldwide cross-sectional study. The selection of the risk-related factors of COVID-19 was based on review of the literature and essentially based on data availability and completeness. The data for the study was extracted as on August 21, 2020. Data for total population, total cases, total COVID deaths, tests done, and GDP per capita (nominal in USD) were extracted from the Worldometers Coronavirus Statistics website (Coronavirus Update (Live) -Worldometer, no date). Datasets for health expenditure as percentage of GDP by government, number of hospital bed numbers (per 1000 people), percentage of rural population, prevalence of smoking (15+ age), percentage of overweight adult population, percentage of deaths due to communicable disease & other nutrition conditions and incidence of malaria (per 1000 population) were extracted from the World Bank Coronavirus website (World Bank Open Data | Data, no date) . Prevalence of diabetes mellitus (percentage of adult population) was retrieved from the indexmundi rankings (Index mundi, no date). The key findings from world population prospects 2017 were used for percentage of 60+ population and the average population age (United Nations, 2017) . Delay in lockdown (with regards to the first case in the country) (Wikipedia, 2020) , population density per square meter(World Population Growth -Our World in Data, no date) and current BCG vaccination policy(BCG World Atlas, 3rd edition , no date) were also included for analysis. Out of about 185 affected countries, only 56 countries with total confirmed cases more than 25000 (as on August 21, 2020) were selected for analysis in this study.

With increasing age the deficiency of T-cell and Bcell function rises, and there is overproduction of type 2 cytokines (Zhou et al., 2020) . This usually adds up to the viral replication and stretch the period of pro-inflammatory responses which result in poor health conditions (Zhou et al., 2020) . Verity et al. (2020) observed that the case fatality rate for those under age 60 was 1.4%, however, it increased drastically to 4.5% for people aged over 60 years old and to 13.4% for 80 years and above (Verity et al., 2020) .\nMoreover, the average age of people dying of COVID-19 was found to be 68 years, while, the average age for recovered patients was 51 years (Chen et al., 2020) .\nIn the present study we observed a positive as well as statistically significant global association of 60+ population percentage with COVID mortality (r=0.422; p=0.009). Further comparing the data between the various continents, it was found that higher '60+ population', such as in Europe (25-29%) was positively associated with COVID 19 morality. Whereas, regions with younger population like the Asia, Africa and Middle-East witnessed fewer deaths. Exceptions to this association were South America and North America (except USA, Canada) which had only 10-15% '60+ population' but experienced higher mortality.

However, significantly less COVID 19 mortality was observed in Asia (r=0.5; p= 0.018) which has less percentage of obese adults. Whereas, South America with high prevalence of overweight; reported a corresponding high mortality (r=0.733; p=0.061).

Looking at it the other way, such heavily populated areas may be a step ahead in providing quality and accessible health care facilities and administering better social distancing policies (You, Wu and Guo, 2020). A US based study revealed that areas with large population have greater COVID-19 infection and fatality rates. However, the observation was reversed after controlling for population size and other confounding variables, resulting in significant negative association of infection and mortality rates with the population density (Hamidi, Ewing and Sabouri, 2020) .\nThe study of population density across the globe reflected a negative (non-significant) association with COVID mortality. We observed a vast difference in mortality when comparing countries with similar population density such as India (394) and Belgium (379) with a contrasting mortality rate of 40 and 906 respectively. Similar contrasting mortality pattern has been documented for other countries with matching population density, like UK and Pakistan and; Italy and Qatar. Our data was unable to find a predictive pattern for population density variable. On one hand we had densely populated Asia with less mortality and sparsely populated American continent on the other hand with a high mortality.\nHowever, Europe with some dense populated countries like Netherland, Belgium, UK and Italy; did show a positive association with mortality rate (r=0.509; p=0.044).\nAll rights reserved.

However, the finding was complimented with a significant high death rate recorded in North America (r=-0.665; p=0.005) comprising of low rural population. Similarly, Europe recorded a high death rate but not statistically significant with its low rural population.

While, Iran and Iraq from the same region had low testing associated with high mortality. South American countries on the contrary had high mortality rate which is attributed to their less testing practice (r=0.789; p=0,035). The deviation from the usual pattern was examined in the US with profound testing associated with low CFR but high mortality rate. Europe also tested more but showed high CFR as well as mortality.
