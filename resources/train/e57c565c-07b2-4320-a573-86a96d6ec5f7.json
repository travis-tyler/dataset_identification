For example, uncertainty about college costs and the availability of financial aid has been associated with underenrollment among low-income and minority students (O'Connor, Hammack, and Scott 2010). In addition, misconceptions about cost and financial aid may limit the colleges that low-income and minority students consider attending (Arnold 1995; College Board and Art & Science Although most analyses in this report include all students, one analysis was conducted at the state level for students in 10 states. 1 1 For these 10 states, NCES designed the HSLS:09 sample so that it represented each state's population of 9th-grade students in schools that offered both 9th and 11th grades.  estimates to the enrollment-weighted average tuition and fee totals within their state because students were asked to estimate the cost at \"a public 4-year college in your state\" rather than at particular institutions. All comparisons of estimates were tested for statistical significance using the Student's t statistic, and all differences cited are statistically significant at the p < .05 level. 2 2 No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Point estimates for all figures can be found in appendix A. The standard errors for the estimates can be found in appendix B. \u2022 When students were asked about their confidence in their tuition and fee estimates in 9th grade, 27 percent reported \"not at all confident.\" Two years later, when most students were in 11th grade, 51 percent reported that they did not know how much public 4-year colleges in their state charged for tuition and fees (figure 5). 3 3 Ninth-graders were not given the opportunity to report \"I don't know\" in estimating tuition and fees but instead were asked about their level of confidence in their ability to estimate tuition and fees. \u2022 One-quarter of 9th-graders disagreed or strongly disagreed that college was affordable (figure 7). Two years later, one-third of these students reported the same. In addition, the percentage of 9thgraders who planned to enroll in a bachelor's degree program declined from 51 percent when they were in 9th grade to 45 percent 3 years later, when most students had just completed high school (figure 8)."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "How do 9th-graders' and their parents' estimates of public 4-year tuition and fees differ from the actual average tuition and fees of public 4-year institutions in their state?
