Sood et al. tested the classifier in muscle, brain and skin expression data (up to age 86), with reported success in classifying young versus old. Using data from the ULSAM cohort (males aged 70 years), the classifier was collapsed into a \"healthy ageing gene score\" (HAGS), which was tested against clinical parameters in linear models, in which HAGS explained 11% of the variance in renal function 12 years later (measured by cystatin C, Sood et al . table S1 ). An association with mortality was also claimed (unadjusted p=0.03), but statistical tests were noted for 26 clinical measures, two diseases plus mortality in this sample of only 108 men, with no adjustment for multiple statistical testing.\nEvidence for HAGS in blood samples was limited to Sood et al. classification performance in patients already suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls (with no data on future 'health'). HAGS performance alone in classifying AD vs controls was modest (ROC areas under the curve 66% and 73% in two datasets: 50%=random, 100%=perfect 'diagnosis') and HAGS alone could not distinguish between MCI and AD. No other data were presented on HAGS as a 'diagnostic of future health' in blood or other tissues.\nHere we investigated HAGS using whole blood-derived expression data from two wellcharacterized human cohorts including wide age ranges and both sexes; the Italian aging cohort, InCHIANTI (2), and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, BLSA (3). We hypothesized that a gene expression ageing score should be positively correlated with chronological age in linear modelling and should predict mortality. It should also be Pilling et al. -Healthy Ageing gene expression score in two human cohorts 3 associated with commonly studied age-related phenotypes including muscle strength, cognitive, renal function and inflammation. Sood et al. report applying the 150 Affymetrix array derived gene set in data from Illumina\nHuman HT-12 v3 microarrays used in skin and blood samples, with 128 genes included. In our Illumina HT-12 based data, we found that only 119 (of the 150) gene IDs had a corresponding probe in the Illumina Human HT-12 v3 array annotation (4). Some genes mapped to more than one probe; we selected the probe with the highest mean expression across the participants for each gene. Of these 119 genes, 77 were significantly expressed above background (v3 array, p<0.01 in at least 5% of participants (5)) in InCHIANTI and 66 (v4 array) in BLSA. We therefore calculated associations with both the genes expressed above background and the full n=119 sets separately.

Robust linear regression models (STATA v13) against HAGS were adjusted for age, microarray batch and basic white blood cell subtype counts (number of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils).

Maximum follow-up time periods for InCHIANTI and BLSA were approximately 6.7 years and 6 years, respectively. HAGS based on genes expressed above background was not associated with our studied ageing phenotypes ( In a recent meta-analysis of nearly 15,000 participants from 14 cohorts including InCHIANTI, Peters et al. report that expression of 1,497 genes in human whole blood samples had sufficient overall correlations with chronological age to produce significant estimates in linear modelling, with 25% of these also associated with age in brain tissue (6) . Of the 150 genes identified by Sood et al. only 10 genes were also found to be associated with chronological age in this large-scale meta-analysis in human blood.\nWe have shown in two relatively large independent cohorts that the recently reported \"healthy aging gene score\", measured in blood, was not associated with chronological age or several age-related phenotypes, and was not predictive of mortality over 6 years. These results were consistent across sensitivity analyses using different data subsets (e.g. narrower age ranges) and adjustments."}]
