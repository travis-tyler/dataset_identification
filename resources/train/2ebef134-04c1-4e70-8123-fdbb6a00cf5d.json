Among the various diagnostic methods for Alzheimer's disease, MRI brain imaging can display sharp changes in brain tissues. It can be used as a medium for early Alzheimer detection. Considering the high volume of features related to brain tissue thickness, requires the using feature reduction methods. For this purpose, statistical tests pair sample test and Independent sample test was used. After careful selection of key features, for reducing the number of features, SAS which is a kernel-based feature selection algorithm is used in linear and nonlinear mode. At the end, neural network classification, decision trees, nearest neighbor and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms are used for modeling. Results show that the classification accuracy of obtained feature subsets have better results compare to the original data set."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer detection is getting progressively more important. Different methods are proposed to improve accuracy of Alzheimer detection. There are great success in this area, but, still there is challenging to solve. Researchers are working to overcome Alzheimer detection challenges. There are different areas in this subject to be work on. Some of researchers try to improve learning models and others try to use new features and new combination of features [1] . Unimodal data yields week results, therefore, data fusion of several modal data are used to boost accuracy of Alzheimer detection [2] . Also, fusing of different class of features is used to improve Alzheimer detection accuracy [3] . These features could be from different modalities or from different class of features [4] . In this paper, a two phase feature selection algorithm is utilized to boost accuracy of Alzheimer detection. In the first phase, statistical tests are used to select features, then, kernel-based feature selection algorithm is utilized. In the second phase, the algorithms are used for first time in Alzheimer detection.\nVarious sources in Alzheimer detection using brain tissue thickness characteristics have been studied. Most studies on Alzheimer detection are focused on four groups of people: healthy subjects (NC), Alzheimer's disease (AD), those with mild disease and later recovered (MCI -S) and those with mild disease later become Alzheimer's disease (MCI-P) [5] . Most of the studies used the statistical methods for diagnosis. In this paper, the SAS, a kernel-based feature selection algorithm, is used, for the first time in the field of Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this article is to select characteristics features of brain tissue thickness extracted from MRI images for classification and separation of Alzheimer's disease and healthy individuals. For this purpose, the study dataset was obtained from ADNI website. After normalizing the data, a subset of characteristic feature is selected in two steps. First using statistical test, then, using kernel-based feature selection algorithm. For this purpose in according to the behavior of the algorithm, 10 subset of features respectively with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 features are selected. Then, the accuracy of classification of the subsets was evaluated using neural network and decision trees classification algorithms. The purpose of this article, in addition to select a subset of features, is specifying the effect of the number of features on the accuracy of classification."}, {"section_title": "PREPARATION DATASET", "text": "The study dataset has been downloaded from ADNI website (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data).

In this dataset, people during periods of the baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months were studied. Finally, there is a dataset with 50 samples and 440 features per period."}, {"section_title": "DATA NORMALIZATION", "text": "There are a lot of methods for data normalization. In all of standardization methods, data is converted in a manner that the conditions to be met. In order to implement the classification algorithms such as neural networks, the data values should be normalized. For this purpose, all data is scaled to the range of [200 and 100] . For this purpose, The MIN-MAX normalization method is used. In this normalization method, assuming that the data Z is in the [ ] interval, the goal is to change range to the new interval [ ]. For this purpose, each initial data value such as V will convert to the new value in the new interval. The normalization equation is given in Equation (1).

In other word, there are 440 features per period. The features with low effect in discrimination of AD and healthy subjects could be eliminated. Due to the high volume of features, it is better to use the statistical methods that are fast in determining the low importance features. For this purpose, the t test in SPSS software is used."}, {"section_title": "TEST PAIRED SAMPLE TEST", "text": "With this test, the following question could be answered. Is there any difference between any of the features of the brain tissue thickness at the baseline and 24 months periods or not?\nIf there is such a difference, these features are important and such important features should be selected. If there is no significant difference between values of any feature in the two periods, that feature has low importance in classifying two groups of patients and healthy individuals. This feature can be eliminated.\nThe data of these two periods are arranged as ordered pairs. The test statistics are based on the variable di which is difference of each pair. If the measured variable in the first period be xi and the measured variable in the second period be yi,the value of di will be obtained as follows (Adel. et al., 1379) [7] .\n(2) Then, these variables, assuming normal distribution for data and having unknown variance, follows the distribution of paired t test, as Eq (3). (3) Where the sd value is obtained from Eq (4).\nIn Eq(4), d is standard deviation and is the average of d. Here, the null hypothesis is having no difference between couples which is zero and 1 hypothesis shows a difference. Test results will confirm or reject the null hypothesis.\nTo apply this test it is necessary to determine the two main variables, Confidence interval and P-value. Given that used dataset is a medical dataset and has high sensitivity, the value of confidence interval is fixed to 99% instead of 95%. This improves the accuracy of the feature selection (Davies et al., 2009) [8] ."}, {"section_title": "INDEPENDENT SAMPLE TEST", "text": "This test is used to get the average of two independent groups that are organized separately.

In this equation, and are the mean of groups one and two. n1 and n2 are the number of members of groups one and two. s1 and s2 are the variance in groups one and two which are obtained using equation (6) . Independent statistical hypothesis for the independent sample test comes as (7) . In this case, if \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the average of two groups of healthy and patient, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the two groups and one hypothesis is that there is a significant difference between the two groups.

For linear algorithms for linear kernel are used. When the data placed in linear space, this kernel has better performance. For the implementation of nonlinear algorithms different kernels can be used that include: dot, quadratic, polynomial and Gaussian [9] . Generally radial Gaussian kernel function (RBF) has better performance in nonlinear prediction problems. This kernel is one of the most-used kernels in the field of machine learning algorithms. This kernel is used in the most kernel-based machine learning algorithms. By increasing the dimension of features, RBF reveals the hidden relationships between the features.

Then, using that feature, the data set is divided into two or more categories. This continues until all the data in a category belong to a class. The goal is to build a tree of features that have the lowest height in order to searches on fewer features for label test data [11] ."}, {"section_title": "K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM", "text": "One of the best classifiers is K nearest neighbor classifier.

First, features that are important for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and healthy people are selected and stored in an Excel file. The data normalization code is written and run in the MATLAB version 2013. The SAS feature selection algorithm in the MATLAB software version 2013 is used. The output of this algorithm (selected features) saved in Excel file format. To evaluate the classification accuracy of classification algorithms (neural networks, decision trees, Na\u00efve Bayes on, k-nearest neighbour) with selected features, Rapid Miner software has been used.\nIn this section results are represent in the graphs and tables format. In Figure 2 the results of the implementation of the Pair Sample Test algorithm is shown. As can be seen, the number of features for each period has been reduced from 440 to 141 features. In Figure 3 , the results of the Independent Sample Test algorithm are shown. As can be seen, the number of features is reduced from 141 to 106. Until now, using these two tests, the number of minor properties has been significantly reduced.\nUsing the filtering method, 106 features were chosen from among 440 attributes for each period. At this stage, dataset contains 50 samples (n = 27 AD patients and 23 healthy subjects) and 106 features. This dataset is used as input to the SAS algorithm. Using kernel-based feature selection algorithms with two separate kernels, from a total of 106 features, 10 separate subset of the features of brain tissue thickness with a number of features 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 are obtained.\nThe purpose of specifying subsets with different number of features is to investigate the effect of selected features and number of them on the classification accuracy.\nAt last, the classification accuracy using the selected subsets of features with different classification algorithms: Na\u00efve Bayes, neural networks, nearest neighbour and decision tree algorithms, are compared. As can be seen in Figures 4 and 5 , the best accuracy is obtained for subsets with 20, 30, 40 and 50 features. The Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm classifier has the best performance. Figure 4 presents the best accuracy, when sasliner is used for feature selection, which are as follows: by decision tree for a subset of 10 features, accuracy is 90%; for subset of 30 features and knn algorithm with k = 7, accuracy is 98%; for subset of 30 features and knn algorithm with k = 10, accuracy is 96%; for subsets of 30 and 20 features and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm, accuracy is 98%; and, for subsets of 40 and 50 and neural network algorithm, accuracy is 98%. As a result, the subsets of 20 or 30 features with Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm give the reasonable results. Figure 5 presents the accuracy of feature selection using sasrbf algorithm. The best accuracy are as follows: accuracy with decision tree algorithm and 10 features is 84%; for subset of 20 features and knn algorithm with k = 7, accuracy is 92%; for a subset of 20 features and knn algorithm with k = 10, accuracy is 92%; for subsets of 10 and 20 features and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm, accuracy is 92%; and, for the subset of 20 features and neural network algorithm, accuracy is 90%.

In the paper [15] , Results indicate superiority of supervised machine learning techniques over unsupervised ones in diagnosing AD and withal, predominance of RBF kernel over lineal one. Accuracies of 83.3%, 83.3%, 90% and 91.7% are achieved in classification by K-mean, FCM, linear SVM and SVM with radial based function (RBF) respectively.

For this purpose, first, statistical tests pair sample test and Independent sample test were used to eliminate low important features. Then, SAS is used in linear and nonlinear mode to reduce feature numbers more. To evaluate effeciency of feature selection, several classification have been used to classify the data with selected featuers. Results show that classification accuracy even improve after feature reduction."}]
