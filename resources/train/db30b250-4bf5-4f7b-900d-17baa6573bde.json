Introduction", "text": "In the following study I consider the impact of sea-level rise on archaeological sites in the Virginia Coastal Plain using analytical techniques drawn from geospatial analysis. While the majority of current sea level rise research centers around existing human infrastructure that will be affected, cultural resource managers have recently started considering sea level rise impacts on coastal archaeological sites (Caffrey and Beavers 2013, Erlandson 2012, Marzeion and Levermann 2014. Previous studies (Boon et al. 2010, Lowery et al. 2012, Reeder-Myers 2015 suggest that the Chesapeake Bay region will be particularly prone to serious and sustained impacts to archaeological resources in coastal and estuarine settings. Just in Virginia alone, Lowery et al. (2012) estimate that with only one foot (0.3 m) of sea level rise, nearly 800 of the 17,000 archaeological sites will be affected. That number increases to nearly 3,000 sites that would be affected with five feet (1.5 m) of sea level rise. My study analyzes a subset of these sites and expands upon previous research in order to identify (a) which sites will be most affected, (b) what sort of coastal change processes will have the greatest effect upon them, and (c) what types of strategies could be implemented to help protect the cultural heritage at these sites. As an anthropological study, my research centers on the way social practices have impacted-and continue to impact-human landscapes. My research is theoretically centered in historical ecology, which emphasizes a 2 dualistic feedback mechanism of human-environmental interactions: human societies are not only affected by environmental change; they also cause environmental change which will then impact them positively or negatively in the future (Bal\u00e9e 2006). Environmental archaeological research draws on paleoclimatic proxies such as shell and pollen deposits, sediment cores, and tree rings to determine what sort of physical environment past societies lived in (Bal\u00e9e 2006, Dincauze 2000, Riebeek 2005). The archaeological record supplements the paleoclimatic record with evidence of how past societies both modified and adapted to the natural environment (Bal\u00e9e 2006, Erlandson 2012, Rick and Lockwood 2013, Sandweiss and Kelley 2012. Thus, the archaeological record not only informs us of how people adapted to environmental change in the past, but it can inform current policy for dealing with issues of sea level rise and coastal erosion today. As Erlandson (2012) emphasizes, \"Ironically, marine erosion is destroying the very coastal sites that can tell us how past societies adapted to earlier episodes of sea level rise and coastal geographic change that had profound effects on human history.\" Previous studies of sea level rise in the Chesapeake region indicate that two particular types of archaeological resources-Native American shell midden sites located along the water's edge and residential settlements located in riverside and estuarine locations-will be hardest hit. Native American shell midden sites are particularly significant sites, and the examples included in this study are no exception to this. These types of deposits accumulate over long periods, which causes them to contain evidence of long-term cultural changes. Equally important, these shell middens also offer evidence of the ways that Native American societies interacted with and transformed an environmental setting over the long term. This makes them crucial long-term archives of both cultural and paleoclimatic data. surrounding Indian Field Creek. The NWSY serves as an ideal location for this study for several reasons. First, the NWSY contains a wealth of archaeological sites, most of which relate to the deep history of Native sites in the region. Secondly, these archaeological deposits maintain a high degree of stratigraphic integrity because the base has avoided the residential development of surrounding areas, and as such most sites remain undisturbed by mechanized plowing or construction. Lastly, as a result of a program of sustained survey and excavation of archaeological sites on NWSY supported by the U.S. Navy, we have detailed knowledge of the archaeological sites on the base. My assessment of archaeological site locations, elevation, and topography on the NWSY points toward the future impacts of climate change on sites located on the base and will enable cultural resource managers to make decisions about how to best preserve these sites before coastal change processes take a further toll upon them."}, {"section_title": "II. Study Area", "text": "In order to understand the role that the landscape of the study area played in the lives of past Native Americans, as well as how that landscape will be affected by coastal change processes, it is necessary to understand the natural features that make up that landscape. My research centers around Indian Field Creek, which branches off of the York River approximately 3 miles west of its mouth, creating a low-energy estuarine setting that is polyhaline, or highly salty,  There is a steep bluff on the northernmost side of the NWSY property facing the river which contains officers' housing known as Mason Row. The bluff is the dividing line between the NWSY property and that which is owned by the National Park Service as part of the Colonial National Historic Park. The Colonial Parkway, owned and managed by the Park Service, runs along the base of the bluff and across the mouth of Indian Field Creek (see Figure II-2 below). It is interesting to note that the channel of Indian Field Creek was actually modified in the 1930s when the Parkway was constructed (MacCord and Callahan 2007). Prior to this construction, the base of the bluff was covered in wetlands, which were then filled in and the land was artificially raised in order to accommodate the road being built on top of it (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 1906). This artificially constructed land constitutes some of the lowest-  "}, {"section_title": "III. Coastal Change Processes", "text": "The physical landscape surrounding Indian Field Creek contains a variety of settings in which past societies lived and worked. These settings are threatened by multiple coastal change processes, each of which affects the landscape and the archaeological record in different ways. This section details what these processes are and which will have the greatest impact on archaeological resources. The three main processes that impact Indian Field Creek and the Chesapeake Bay area as a whole are: sea level rise, land subsidence, and coastal erosion. All of these processes are interconnected and thus magnify the effects of the others. In particular, the amount of land subsidence increases the amount of relative sea level rise, which increases the amount of coastal erosion, and so in turn, they all have an impact on coastal archaeological sites."}, {"section_title": "A. Sea Level Rise", "text": "Researchers conceptualize and measure sea level rise in two ways: absolute sea level rise and relative sea level rise. Absolute, or global, sea level rise is the measure of the increase in volume of water in the world's oceans due to increasing temperature and melting ice caps. The average global sea level rise is currently occurring at 1.8 mm/yr based on calculations presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report 4. On the other hand, scientists calculate relative sea level rise relative to the land surface at coastal tidal stations. 1 As the land sinks, the difference in vertical elevation between the land surface and water surface will increase. This will indicate a higher rate of relative sea level rise compared to absolute sea level rise because the relative rate of sea level rise also includes the amount of land subsidence (or in rare cases, the amount of land emergence). The fact that the land is sinking in the Tidewater area, in addition to the absolute sea level rising, explains why the rate of relative sea level rise for the Chesapeake Bay equates to nearly twice the global average, at 3.8 mm/yr measured at the Gloucester Point tidal station (Barbosa and Silva 2009, Boon et al. 2010, Fagan 2013, NOAA 2013b."}, {"section_title": "B. Land Subsidence", "text": "Scientists define land subsidence as \"downward movement of the earth's crust relative to the earth's center.\" The main cause for land subsidence along developed coastlines is the pumping of groundwater to provide water supplies for localities. As a result of groundwater removal, the surrounding sediment layers compact, making the ground surface lower than it was before (Barbosa andSilva 2009, Boon et al. 2010). The Hampton Roads Sanitation District is in the process of researching how to pump treated wastewater back into the aquifer to help it recharge, which would help to combat subsidence in addition to providing more water that is available to local communities (Bogues 2016)."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C. Coastal Erosion", "text": "Erosion refers to the wearing down of sanding or rocky shorelines by continual wave action. Erosion is always occurring in coastal areas to some degree, but several factors increase its severity. Increased sea level rise will cause waves to break at a higher elevation along the shoreline, inundating lower elevations more frequently as well as washing sediment away from further up the slope. Hurricanes and other major storm events amplify this process because storm surge affects considerably higher elevations than usual. During Hurricane Isabel, storm surge caused sudden major erosion of a portion of the shoreline along the Colonial Parkway near Indian Field Creek, which required emergency work to stabilize the cliff side and make sure the road was not in danger of collapsing (Hardaway et al. 2006). One of the predicted impacts of future climate change is more frequent and more severe storms (Erlandson 2012), which would cause catastrophic erosion like what happened during Isabel to occur more regularly. Depending on the geology of a region and the steepness of the slope, the base of a bluff may erode more easily than the material above it. Erosion will continue along the base until there is not enough structural integrity to hold up the material above it. The upper layers will all fall down the slope and fill in, which is a process known as slumping. This occurs frequently in my study area along the York River, where the dominant features are riverine terraces with steep bluffs leading down to the water. In areas where there are prehistoric midden deposits, the Woodland era midden is on top of a fossil layer known as the on Felgates Creek, just up the river from my study area, the Yorktown Formation layer is eroding, leaving the intact midden precariously jutting out over the beach. When the fossil layer erodes too far, nothing remains to hold up the midden layer and all of it collapses onto the beach (Hardaway et al. 2014). This is far more catastrophic than incremental erosion because all stratigraphic integrity is lost with the collapse of the midden, making it impossible for archaeologists to determine the context of the layers of the midden. Another common occurrence is tree falls. With the erosion of sandy soil from the bluffs, trees at the top of the bluff become exposed. When they no 12 longer have the root structure to support themselves, they will fall down the bluff with their remaining roots displacing more soil from the bluff along with them, as shown in Figure III  In addition to erosion by undercutting, erosion can occur down slopes, as visible at site 44YO2 in Figure X- "}, {"section_title": "IV. Heritage Management", "text": "When one considers the potential 800 coastal sites in Virginia that could be threatened due to future coastal change processes (Lowery et al. 2012), it becomes readily obvious that not all of them can be saved. Because of the time and monetary investment needed to protect a single site, it then becomes a matter of prioritizing which sites are the most significant and in the greatest danger (Murphy et al. 2009 (Gallivan 2016, King 2003. Under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), sites are evaluated not only based on their significance, but also based on potential future impacts to the site based on natural or anthropogenic processes. This evaluation also considers how to mitigate adverse effects from future processes, as well as how to best preserve the knowledge contained in the archaeological record at each site. Two common options are: excavation of the site to recover as much data as possible or preservation of the site in situ (King 2003). For shoreline sites, in situ preservation generally takes the form of attempting to stabilize the shoreline to lessen the rate at which future erosion occurs. In Virginia, the preferred method of shoreline management is the creation of \"living shorelines\" that are composed primarily of marsh plants planted along the shoreline (Hardaway et al. 2014: 1). These marshes serve to anchor the sediment to prevent erosion, disperse wave action so it does not hit the shore as aggressively, improve the surrounding water quality, and provide habitat for aquatic plants and animals. The marsh edge is often accompanied by stone sills further out into the water that serve as breakwaters and protect the marsh behind them. This approach has proven to be more effective that previous shoreline armoring techniques where stone revetments at the shore were unexpectedly overtopped during storm events, causing erosion of the bank behind them (Hardaway et al. 2010) and was implemented at Werewocomoco in the summer of 2016 (see Figure IV- (Sheehan et al. 1999, Gallivan 2016. Data on the Archaic period is limited to a few diagnostic projectile points, though it appears that Archaic period inhabitants preferred locations further away from the York River in higher elevations (Gallivan 2016. Late Archaic sites that have been discovered are typically small and ephemeral, with low artifact densities. Blanton et al. hypothesized that these small sites might be staging areas in between larger, more intensively used sites located on lower river terraces, which are now submerged by rising sea levels (Blanton et al. 2005: 251). Likewise in the Early Woodland period (1000 -500 BC), sites that have been found are also temporary encampments with small scatters of artifacts (Blanton et al. 2005). More Early Woodland sites have been found to the west of the Chickahominy River than to the east along the James-York Peninsula, which could suggest that the native inhabitants migrated eastward as they shifted their dependence from forest resources in the Early Woodland to estuarine resources in the Middle Woodland period (Blanton et al. 2005, Sheehan et al. 1999. Part of the reason for this shift could be due to the expansion of tidal wetlands and the expansion of more saline water up into the York River, creating the perfect environment for shellfish. This occurred right at the end of the Early Woodland and the beginning of the Middle Woodland period, based on pollen core evidence gathered from 44YO2 (Blanton et al. 2005). Going into the Middle Woodland period (500 BC -900 AD), the number of inhabited sites increased dramatically. In the early Middle Woodland, the Native inhabitants still preferred inland locations where they could hunt deer and squirrel or gather mast and other nuts (Sheehan et al. 1999). However, there began to be a more even mix of inland and coastal settlements that were frequently used as short-term hunting and gathering sites. Throughout the Middle Woodland period, native populations increased, which facilitated a shift from bands to tribes. These population increases also strained the availability of resources, which would explain why we see an expansion into coastal sites and an increasing dependence on estuarine resources (Blanton et al. 2005, Gallivan 2016, Sheehan et al. 1999. Beginning in the late Middle Woodland period (200 -900 AD) we see a definite shift towards estuarine resource exploitation. The \"hunter-gatherer\" people became rather \"forager-fishers,\" utilizing one or two seasonal rounds in order to take best advantage of both marine and terrestrial resources as they were seasonally available. Encampments would be nearer to the shore to gather clams and oysters in the fall and winter then would move closer to the fish runs in the spring and summer. Estuarine base camps were inhabited repeatedly as part of this seasonal round and for longer lengths of time than early Middle Woodland encampments, as indicated by the higher density of shell and fire-cracked rock found in the archaeological record (Blanton et al. 2005, Dent 1995, Gallivan 2016). It is unlikely that these base camps would be classified as villages at this point, but the people were definitely becoming more sedentary. In the early Late Woodland period (900 -1200 AD), we see a reversal of these trends. The amount of oysters being consumed decreased, which put less pressure on oyster populations, allowing them to grow larger, and so we see an increase in the shell size of oysters recovered from this period (Gallivan 2016). It is probable that the population growth of the Middle Woodland period put a strain on marine resources and so the people looked for alternate sources of food. More deer were consumed during the Late Woodland, as their populations likely rebounded during the Middle Woodland while the people were exploiting shellfish (Blanton et al. 2005). Bows and arrows came into use at this time, which made it easier to hunt terrestrial game (Dent 1995). More important, however, was the beginnings of maize horticulture during this period. This transition towards agricultural dependence occurred later in the Coastal Plain region than in other regions, suggesting that the shift was driven by resource depression due to increased population (Blanton et al. 2005, Dent 1995, Gallivan 2016, Sheehan et al. 1999. This also meant that people were living in definite villages for the first time, which were often located in floodplains, while still making use of smaller camps directly on the coasts (Blanton et al. 2005, Dent 1995, Sheehan et al. 1999)."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Most of these patterns reach their climax in the late Late Woodland or Protohistoric period (1200 -1607 AD). Population continued to increase and thus villages became larger, more centralized, and were intended to be more permanent. Typical villages at this time were made up of longhouses and smaller oval-shaped dwellings and were encircled by ditches and/or palisade lines (Dent 1995, Sheehan et al. 1999. Dent (1995) also pointed out that sometimes palisade lines would only encircle part of the village, or would separate the chief's house or sacred spaces from the rest of the village, which could indicate that the palisades served more of a symbolic rather than defensive purpose. Within these villages, people became more sedentary and dependent on agriculture; however, we also see a reversal back to dependence on shellfish and other estuarine resources (Gallivan 2016). Within the archaeological record for the area along the York River, there are a larger number of sites with Late Woodland/Protohistoric components, as well as a higher artifact density at those sites, including large shell middens. A very large number of postholes have also been found, which indicates the creation of more permanent houses (Blanton et al. 2005). All of these factors contributed to the rise of chiefdoms, specifically the Powhatan chiefdom, which stretched from the Rappahannock River to the James River and west to the fall line (Dent 1995 Another way that Powhatan maintained power over his sub-tribes was through a tribute system. The weroances of each sub-tribe gave tribute to Powhatan as a sign of their subservience and loyalty to him. In return, Powhatan promised protection for the tribes and would also give gifts of prestige goods to the weroances. This was a means by which the weroances could compete with each other for social and political standing (Mallios 2006).  (Blanton et al. 2005, Dent 1995. Copper was especially important as a symbol of authority among the Powhatan because it could not be found in the Tidewater area and had to be obtained from the Monacan tribes located in the Virginia Piedmont, who were frequent rivals of the Powhatan. This likely explains why the Powhatan were eager to trade with the Europeans for copper, because it reduced their reliance on the Monacan (Hantman 1990). When the Europeans first arrived, the Powhatan sought to bring them into this exchange and tribute system. Gallivan (2016) argued that the Powhatan divination ceremony that John Smith took part in while being held captive by the Powhatan was actually a means by which he was symbolically brought into the Powhatan world. Later, he returned to Jamestown and Powhatan considered him one of his weroances in charge of the James Fort settlers (Gallivan 2016). However, relations between the Powhatan and the Europeans quickly soured. Mallios made the case that this was because the Europeans were not aware of and thus did not follow Native customs of gift exchanges (Mallios 2006). In spite of this and other reasons for the discord, relations between the Kiskiak and the Europeans were always strained. John Smith commented that when he visited Kiskiak, he \"was treated with scorn\" by the village's inhabitants. Later, the Kiskiak were one of the tribes that participated in the uprising of 1622. This led to fierce reprisals by the Europeans, which included burning food supplies and portions of the village in repeated episodes over time. Shortly after this, in 1623, the Kiskiak abandoned the village on the York River and moved northward into Mathews County before merging with the Piankatank tribe (Blanton et al. 2005, Gallivan 2016). This was the end of prehistoric settlement around Indian Field Creek, as the land was quickly divided up amongst prominent European settlers (Blanton et al. 2005)."}, {"section_title": "VI.

These middens were most likely processing areas for oysters gathered from Indian Field Creek before they were taken into the domestic spaces further along the bluff and consumed there (Gallivan 2016 to determine its extent. At the end of their excavation, they had found 23 meters of the ditch extending along the bluff. Their initial interpretation was that it was a defensive fortification, which is supported by further excavations by Gallivan (Blanton et al. 2005, Gallivan 2016). Additionally, the WMCAR survey also found deposits from a historic period occupation dating to the 20 th century.

Methodology", "text": "To determine the vulnerability of the selected sites, I chose to construct a Coastal Vulnerability Index, or CVI. This is a tool frequently used by coastal managers that takes into account multiple variables -such as elevation, historic rates of erosion, and sea level rise and land subsidence rates -and assigns them a numerical ranking between 1 (least vulnerable) and 5 (most vulnerable) so they can be compared with each other to produce a total ranking of vulnerability. This approach allows for comparing both quantitative and qualitative variables and can be used to make management decisions over large areas, such as entire coastlines, or with a large number of archaeological sites being analyzed (McLaughlin and Cooper 2010, Reeder et al. 2010, Thieler and Hammar-Klose 2000. In contrast, when looking at smaller study areas, such as Indian Field Creek, it is common to simply calculate rates of erosion on a site-by-site basis and use regression analysis to predict future erosion (Maio et al. 2012, Reeder et al. 2010. However, I chose to construct a CVI because it allowed me to consider more variables besides just erosion to determine the vulnerability of the physical environment. This approach also allowed me to take into consideration cultural variables in addition to the environmental variables, so that I could factor in each site's significance to the archaeological record as well as its vulnerability to the physical environment. Many studies only take the environmental factors into consideration, but also examining the cultural factors is important for heritage management planning purposes."}, {"section_title": "A. Selection of Environmental Variables", "text": "In Thieler and Hammar-Klose's study, they looked at six different variables: geomorphology, historic rate of shoreline erosion, coastal slope, relative sea level rise (which includes land subsidence), wave height, and tidal range Hammar-Klose 1999, 2000). In later studies by Reeder-Myers et al. (2010, the same variables were considered, although a few were excluded because they were constant across the study area. She also added the distance from the site to the shoreline and the elevation and land use of each site. I followed this approach by taking into account the historic rate of shoreline erosion, coastal slope, distance to the nearest drainage (shoreline or wetland), and the minimum elevation of each site as my environmental variables. Firstly, the historic rate of erosion for a site can be used to predict the future rate of erosion at that site. If the site has been eroding at a certain rate, without human intervention it is safe to assume that it will continue eroding either at that rate or at a higher rate. Coastal slope can be used as both a measure of the future erosion rate and the inundation potential of a site. A shallower slope of the land adjacent to the shoreline will be more vulnerable to inundation during extreme weather events, but additionally will be subject to a faster rate of shoreline retreat than an area with a steeper slope (Thieler and Hammar-Klose 1999). However, if a slope is too steep, it is in danger of being undercut by wave action, which will erode the base of the slope, causing the top of the slope to slump, which would destroy the stratigraphy of the shoreline. Looking at the variables that Reeder et al. (2010) added to Thieler and Hammar-Klose's analysis, Reeder et al. emphasize the importance of the distance to the shoreline, given that sites closer to the shore will be more at risk than those further away, regardless of elevation. However, the shoreline data that I received did not include the smaller drainages of Indian Field Creek and the wetland areas around the shoreline, so I found that the distance to the nearest wetland area was a more accurate measure of shoreline encroachment on archaeological sites. In the areas where there are not wetlands immediately adjacent to the shore, I used the distance from the site to the shoreline. In terms of elevation, I specifically used the minimum elevation of each site, rather than a mean elevation, because the area with the lowest elevation would be most at risk. However, I was limited in my evaluation by the small size of my study area. The only source of data for wave height and tidal range would have come from a NOAA tidal station located at the Yorktown Coast Guard base, in which case the values would be the same for the entire area of Indian Field Creek and thus would not affect the results in any way. Likewise, the approximate rate of relative sea level rise is 3.8 mm/yr based on the NOAA tide gauge at Gloucester Point (NOAA 2013), so the only variation that would be present in that value across the study area would come from land subsidence. In Boon et al.'s (2010) study of ten different tidal gauges across the Chesapeake Bay, land subsidence made up 50-60% of the amount of relative sea level rise, so the fact that the land is sinking is the main reason why the rate of sea level rise for the Chesapeake Bay is twice the global average (Barbosa andSilva 2009, Boon et al. 2010). I attempted to calculate the amount of land subsidence across the study area by comparing two digital elevation models (DEMs) from 1963 and 2013 in order to see how much the elevation of the study area changed over that fifty year time period. However, due to the lower resolution of the 1963 DEM (10-meter resolution as opposed to the 1-meter resolution of the 2013 LiDAR), I was unable to gather accurate results, so I was unable to consider land subsidence as a variable for my CVI. I also attempted unsuccessfully to analyze geomorphology and land use for the study area. Geomorphology can be used as a measure of the erodibility of a shoreline based on what sort of natural features each site is located on, as a sandy beach will be much more prone to erosion than a rocky one. However, my entire area is in the coastal plain, it is all part of the Shirley Formation geologically (Schweitzer 2013), and it would all classify as an estuarine setting following the USGS criteria for geomorphology in Hammar-Klose (1999, 2000) so the value for geomorphology would be constant across the site. I then tried to use a broader variable of land cover, given that wetlands would be more vulnerable than uplands and that upland areas of residential or commercial use would be more vulnerable than forested uplands. Reeder-Myers et al. (2010) also included land use as a way to determine the modern-day human impact on each site. However, the vast majority of the sites examined would be classified as forested uplands, so there was not enough variability to consider this as a separate variable."}, {"section_title": "B. Selection of Cultural Variables", "text": "For my analysis, I focused on two cultural variables: eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the area of each site. I used NRHP eligibility as a proxy for the significance of each site, assuming that the sites with the richest cultural deposits would be more likely to be eligible for the NRHP. Additionally, I took into account the size of each site on the basis that a large village site with broad temporal depth would be a greater cultural resource than a small dispersed scatter of artifacts."}, {"section_title": "C.

However, there is a broad range of variability as to which variables are weighted more heavily than others; this is entirely subjective "}, {"section_title": "VIII. Analysis and Results of Environmental Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Historic Rate of Erosion", "text": "The Shoreline Studies Program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) has already analyzed rates of shoreline erosion and accretion for the York River by comparing the shorelines on aerial imagery from 1937 and 2009. However, they did not include Indian Field Creek in their analysis (see Figure   VIII-1) because the width of the creek was smaller than their unit of analysis (Milligan et al. 2010). Therefore, I sought to replicate their analysis of historic erosion for the shorelines around Indian Field Creek.     The problem now was how to associate the rate of erosion occurring along the shorelines nearest to each archaeological site with the sites themselves. Some of the larger sites in particular encompass long stretches of shoreline with varying rates of erosion and so I thought it was important to take that into consideration in the analysis. To that end, I defined a shoreline reach polygon for each archaeological site, which I defined as the shoreline or shorelines nearest each archaeological site, which would have the most impact on that site. Some sites were given multiple shoreline reach polygons in order to better represent different shoreline conditions. The shoreline reach polygons are displayed in The values with the highest rates of erosion were assigned as vulnerability ranking of 5, with the lowest values being assigned a 1. The NSM and EPR values along with the ranking for each site and shoreline reach are shown in     Table 1. The EPR and NSM statistics for each archaeological site, along with their vulnerability ranking. The sites with multiple shoreline reaches are broken down by reach, as well as giving an average value for the entire site. Looking at the maps, it is clear that more erosion is occurring on the western shore of Indian Field Creek than the eastern shore. This could be a result of the prevailing wind direction causing more waves to break on the western shore as opposed to the eastern shore. This greater amount of wave action would cause the western shore to erode at a faster rate. Also visible are some areas where new tributaries and drainages are forming along the sides of the creek. Because these drainages did not exist in 1937, they appear as areas of massive erosion. If these drainages continue to form and erode at the same rate as they did between 1937 and 2009, they will threaten the nearby archaeological sites. This explains the high vulnerability scores for sites such as YO687, YO692, YO695, and YO829. By analyzing the historic rate of erosion that has occurred over the past 70 years, it is easier to identify which areas of Indian Field Creek are eroding faster than others and thus which archaeological sites (or parts of sites) are most threatened if the erosion rates remain constant."}, {"section_title": "B. Coastal Slope", "text": "As discussed at the beginning of this paper, coastlines with slopes at either extreme will be highly vulnerable. If the slope of the shoreline is really shallow, it can easily be inundated. Because of this, Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000) gave sites with shallow slopes a higher vulnerability ranking than those with steeper slopes. However, very steep slopes are also in danger of being undercut by wave action, which will erode the base of the bluff until it loses structural integrity and slumps downward. This scenario is considerably more common in and around my study area, so I identified steeper slopes as more vulnerable than shallower slopes. Using the Slope function found in the Spatial Analyst tools in ArcMap yielded a raster that gave a slope value between every pixel in the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the study area. While this gave an indication of where the steepest parts of the bluff were all the way around Indian Field Creek, it did not allow for quantitative comparison between sites. In order to better quantify the slope of the bluff adjacent to my selected sites, I constructed another set of transects. (The transects constructed for the shoreline change analysis could not be reused here because they were out in the water and not extending up the bluff in most instances.) I set the length of each transect to be 50 meters which captured just the main slope of the bluff and not the flat terrace at the top of the bluff and allowed the transects to be compared directly. As you can see in the slope profile in Figure VIII-8, there are steeper and less steep segments along the transect, for which the slope was calculated for each segment. ArcMap stores that information internally and then returns the minimum, maximum, and average slope along the line. Originally, I used the average slope to determine vulnerability. However, some transects had a high amount of variability which was masked by using the average. In the end, I used the maximum slope to determine vulnerability because it would be the area with the sharpest amount of change. After these statistics had been calculated for each individual transect, I analyzed the transects in terms of shoreline reaches again. I used the same shoreline reach polygons used in the historic erosion rate analysis and then calculated the maximum, minimum, and average slope values for all the transects that fell within each polygon. These values are shown in Table 2. From there, I took the maximum slope value for each shoreline reach and assigned it a vulnerability ranking between 1 and 5. The vulnerability rankings for each site, along with the individual slope transects, are shown in Figure VIII Table 2. Minimum, maximum, and average slope values for selected sites. For sites with multiple shoreline reaches, the minimum, maximum, and average of all the reaches was taken to give one value for the entire site.  "}, {"section_title": "C. Elevation", "text": "I wanted to identify the minimum elevation for each selected site. Knowing where the ground was the lowest helps to identify where the site is most at risk of inundation. I used the zonal statistics tool in ArcMap to calculate the lowest value from the digital elevation model (DEM) for each site polygon. Then I used the raster calculator to determine exactly which cell in the DEM contained the minimum value for each site and then exported that to a point feature class. I was then able to associate the points back with the selected sites which allowed me to add the elevation attributes to the site polygons. The sites were then classified based on their minimum elevation, with the lowest elevations being given the highest vulnerability ranking and the highest elevations being given the lowest vulnerability ranking. Figure VIII-11 shows the selected sites classified by vulnerability ranking as well as the lowest points for each site. Table 3 shows the minimum elevation at each site. As one might expect, the archaeological sites that are further inland along tributaries of Indian Field Creek have a higher elevation than those along the main stem of the creek. The average minimum elevation of all the sites is 3.9 meters and seven of the 27 sites have minimum elevations that are less than 1 meter; this is generally where the site polygon extends all the way down to the shoreline, such as at YO2, YO687, and YO697.  "}, {"section_title": "64", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "D. Distance to Nearest Drainage", "text": "The distance from an archaeological site to the shoreline was a critical factor for Reeder et al. (2010) because regardless of elevation above sea level, sites that are directly adjacent to the shore will be more vulnerable than those that are further inland. In the case of Indian Field Creek, several sites are further away from the creek itself, but they are directly adjacent to tidal wetlands. While these wetlands serve to disperse wave action, they are flooded intermittently following the tide cycles, and so sites located nearby will be more at risk than those that are truly located inland. Because of this, I evaluated the selected sites on their distance to the nearest wetland, and if no wetlands were present they were evaluated on the distance to the nearest shoreline.  Figure   VIII-12 illustrates these points. The distance between the site and the wetland or shoreline boundary was also calculated, as shown in Table 4. These distances were classified into five categories and given a vulnerability ranking. Closer proximity to the wetland or shoreline yielded a higher vulnerability ranking. These rankings are also shown for each site in Figure VIII   Most sites had wetlands adjacent to the majority of their shoreline reach. Only YO695 and YO697 were the only two sites whose nearest point fell on bare shoreline rather than marsh. However, a large distance of shoreline near site YO2 has a very thin margin of wetland or no wetland. It is also interesting to note that a number of the areas that have seen large amounts of historic erosion leading to the creation of new drainages have filled in with wetlands, which is an encouraging sign for the future stability of those areas."}, {"section_title": "IX.

NRHP Eligibility", "text": "One of the goals of the Phase II excavations conducted by WMCAR in 2003 was to determine the eligibility of the twelve sites they selected for the  (Blanton et al. 2005). Beyond these five sites, the remaining 22 sites were classified based on the previous WMCAR survey and the attributes in the site polygon data from 68 WMCAR (Underwood et al. 2003). 4 All 27 sites fell into one of four categories: eligible, potentially eligible, not eligible, or undetermined. Each of these categories was given a vulnerability ranking between 1 and 5. Since NRHP eligibility was used as a proxy of site significance, the sites that are eligible for the NRHP would be assumed to be the most significant sites in the study area and thus the most important to protect, so they were assigned the highest ranking of 5. Both potentially eligible and undetermined sites could become either eligible or ineligible pending further investigation, so they were assigned values in the middle of the range. Sites that were classified as potentially eligible were given a ranking of 3 and sites that were classified as undetermined were given a ranking of 2. Sites that were determined to be ineligible were given the lowest ranking of 1 because these are usually sites with low artifact density or compromised stratigraphic integrity so the amount of archaeological knowledge we can gather from them is limited. The results of this analysis can be seen in Table 5 and in Figure IX "}, {"section_title": "B. Site Area", "text": "The area of each selected site was also used as a proxy for the significance of the site. A large village site would have a more robust archaeological record and would be more important to study than a smaller site with a dispersed scatter of artifacts. Thus, sites with the largest area were ranked the highest (5) while sites with the smallest area were ranked the lowest (1). Area was calculated using the Calculate Geometry function in the attribute table in ArcMap. Area was calculated in both square meters and in hectares for each site, although the value in square meters was used to calculate the CVI rankings. The results are shown in Figure IX-2 and Table 6. The areas of the selected sites ranged from 518 square meters (44YO828) to 94,800 square meters (44YO2). Interestingly enough, 44YO2 is about twice as large as the next largest site, which is 44YO822, at 57,400 square meters. These large sites are the exceptions rather than the rule, as the average site area was 15,000 square meters.  "}, {"section_title": "X. Final Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) Calculation", "text": "After each variable was calculated individually for each selected site, the vulnerability rankings for each variable and each site were compiled. For each site, the average (arithmetic mean) of all of the rankings was calculated to produce a final overall vulnerability score for each site. This allowed the sites to be compared to each other to determine which of them were at the greatest risk. The final CVI matrix is shown in Table 7. Based on the final CVI results, sites YO693, YO2, and YO687 are the most at risk from future impacts of sea level rise and coastal erosion. YO693 is most vulnerable along the eastern side of the site where the shoreline is eroding at the highest rate. Interestingly enough, the portion of the site originally classified as YO694 is less at risk because the rate of erosion is lower immediately adjacent to that site than further north along that shoreline, as well as having a smaller area than the main YO693 polygon. YO2 is most vulnerable in the cove in the center of the 'Y' where the rate of erosion has been the highest and where the site polygon extends all the way down to the waterline. YO687 is most vulnerable on the southern edge of the site where it abuts the nearshore marsh fringe.   (Blanton et al. 2005). Field observations of this portion of the site conducted in June 2016 and July 2017 indicated downslope erosion with shell deposits being washed down the slope into the creek, as can be seen in Figure X-1. This is occurring despite the presence of trees and ground cover on the top of the bluff. In fact, several of the trees have been uprooted by past erosion, causing them to topple over and loosening the soil, which perpetuates higher rates of erosion. Possible solutions to these problems would be to shore up the bluff using natural solutions. There is a thin fringe of marsh in the cove there, but more spartina could be planted there to reinforce the marsh and make it disperse wave action more effectively. Up on top of the bluff, the dead trees could be cleared out and more shrubs could be planted to reduce the amount of downslope erosion. These strategies could help to minimize the amount of shoreline erosion occurring near this site, which would help protect the midden deposits there. Figure X-1. Field observation at YO2, July 2017. Shell deposits from the midden were being exposed and washed down the slope of the bluff to the creek. Also visible is a tree that has fallen into the creek bed. Sites YO687 and YO151 share similar vulnerability rankings because they share the same shoreline reach. However, YO151 is less at risk because it is further inland and at a higher elevation than YO687. Currently, the nearshore wetland in front of YO687 is fairly broad, which will help to minimize the amount of erosion at the site. At present, no action needs to be taken here, but it would be prudent to monitor the site conditions in the future. Future sea level rise could inundate both the marsh and the portion of the site that comes right up to the shoreline. Thinning of the marsh fringe in the future would also make the site more vulnerable to inundation and erosion. While YO151 is less vulnerable than YO687, since so little is known about YO151, it might be useful to conduct further surveys there. Beyond continuing research at YO2 and YO687, YO693 has the greatest potential for future research. It has not been studied as much at YO2 and YO687, so less is known about it. WMCAR did do a Phase II excavation there in which one test unit revealed an Early Woodland deposit. Further excavation at this site could add to our knowledge of settlement and subsistence practices during the Early Woodland period. Additionally, the shoreline along the southeast side of this site has one of the highest rates of erosion in Indian Field Creek, so it would be important to conduct research there before the site is significantly impacted by future erosion. The shoreline there should also be studied further to determine what management solutions would be most effective, since there is a sizable nearshore wetland along the shoreline, however, erosion is still occurring at a high rate. After YO693, YO2, and YO687, YO696 is ranked as the fourth most vulnerable site in the study area. This is also a large site that contained deposits from multiple prehistoric occupations spanning from the Late Archaic period through the Late Woodland period, followed by a couple of historic occupations (Underwood et al. 2003). The most threatened part of the site is the eastern side where the new drainage has been forming. Additionally, there are no wetlands surrounding the northern point of the ridge that the site is located on; however, fortunately, the historic rate of erosion in that area has been low. A fringe of shell and historic debris was found along the top of this ridge, indicating cultural deposits that would be threatened if the amount of erosion increased (Underwood et al. 2003). Since, to my knowledge, no Phase II excavations have been conducted at this site, it would be beneficial to either resurvey or conduct a Phase II excavation in order to assess the condition of the site and the potential for further research here."}, {"section_title": "XI. Conclusions and Directions for Further Research", "text": "This study has assessed the vulnerability of archaeological sites close to the shoreline of Indian Field Creek. The results indicate which sites are at greatest risk from future damage due to coastal erosion, as well as which sites have the greatest potential for future research. This will aid coastal and cultural resource managers at the Naval Weapons Station in establishing research and conservation priorities. Moreover, the Coastal Vulnerability Index framework has broad applications for any coastal region. It can be applied to a small number of sites, as shown here, or to thousands of sites along entire shorelines, as was done in Hammar-Klose's work (1999, 2000). Working with a larger study area provides a macro view of the large-scale environmental trends that are occurring, while working with a smaller number of sites, as was done here, allows for the assessment of sites on a case-by-case basis to determine the best management strategies for each one. In both cases, this type of analysis allows coastal and cultural resource managers to focus their attentions on the areas that are most vulnerable and most significant, allowing them to make efficient use of their time and resources. One flaw in the CVI framework that is worth mentioning is its dependence on the boundedness of sites. Archaeological sites are made up of loci of artifact deposits with varying amounts of artifact frequencies across each site. Thus, they do not exactly correspond to the neat polygons drawn around them to indicate their locations, which are then used in maps and GIS analysis. For instance, when a point within the site polygon is indicated as the lowest elevation at the site, there may not actually be a cultural deposit directly at that point, or it may be a lower density of artifacts than the rest of the site. This problem was alleviated at least in part by the use of shoreline reaches, which then identified the portion of the shoreline closest to the site that was most vulnerable and provided a usable result, regardless of the actual site boundary. Beyond this, there are ways that this study could be broadened and improved upon. In the context of the York River estuary, the analysis would actually benefit from a larger study area that would allow for the inclusion of variables such as tidal range and geomorphology because there would be more variability across the study area. If more accurate historic elevation data were available, it would be possible to determine the amount of change in both elevation and slope for the study area. This would make it easier to identify where the greatest amounts of land subsidence and erosion were taking place and the rate at which they were occurring. Analysis of the different types of soils in relation to historic rates of erosion would also be beneficial because then it could be predicted which soil types are most prone to erosion. Unfortunately, that was beyond the scope of this study. These suggestions would expand upon the work presented here, which provides a practical management framework for the protection of the cultural resources surrounding Indian Field Creek. Through the use of geospatial analysis to develop a Coastal Vulnerability Index, I was able to identify which sites within the study area are most threatened by future coastal erosion. I also provided suggestions for future research and management of these sites. Many of these sites contain deep deposits that provide researchers with comprehensive long-term histories of how people lived and interacted with a changing landscape. These archaeological deposits still have much to reveal about the Powhatan village at Kiskiak, in addition to 10,000 years of Native American settlement in the region before that. There is still much we can learn about how these people dwelled, utilized the natural resources around them, and 83 responded to the ever-changing coastal landscape, but only if we learn the best ways to manage that landscape ourselves."}]
