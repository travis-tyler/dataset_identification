[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Male hypogonadism can cause distressing effects, which have been treated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for more than 60 years. Many diseases or medical conditions can adversely impair the hypothalamicpituitary-testicular (HPT) axis and cause hypogonadism. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (HyperH) is caused by primary testicular failure (congenital or acquired), whereas hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HypoH) is the result of inadequate secretion of either pituitary gonadotropins or hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of hypogonadism in men, diagnosis, the benefits and risks of treatment, the options for TRT, and recent recommendations for monitoring."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence and epidemiology of hypogonadism", "text": "Age-related decreases in serum testosterone levels have been noted in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [1] found approximately 20% of men in the seventh decade of life and 30% in the eighth decade of life to have low total testosterone levels. The prevalence of a low free testosterone index, a measure of free testosterone, was approximately 40 and 60%, respectively. There is evidence that many of these men are not symptomatic, but many are [2 ] .\nProspective population-based studies reported in the past decade indicate that low testosterone levels are associated with an increase in the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and a reduction in survival [3 ,4 ,5] . The reduction in survival is best documented in a study in southern California. Sixtyeight percent of the men died over the 11.8 years of follow-up. Men in the lowest quartile of testosterone levels had a 40% higher mortality rate [hazard ratio (HR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.71] than those in the highest quartile. Low testosterone predicted increased risk of cardiovascular (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.85) and respiratory disease (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.25-4.20) mortality. Results were similar for bioavailable testosterone."}, {"section_title": "Causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism", "text": "A list of the congenital and acquired causes of HypoH and HyperH are shown in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism", "text": "Congenital idiopathic HypoH (IHypoH) is a disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by 18 years of age in conjunction with low or inappropriately normal levels of gonadotropins, low serum testosterone, and no other hypothalamic-pituitary axis abnormalities [6] . It is most commonly caused by an isolated defect in GnRH release, action, or both. Other rare, but reported, causes of congenital idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) include mutations in the b-subunit of lutinizing hormone (LH) and follicularstimulating hormone (FSH). Congenital IHH was first reported in association with anosmia by Kallman et al. [7] .\nAlthough the classic isolated GnRH deficiency (Kallmann syndrome and IHypoH) are congenital, Nachtigall et al. [8] have described a group of men with adult-onset IHypoH who had normal pubertal development and subsequently developed hypothalamic hypogonadism in adulthood, leading to infertility and sexual dysfunction. These patients are referred to as having the adult-onset or acquired form of IHypoH. Although its cause is obscure, it has been postulated to result from the delayed onset of a dominant genetic defect of GnRH secretion.\nThe major and most difficult diagnostic problem with IHypoH is distinguishing it from constitutional delay of puberty. No single test can reliably distinguish between these two disorders, but it has been suggested that, in boys with serum testosterone (testosterone) less than 50 ng/dl, a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (15 IU/kg) and a serum testosterone determined 48 h later, offers the most reliable and cost-effective test to differentiate between the two conditions [9] .\nSecondary hypogonadism also may occur in association with impaired secretion of other pituitary hormones as a result of impaired expression of transcription factors necessary for early differentiation of the pituitary during embryogenesis."}, {"section_title": "Acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism", "text": "This can be either functional or structural."}, {"section_title": "Functional", "text": "Functional forms of HypoH may be transient. Gonadal function is seriously affected in a variety of acute and chronic diseases. In most cases, the pathophysiological mechanisms are hypothalamic dysfunction in conjunction with direct gonadal involvement. Although, the hormonal changes in acute illnesses rarely are manifested clinically, they can cause severe systemic manifestations and may worsen the prognosis of chronic diseases [10] . Short-term TRT currently is considered adjunctive therapy in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels and weight loss, as well as in men receiving high doses of glucocorticoids who also have low testosterone levels [11 ] . The most prevalent functional cause of HypoH is idiopathic acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) that is seen in middle and older age men. Most of these men have an increase in LH and testosterone levels when they take the antiestrogen, clomiphene citrate. Although most of these men are obese and may have increased estradiol levels, some are not obese.\nFunctional HypoH also can be drug-induced. Chronic treatment with glucocorticoids can lead to HH [12] . Reversible suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal (HPG) axis can also be seen in athletes who use anabolic steroids; this suppression may persist for weeks to months after cessation of steroids. GnRH agonists are used routinely in men with extraprostatic prostate cancer to cause testosterone deficiency [13] ."}, {"section_title": "Structural", "text": "Structural lesions of the hypothalamus and pituitary can cause HypoH. The majority of patients with HypoH secondary tumors have multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies in addition to that of gonadotropins. A mass lesion in the pituitary or hypothalamus, however, is more likely to disrupt the secretion of gonadotropins than adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH). In children, craniopharyngioma is the most common tumor resulting in HypoH, whereas in adults, prolactinomas are the most frequent cause of HypoH. Hyperprolactinemia induces hypogonadism by inhibiting GnRH pulsatile secretion; however, in the case of macroadenomas, HypoH can be the result of local destruction of the gonadotropes. Sudden and severe hemorrhage into the pituitary (pituitary apoplexy) can result in permanent impairment of pituitary function, including hypogonadism. Infiltrative diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary region may also cause HypoH. Iron deposition in the pituitary cells is the hallmark of pituitary hemochromatosis. Gonadotropin deficiency is the most common endocrine abnormality although other pituitary hormone deficiencies may occur, but are much less common [14] . Repeated phlebotomy to remove iron may reverse the gonadotropin deficiency. Sarcoidosis and Langerhans cell histiocytosis can cause hypothalamic hypogonadism and treatment of the underlying disease may improve gonadotropin secretion. Among the underdiagnosed causes of HypoH is posthead-trauma hypopituitarism (PHTH). Benvenga et al. [15, 16] reviewed the literature from 1970 to 1998 and were able to identify 367 cases of PHTH including the first published case of posttraumatic isolated HypoH. PHTH is predominantly a medical problem of the young. Of the cell types present in the anterior pituitary, gonadotrophs seem to be the most fragile. The hormonal deficiency may be transient.\nFinally, Cranial irradiation may result in the gradual onset of hypothalamic-pituitary failure [17] . The insult is typically hypothalamic as the hypothalamus is significantly more radiosensitive than the pituitary."}, {"section_title": "Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism", "text": "The most common causes of primary HyperH are listed in Table 1 . Klinefelter syndrome represents the most common congenital cause for testicular failure. Acquired causes of testicular failure include blunt and surgical trauma, radiation, chemotherapy, infection, and autoimmune disease. Aging is associated with a gradual loss of Leydig cells, which may contribute to the ageassociated reduction in testosterone levels."}, {"section_title": "Symptoms and signs of hypogonadism", "text": "Symptoms and signs associated with hypogonadism in adults are noted in the lists below:\n(1) incomplete sexual development, eunuchoidism, aspermia; (2) reduced sexual desire (libido) and activity; (3) decreased spontaneous erections; (4) breast discomfort, gynecomastia; (5) loss of body (axillary and pubic) hair, reduced shaving; (6) very small or shrinking testes (especially <5 ml); (7) inability to father children, low or zero sperm counts; (8) height loss, low trauma fracture, low bone mineral density (BMD); (9) reduced muscle bulk and strength; (10) hot flushes, sweats.\nOther symptoms and signs associated with androgen deficiencies that are less specific than listed here:\n(1) decreased energy, motivation, initiative, aggressiveness, self-confidence;\n(2) feeling sad or blue, depressed mood, dysthymia; (3) poor concentration and memory; (4) sleep disturbance, increased sleepiness; (5) mild anemia (normochromic, normocytic, in the female range); (6) increased body fat, body mass index; (7) diminished physical or work performance.\nMany are relatively nonspecific, so this fact can make diagnosis more difficult. Furthermore, development of testosterone deficiency, like other endocrine deficiencies, often is gradual and unappreciated by the patient. Recognition of symptoms often is retrospective. It is essential that the clinicians have a high index of suspicion when they take the history. Diagnosis depends on the presence of symptoms, signs, and low testosterone levels."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory diagnosis of hypogonadism", "text": "HypoH is characterized by low levels of serum testosterone and sperm count in association with low or inappropriately normal serum FSH and LH concentrations. Laboratory measures of testosterone include total testosterone, free testosterone, and steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) [11 ] . Approximately 98% of the circulating testosterone is bound to the SHGB or albumin. The amount of bioavailable testosterone is the sum of the free testosterone and albumin bound testosterone. SHBG levels are decreased by obesity, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism and use of glucocorticoids, progestins, and androgenic steroids. SHBG levels are increased by aging, hepatic cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, use of anticonvulsants or estrogens, and HIV infection. Because changes in the SHBG can affect the total testosterone (normal range 300-1000 ng/dl), measuring the free testosterone or bioavailable testosterone may be more useful than total testosterone levels in the presence of conditions that can alter SHBG levels. Determining the calculated free or bioavailable testosterone is practical and accurate."}, {"section_title": "Potential benefits of testosterone replacement therapy", "text": "It is not known if TRT will improve life expectancy or if it will reduce risk for developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although a large clinical trial is necessary to assess the benefit-to-risk ratio, smaller trials should be able to determine if TRT can reduce risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. We do know that TRT can maintain or restore secondary sexual characteristics and libido and erectile function in younger men who do not have comorbid diseases that also can cause these problems [18, 19] . There is some evidence that TRT can increase energy and improve mood [20] . There is good evidence that TRT can improve body composition (decrease fat mass and increase lean body mass and perhaps muscle strength [21, 22] . TRT also can increase bone density, but there are no trials evaluating the effects of TRT on fractures [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] . The effect of TRT on bone seems to be independent of age and type of hypogonadism."}, {"section_title": "Potential risks of testosterone replacement therapy", "text": "The appropriateness and risks of TRT depend upon the individual's age, life circumstances, and other medical conditions [11 ] . TRT is not appropriate for men who are interested in fathering a child because exogenous testosterone will suppress the HPT axis. Prior to the age of 50, the most serious concern is possible precipitation or aggravation of sleep apnea in men who are at risk for this condition. Some men in this age group may experience gynecomastia or acne, but usually treatment can be continued. Men over age 50 are at greater risk for developing erythrocytosis and a hematocrit more than 52%. The prevalence of occult prostate cancers increases with age such that men in the seventh decade of life have a 50-60% chance of having an occult prostate cancer, and the risk increases in older men. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) of obstruction increase with age, and they could be aggravated if TRT causes the prostate to enlarge. Testosterone is anabolic, and it will cause some nitrogen, sodium and water retention. Edema may be worsened in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. Concerns that men have more cardiovascular events than women and that TRT could increase cardiovascular events have been lessened in recent years on the basis of epidemiological data, but large clinical trials are need to determine if TRT increases, decreases, or has a neutral effect on cardiovascular events."}, {"section_title": "Treatment", "text": "Androgen therapy, whether by exogenous testosterone replacement or induction of endogenous testosterone production is the mainstay of treatment for patients with hypogonadism. Treatment with testosterone alone, however, does not restore spermatogenesis and, therefore, in patients who desire fertility, induction of gonadotropin secretion with pulsatile GnRH or treatment with exogenous gonadotropins is needed [27] . GnRH administration is more effective for hypothalamic disorders, whereas administration of gonadotropins is suitable for patients with both pituitary and hypothalamic disorders.\nGnRH is administered in a pulsatile fashion by a pump and syringe that is programmed to deliver a bolus of GnRH every 2 h. The use of pulsatile GnRH therapy for the induction of spermatogenesis is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in the United States and is confined to specialist.\nA conventional gonadotropin regimen for induction of spermatogenesis consists of hCG in combination with FSH, both of which can be administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Due to its structural homology to LH, purified hCG is an effective substitute for LH and stimulates the Leydig cells to synthesize and secrete testosterone. Both urinary and recombinant hCG preparations are available. FSH has traditionally been administered in the form of human menopausal gonadotropins (hMGs). Recombinant FSH (r-FSH) is now available but is less well studied in men. Therapy is typically initiated with hCG alone and the dose is titrated based on trough testosterone levels and testicular growth, thus, it is noteworthy that in the majority of patients with large testes at baseline, spermatogenesis might be initiated with hCG alone due to residual FSH secretion. Once there is a plateau in the response to hCG, FSH should be added. Gonadotropin treatment results in the appearance of sperm in the ejaculate in up to 90% of cases, but often not to normal sperm counts [28] . When the number of sperm is subnormal, pregnancy can be achieved normally or with the help of an assisted reproductive technique. Gynecomastia is the most common side effect of gonadotropin therapy. It can be explained by the excessive secretion of estrogen in response to hCG stimulation of the Leydig cells.\nMultiple delivery systems have been developed for administration of testosterone (Table 2) [11 ] . Testosterone is metabolized by the liver on the first pass when it is administered orally. In an attempt to prevent first-pass hepatic metabolism, chemists modified testosterone by adding a 17a-alkyl group; however, both 17a-methyltestosterone and halotestin can cause liver toxicity when given in replacement doses required for men. Testosterone has been added to a bioadherent material that attaches to the gum. Hydration of the tablet causes testosterone to be released into the oral cavity where it is absorbed through the buccal mucosa into the system circulation. Addition of an ester group in the b-position at C17 provided an effective means for making testosterone soluble in oil. When testosterone undecanoate in oil is given orally, it is absorbed into the intestinal lymphatics and then into the systemic circulation. Serum half-life is limited with this delivery system, so it must be administered at least twice a day. Parenteral administration of a testosterone ester (cypionate or enanthate) provided the most reliable and safest means for delivering testosterone until recently. In the last decade intramuscular administration of testosterone undecanoate in oil has been shown to provide stable blood levels within the normal range over much longer periods than can be achieved with other injectable esters. Stable, therapeutic blood levels also can be achieved with testosterone pellets, but administration requires an incision and a trochar. Testosterone pellets have not been very popular. Transdermal delivery systems, initially patches, and more recently gels and creams, have become very popular. The patch or gel must be applied daily. Patches can cause skin irritation and only provide serum levels in the low normal range, whereas the gels can be titrated to achieve the desired blood level in most patients. It is difficult, however, to achieve mid-normal (400-600 ng/dl) serum levels in some patients. Each of these delivery systems has advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to determine the patient's preferences and then to monitor serum levels to determine if they are in the therapeutic range."}, {"section_title": "Monitoring treatment", "text": "Patients and physicians must be committed to monitoring the effects of testosterone therapy. The guidelines endorsed by the Endocrine Society for monitoring of men receiving TRT are shown in the list below [11 ] .\n(1) Evaluate the patient 3 and 6 months after treatment starts and then annually to assess whether symptoms have responded to treatment and whether the patient is suffering from any adverse effects. (2) Monitor testosterone levels 2 or 3 months after initiation of testosterone therapy. (3) Check hematocrit at baseline, at 3 and 6 months, and then annually. If hematocrit is more than 54%, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to a safe level; evaluate the patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea; reinitiate therapy with a reduced dose. (4) Measure BMD of lumbar spine and/or femoral neck at baseline every 1-2 years of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with osteoporosis or low trauma fracture. (5) Perform digital rectal examination and check prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before initiating treatment, at 3 months, and then in accordance with guidelines for prostate cancer screening, depending on the age and race of the patient. (6) Obtain urological consultation if there is (a) verified serum PSA concentration more than 4.0 ng/ml; (b) an increase in serum PSA concentration more than 1.4 ng/ml within any 12-month period of testosterone treatment; (c) a PSA velocity of more than 0.4 ng/ml/year using the PSA level after 6 months of testosterone administration as the reference (only applicable if PSA data are available for a period exceeding 2 years); (d) detection of a prostatic abnormality on digital rectal examination; (e) an American Urological Association (AUA) or International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) prostate symptom score of more than 19.\nMonitoring for efficacy is indicated at all ages. In sexually immature males, one must initiate treatment to achieve maximum height and sexual maturation. Monitoring for safety is critical in men who are 50 years of age and older and beginning at age 40 or 45 in African-Americans and those with a first-degree relative who has had prostate cancer. Efficacy of testosterone therapy is dependent upon achieving adequate serum levels of testosterone. The time at which blood is collected for measuring testosterone depends upon the delivery system. Usually, we choose times when serum levels should be in the midnormal range. Dose adjustments are indicated when desired serum levels are not achieved. Assessment of testosterone-induced changes in symptoms and signs is important. Usually, this is done at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually. Monitoring for safety also usually is done at these time intervals. In younger men acne, breast tenderness, and gynecomastia are more likely. Usually, the acne can be managed with better hygienic measures and insuring that the serum levels of testosterone are not excessive. Middle-aged and older men are at greater risk for erythrocytosis and sleep apnea. One must be concerned that testosterone treatment can increase prostate volume and may increase LUTS of obstruction. It also is possible that TRT may cause an occult prostate cancer to become clinically apparent, so assessment of the prostate by digital rectal examination and by measurement of PSA is essential in this age group.\nIn addition to the potential adverse effects of testosterone treatment there are formulation-specific adverse effects, which should be discussed with the patient prior to initiating therapy. These factors must be considered when monitoring treatment. Injectable testosterone cypionate/enanthate can be associated with fluctuations in mood/and or libido. Erythrocytosis also is more likely with this treatment, especially in older men. The duration of each treatment cycle should be considered when older middle-aged and older men are treated with either testosterone undecanoate or testosterone pellets. The buccal tablets can cause alterations in taste and irritation of gums. Transdermal patches frequently cause some skin irritation at the application site. Topical gels dry quickly, but they leave a residue of testosterone on the skin that can be transferred to a child or female by skin-to-skin contact. The application site should be covered with a T-shirt, and the site should be washed with soap and water prior to skin-to-skin contact."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "TRT is the mainstay of treatment for men with hypogonadism unless a person desires to father a child. Testosterone can be administered orally, parenterally, or transdermally in the form of a patch or gel. TRT can have positive effects on sexual function, mood, body composition, muscle mass, and bone density. Monitoring the efficacy of TRT is indicated at all ages, and monitoring for safety is critical in middle-aged and older men. A large clinical trial is needed to assess the longterm benefit-to-risk ratio of TRT, especially in older men. In a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis, Ding et al. found that high testosterone levels were associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus among men. The authors highlighted the importance of conducting a large prospective study to further clarify the clinical predictive role of endogenous sex hormone levels in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus."}, {"section_title": "References and recommended reading", "text": ""}]
