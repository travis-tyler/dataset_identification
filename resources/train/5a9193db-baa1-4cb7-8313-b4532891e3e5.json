Chapter 3, in part is currently being prepared for submission for publication of the material. Oceanographic, acoustic and remote approaches reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of blackfin snapper at an aggregation site in Palau. Marine Ecological Progress Series, doi: 10.3354/meps12651. Schramek, T. A.,  Coastal processes around islands encompass dynamics on a range of scales with physics that can differ from typical continental shelves due to steeper bathymetry, potentially allowing the surrounding basin waters to 'communicate' quickly to the shoreline. This thesis work advances our understanding about these interactions, using a unique set of nearshore oceanographic xx observations from around the island group encompassed by the Republic of Palau in the tropical western Pacific. The influence of large scale and climatic variability on nearshore island environments can be seen through an empirical model of fore reef temperature structure based on SST and sea level anomaly (SLA) made from nearly two decades of temperature observations (2-90m depth) from three stations around Palau. SLA complements SST by providing a proxy for vertical isotherm displacements driven by local and remote winds on intraseasonal to interannual time scales. Thermal stress on coral ecosystems can now be forecast into the mesophotic zone using this means of predicting subsurface temperatures which are easily accessible for the tropical Pacific. Baroclinic variability around islands has multiple drivers on a range of time scales. Observations of temperature and currents from around the main island group of Palau exhibit a persistent presence of baroclinic coastally trapped waves and internal tides. The largest amplitude signals of coastally trapped waves in fore reef temperature were concurrent with the passage of Typhoon Haiyan, which crossed the northern most Palauan islands in November of 2013. The subinertial signals present after Typhoon Haiyan were tracked propagating around the island group for upwards of a week after the typhoon passed. Internal tides were also deemed to be present, but with varying amplitude and phase modulating in and out of phase with the local surface tide. Surface currents impinging upon Palau have a direct impact on the local sea level field around the island group. An array of nearshore pressure gauges, in depths of 20-28 m, encircling the island group and a high resolution (1/120\u00b0 x 1/120\u00b0) regional circulation model are used to examine the space-time characteristics of the flow in a channel in the southern extent of Palau in comparison to the large-scale currents near the island group. A balance between the along-channel pressure difference and bottom friction in the channel was inferred based on the current and xxi pressure observations and the high-resolution model simulations. A drag coefficient for the channel, computed using in situ observations, is O(10 -3 -10 -4 ). Variations in large-scale zonal currents correlate with the pressure difference across the channel as well as the along-channel flow. The model simulations indicate that as the large-scale flow impinges on the island group, topographic blocking results in a pressure difference on either side of the island which causes a pressure gradient along the channel. The fore reef waters of Palau are shown to be influenced by a range of dynamics across all spatial and temporal scales of our observations. There is an apparent omnipresence of both internal tides and coastally trapped waves throughout the observational window which provide a regular cycling of temperature at depth. These waves have their largest effects at the thermocline, the depth of which can be estimated in this region using only surface variables, as described above. Together, our assessments of these dynamics provide an enhanced perspective on the potential for thermal conditioning of benthic communities living on the outer reef slopes and an advanced perspective of how the large-scale oceanographic field translates to the fore reef environment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Islands in the open ocean typically lack shelves and are characterized by steep bathymetric slopes, resulting in a connection of the high seas to vibrant coastal ecosystems on their coastlines. Offshore oceanographic fields can translate directly to shore due to these rapid shifts from deep to shallow water. The mean oceanographic fields in the Tropical Pacific, a region home to hundreds of islands, has a predominantly zonal structure (Talley, 2011). Equatorial winds, which include the trades, drive zonal flows across the Pacific basin. Seasonal patterns in wind fields vary across the tropics, with a large monsoonal influence present in the western Pacific . Temporal variability in this region is dominated by signals at the interannual time scale, such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Ando & Hasegawa, 2009). Meridional variability in these interannual signals (Widlansky et al., 2014) drive varied responses on island fore reefs residing on opposing sides of the equator. On shorter time scales, typhoons play an active role in the region (D'Asaro et al., 2011) having substantial impact on island communities throughout. High intensity winds from the typhoons drive the generation of surface gravity waves (Charnock, 1955) compounding the effects of storm surge (Marks et al., 1998), intensifying shoreline change (Darwin, 1842;Ford & Kench, 2014) and shallow water ecosystem damage (Ogg & Koslow, 1978;Stephenson et al., 1958). The surface wave field generated by tropical systems propagate from the immediate vicinity of the storm system in the form of swell, allowing them to influence regions far from the storm. Additionally, both cold wakes (Shay et al., 1992) and coastally trapped waves (Merrifield, 2002) can be lasting signatures of these large atmospheric forcing events. Observational physical oceanography around islands in the Tropical Pacific has a rich history, likely starting with the stick maps of the seafaring communities living in the Marshall Islands, first documented by Gulick (1862) as in existence in the 1200s. The charts were used to 2 plot how islands refracted surface wave fields, useful for maritime navigation when islands were out of sight (Genz et al., 2009). During World War II, Harold Sverdrup (1944), director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, played a critical role in developing wind and current maps of the Pacific for purposes of aiding downed aviators surviving in life rafts. These wind maps (and estimates of geostrophic currents) were based on large-scale barometric pressure observations. The role of remote and local wind forcing in driving variability in the fore reef oceanographic structure and lagoon flushing around islands and atoll systems were studied in the period after World War II (Munk & Sargent, 1948). Theoretical assessments of trapping of the large-scale ocean waves were later developed  and eventually tested in the case of Bermuda in the Atlantic  and Hawaii in the Pacific (Merrifield, 2002;Munger & Cheung, 2008). Jarvis Island in the South Pacific allowed for a case study of what could be inferred about the large-scale currents impinging on an island through in situ observations of pressure offshore of an island's fore reefs . The biological implications of this flow field was assessed to better understand drivers of local ecological variability . Islands have been shown to be centers of upper ocean productivity in the open sea (Caldeira et al., 2002;Doty & Oguri, 1956;Gilmartin & Revelante, 1974;J. M. Gove et al., 2016). There are biological implications of spatial gradients in the oceanographic environment, which can span across island groups or down to the scale of an individual island fore reef system. Meridional differences in oceanographic fields exist across the Line Islands, which straddle the equator, resulting in varied amounts of primary production on the fore reefs across this island group. Variations in primary production, food availability, and depth on a fore reefs drive trophic selection for coral species (Fox et al., 2018), connecting variability of the larger oceanographic environment to the ecosystem community scale. Furthermore, variability of oceanographic properties across a single island group can drive spatial differences in community structure (J. Gove et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2013). The island nation of Palau rises up from the Palauan Trench and sits at the western end of the Caroline Islands in the tropical western Pacific. This island group is home to some of the most diverse and unique coral ecosystems in the world . Palau is located at the mean latitude of the transition between two large zonal surface currents: the North Equatorial Current (NEC) to the north, flowing east-to-west, and the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) to the south, flowing west-to-east . Both of these current systems have seasonal and interannual variability linked to ENSO Qiu & Joyce, 1992;Zhao et al., 2013). A highly active internal wave field has been observed on Palau's fore reefs , generated both locally and remotely. Assessments have been made of the biological communities in Palau  including the impacts of large thermal stress events on local corals , and work has been done to connect studies of nearshore biological activity to the physical oceanographic drivers (Cimino et al., 2018;. This island group serves as an ideal platform to study how the interaction of the synoptic ocean conditions with the nearshore environment, with attention paid to the resulting ocean habitat changes of the local marine ecosystems. Just as nearshore environments around islands are influenced by the state of the offshore conditions, there is feedback from the shoreline to the synoptic field. To what degree this coupling is one-or two-way is still to be determined. Global operational ocean models are typically too coarse to resolve steep topographic features such as islands, where individual islands or even whole island groups are too small to be resolved by the model grid. The influence of these sub-grid-scale topographic features on the temporally-evolving ocean state are often parameterized, intending to accurately characterize the interaction of the flow encountering the abrupt topography. Nearshore observations from islands groups such as Palau can help to identify how sub-grid-scale shoreline processes are related to open ocean dynamics, providing a means to assess the accuracy of these parametrizations. This dissertation assesses how offshore oceanographic and atmospheric influence drive dissertation. An ocean circulation model run at a 1/120\u00b0 x 1/120\u00b0 resolution by FLEAT collaborators at the University of Alaska -Fairbanks (PALAU_120B) was used in support of the observations. Chapter 1 describes the relationship between sea level and fore reef temperature structure from the surface down to the mesophotic zone, between 30 and 150 m depth, and an application using this method to predict thermal stress metrics for coral ecosystems in this depth range. Chapter 2 assesses coastally trapped waves generated by Typhoon Haiyan, which passed over Palau in November of 2013. Chapter 3 investigates the force balance of subtidal flows in a channel at the southern end of the main island group of Palau and relates them to the regional 5 oceanographic fields. Chapter 4 studies tidal currents in that same channel, attempting to determine the influence of the surface and internal tides as well as other variability.\nThermal stress is a major driver of coral bleaching, which threatens coral reefs around the world (Hughes et al., 2018;Langlais et al., 2017). Climate change and warming oceans adversely impact coral communities (Hughes et al., 2018;Wellington et al., 2001), and with no indication of immediate relief (Donner, 2009;Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999;Langlais et al., 2017), marine ecosystems  and the social and economic systems dependent on them (Bridge et al., 2013, p. 201) are threatened. Sea surface temperature (SST) is the principal ocean parameter used to predict coral bleaching (Gleeson & Strong, 1995;Liu et al., 2006Liu et al., , 2014Strong et al., 2004) and to derive metrics quantifying thermal stress in surface waters, such as Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) (Strong et al., 2004). The depth/temporal variability of thermal regimes on reef systems has been understudied leading to a lack of understanding of thermal stress on corals through the extent of their depth range. Deeper reef waters in the mesophotic zone Kahng et al., 2010;Lesser et al., 2009), between 30-150 m, have been hypothesized to possibly provide refuge for coral reefs in the future (Bongaerts et al., 2017;Bridge et al., 2014;Neal et al., 2014;Riegl & Piller, 2003;Shlesinger et al., 2018), but have recently been shown to be ecologically distinct (Rocha et al., 2018). These factors motivate the need for new methods to assess coral stressors at each depth zone independently. Warm conditions that may lead to thermal stress and coral bleaching currently are forecast using SST values derived from satellite observations (Scott F. Heron et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2014;McClanahan et al., 2007). Elevated SSTs have been shown to be predictive of coral bleaching for shallow fore-reef corals (Couch et al., 2017;Eakin et al., 2010;Glynn & D'croz, 1990;Liu et al., 2014;McClanahan et al., 2007). At the same time, quantifying accurate bleaching thresholds for corals between 10-30 m has been limited and assessments of thermal stress on mesophotic coral reefs have only been done in a few studies Nir et al., 2014). This is primarily due to the lack of sustained temperature records at depths > 10-30 m and inconsistent surveying of bleaching events at depths exceeding 20 m (Bak et al., 2005). Depth has been recently shown to be a relevant parameter is assessing coral bleaching (Couch et al., 2017, p. 200;Safaie et al., 2018), but in the context of other environmental and ecological factors. We propose that the vertical dimension, something not captured in SST measurements, is critical when developing indicators of thermal stress as temperature variance is observed to increase closer to the thermocline (Bak et al., 2005;. Sea level anomaly (SLA) is a relevant observation that facilitates the prediction of temperatures starting at depths of 20-30 m, typically below the upper mixed layer (UML), for which SST is a poor proxy. A major part of the coral biomass exists below the base of the UML, denoted as the mixed layer depth (MLD), in the tropical Pacific (Bridge et al., 2013). The depth of isotherms below the MLD and SLA have been shown to be related in the tropical Pacific (Chaen & Wyrtki, 1981;Rebert et al., 1985), but the impact of isotherm displacements on the thermal structure at a tropical fore-reef system has not been documented on the time scales considered here due to a lack of in-situ observations. The Republic of Palau, an island nation in the tropical western Pacific (Figure 1.S1.a), has a high diversity of marine habitats with exceptional coral reefs . Coral bleaching events have occurred in Palau with the largest on record concurrent with the 1998 La Ni\u00f1a  with a lesser bleaching event on Palau's lagoons/outer slopes in (van Woesik et al., 2012. Bleaching in the mesophotic zone during the 1998 event was qualitatively observed down to 60 m   (Reynolds et al., 2007). Daily averages were obtained on a 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 global grid. Daily tide gauge records were obtained from the Malakal Harbor station for 1970 through 2017 from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/) . Regional sea level was specified using the global ocean gridded sea level anomaly L4 output, 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 resolution, from Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) (marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/). NCEP surface wind records (Kalnay et al., 1996) on a 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 global grid from 2000 to 2017 were obtained (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html).\nThe physical framework for understanding Coastally Trapped Waves (CTWs) has advanced from simplified straight coast geometries to regions with complex bathymetry and curved coastlines. CTWs propagate with the coast to the right (left) in the Northern (Southern) hemisphere, rotating around basins in a cyclonic direction, and around islands in an anti-cyclonic direction(K H Brink, 1991). The special case of CTWs around islands was first approached with theory from , 1969 followed by observational studies conducted around Bermuda by  and Brink (1999) . Substantial effort has been focused on determining the physics of CTWs along the continental shelf (K H Brink, 1991;Buchwald & Adams, 1968;D C Chapman, 1983;John M Huthnance, 1975, 1978L A Mysak, 1980). Extension of the theory to regions with nearshore trenches such as Japan and Peru has brought insight to regional conditions with steeper topographies or with small, opposing trench walls (Lawrence A Mysak et al., 1979). Narrow shelves have been approached as quasi-vertical walls and are dominated by Kelvin wavelike structure (J M Huthnance et al., 1986;Wang & Mooers, 1976). Semi-analytical models now exist that are capable of determining modal structure due to the influence of Coriolis, topography, and stratification while being able to account for curved coastlines of islands by employing radial geometries (K H Brink, 1999;Brink & Chapman, 1985). The slope of an island's bottom topography creates a semi-geostrophic balance where horizontal motions are constrained causing vertical displacements (K H Brink, 1991). Due to this, CTWs around islands should be clear in observations of water temperature along the coastline while the nearshore current response will be subdued in comparison to the offshore response maintaining the semi-geostrophic balance (K H Brink, 1991;). There are a number of parameters that define the wave-guide which control the existence and type of CTW in a region. Static properties include the local topography and coastline shape as well as the latitude band. Typical continental shelf topographic profiles are shallow for an extended distance offshore with an abrupt steepening, called the shelf break. This shape is often modeled as an exponentially decaying offshore profile ending in a flat bottom ocean (Buchwald & Adams, 1968). Stratification and along-coast flow control the time-varying properties of the wave-guide. For example, the depth of the thermocline and where it interacts with the local offshore bathymetric profile can dictate the wave type. Changes in the properties of the wave-guide, such as pycnocline depth, can dictate the wave types that are present. If the pycnocline consists of a sharp gradient and is deeper than the shelf break the major response in deep water will be equivalent to the motion along a steep wall and show characteristics of internal Kelvin waves (J M Huthnance et al., 1986;Wang & Mooers, 1976). Shelf or edge waves can be present in the shallow region of the shelf when the pycnocline is above the shelf break (David C Chapman, 1984). Variations in along-coast profiles, especially headlands, cause dissipation due to interaction between modes and radiation away from the land mass (Wilkin & Chapman, 1990). Forcing of CTWs can be done by a variety of atmospheric and oceanographic phenomenon such as along-coast wind stress events (K H Brink, 1991) and equatorial Rossby or Kelvin waves radiating up the coast (Suginohara, 1981). While studies have examined typhoon-generated CTWs along continental shelves (Dukhovskoy et al., 2009;Kakinuma & Nakayama, 2007;Zamudio et al., 2002), there are few observations of these events around islands and those that do exist (Kakinuma & Nakayama, 2007) do not capture CTWs propagating around islands. The physical oceanographic environment of the outer-reef slope around Palau has gone largely uncharacterized outside of one study (Wolanski et al., 2012). The purpose of this study is to better understand a driver of temperature cycling for the benthic slope communities of Palau and the influence of tropical systems on the nearshore oceanographic environments around an island group. Here, we assess the CTW activity along the barrier reef of Palau's main island group, with the aim to characterize both their generation and propagation using an observational array deployed around the barrier reef. The main island group of Palau is a single island shelf with steep barrier and fringing reefs around its perimeter . The Palau Trench sits directly off of the east coast of Palau and has depths exceeding 8000 m (Figure 2.1) while other coasts have depths of a few thousand m within 5-10 km of the reef. The meridional length scale of the main island group is ~160 km, if Velasco Reef in the north is considered, and has a total circumference along the fore-reef of ~350 km. The atmospheric conditions around Palau are dominated by the southwesterly monsoon through the summer and fall and the trade winds in the winter and spring . previous observations showed a large amount of variance and it is feasible for suitably equipped and trained diver deployments . A Scripps Institution of Oceanographybuilt meteorological station configured with a Vaisala WXT520 (Vantaa, Finland) weather sensor was stationed on a small island on the western barrier reef (Figure 2.1). The collected data are reported hourly to the Coastal Research and Development Center at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography using Iridium.\nIslands in the tropical Pacific typically have narrow coastal zones (~1 km) compared to continental margins. These narrow strips of nearshore waters around islands therefore are in close proximity, O(10) km, to deep water flow fields, but are not often examined with them in mind. Flows near islands are known to be driven by the local surface tide (Ulloa et al., 2018), internal waves (Smith et al., 2016), local winds (Lowe & Falter, 2015), coastally trapped waves (Chapter 2 of this dissertation), as well as surface wave driven setup (Becker et al., 2014) and alongshore pressure gradients (Ruessink et al., 2001). The influence of regional-scale, deep ocean flow fields in the nearshore of islands has not been widely reported, although Jarvis Island, in the direct path of strong equatorial flow, features strong pressure perturbations on the upstream and downstream side of the island . Islands can influence regional large-scale geostrophic flows through wakes and standing eddies (Dong et al., 2007), lee waves (Nikurashin & Ferrari, 2011), and internal tides , as well as other processes leading to energy dissipation (Leichter et al., 2012). The energy dissipation and conversion driven by steep ocean topography influence the spatial structure of mixing in the world's oceans . To answer these questions the momentum equations are scaled for the channel setting to estimate the order of magnitude of each term (3.3.1). The pressure field at the southern extent of Palau is compared to the channel flow, and, the along-channel pressure gradient is estimated to understand the frictional balance of the channel (3.3.2). A high resolution (1/120\u00b0 x 1/120\u00b0) regional model is used to examine flow interaction with the island for comparison with the results obtained from the observations (3.3.3). In addition, the pressure difference and channel flow will be compared to geostrophic flows in the vicinity of Palau and local HF radar observations of surface currents to understand the extent of flows that may drive the channel flow (3.3.4). Finally, the force balance in the channel is used to estimate a bottom drag coefficient, (3.3.5). A conclusion and discussion follow (3.4)."}, {"section_title": "Filtering and the Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index", "text": "Weekly averages were constructed for all data records to examine sub-inertial variability.

DHW is the sum of thermal anomalies (Hotspots) that exceed a prescribed threshold accumulated during a 12-week running window (Strong et al., 2004). Coral bleaching is known to occur when SSTs exceed 1\u00b0C above the maximum monthly mean (MMM) temperature (Glynn & D'croz, 1990); hence MMM+1\u00b0C is the typical threshold used for the DHW calculation, or the bleaching threshold (Berkelmans & Willis, 1999). To evaluate the potential thermal stress at depth, we considered three measures of DHW. The first is the traditional method based on when SST exceeds the bleaching threshold, which is computed using MMM at the sea surface, at z = 0, determined from SST, The second uses in-situ temperature at each depth from the MLR reconstructions, with the bleaching threshold determined from SST, This method assumes that thermal stress tolerances appropriate for the sea surface applies at all depths. Lastly, we adjust the bleaching threshold with depth to account for changes in the mean and variable temperature through the water column.

During La Ni\u00f1a conditions, the mixed layer is deep (greater than 35 m) with a weaker temperature gradient in the thermocline than during neutral ENSO phases . During El Ni\u00f1os, the mixed layer is shallow (15 m) with weak temperature gradients to ~35 m depth, and strong gradients below ~35 m. In general, as sea level rises/falls, the thermocline deepens/shoals, with UML temperatures tracking SST.  van Woesik et al., 2012) while minor bleaching occurred during 2014 and 2016 in shallow corals (Colin, personal observation, Text S1). Using the bleaching threshold based on SST, the DHW estimate shows that the warming events at the surface penetrate to 30 m or so, largely reflecting the isothermal conditions in the UML (Figure 1.4.b). Using the scaled bleaching threshold, we find elevated DHW vales extending deeper in the water column to ~50 m, such as during the 1998 La Ni\u00f1a event ( Figure 1.4.c). The scaled bleaching thus increases the estimated thermal stress compared to the standard DHW estimate based on only SST ( Figure   1.4.c).\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Discussion", "text": "In summary, A unique set of long-term, in-situ temperature records from Palau provide an opportunity to derive a new empirical model of upper-ocean temperature variability at fore-reefs using SST and SLA time series. We hypothesize that this relationship could persist throughout the tropical Pacific where the thermocline depth is largely dependent on large scale wind driven flows (Widlansky et al., 2014), and SLA has already been shown to be an indicator of the 20\u00b0C isotherm depth (Rebert et al., 1985). This concept has been used to derive synthetic temperature profiles in the Atlantic based on satellite altimeter data (Carnes et al., 1990), and temperature and salinity profiles in large scale ocean models (Fox et al., 2002), adding credence to the hypothesis. We caution that the method does not account for salinity effects, and in particular upper ocean thermal structures associated with barrier layers, which are salinity driven temperature inversions in the tropical western Pacific (Bosc Christelle et al., 2009;Lukas & Lindstrom, 1991). When barrier layers are prevalent, SLA may not always accurately predict the temperature structure. We conclude that DHW estimates based only on SST may not adequately account for prolonged warming at depth associated with high sea levels and downward thermocline displacements. We have attempted to adjust the bleaching condition with depth to account for observed temperature variations with depth; however further studies are needed to confirm that the depth-dependent bleaching threshold matches observed bleaching events below the upper mixed layer where multiple stressors may also play a role in bleaching (Harborne et al., 2017). As a case in point, coral bleaching in Palau was observed at 60 m depth during the 2010 warm event; however, our DHW estimates only show heightened thermal stress to about 30 m, even with the adjusted bleaching condition. Nevertheless, our findings highlight that mesophotic coral reefs are vulnerable to thermal stress and that these depth zones may not be a refugia. High temporal resolution and long duration observations of temperature on Palau's forereef system provide insight into the depth variable structure of thermal stress, leading to a new variance-based approach for predicting thermal stress. Our methods here provide a new means of assessing thermal stress due to the depth dependent nature of temperature variance seen throughout the range of depths where corals exist in this tropical Pacific location.      . This matches the record of DHW supplied by CRW (not shown). b. DHW was computed for the temperature reconstructions between 0 and 90 m, which shows the temporal evolution of the depth variable thermal stress present through the records. DHWs were computed using the MMM supplied for CRW based off of the CoralTemp SST. DHW calculations for (a) and (b) use a bleaching thershold of 1\u00b0C. c. DHWs is shown between 0 and 90 m for the temperature records using the MMM computed for the temperature record at that depth. The bleaching threshold is now the standard deviation of the temperature time series at that depth multiplied by 1\u00b0C over the standard deviation of the SST. This give a proportional variance threshold, which the temperatures would have to exceed to be deemed a thermal stress. All relevant parameters for this figure are in Table 1.S2.\nOur results from data collected during our observation period, May through December 2013, indicate that the observed baroclinic CTWs are a feature of the background. These baroclinic CTWs were detected with an array of thermographs located near the 57 m and 90 m isobath after filtering out both the diurnal variability and signals with periods greater than 20 days. Time-lagged cross-correlation of temperature records at different observational sites were used to estimate apparent propagation speeds that showed spatial variability, but were all within a range of 1 m/s (Table 2.2). Results were similar between the Godin and band-pass filtering methods. The forcing of the background state was not determined, i.e. if waves were locally wind-forced or remotelygenerated features. These estimates were limited in quality by the strength of the signal, particularly for the distant stations. Typhoon Haiyan provided a large, broadband atmospheric forcing to the local water around Palau. Due to the track location and intensity of the storm, reported by the JTWC, Typhoon Haiyan likely produced a significant along-shore wind pulse in the vicinity of the northeast coast of Palau before passing Kyangel Atoll (Figure 2.1). Measurements of nearshore currents on the East coast showed a broad near-inertial response that persisted for one month after the event (Figure 2.7). A sub-inertial propagating coastally-trapped baroclinic wave was recorded in the temperature data around Palau at both 57 m and 90 m (Figure 2.9). The large value of the stratification parameter and a lack of corresponding water level perturbations supports this being a dominantly baroclinic response. The wave's frequency was near to sub-inertial as supported by rotary spectra. The results of the time-lagged cross-correlation estimated apparent propagation speeds of the CTWs to be 0.85 \u00b1 0.23 m/s (Table 2.2). We hypothesize that the large intensity along-shore wind burst along the northeast coast of Palau was the generation mechanism for the CTWs seen in the temperature records upwards of a week after Typhoon Haiyan impacted the area. This generation mechanism was described by (Thomson, 1970). Capture of these propagating waves, which over went a full 180 degree heading change as the propagated around Palau, proved to be a unique set of observations. Remarkably, these waves drove large temperature fluctuations at locations over 240 km along-coast from their generation site after propagating through multiple deep channels and passed headlands. The CTWs observed around Palau help to increase the variation and rapidity of the previously documented  temperatures impacting benthic slope communities. During El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral conditions, there is almost certainly moderate cycling of sub thermocline water to shallow depths (less than 60 m) on outer reef slopes , which is beneficial for corals that occur in this section of the reef slope. During La Nina periods, however, the thermoclines are too deep (100 m or more for sub 20 o C water) for CTWs to bring cold, sub-thermocline waters onto reefs to provide relief from heat stress inducing coral bleaching. During El Nino's the opposite occurs and the thermocline moves to shallower depths and CTWs can bring water of sufficiently low temperature to induce \"cold water bleaching\"  to deeper corals (40-75 m depth). Our two semi-analytical models provide phase speed solutions that are comparable with the observed phase speeds. These models are intended to provide insight into the role of static and temporally varying properties of the nearshore region that regulate wave-guide physics. However, the results and model structure output should be interpreted with caution, as they do not contain the range of ocean scales and dynamics that exist in nature (e. g. bathymetric variation, ocean state variability). Mode-1 phase speeds computed with the vertical structure equation, 2.81 m/s, are a factor of 2-3 faster than the observed phase speeds, and the Mode-2 through Mode-9 results, ranging between 1.83 m/s and 0.37 m/s, are on the order of the observations. The CTWs found by BC85, with phase speeds between 0.07 m/s and 0.40 m/s, are slower than the observed propagation speeds and the lower mode results just noted from the VSE. With the steepness of the offshore topographic profiles in the vicinity of Palau and the dominant role of stratification these waves fit with the theory of coastally trapped internal Kelvin waves along a vertical wall. For \u03c9 < and S >> 1, (J M Huthnance et al., 1986)] defined this to be the likely propagating wave type. Differences may be due to inhomogeneity in alongshore bathymetry and oversimplified modeling. More advanced numerical modeling could provide insight in to the wave-guide's alongcoast variability and offshore structure. We expect the headlands and variations in coastal morphology cause modal interactions that could not be examined without a more spatially dense array of instrumentation that would not be feasible to maintain without large cost. Simulations of the changing oceanographic environment would allow for a data-rich test bed to probe for these characteristics.\nOur The assumed was readdressed by comparing the observed pressure and friction terms of the x-momentum equation. This results in a lower than initially assumed and lower than what would be required for pressure and friction to be the only dominant terms. Using the factor of two drop in pressure as seen in PALAU_120B from the near observation points to the channel would lead to a smaller , but still on the order of 10 \u22124 . We estimate a drag coefficient assuming that bottom friction balances the pressure gradient, but other acceleration terms likely are important as the flow moves in to a smaller cross-sectional area between islands. PALAU_120B also has a = 0.0025~10 3 , a factor of 2-5 higher than what was observed. The lower observed could be due to their being depth of ~500 m to the north and south of Hydrographers Bank in the channel, limiting bottom drag at the depth of the observed flow. The time lag of ~7 hours between the pressure and drag terms as seen in PALAU_120B suggests that the acceleration terms likely play a role as the pressure gradient-bottom friction balance builds to an equilibrium state. More generally, island topography alters impinging deep ocean flows by establishing anomalies in local sea level across the island. The model simulations suggest that the blocking effect alters the pressure field 5-10 km offshore (Figure 3.8a,c,d) which may have an associated influence on boundary currents (Figure 3.8a). The downstream impacts of the flow-topography interaction are captured by the HF radar surface currents, which show that the relationship between the channel flow and the unimpeded offshore flows extend at least 100 km offshore. The upstream scales of high pressure anomaly induced by the topography can have longer spatial scales than the channels or gaps between islands, forcing a hydraulic-like response in the channels. The channels act as a leaky boundary that sees a pressure head built around the topographically blocked flow. These scales are relevant when attempting to predict responses of nearshore flow to large scale flow fields and sea level variability. Downscaling efforts, as have been made here with PALAU_120B nested in a coarser state estimate, when coupled with in situ observations give insight into how these scales interact. In coarser state estimates, which are becoming more common with the proliferation of observations and computational capabilities, channels such as the one studied here are still poorly resolved or not resolved at all. This leads to the question of how one might infer what the channel flow would be from the models of this scale. Our work here shows that local pressure gradients likely play a large role in driving flow. But an examination of the drag coefficient made with in situ observations suggests that the advective and acceleration terms likely play a role in balancing the flow in the channel at different time scales. Further observational campaigns, coupled with high resolution modeling efforts, are needed to better understand the dynamics that operate at these temporal and spatial scales.\nTidal flows in excess of 2 m/s were observed in the channel over Hydrographers Bank in the southern extent of Palau over the course of observations collected between 2014 and 2018. Temporal variability in tidal flows, both in amplitude and phase, were inconsistent with those of predicted tidal flows using t_tide indicating strong interactions, perhaps advective. Depthaveraged flows were analyzed for their influence by internal tide signals as the flow field over the bank had little shear. The amplitude of the tidal currents were found to change over time, but were not consistently related to the spring-neap cycle of the local sea level anomaly. Amplitude of the tidal currents are large compared to the t_tide prediction. We hypothesize that this is driven by internal tides, but are not able to make the distinction of that influence resulting from local or remotely generated internal tides. The phase relationship between surface tide and depth-averaged currents varies in time, possibly due to the influence of both remote and locally generated internal tides influencing the site. Coherence of SLA and flow over Hydrographers Bank in both the 117 semidiurnal and diurnal bands seem to be related to the amplitude of the tidal currents seen in the observations, while are seemingly unrelated to the temporal modulation of the predicted currents. The depth of the thermocline varies from 10 to over 90 m in Palau on an interannual timescale . The associated stratification can dictate the nearshore response to a remotely generated internal tide, and also aid in the local generation of internal tides. It is unclear from this analysis if the stratification is dictating a local response in internal tidal generation, but it prompts the question, is this channel in the southern extent of Palau an internal tide generation site? Elevated levels of energy in the tidal bands suggest this is a possibility. Multiple locations to the west of Palau, such as Luzon Straight and the Celebes Sea, are remote generation sites which could be influencing the local variability in Palau. Rays from these sites have been shown in numerical models to be directed towards our observation site (Simmons et al., 2004). A challenge to addressing the problem observationally is the range of scales. At the local level, tides can induce baroclinic variability if the right combination of stratification, topographic, and background flow are present. Model grid resolution of at least 2.5 km is needed to resolve a 10 km wide channel, as in the channel described here, to allow for grid points to cover channel boundaries and allow for multiple grid points within the channel. This grid resolution would be required to resolve any cross-channel variability. Properly resolving topographic slopes, which in the case of Palau go from 8000 m to 20 m of depth in less than 40 km, is also of concern if local generation is to be properly simulated. Properly resolving similar topographic features only allows for the assessment of locally generated internal tides. This level of resolution must be coupled with full-physics models that encompass possible remote generation site at distances of O(1000) km 118 away, running with tides. Outside the scope of this study would be the development of a numerical model that possesses the required resolution and spatial domain to simulate both local and remote sourcing to the observed signal within the study region."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "\nWe are thankful for the efforts of the staff from the Coastal Research and Development      November 2013 (f-j).

The 6-month time series was used to assess the background state. Two filtering methods were used to verify the subtidal signals, a Godin de-tiding running average and a Butterworth band-pass filter for periods of 3.5 -20 days.      and bottom friction in the channel was inferred based on the current and pressure observations and the high-resolution model simulations. A drag coefficient for the channel, computed using in situ observations, is O(10 -3 -10 -4 ). Variations in large-scale zonal currents correlate with the pressure difference across the channel as well as the along-channel flow. The model simulations indicate that as the large-scale flow impinges on the island group, topographic blocking results in a pressure difference on either side of the island which causes a pressure gradient along the channel. Although the observations suggest a balance between bottom friction in the channel and the pressure gradient, a seven hour time lag of the channel current relative to the pressure gradient suggests other terms in the momentum balance, such as acceleration and advection, which was not directly measured, may contribute to the momentum balance. The findings suggest that the influence of large-scale circulation can penetrate across isobaths in to shallow coastal zones around islands and through island gaps, and that topographic blocking and resulting small-scale pressure gradients are important considerations in determining near-island flows.\nWe are thankful for the efforts of the staff from the Coastal Research and Development      The relationships between the observed zonal flow through the channel (blue lines, left y-axes) and the differences in sea surface height, denoted as \u0394\u03b7, across the island (orange lines, right y-axes) is examined.

Coastal circulation can be driven by these internal tides, which are at times incoherent with the surface tide (Zilberman et al., 2011). While our ability to map the surface tide using satellite altimetry (Egbert et al., 1994;Egbert & Ray, 2001) has become a routine observational tool, internal tides remain an elusive phenomena to map and predict with any fidelity of their phase relationship with the surface tide (Chavanne et al., 2010;Ray & Zaron, 2011). Internal tides are generated at sites of rough topography across the world's oceans, converting energy from barotropic to baroclinic modes (Simmons et al., 2004). These internal waves are often generated and dissipated at different locations, sometimes propagating freely to meet their fate far from their generation site . The interaction of the barotropic tide with topography results in non-linear interactions diagnosable by a broadening of the spectral responds around the tidal bands (Munk et al., 1965;Munk & Cartwright, 1966). The island nation of Palau sits in the tropical western Pacific and extends from 1 to 6 degrees latitude (Figure 1.a), with the main island group centered at 7\u00b0N and 134.5\u00b0E (Figure 1.b).

Nearshore oceanographic conditions on the fore reefs of Palau have been shown to have highly active internal wave component  with excitation at the tidal bands. Observations in of in-situ pressure, temperature, and currents were taken from March 2014 through June of 2018 on Palau's fore reef slopes to better understand the role of the surface and internal tide in driving nearshore variability. tidal signals. The relevance of individual tidal constituents were examined using t_tide . Hilbert transforms were used to compute the envelope function of the signal and assess the amplitude of the tidal band energy beyond the daily time scale. This was done after band pass filtering around the desired tidal bands was performed on the time series. Wavelet coherence analysis was done using the Matlab wavelet toolbox (Daubechies et al., 2011).\nWe are thankful for the efforts of the staff from the Coastal Research and Development Center at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, including S Scott, and M Jilka who assisted in the preparation and implementation for the current meter data collection.

Observed and predicted tidal currents were bandpass filtered around the diurnal (Middle) and semidiurnal (Bottom) bands.

The inertial period ranges between 3.6 -4.1 days within the meridional extent of Palau, ranging (7\u00b0N to 8\u00b0N).

These values were determined using a mean ARGO profile (Roemmich & Gilson, 2009) off of the East coast of Palau (Figure 2.2) and spatial scales were determined by mean offshore topographic profiles taken off of the East and West coasts from the (Smith & Sandwell, 1997) et al., 1986). This relation should be adjusted for a two layer system, as the original formulation assumes near linear stratification (David C Chapman, 1984). This adjustment accounts for both the layer depth and density gradient through reduced gravity and shows a stratification-dominated system for this case with a S \ufffd value of 4.5 when the depth of layer-1 is considered to be 200 m. Throughout the majority of the observational time period, May through December 2013, winds were dominated by the summer southwesterly monsoonal flow pattern (Figure 2.4a) which is typical for Palau during this period . Time tagged cross-correlations were computed between the meridional components of the winds observed at both meteorological stations, M1 and M2 (Table 2.1), between 21 May and 31 October 2013. Peak cross-correlation were at a time lag of 0 days with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 (P < 0.001). Wind fronts propagating along-coast would produce a peak within this time-lagged cross-correlation curve, but we do not expect this was the case because of the 0 day time lag in these data. This cannot be more thoroughly examined without a spatially dense set of meteorological observations. Temperature records showed large subtidal variability along with structure that exceeded a 20-day period which is consistent with seasonal and inter-annual variability (Figure 2.4b). Filtering methods eliminated these spectral ranges and maintained the super-tidal period signals. The temperature range at site T1 was between 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C (Figure 2.4b), but the array did capture temperatures down to 18\u00b0C at other sites during the observational window, likely due to internal waves. Time-lagged cross-correlation of temperature records from around the island group gave averaged values of wave speed between observation sites confirming the presence of a propagating feature with variable speed (Table 2.2). For along-coast distances between each observational site (T1-T6) see Table 2.1. Cross-correlations were computed between pairs of temperature records (T1 vs T*) for a range of time lags, \u00b1500 hours (Figure 2.5), to determine the peak correlation between records. To assess the background state this analysis was performed on both the Godin filtered and band-passed data over the 6 month observation period (01 May -31 October, 2013) proceeding Typhoon Haiyan's impact on 6 November 2013. Time lags were determined by choosing the first peak in cross-correlation when the signal at T1 leads the signal in the record from the next along-coast record (Figure 2.5). Apparent propagation speeds computed using these time lags and the associated along-coast distances between observational sites (Table 2. Results between sites T1 and T2 for the Godin filtered data were excluded since they had had a time lag of 0.5 hours, giving unrealistic propagation speeds for coastal trapped waves of 26.11 m/s. Simplified modeling cases of the expected phase speeds in the region will be discussed in Section 3.3 showing why these are unrealistic. The peak in cross-correlation between site T1 and sites T2 and T6 was small compared to site T1 and T3 -T5 during the May -October period (Figure 2.5). While all sites are connected by a continuous 500 m isobath around the island group there are channels with depths exceeding 50 100 m at both the northern and southern extends of Palau's main island group. These deep channels result in discontinuous isobaths (both 57 m and 90 m) between site T1 and T6. Site T2 sits at the northern end of the southern channel. Waves propagating near T2 will be affected by dynamics occurring within this channel, such as the strong flows that were measured to be greater than 2 m/s in later observational campaigns in 2015 and 2016."}, {"section_title": "A Strong Forcing Event -Typhoon Haiyan", "text": "Typhoon Haiyan provided a large perturbation to local waters, allowing us to record and study data with potentially larger signals. As the storm system passed Kayangel Atoll, to the north of the main island group, at 18:00:00 UTC on 6 November 2013 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported maximum wind speeds of 87.5 m/s. This corresponded with a reported minimum sea level pressure of 895 mb. Local meteorological observations were made throughout the storm at a station roughly 100 km south of the storm track ( Figure 2.1, M1 in Table 2.1) and an additional station was maintained just North of Kayangel Atoll (Figure 2.1, M2 in Table 2.1), but was destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan hours before passage of the eye of the storm. Wind speeds measured at the M1 station, reported as 3 hour averages, showed vector averaged wind speeds of only 18.8 m/s with maximum winds within the 3 hour averaging window of 24.4 m/s (Figure 2.6). Measurements of sea level pressure showed the atmospheric low-pressure signal dropped by 12 mb from the 30 day mean value to 992 mb. Due to the M1 station being in the southern extent of the storm it recorded significantly lower wind speeds than those reported for the system by the JTWC. Nearshore currents observed by the ADCP (Figure 2.1), where the inertial period is 3.8 days, showed a large near-inertial response after Typhoon Haiyan (Figure 2.7). Due to the proximity of the measurements to the coastline the currents were linearly polarized alongshore with the major axis of variance having a rotation angle 4.39 degrees clockwise from true north and containing 78% of the variance. This topographic steering of the flow altered the likely circularly polarized nature of these near-inertial currents. Ringing in the Godin filtered currents persisted for over one month after Typhoon Haiyan. Computed rotary spectra (Gonella, 1972) over a 60 day windows before and after the storm showed significant excitation in the near-inertial band after the storm, which was not excited preceding the storm (Figure 2.7). Bottom pressure records collected around the barrier reef showed little relationship with the propagating features seen in water temperature (Figure 2.8). Due to the deployment depths of the pressure sensors being shallower than the thermocline we use the pressure data to compute Sea Surface Height (SSH) assuming small variability in density at those stations. To see the residual subtidal variability driven by the storm the records were de-tided and Godin filtered. The apparent lack of storm surge response in the array along the southern half of the island group was likely due to the relatively weak onshore local winds ( Vertical displacements in the water column, \u03b7, due to the temperature anomalies were determined by computing the vertical temperature gradient, \ufffd \ufffd at a given depth , from the offshore mean ARGO profile (Figure 2.2e) and the demeaned temperature records (Figure 2.4b), \ufffd , \ufffd, using the relation Gregg, 1987) \ufffd This assumes that the density field is being driven by temperature (Gregg, 1987). At site T1 maximum vertical displacements, , computed from band-passed temperature records were 10.9 m and 10.4 m at the 57 m and 90 m isobaths, respectively. As expected, the unfiltered temperature records, with a sampling period of 30 minutes, from site T1 showed much higher vertical displacements of 35.5 m and 45.7 m at the 57 m and 90 m isobaths, respectively. These displacements were sustained for 2.5 hours at the 57 m isobath. The same time-lagged cross-correlation method that was used to assess the background state was applied to the temperature records from a 22-day period around Typhoon Haiyan, 01 - to what was seen in the T-X diagrams, 0.84 m/s (Figure 2.9). These propagation speeds were determined using filtered data. We tested two different filters (Godin and band-pass) and both produced similar results with differences of 1.1% (Table 2.2). We conclude that the wave-guide, governed by both the local stratification and topographic variability, allowed for coherent signals to propagate both in the 6 months preceding the storm and the following month. The measured propagation speeds for these two time periods were within a factor of two of each other."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Results", "text": "We use of the vertical structure equation to obtain first order estimates of the phase speeds for free wave baroclinic motion using the local stratification. Through the use of the scaling relation in the Stratification Parameter adjusted for a two-layer system, S \ufffd , (David C Chapman, 1984;J M Huthnance et al., 1986) the role of stratification was expected to be dominant for this area and suggests that variability in the water column should be baroclinic. The climatological ARGO profile (Figure 2.2) and profiles provided by local glider observations  show the stratification to be non-linear, thus the N 2 profile was not constant. The N 2 profile was extended to the sea floor by linearly interpolating between the deepest ARGO value at 1975 m to 1% of that value at the sea floor. The depth used for this calculation was 4500 m as used in (Picaut & Sombardier, 1993). Here, the rigid lid approximation is adequate since we are not examining the barotropic response, thus Mode-0 results are not realistic. Results from the VSE show baroclinic Mode-1 phase speeds of 2.81 m/s which were substantially faster than those observed around Palau. The baroclinic Mode-2 through Mode-9 data show phase speeds ranging between 1.83 m/s and 0.37 m/s, more closely matching the observations (Figure 2.10c). Our VSE Mode-1 phase speeds of 2.81 m/s are consistent with previous estimates of the first baroclinic gravity wave phase speed for this region of 2.8 m/s (Chelton et al., 1998) and 2.6 m/s (Picaut & Sombardier, 1993). The displacement modes ( Figure   2.10) show that Modes-1-3 have the same sign at 55 and 90 m. The Mode-2 and Mode-3 displacement values are 99% and 97% of the Mode-1 value at 55 m and 94% and 79% at 90 m. These percentages were determined on the non-normalized profiles in Figure 2.10. Due to this similarity in modal structure and sign the phase of the temperature records cannot be used to determine a specific modeled mode. The displacement modes were also converted to pressure anomaly profiles so projections of Sea Surface Height anomaly (SSH') could be made using the vertical displacements predicted from the observed bandpass filtered temperature anomalies in were smaller than these values at each of the pressure gauges. The largest observed SSH' post Haiyan were seen at P1 and P2 (Figure 2.8). As stated in Section 3.2, we think these are likely a response to the local wind field (Figure 2.6). We next assess the combined role of topography and Coriolis using a two-dimensional model, BC85, with length scales derived from average topographic profiles taken from both the East and West coasts (Figure 2.3). These profiles lack a shelf and show considerably steeper topography than other large coastal trench cases such as along Japan or Peru (K H Brink, 1982;Igeta et al., 2007;Kajiura, 1974;Pietri et al., 2014). Assuming the length scales stated in Sections 1 and 3.1, BC85 solves for \u03c9 numerically via resonance iterations for our two topographic profiles (K H Brink, 1982). Phase speeds were computed using the MATLAB package bigc*.m. This is an updated version of the original FORTRAN software freely available online from Dr. Kenneth Brink (Kenneth H Brink & Chapman, 1985). This variant is for a straight coast case and allows for complex frequencies, and thus dissipation in the offshore direction. The straight coast model was hypothesized to be applicable due to the long (120 km -160 km) straight nature of the coastline on the east coast of Palau. Results of the BC85 application are shown through quasi dispersion curves (Figure 2.11). These are quasi dispersion curves due to the fact that BC85 solves for discrete values of frequency thus they do not represent a continuous dispersion relationship (K H Brink, 1999). Group velocity can be computed with an approximate dispersion relationship using these quasi dispersion curves.  (Figure 2.10). The VSE estimate was preferred as it accounts for the full Brunt Vaisala frequency profile and is not a simplified two-layer approximation. The maximum alongshore wavelength was set at 160 km since the maximum meridional length scale of Palau is ~160 km, corresponding well with the first baroclinic Rossby radius determined with the VSE. The minimum along-coast wavelength used when forcing BC85 was 20 km. Model runs forced with along-coast wavelengths less than 90 km produced spurious results. The along-coast wavelengths used to force BC85 were much less than the full circumference of the island group, ~350 km, thus we are not concerned with the first azimuthally quantized mode, but higher order modes do fall within the range of applicable along-coast wavelengths."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Observational array and gridded products", "text": "In-situ pressure observations were made on the outer fore reef slopes around the main island group of Palau between March 2015 and June 2018 using RBR Inc Duo pressure loggers, deployed in 2-28 m of water depth.

Currents were polarized in the east-west direction (Figure 4.2). This polarization matches the orientation of the channel in which the ADCP was stationed. Rotary spectra of the signal showed energy in the inertial band, as well as signatures of the diurnal and semi diurnal tides (Figure 4.3). The bandwidth of the excitation around the K1 and M2 tidal bands is not insignificant, likely due to non-linear interactions of the tides with the coastal topography (Munk et al., 1965;Munk & Cartwright, 1966). Energy in the tidal harmonics was also elevated (Figure 4.3) as was seen in the spectra of the sea surface height as observed by the ADCP pressure gauge (Figure 4.4)."}, {"section_title": "Evidence of an internal tide in the tidal currents", "text": "Temporal variability of the magnitude of the tidal component computed with a 30 day window is present in time series of the frequency spectrum of the east and north depth-averaged 114 currents (Figure 4.5). A narrow-band response is seen around both the diurnal and semi diurnal frequencies (Figure 4.5, dash and dash-dot lines). The barotropic surface tide accounted for 35.1, 24.3, 39.7, and 37.7 percent of the annual variance predicted in relation to the total variance in the depth-averaged records for each of the four 12 month deployments starting in March of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The Matlab package t_tide  was used for this analysis. The influence of the baroclinic internal tide and its varying phase relationships were not accounted for in these percentages. Flow over the bank was observed to have little shear between the sensor location at ~20 m and the surface. The lack of shear argues for the use of the depth average to be an accurate representation of the flow field across the bank for further tidal decomposition analysis. Harmonic decomposition (t_tide) cannot distinguish between the baroclinic and barotropic components that drive the flow, and thus the internal tidal component is not contained in the estimate of the percentage of variance explained as it isn't phase locked with the surface component, and found to undergo phase changes on time scales of O(5) days. The amplitude of the currents in the diurnal and semidiurnal bands change throughout the record (Figure 4.6, red lines). Band pass filtered sea level observed in Malakal Harbor, the central lagoon system on Palau, shows temporal modulation consistent with a spring neap cycle ( Figure   4.6, black lines) and has been shown elsewhere to be consistent with global tidal predictions (Mitchum, 1994) . Sustained periods of elevated current amplitudes in both K1 and M2 bands last for upwards of 1 month, but do not consistently modulate with the amplitudes of the surface tide in each respective band as observed in the tide gauge in Malakal Harbor (Figure 4.6, red lines). The amplitude of observed tidal currents in the diurnal and semidiurnal bands were typically larger than the t_tide predicted tidal currents (Figure 4.7, Top), as generated using one 115 year of observed currents between March 2014 and March 2015 in t_tide. Observed currents were high passed, maintaining all periods shorter than 2 days. Elevated energy in each tidal band ( Figure   4.7 middle, bottom) is indicative of the internal tides driving local flows. The phase relationship between the surface tide and depth-averaged currents changes throughout the record. A current driven by the hydrostatic control of a surface tide will be 90 degrees out of phase with the sea level response. In contrast, at our observation site, the diurnal and semidiurnal bands of tidal currents exhibit phase relationships that vary between 0 and 180 degrees (Figure 4.8), all within the span of one month. Elevated levels of coherence are seen at the semidiurnal and diurnal bands as seen through wavelet coherence between the surface tide, represented by the SLA observed by the ADCP pressure sensor, and major axis velocity in the semidiurnal and diurnal bands between March 2014 and March 2015 (Figure 4.9). While a relationship between the coherence of the surface tide and observed tidal currents verses the amplitude of the observed tidal currents is present (Figure 4.10, left column), there is no clear relationship between the amplitude of the coherence of the surface tide and observed tidal currents versus the predicted tide ( Figure 4.10, right column). Wavelet coherence between sea level and the tidal band currents was compared to the amplitude of the tidal band currents, as shown in Figure 4.7. A relationship between the coherence of the sea level and tidal currents and amplitude of the observed tidal currents is apparent for both the semidiurnal and diurnal bands (Figure 4.11, left column). The amplitudes of the predicted tidal currents does not show the same relationship (Figure 4.11, right column)."}, {"section_title": "The role of stratification 116", "text": "The depth structure of temperature seen on Palau's fore reefs was examined during periods when the correlation between the barotropic surface tide and observed currents were positive, negative, and not correlated. West Channel, on the west coast of Palau, is roughly 75 km from Hydrographers Bank and is the location of the thermograph array used for this comparison. The thermocline was located at the depth of our array for time windows when the surface tide and tidal currents were both positively (Figure 4.12) and negatively correlated (Figure 4.13). The thermocline was shallowest for this comparison during the period with a negative correlation. The thermocline was found to be deeper in the time period where the surface tide and the tidal currents showed little correlation Figure 4.14)."}, {"section_title": "125", "text": ""}]
