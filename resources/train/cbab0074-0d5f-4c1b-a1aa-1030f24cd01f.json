Therefore, more research is conducted focusing on immigrant children particularly on their educational attainment. In many studies, there is a distinction between first-generation immigrants who were born outside the host country with at least one parent also born abroad, and second-generation immigrants who were born in the immigrant country with at least one of the parents born outside the immigrant country. A stylized finding is that in terms of educational attainment, second-generation immigrant children are not very different from native children whereas first-generation immigrant children are performing worse.\nThe educational attainment of immigrant children in the European context has been investigated in a number of recent studies. For example, Colding et al. (2009) study the gap in high school completion between immigrant children and native Danish children and find that family characteristics and age at immigration are important determinants of the gaps. Bratsberg et al. (2010) do a similar analysis for Norway. Although the gap between immigrant children and native Norwegian children decreased over the past decades, the first-generation immigrant children are especially more likely to leave high school early with this effect being stronger the later the age at immigration. Dustmann et al. (2012) compare the educational gap between second-generation immigrant children and native children aged 15, across several OECD countries. Parental characteristics are an important determinant with a foreign language spoken at home being the single most important factor associated with the educational gap.\nThere are also a couple on non-European studies. Cortes (2006) Corak (2011) analyses high-school dropout rates of a cohort of immigrants who arrived in Canada as children. He finds that the chances of being a high-school dropout do not vary according to age at arrival up to age 9. Children arriving after that age are more likely to not graduate from high school.\nIn the Netherlands, Veenman (2003, 2006 ) study the educational gap between the native Dutch and immigrant students, who are aged between 15 and 29. Van Ours and Veenman (2003) find the evidence that the gap in educational attainment between the two groups is smaller for the second-generation immigrants than the first-generation immigrants.\nVan Ours and Veenman (2006) , on the other hand, investigate the effect of age at immigration and present evidence that educational attainment of second-generation immigrants indeed depends on the age at immigration, although the age threshold depends on gender and country of origin. Van Ours and Veenman (2010) explore the effect of interethnic marriages on the educational attainment of Moluccan immigrant children and find that children born from mixed ethnic parents do better than those born from homogeneous ethnic parents. Finally, Schnepf (2007) conducts a cross-country analysis and studies differences in maths and reading test scores between the native and immigrant children in each country. Using similar data as we do she finds that immigrant children in the Netherlands score less than the native children, although only 2 out of 18 estimates suggest statistically significant differences in the test scores between the two groups of students.\nIn the current paper, we investigate the differences in test scores, between immigrant children in the Netherlands and native Dutch children conditional on personal and family characteristics and classroom environment. Similarly to the existing literature, this paper also highlights the differential educational achievements by first and second-generation immigrants. Moreover, for the first-generation immigrants, we study whether the age at immigration influences the academic achievements.\nIn contrast to the majority of previous literature that exclusively study the educational attainment of students in junior high school and above, our paper uses information on the test scores of children aged 9 and 10. This allows us to study if the educational gap also exists early on in life. Unlike most of the previous studies that measure educational attainment in terms of completed education, our data allow us to make a distinction between language, science and math test scores. The outcomes of all three subjects are studied, since differential levels of linguistic requirements across these subjects may lead us to observe varying degrees of gaps in test scores among students.\nMoreover, we explore in detail the importance of mixed/homogeneous ethnic marriages and its differential impacts by children's age at immigration."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Our empirical analysis is based on information on the educational attainment of children in the Netherlands. The datasets employed are the 2006"}, {"section_title": "Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and the 2007", "text": "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). These datasets share similar characteristics, since both surveys were designed and conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). PIRLS assesses the reading abilities while TIMSS collects information on the mathematics and science abilities. The samples of students in both surveys were selected using a two-stage sampling design.\nIn the first stage, schools were selected using a probability-proportional-tosize sampling scheme ; in the second stage, classes were randomly sampled from each of the selected schools. 1 Similar sets of covariates are available from both PIRLS and TIMSS.\nFor example, at the individual student level, PIRLS and TIMSS hold information on age and gender of students and the number of books at home.\nHowever, the highest educational qualifications of parents are only available in PIRLS. As a result, we also use the information on the number of books at home as a proxy for the parental educational background. The Table 1 shows that the average reading test scores do not differ a lot between native children and second-generation immigrant children. The difference is 5 points, whereas the difference between secondgeneration immigrant children and first-generation immigrant children is 25 points. In the PIRLS sample about three-quarter of the second generation immigrant children are from a mixed marriage, which is about one-third for first-generation immigrant children. The percentage of girls is very high among first-generation immigrant children, but this may be coincidental and related to the small sample size. The distribution of the number of books at home is not very different from the children in the TIMSS sample.\nThe PIRLS data also contain information on parental educational attainment. The educational attainment of the parents is higher for native Dutch children than for second-generation immigrants. Somewhat surprisingly the educational attainment of first-generation immigrants is rather high. Again, this may have to do with the small sample size for the first-generation immigrants. is a lot of probability mass at the high end of the distribution, for children with two immigrant parents this is the case at the low end of the distribution. The middle graph shows that for math test scores there are also clear differences although they are not as big as for the science scores. Finally, the bottom graph of Figure 2 shows that for reading test scores the differences 6 are not that big either.

Furthermore, the error term, ic = \u03b1 c + u ic , is composed of two terms: \u03b1 c reflects the classroom fixed effects and u ic is the random error term. Our data allow us to investigate the effects of the following individual and family characteristics: whether a child is a first-generation or second-generation immigrant, whether the parents of the child form a mixed couple (i.e. mother and father are native and immigrant), the gender and age of the child and the number of books at home. The number of books at home is specified in discrete intervals (up to 10, 11 to 25, 26 to 100, 101 to 200 and more than 200) for which we use dummy variables. Our data also allow us to include classroom fixed effects in our estimates."}, {"section_title": "Parameter estimates", "text": "The parameter estimates of equation (1) are presented in Table 2 . The first column shows the parameter estimates for the science scores. Secondgeneration immigrant children have a significantly lower science test score compared to native children, while first-generation immigrants children have an even lower science test score. Having parents from a mixed marriage lead to a positive and significant effect on the science score of their children. 2 The size of this effect is about the same in magnitude -but opposite in signas the second-generation dummy. This implies that second-generation immigrant children from a mixed marriage have about the same educational attainment as native children. Girls have a significantly lower science score than boys while age has no effect. The second column of Table 2 show that this general pattern is also present for the math scores. The fifth column of Table 2 shows that for the reading scores there is only one significant parameter. First-generation immigrants have a significantly lower reading score than native children, while second-generation immigrant children do not suffer significant disadvantages compared to the native children.\nIntroducing classroom fixed effects or parental education dummies as additional explanatory variables does not change these results.\nIn Table 3 , we explore whether age at immigration has an effect on the educational attainment of the immigrant children. Age at immigration information is only available in TIMSS and, therefore, this analysis is only possible for the science and math scores and not for the reading scores.\nThe first column shows that the negative effect of being a first-generation immigrant on the science score increases in absolute terms if the age at immigration increases, but the effect is not strong. The second and third columns of Table 3 show parameter estimates if we interact the immigrant dummies with parental marriage. There seems to be no significant effect on the science score for immigrant children born from interethnic parents. 3 For 2 We also investigated whether it mattered if the father or the mother was native, but we found no evidence for this. The finding of Van Ours and Veenman (2010) , which indicates that a mixed marriage is only better for the educational performance of Moluccan children if the mother is native, is probably specific to the Moluccan immigrant group.\n3 The significant negative effect of the first generation dummy for 1-5 years age at 8 first-generation immigrant children with two immigrant parents, there is a clear relationship between science score and age at immigration. Children who entered at age 5 or older have a much lower science test score than children who entered as a baby, who have about the same science test score as second-generation immigrant children. The fourth to sixth columns of Table 3 show similar parameter estimates for the math test scores."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We analyze the determinants of the educational attainment of young children in the Netherlands.
