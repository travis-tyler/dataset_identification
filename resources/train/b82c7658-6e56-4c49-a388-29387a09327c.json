It holds great promise for a systems biology of the brain to better understand complex neurobiological systems, from genetic determinants to cellular processes to the complex interplay of brain structure, function, behavior and cognition. Disorders of the nervous system are associated with complex neurobiological changes, which may lead to profound alterations at all levels of organization.\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been increasingly performed to correlate high-throughput singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to large-scale imaging data. To facilitate such association analysis, many studies used a hypothesis-driven approach (Glahn et al., 2007) by making significant reduction in one or both data types. For example, some whole-brain studies focused on a small number of genetic variables (e.g. Brun et al., 2009; Filippini et al., 2009; Hariri et al., 2006; Nichols and Inkster, 2009) , and some whole-genome studies examined a limited number of imaging variables (e.g. Baranzini et al., 2008; Potkin et al., 2009; Seshadri et al., 2007) . Many SNPs have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), see those in the AlzGene database (www.alzgene.org).\nSo far most studies focus on selecting and associating SNPs to AD status or imaging phenotypes. Very few studies have been done to directly examine how the SNP values change when phenotypic measures are varied, i.e. via regression of SNP values on phenotypic measures. This alternative approach may have a potential to help us discover important imaging genetic associations from a different perspective. In this study, we perform such an initial analysis for finding phenotypic imaging markers that are related to SNPs from or proximal to AlzGene candidates.\nNeuroimaging measures have been widely studied to predict disease status and/or cognitive performance (Batmanghelich et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2010a) . However, whether these measures coupled with their longitudinal profiles have sufficient power to infer relevant genotype groups is still an under-explored yet important topic in AD research. A simple strategy typically used in longitudinal studies (e.g. Risacher et al., 2010) is to analyze a single summarized value such as average change rate of change or slope. This approach may be inadequate to distinguish the complete dynamics of cognitive trajectories and thus become unable to identify the underlying genetic structure.\nWith these observations, in this work, we propose a new taskcorrelated longitudinal sparse regression framework to effectively identify the longitudinal phenotypic markers related to candidate AD SNPs. Based on the emerging structured sparse learning techniques, which has been effectively applied in imaging genetics studies (Wang et al., 2011a (Wang et al., , b, 2012a , the new combined structured sparse regularizations are introduced to tackle the longitudinal phenotypic patterns and biological genotypic correlations. The proposed new computational biology model consists of three major components. First, due to the serial measures of the imaging phenotypes over time, we propose a novel longitudinal regression analysis method. As a result, the regression coefficients assess the relationships between longitudinal phenotypes and their genetic makeups. Second, certain SNPs are naturally correlated via different ways, e.g. multiple SNPs from one single gene often jointly carry out similar genetic functionalities, SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) are linked together in meiosis. To incorporate such SNP correlations in our association studies, we propose to use the trace/nuclear norm regularization (Cand\u00e8s and Recht, 2009; Nie et al., 2012) to approximately minimize the rank of regression coefficient matrix, such that the coefficients of phenotypes associated to correlated SNPs are linearly dependent. Finally, through enforcing the 2,1 -norm regularization, the imaging feature selection across most SNPs are coupled (Argyriou et al., 2007; Obozinski et al., 2006) , so that the identified imaging phenotypes have common influence on all the SNPs.\nWe apply the proposed method to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (Mueller et al., 2005) for identifying longitudinal phenotypes using a set of SNPs based on the AlzGene database. Our empirical results yield not only clearly improved prediction performance in all test cases but also a compact set of associations between phenotypes and genotypes that are in accordance with prior research findings."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND DATA SOURCES", "text": "Both SNP and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

Among all SNPs, only SNPs, belonging to the top 40 AD candidate genes listed on the AlzGene database (www.alzgene.org) as of June 10, 2010, were selected after the standard quality control (QC) and imputation steps. The QC criteria for the SNP data include (i) call rate check per subject and per SNP marker, (ii) gender check, (iii) sibling pair identification, (iv) the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, (v) marker removal by the minor allele frequency and (vi) population stratification. As the second pre-processing step, the quality-controlled SNPs were imputed using the MaCH software (Li et al., 2010) to estimate the missing genotypes. After that, the Illumina annotation information based on the Genome build 36.2 was used to select a subset of SNPs, belonging to the top 40 AD candidate genes (Bertram et al., 2007) .

Obviously, X is a tensor data with d imaging features, n subject samples and T time points. The output genetic variations described by c SNPs for the n subject samples forms a matrix Y = y 1 ,...,y n T \u2208 R n\u00d7c , where the y i \u2208 R c is the SNP values of the ith subject sample. Our goal is to learn from {X ,Y } a model that can reveal the associations between the longitudinal imaging phenotypes X and the genotypes Y . A straightforward method for relating imaging phenotypes and SNPs is to perform regression at each time point separately, which, though, does not take into account the valuable information conveyed by the longitudinal patterns of the phenotypic inputs. To overcome this limitation, different from previous studies that learned the regression coefficient matrix for each time point individually, we aim to learn a unified longitudinal regression model to find the genetic features that are associated to the longitudinal imaging patterns over all the measurement time points. To this end, we expect to learn a coefficient tensor (a stack of coefficient matrices) B ={B 1 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,B T }\u2208R d\u00d7c\u00d7T to reveal the temporal changes of the coefficient matrices. In this article, we propose to use the low-rank structured sparse regularizations to explore the temporal patterns and the interrelatedness between SNPs in a new task-correlated longitudinal sparse regression model. i620 3.1 Task-correlated longitudinal sparse regression using low-rank structured sparse regularizations\nThe simplest model to associate the the phenotypic markers to the genotypes is the multivariate regression model, which solves the following optimization problem:\nwhere b k t denotes the kth row of coefficient matrix B t at time t, and L B is the proposed longitudinal loss and defined as\nBecause the objective J 0 in Equation (1) can be decoupled for each individual time point and does not consider the longitudinal correlations between the imaging features and the SNPs, it is not suitable for longitudinal data analysis and feature selection. Because the selected imaging markers with temporal changes are desired to connect all the SNPs, the T groups of regression tasks at different time points should not be decoupled and have to be performed simultaneously. Thus, we introduce the structured sparse regularization (Argyriou et al., 2007; Nie et al., 2010; Obozinski et al., 2006) into the longitudinal data regression and feature selection model as following:\nApparently, J 1 in Equation (3) can no longer be decoupled over time dimension. Upon solution, the imaging features with common influences to all the SNPs across all the time points will be identified out due to the second term in Equation (3), which essentially is a tensor extension of the widely used 2,1 -norm for matrices. To further take into account that many SNPs are interrelated together and their effects on brain structure or disease progression could overlap, we expect to further develop J 1 in Equation (3) to leverage the useful information conveyed by the SNP correlations. Mathematically speaking, due to the interrelatedness among the SNPs, the learning vector b t j should have certain correlations, where b t j denotes the jth column of B t . Namely, the coefficient\n..I n as the unfolding operation along its kth mode. Then we can achieve our goal by minimizing the rank of B 1 / = [B 1 ,B 2 ,...,B T ] \u2208 R d\u00d7 c\u00d7T / induced from B, which leads to the following optimization problem:\nwhere * denotes the trace-norm of a matrix, and without ambiguity we drop the subscript of the matrix B 1 / for notation brevity. Given a matrix M \u2208 R n\u00d7m and its singular values \u03c3 i 1 \u2264 i \u2264 min n,m , the\nIt has been shown that (Candes and Tao, 2010; Cand\u00e8s and Recht, 2009 ) the trace-norm is the best convex approximation of the rank-norm. Therefore, the third term of J 2 in Equation (4) indeed minimizes the rank of the unfolded learning model B, such that the correlations among the SNPs are captured. Due to its both capabilities for imaging marker selection and task correlation integration, we call J 2 defined in Equation (4) as the proposed 'task-correlated longitudinal sparse regression model'."}, {"section_title": "A new optimization algorithm and its global convergence", "text": "Because our new objective J 2 is non-smooth, the problem in Equation (4) is difficult to solve in general. Some existing methods, such as LARS (Efron et al., 2004) , linear gradient search (Liu et al., 2009) , proximal (Beck and Teboulle., 2009 ) methods, can solve it, but not efficiently. Thus, in this subsection we derive a new efficient algorithm to solve J 2 with rigorous proof of its global convergence. Taking the derivative of J 2 w.r.t B t and set it to zeros, we have:\nwhere D is a diagonal matrix with\nThus, we can derive\nWhen the time t changes from 1 to T , we can compute B t 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T by Equation (6).

We compare the proposed method against its three close counterparts including multivariate linear regression (LR) method, ridge regression (RR) method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) (Tibshirani, 1996) method. LR method is the most broadly used association model in both statistical learning and imaging genetics. RR method is the regularized version of LR model to avoid over-fitting. Lasso method replaces the squared 2 -norm regularization in RR method by the 1 -norm regularization, from which sparse results can be achieved (Tibshirani, 1996) . Different to these compared methods, our new association model imposes structured sparsity via the tensor 2,1 -norm regularization for phenotypic marker selection and the trace-norm regularization for capturing the interrelationships among different SNPs. We implement two versions of the proposed method as follows. First, we implement our method by only imposing the trace-norm regularization, denoted as 'Ours (Trace-norm only)', which only makes use of the SNPs' correlations, but does not select longitudinal imaging markers. Second, we implement the full version of the proposed method, denoted as 'Ours', which solves the problem in Equation (4). For measuring the regression performance of the five compared association models, we use a 5-fold cross-validation strategy by computing the Pearson's correlation coefficient (CORR) and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the predicted and the actual SNP values, which are reported in Figure 1 .\nAs can be seen from Figure 1 , if we only use the baseline data, the proposed method is reduced into a conventional multitask regression model, which appears as a matrix but not a tensor and achieves only the slightly better performance than the RR and Lasso methods. On the other hand, by using the longitudinal data, the performance of the proposed method is significantly improved, e.g. for predicting SNPs using the longitudinal data over all the four time points, the proposed (BL \u223c M24) method achieves the CORR of 0.793 and 0.812 and the RMSE of 0.314 and 0.301, respectively, which are much better than the case of using only the baseline data.\nIn addition, Figure 1 also shows that the usage of longitudinal data can improve the performances of all the LR, RR and Lasso methods, although the improvements are much less than the proposed method.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of using longitudinal data for improved regression from imaging phenotypes to genotypes, especially by the proposed method, which has the capability to make use of the input data through longitudinal feature selection; and the integration of the interrelatedness among the SNPs."}, {"section_title": "Identification of longitudinal imaging markers", "text": "One primary goal of this study is to identify a subset of imaging phenotypes that are highly correlated to certain SNPs to capture important imaging genomic associations in AD research.

We also observe that hippocampal measures (LHippocampus, RHippocampus, LHippVol and RHippVol) are identified, which is in accordance with the fact that in the pathological pathway of AD, medial temporal lobe including hippocampus is firstly affected, followed by progressive neocortical damage (Braak and Braak, 1991; Delacourte et al., 1999) . The thickness measures of isthmus cingulate (LIsthmCing and RIsthmCing), frontal pole (LFrontalPole and RFrontalPole) and posterior cingulate gyrus (LPostCingulate and RPostCingulate) are also selected, which, again, is accordance with the fact that the GM atrophy of these regions is high in AD (Lehmann et al., 2010; McEvoy et al., 2009) . In summary, the identified longitudinally stable markers strongly agree with the existing findings, which warrants the correctness of the discovered phenotype-genotype associations, and reveals the complex relationships among MRI measures, genetic variations and diagnosis status.
