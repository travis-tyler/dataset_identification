Graduates' repayment status varied with their employment status in 2012. Among those who had enrolled for additional education, relatively more full-time than part-time employees or those who were not employed 10 were in repayment (66 percent vs. 48 and 40 percent, respectively). Among those who had not enrolled since earning their bachelor's degree, 71 percent of graduates who were employed full time in 2012 were in repayment, compared with 61 percent of those who were not employed. 10 Not employed includes both those out of the labor force (not looking for work) and those unemployed (looking for work). Among employed graduates who were repaying their undergraduate or graduate loans, monthly loan payments accounted for about 12 percent, on average, of their monthly salary in 2012 (figure 5). This ratio of monthly loan payments to monthly salary, known as \"debt burden,\" was higher for those employed in one part-time job in 2012 than for those employed full time or in multiple jobs (30 percent vs. 10 and 11 percent, respectively).
