Relative to NGT, IFG100 and IFG110 were associated with (\"conferred\") significant (Fig. 1 In contrast, there was a more dramatic difference in risk of postchallenge\nglucose intolerance (IGT or diabetes). The risk conferred by IFG100 was 2.53 (1.55-4.13), while the risk for IFG110 was 11.54 (5.78 -23.02) (P \u03ed 0.0004). In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, race, sex, and BMI, the risk of glucose intolerance was OR 3.22 (95% CI 1.84 -5.66) for IFG100 vs. 13.14 (6.12-28.23) for IFG110 (P \u03ed 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS -T h e p r e s e n t studies demonstrate that although prediabetes, characterized as IFG100 and IFG110, identifies individuals with similar demographics, IFG110 carries increased risk of the metabolic syndrome by NCEP criteria, LDL cholesterol \u03fe130 mg/ dl, and high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and IFG110 is much more likely to confer risk of postchallenge hyperglycemia. It has previously been reported that individuals with progressive elevation in FPG are more likely to have IGT or diabetes (9) . However, we are not aware of previous comparisons of the risks in individuals added by inclusion under \"newer\" criteria (IFG100) versus the risks conferred by the \"older\" criteria (IFG110).\nRecognition of pre-diabetes is important to identify individuals who have risks that can be modified to improve outcomes. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging has shown that mortality is increased in men by levels of FPG \u03fe110 mg/dl and/or 2-h OGTT glucose levels \u03fe140 mg/dl, even after adjustment for the presence of other risk factors (12) , and mortality was also independently increased by the presence of postchallenge hyperglycemia in men in the Whitehall Study (13) and in both men and women in the DECODE (Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe) study (14) . Although it is not yet established in randomized controlled trials that mortality and/or cardiovascular events can be decreased in individuals with such mild hyperglycemia by interventions other than treatment with acarbose (15), the hypothesis is being tested in ongoing studies with rosiglitazone, nateglinide, ramipril, and valsartan. Moreover, several different studies have shown that lifestyle change and/or medication can reduce progression from IGT to diabetes (2,16 -18) , and such interventions appear to be costeffective (19) . Such considerations indicate that identification of pre-diabetes should be a national priority.\nThe present study demonstrates that it is particularly important to follow recognition of IFG110 with additional diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Since IGT and diabetes are associated with increased mortality (above), detection of IFG110 should also prompt consideration of further evaluation by OGTT. "}]
