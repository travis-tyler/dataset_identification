[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The early development literature documented that the growth path of most advanced economies was accompanied by a process of structural transformation. As economies develop, the share of agriculture in employment falls and workers migrate to cities to \u2026nd employment in the industrial and service sectors [Clark (1940), Lewis (1954), Kuznets (1957)]. These \u2026ndings suggest that isolating the forces that can give rise to structural transformation is key to our understanding of the development process. In particular, scholars have argued that increases in agricultural productivity are an essential condition for economic development, based on the experience of England during the industrial revolution. 1 Classical models of structural transformation formalize their ideas by showing how productivity growth in agriculture can release labor or generate demand for manufacturing goods. 2 However, several scholars noted that the positive e\u00a4ects of agricultural productivity on industrialization occur only in closed economies, while in open economies a comparative advantage in agriculture can slow down industrial growth. 3 Despite the richness of the theoretical literature, there is scarce direct empirical evidence testing the mechanisms proposed by these models. 4 In this paper we provide direct empirical evidence on the e\u00a4ects of technical change in agriculture on the industrial sector by studying the recent widespread adoption of new agricultural technologies in Brazil. First, we analyze the e\u00a4ects of the adoption of genetically engineered soybean seeds (GE soy). This new technology requires less labor per unit of land to yield the same output. Thus, it can be characterized as labor-augmenting technical change. In addition, we study the e\u00a4ects of the introduction of a second harvesting season for maize (milho safrinha). This technique permits to grow two crops a year, e\u00a4ectively increasing the land endowment. Thus, it can be characterized as land-augmenting technical change. The simultaneous expansion of these two crops allows to assess the e\u00a4ect of agricultural productivity on structural transformation in open economies. To guide empirical work, we build a simple model describing a two-sector small open economy where technical change in agriculture can be factor biased. The model predicts that a Hicksneutral increase in agricultural productivity induces a reduction in the size of the industrial sector as labor reallocates towards agriculture, as in classical open economy models such as Matsuyama (1992). Similar results are obtained when technical change is land-augmenting. However, if land 1 See, for example, Rosenstein-Rodan (1943), Nurkse (1953), Lewis (1954), Rostow (1960). 2 See Baumol (1967), Murphy, Shleifer, Vishny (1989), Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie (2001), Gollin, Parente and Rogerson (2002), Ngai and Pissarides (2007). 3 See Mokyr (1976), Field (1978), Wright (1979), Corden and Neary (1982), Krugman (1987), and Matsuyama (1992). 4 Empirical studies of structural transformation include Rosenszweig (2004, 2008), Nunn and Qian (2011), Michaels, Rauch and Redding (2012), Hornbeck and Keskin (2012). We discuss this literature in more detail below. and labor are strong complements in agricultural production, labor-augmenting technical change reduces labor demand in agriculture and causes workers to reallocate towards manufacturing. In sum, the model predicts that the e\u00a4ects of agricultural productivity on structural transformation in open economies depend on the factor-bias of technical change. In a \u2026rst analysis of the data we \u2026nd that regions where the area cultivated with soy expanded experienced an increase in agricultural output per worker, a reduction in labor intensity in agriculture and an expansion in industrial employment. These correlations are consistent with the theoretical prediction that the adoption of labor-augmenting agricultural technologies reduces labor demand in the agricultural sector and induces the reallocation of workers towards the industrial sector. However, causality could run in the opposite direction. For example: an increase in productivity in the industrial sector could increase labor demand and wages, inducing agricultural \u2026rms to switch to less labor intensive crops, like soy. We propose to establish the direction of causality by using two sources of exogenous variation in the pro\u2026tability of technology adoption. First, in the case of GE soy, as the technology was invented in the U.S. in 1996, and legalized in Brazil in 2003, we use this last date as our source of variation across time. Second, as the new technology had a di\u00a4erential impact on yields depending on geographical and weather characteristics, we use di\u00a4erences in soil suitability across regions as our source of cross-sectional variation. Similarly, in the case of maize, we exploit the timing of expansion of second-harvest maize and cross-regional di\u00a4erences in soil suitability. We obtain an exogenous measure of technological change in agriculture by using estimates of potential soil yields across geographical areas of Brazil from the FAO-GAEZ database. These yields are calculated by incorporating local soil and weather characteristics into a model that predicts the maximum attainable yields for each crop in a given area. Potential yields are a source of exogenous variation in agricultural productivity because they are a function of weather and soil characteristics, not of actual yields in Brazil. In addition, the database reports potential yields under traditional and new agricultural technologies. Thus, we exploit the predicted di\u00a4erential impact of the new technology on yields across geographical areas in Brazil as our source of crosssectional variation in agricultural productivity. Note that this empirical strategy relies on the assumption that although goods can move across geographical areas of Brazil, labor markets are local due to limited labor mobility. This research design allows us to investigate whether exogenous shocks to local agricultural productivity lead to changes in the size of the local industrial sector. We use municipalities as our geographical unit of observation, which are assumed to behave as the small open economy described in the model. We \u2026nd that municipalities where the new technology is predicted to have a higher e\u00a4ect on potential yields of soy did experience a larger expansion of the area planted with GE soy. In addition, these regions experienced increases in the value of agricultural output per worker and reductions in labor intensity measured as employment per hectare. Besides, these regions experienced faster employment growth and wage reductions in the industrial sector. Interestingly, the e\u00a4ects of technology adoption are di\u00a4erent for maize. Regions where the FAO potential maize yields are predicted to increase the most when switching from the traditional to the new technology did indeed experience a higher increase in the area planted with maize. However, they also experienced increases in labor intensity, reductions in industrial employment and increases in wages. The di\u00a4erent e\u00a4ects of technological change in agriculture documented for GE soy and maize indicate that the factor-bias of technical change is a key determinant of the relationship between agricultural productivity and structural transformation in open economies. Land-augmenting technical change, the case of second-harvest maize, leads to an increase in the marginal product of labor in agriculture and a reduction in industrial employment. However, labor-augmenting technical change, the case of GE soy, leads to a reduction in the marginal product of labor in agriculture and employment growth of the industrial sector. Thus, in what follows we refer to labor-augmenting technical change as labor-saving. 5 Our estimates can be used to quantify the e\u00a4ect of factor-biased agricultural technical change on structural transformation. In particular, we compute the elasticity of sectoral employment shares to changes in agricultural productivity induced by soy technical change: 1 percent increase in agricultural labor productivity leads to a 0.16 percentage points decrease in the agricultural employment share and an increase in the manufacturing employment share of a similar magnitude. These estimates can be used to understand to what extent the observed di\u00a4erences in the speed of structural transformation across Brazilian municipalities can be explained by labor-saving technical change in soy. In the year 2000, the average municipality had employment shares in agriculture and manufacturing of 38 and 10 percent, respectively. During the next decade, the degree of labor reallocation across sectors varied extensively across municipalities. Our estimates imply that labor-saving technical change in soy can explain 24 percent of the observed di\u00a4erences in the reduction of the agricultural employment share across Brazilian municipalities and 31 percent of the corresponding di\u00a4erences in the growth of the manufacturing employment share. We complement our \u2026ndings with an analysis of the service sector. For this purpose, we extend the theoretical model by incorporating non-traded services. A central feature of the analysis is the distinction between two e\u00a4ects of agricultural technical change: the supply e\u00a4ect and the demand e\u00a4ect. In the case of land-augmenting technical change, the \u2026rst e\u00a4ect is generated by the increase in the marginal product of labor in the agricultural sector, which draws workers out of other sectors. The second e\u00a4ect is generated by the higher income resulting from technical change in agriculture which leads to increased demand for non-traded services. Both e\u00a4ects lead to a reallocation of labor away from the manufacturing sector. However, when technical change is labor-saving, the supply e\u00a4ect releases agricultural workers. As a result, the net e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on industrialization depends on the relative strength of the supply and demand e\u00a4ects. In addition, the demand e\u00a4ect is only driven by an increase in land rents. Thus, its strength depends on the extent to which land-owners consume services in the region where their land is located. Our empirical results imply that in regions more a\u00a4ected by labor-saving technical change labor reallocated from agriculture to manufacturing and not towards services. Our interpretation of these \u2026ndings is that the di\u00a4erences-in-di\u00a4erences empirical strategy is well suited to identify the supply e\u00a4ect to the extent that labor markets are local. However, our model suggests that it might not be suitable to identify the demand e\u00a4ect if land owners do not reside locally or consume services in other regions. Thus, a further investigation of the e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on the service sector is left for future work. Finally, we assess the robustness of our estimates to a number of deviations from our baseline framework. First, estimates are stable when we allow municipalities with di\u00a4erent initial levels of development to be on di\u00a4erential structural transformation trends. Second, we obtain similar estimates in the subsample of Brazilian municipalities where the agricultural frontier did not expand. Third, contemporaneous migration patterns are consistent with the predictions of the model: there is out (in) migration in areas more a\u00a4ected by labor-augmenting (land-augmenting) technical change. Fourth, our estimates are not driven by pre-existing trends in manufacturing employment nor migration \u2021ows. Fifth, our results are robust to using a larger unit of observation, microregions. Sixth, at least 60 percent of our estimated e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on the manufacturing employment share is not driven by the processing of soy and maize in downstream industries nor larger agricultural sector demand for manufacturing inputs. Seventh, our estimates are not driven by contemporaneous changes in commodity prices. Finally, our main results remain statistically signi\u2026cant when we correct standard errors to account for spatial correlation."}, {"section_title": "Related Literature", "text": "There is a long tradition in economics of studying the links between agricultural productivity and industrial development. Nurkse (1953), Schultz (1953) and Rostow (1960) argued that agricultural productivity growth was an essential precondition for the industrial revolution. Classical models of structural transformation formalized their ideas by proposing two main mechanisms through which agricultural productivity can speed up industrial growth in closed economies. First, the demand channel: agricultural productivity growth rises income per capita, which generates demand for manufacturing goods if preferences are non-homothetic [Murphy, Shleifer, Vishny (1989), Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie (2001), Gollin, Parente and Rogerson (2002)]. The higher relative demand for manufactures generates a reallocation of labor away from agriculture. Second, the supply channel: if productivity growth in agriculture is faster than in manufacturing and these goods are complements in consumption, then the relative demand of agriculture does not grow as fast as productivity and labor reallocates towards manufacturing [Baumol (1967), Ngai and Pissarides (2007)]. 6 The view that agricultural productivity can generate manufacturing growth was challenged by scholars studying industrialization experiences in open economies. These scholars argued that high agricultural productivity can retard industrial growth as labor reallocates towards the comparative advantage sector [Mokyr (1976), Field (1978) and Wright (1979)]. Their ideas were formalized by Matsuyama (1992) who showed that the demand and supply channels are not operative in a small open economy that faces a perfectly elastic demand for both goods at world prices. The open economy model we present in this paper di\u00a4ers from Matsuyama's in one key dimension. In his model, there is only one input to production thus technical change is, by de\u2026nition, Hicks-neutral. In our model there are two factors, land and labor, and the two are complements in agricultural production. Thus technical change can be factor-biased. In this setting, a new prediction emerges: when technical change is labor augmenting, an increase in agricultural productivity leads to a reallocation of labor towards the industrial sector even in open economies. 7 Our work also builds on the empirical literature studying the links between agricultural productivity and economic development. 8 The closest precedent to our work is Rosenzweig (2004, 2008) who study the e\u00a4ects of the adoption of high-yielding-varieties (HYV) of corn, rice, sorghum, and wheat during the Green Revolution in India. To guide empirical work, they present a model in which agricultural and manufacturing goods are tradable and technical change is Hicksneutral. Consistent with their model, they \u2026nd that villages with higher improvements in crop yields experienced lower manufacturing growth. Our \u2026ndings are in line with theirs in the case of maize, for which technical change is land-augmenting. However, we \u2026nd the opposite e\u00a4ects 6 Another mechanism generating a reallocation of labor from agriculture to manufacturing is faster growth in the relative supply of one production factor when there are di\u00a4erences in factor intensity across sectors [See Caselli and Coleman (2001), and Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008)]. For a recent survey of the structural transformation literature see Herrendorf, Valentinyi and Rogerson (2013). in the case of soy, for which technical change is labor saving. Thus, relative to theirs, our work highlights the importance of the factor-bias of technical change in shaping the relationship between agricultural productivity and industrial development in open economies. Our model is related to the literature on the Dutch Disease: Corden and Neary (1982) and Krugman (1987). In particular, Corden and Neary consider a three-sector open economy model with non-traded goods. One of the traded sectors is extractive and experiences a boom, which leads to de-industrialization and an expansion of the service sector. We build on their distinction between two e\u00a4ects of the boom: the spending e\u00a4ect and the resource movement e\u00a4ect, which we call the demand and supply e\u00a4ects. Our setting di\u00a4ers in that we consider labor-saving technical change which reduces the marginal product of labor in the booming sector, agriculture. Thus, in our model the net e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on industrialization depends on the relative strength of these e\u00a4ects. Our research also connects to the literature studying the role of manufacturing in economic development. This literature has shown that a reallocation of labor into manufacturing can increase aggregate productivity: \u2026rst, when labor productivity is lower in agriculture than in the rest of the economy [Gollin, Parente and Rogerson (2002), Lagakos and Waugh (2013) and Gollin, Lagakos and Waugh (2014)]; second, when the manufacturing sector is characterized by economies of scale generated by on-the-job accumulation of human capital such as learning-by-doing [Krugman (1987), Lucas (1988), Matsuyama (1992)]. Finally, our work is related to recent empirical papers studying the e\u00a4ects of agricultural productivity on urbanization [Nunn and Qian (2011)], the links between structural transformation and urbanization [Michaels, Rauch and Redding (2012)], the e\u00a4ects of agriculture on local economic activity [Hornbeck and Keskin (2012)], and the role of out-migration from rural areas in favoring the adoption of capital-intensive agricultural technologies [Hornbeck and Naidu (2014)]. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives background information on agriculture in Brazil. Section 3 presents the theoretical model. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the empirical strategy and results. Section 6 shows a set of robustness checks on our main results. Section 7 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Agriculture in Brazil", "text": "In this section we provide background information on recent technological developments in Brazilian agriculture. In particular, we focus on two new agricultural technologies for the cultivation of soy and maize. The \u2026rst is the use of genetically engineered (GE) seeds in soy cultivation. The second is the introduction of a second harvesting season in maize during the same agricultural year, which requires the use of advanced cultivation techniques."}, {"section_title": "Technical Change in Soy: Genetically Engineered Seeds", "text": "The main advantage of GE soy seeds relative to traditional seeds is that they are herbicide resistant, which facilitates the use of no-tillage planting techniques. 9 The planting of traditional seeds is preceded by soil preparation in the form of tillage, the operation of removing the weeds in the seedbed that would otherwise crowd out the crop or compete with it for water and nutrients. In contrast, planting GE soy seeds requires no tillage, as the application of herbicide selectively eliminates all unwanted weeds without harming the crop. As a result, GE soy seeds can be applied directly on last season's crop residue, allowing farmers to save on production costs since less labor is required per unit of land to obtain the same output. 10 The \u2026rst generation of GE soy seeds, the Roundup Ready (RR) variety, was commercially released in the U.S. in 1996 by the agricultural biotechnology \u2026rm Monsanto. In 1998, the Brazilian National Technical Commission on Biosecurity (CTNBio) authorized Monsanto to \u2026eld-test GE soy in Brazil for 5-years as a \u2026rst step before commercialization. Finally, in 2003, the Brazilian government legalized the use of GE soy seeds. 11 Prior to legalization, smuggling of GE soy seeds from Argentina was detected since 2001 according to the Foreign Agricultural Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2001). The new technology spread quickly: in 2006 GE seeds were planted in 46.4% of the area cultivated with soy in Brazil, according to the last Agricultural Census (IBGE, 2006, p.144). In the following years the technology continued spreading to the point that, according to the Foreign Agricultural Service of the USDA, it covered 85% of the area planted with soy in Brazil by the 9 Genetic engineering (GE) techniques allow a precise alteration of a plant's traits. This allows to target a single plant's trait, facilitating the development of plant characteristics with a precision not attainable through traditional plant breeding. In the case of herbicide resistant GE soy seeds, soy genes were altered to include those of a bacteria that was herbicide resistant. 1 0 GE soybeans seeds allow farmers to adopt a new set of techniques that lowers labor requirement for several reasons. First, since GE soybeans are resistant to herbicides, weed control can be done more \u2021exibly. Herbicides can be applied at any time during the season, even after the emergence of the plant. Second, GE soybeans are resistant to a speci\u2026c herbicide (glyphosate), which needs fewer applications: \u2026elds cultivated with GE soybeans require an average of 1.55 sprayer trips against 2.45 of conventional soybeans (Du\u00a4y and Smith, 2001;Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2002). Third, no-tillage production techniques require less labor. This is because the application of chemicals needs fewer and shorter trips than tillage. In addition, no-tillage allows greater density of the crop on the \u2026eld (Huggins and Reganold, 2008). Finally, farmers that adopt GE soybeans report gains in the time to harvest (Du\u00a4y and Smith, 2001). These cost savings might explain why the technology spread fast, even though experimental evidence in the U.S. reports no improvements in yield with respect to conventional soybeans (Fernandez-Cornejo and Caswell, 2006) 1 1 In 2003, Brazilian law 10.688 allowed the commercialization of GE soy for one harvesting season, requiring farmers to burn all unsold stocks after the harvest. This temporary measure was renewed in 2004. Finally, in 2005 -the New Bio-Safety Law -authorized production and commercialization of GE soy in its Roundup Ready variety (art. 35)."}, {"section_title": "2011-2012 harvesting season (USDA, 2012).", "text": "The timing of adoption of GE soy seeds coincides with an increase in labor productivity in soy production and a fast expansion in the area planted with soy in Brazil. Figure 1(a) documents the evolution of soy production per worker between 1980 and 2011. As the Figure shows, labor productivity in soy production has been increasing in Brazil since the early 1990s, and accelerated sharply in the early 2000s: soy production per worker went from 100 tonnes per worker in 2003 to around 300 tonnes per worker in 2011. Labor productivity growth was accompanied by an expansion in area planted with soy. Table 1 reports land use by agricultural activity according to the 1996 and 2006 Agricultural Censuses. It shows that the area cultivated with seasonal crops increased by 10.4 million hectares between 1996 and 2006. 12 Out of these, 6.4 million hectares were converted to soy cultivation. Similarly, Figure 1(b) shows that the area planted with soy has been growing since the 1980s, and experienced a sharp acceleration in the early 2000s. 13 The adoption of GE soy can a\u00a4ect labor demand in the agricultural sector through two channels: the within-crop and the across-crop e\u00a4ects. The \u2026rst e\u00a4ect is due to a reduction in the amount of agricultural workers per hectare required to cultivate soy: labor intensity of soy production fell from 29 workers per 1000 hectares in 1996 to 18 workers per 1000 hectares in 2006 ( Table 2). The timing of this change in labor intensity is illustrated by Figure 1(c), which shows a sharp increase in the area planted per worker in soy production in the early 2000s. 14 This reduction in labor intensity entirely o\u00a4set the potential increase in labor demand for soy due to the expansion in the area planted: Figure 1(d) shows that employment in soy production experienced a constant decrease during the period under study. In turn, the across-crop e\u00a4ect is due to the expansion of soy cultivation over areas previously devoted to other crops. This e\u00a4ect reduces the labor intensity of production in the agricultural sector because soy production is one of the least labor-intensive agricultural activities: its production 1 2 Seasonal crops are those produced from plants that need to be replanted after each harvest, such as soy and maize. 1 3 Yearly data on area planted are from the CONAB survey. This is a survey of farmers and agronomists conducted by an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture to monitor the annual harvests of major crops in Brazil (see Section A2 of the Appendix for a detailed description). We use data from the CONAB survey purely to illustrate the timing of the evolution of aggregate agricultural outcomes during the period under study. In the empirical analysis, instead, we rely exclusively on data from the Agricultural Censuses which covers all farms in the country and it is representative at municipality level. 1 4 Figure 1(c) displays yearly data on area planted with soy from the CONAB survey and yearly data on employment in soy production from the PNAD survey. Table 2 instead is based on data on area planted and employment from the Agricultural Censuses of 1996 and 2006. Notice that the decrease in labor intensity in soy production between 1996 and 2006 implied by Figure 1(c) is larger than the one showed in Table 2 and reported in the text. This is because labor intensity in soy production in Table 2 is computed as total land in farms whose main activity is soy divided by total number of workers in farms whose main activity is soy according to the Agricultural Census, which tends to overestimate the number of workers in soy whenever farms whose main activity is soy produce also other crops (which are, on average, more labor intensive). See section A2 of the Appendix for a detailed description of the data sources used in this section. required 18 workers per 1000 hectares while seasonal crops and permanent crops require 84 and 127, respectively (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Technical Change in Maize: Second Harvesting Season", "text": "During the last two decades Brazilian agriculture experienced also important changes in maize cultivation. Maize used to be cultivated as soy, during the summer season that takes place between August and December. At the beginning of the 1980s a few farmers in the South-East region of Brazil started producing maize after the summer harvest, between March and July. This second season of maize cultivation spread across Brazil, where it is now known as milho safrinha (smallharvest maize). Cultivation of a second season of maize requires the use of modern cultivation techniques. First, more intensive land-use removes nitrogen from the soil, which needs to be replaced by fertilizers. Second, the planting of a second crop requires careful timing, as yields drop considerably due to late planting. Third, herbicides are used to remove residuals from the \u2026rst harvest on time to plant the second crop. Finally, the second season crop needs to be planted one month faster than the \u2026rst, which usually requires higher mechanization. 15 Figure 1(e) documents the evolution of the area cultivated with maize since 1980. The \u2026gure shows that, although the total area devoted to maize has increased only slightly, the area devoted to second season maize has expanded steadily since the beginning of the 1990s. 16 The introduction of a second harvesting season for maize can a\u00a4ect labor demand in the agricultural sector through the within-crop and across-crop e\u00a4ects. The \u2026rst e\u00a4ect is directly due to the introduction of a second harvest which raises labor demand relative to the benchmark of one maize harvest. The second e\u00a4ect is due to the expansion of maize over areas previously dedicated to less-labor intensive activities, which also tends to increase labor demand. According to the 1996 Agricultural Census, maize cultivation is more labor intensive than the main agricultural activities in Brazil. In this year, labor intensity in maize production was 100 workers per 1000 hectares, above the labor intensity of soy, other cereals and cattle ranching, reported in Table 2. 17 1 5 For a more detailed discussion, see EMBRAPA (2006) and CONAB (2012). 1 6 Data on area cultivated with maize broken down by the season of harvest of maize is publicly available only at the aggregate level. For this reason in section 5, when we study municipality-level data, we will not be able to distinguish between maize cultivation in each seasons. 1 7 Information on the area and number of workers employed in farms whose main activity is maize production is publicly available only for the Agricultural Census of 1996. In Table 2 we therefore report labor intensity for the \"all cereals\" category, which we also observe in 2006 and includes rice, wheat, maize and other cereals. For a measure of maize labor intensity under advanced cultivation techniques, we refer to data for the U.S. The USDA Agricultural Resources Management Survey (ARMS), reports that maize is more labor intensive than soy: labor cost of maize cultivation in 2001 and 2005 were on average 1.8 and 1.4 times higher than the labor cost for soy cultivation."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "In this section we present a simple model to illustrate the e\u00a4ects of factor-biased technical change on structural transformation in open economies.

Production of the agricultural good requires both labor and land, and takes the CES form: where Q a denotes production of the agricultural good, the two production factors are labor (L a ) and land (T a ); A N is Hicks-neutral technical change, A L is labor-augmenting technical change and A T is land-augmenting technical change. The parameter > 0 captures the elasticity of substitution between land and labor, and 2 (0; 1). The production function described by equation 1implies the following marginal product of labor: This expression shows that Hicks-neutral and land-augmenting technical change increase the marginal product of labor. However, labor augmenting technical change generates two opposing e\u00a4ects on the marginal product of labor. First, increases in A L imply that each worker is more productive, as can be seen in the \u2026rst term of the equation. Second, a larger A L generates a reduction in the amount of land per unit of labor in e\u00a2 ciency units (A T T =A L L a ), which tends to reduce the marginal product of labor.

As a result, this condition is more likely to be satis\u2026ed when the equilibrium level of agricultural employment is high. 1 9 See Neary (1981) and Acemoglu (2010) for more general discussions of the properties of technical change that reduces the marginal product of labor. We follow Acemoglu in using the term strongly labor saving. output, labor-augmenting technical change induces a reduction in the marginal product of labor in agriculture. In equilibrium, the marginal product of labor in agriculture is given by international prices and manufacturing productivity, thus it must stay constant when A L increases. Thus, employment in agriculture must fall to increase the marginal product of labor to its equilibrium level. Proof. See Appendix. b) Land and labor are not strong complements: @L a @A L > 0 and @L m @A L < 0: An increase in A L generates a reallocation of labor from manufacturing to agriculture. This is because if the elasticity of substitution is larger than the land share of output, labor-augmenting technical change induces an increase in the marginal product of labor in agriculture. Land-augmenting technical change: @L a @A T > 0 and @L m @A T < 0: An increase in A T generates a reallocation of labor from manufacturing to agriculture. To see why this is the case, note that land-augmenting technical change rises the marginal product of labor in agriculture (see equation 2). Hicks-neutral technical change: @L a @A N > 0 and @L m @A N < 0: An increase in A N generates a reallocation of labor from manufacturing to agriculture: To see why this is the case, note that a Hicks-neutral increase in agricultural productivity rises the marginal product of labor in agriculture (see equation 2).\nThe effect of labor augmenting technical change on agricultural employment depends on whether the elasticity of substitution is smaller than the equilibrium land share of agricultural production (\u03c3 < 1 \u2212 \u0393 * ). When this condition is satisfied, we say that land and labor are strong complements. a) Land and labor are strong complements: Proof. We obtain \u2202L * a \u2202A L from the solution for L * a as a function of the equilibrium land share given by equation 6, as follows: where the last step used the following solution for the elasticity of the land to labor share ratio with respect to labor-augmenting technical change: b) Land and labor are not strong complements:"}, {"section_title": "Empirical Predictions", "text": "In the following section, we test the predictions of the model by studying the simultaneous expansion of two new agricultural technologies: GE soy and second-harvest maize. In the case of soy, the advantage of GE seeds relative to traditional ones is that they are herbicide resistant, which reduces the need to plow the land. As a result, this new technology requires less labor per unit of land to yield the same output and can be characterized as labor-augmenting technical change. In the case of maize, farmers started introducing advanced cultivation techniques and inputs which permit to grow two crops a year, e\u00a4ectively increasing the land endowment. Thus, this new technology can be characterized as land-augmenting technical change. In our empirical analysis, we quantify the e\u00a4ects of these two types of technical change on observable variables in the agricultural and manufacturing sector and test whether they display the sign patterns predicted by the model. We analyze data aggregated at the municipality level, which is our unit of analysis. As a result, we interpret the production functions in the model as describing the aggregate level of agricultural and manufacturing production (Q a and Q m ) in a given municipality. In addition, the agricultural census reports information on employment aggregated across agricultural activities. Thus, we interpret equation 1as describing the aggregate production function for the agricultural sector, where P a Q a is the value of agricultural output, L a is agricultural employment and T a is land in agricultural establishments. We trace the e\u00a4ects of the two new agricultural technologies on these directly observed variables to test the following predictions of the model regarding the e\u00a4ects of technical change. Proof. See Appendix."}, {"section_title": "Services", "text": "In this section we extend the model by including a third sector which produces non-traded services. The purpose of this extension is to understand to what extent the predictions of the model discussed above are modi\u2026ed by the presence of non-traded goods. A detailed analysis of the model with services and all derivations are contained in the appendix. We assume that the production function for services uses only labor and displays constant returns to scale. As a result, Q s = A s L s ; where Q s denotes production of services and L s denotes labor allocated to the service sector. Note that because services are non-tradable, production can no longer be determined independently of consumption. Thus, we specify preferences and factor ownership. Consumers have the following Cobb-Douglas preferences over the three goods: where a + m + s = 1: 20 There are-two types of agents in the economy: L workers, each endowed with one unit of labor; and T land-owners, each endowed with one unit of land. We assume that workers reside in the same region where they work. In contrast, land owners can reside in any region. We denote by the share of land owners residing in the same region where their land is located. Then, aggregate service consumption in a region is where c s;L is the consumption of workers and c s;T the consumption of land-owners. 21;22 In this setting, equilibrium employment in agriculture is the same as in the model without nontraded services, given by equation 4. This is because wages are set by the value of the marginal product of labor in manufacturing. Thus, the e\u00a4ects of agricultural technical change on agricultural employment are identical to the ones in the model without services. We call them the supply-side e\u00a4ects of technical change: @L a @A i for i = N; T; L: In turn, equilibrium employment in services can be written as: where r is the equilibrium land rent. 23 Note that workers spend a constant share of their labor endowment on services ( s L). This is because the service sector uses only labor for production. Thus, any increase in wages has both an income and substitution e\u00a4ect on the demand for services by workers. The income e\u00a4ect increases their demand for services as their labor endowment is more valuable. The substitution e\u00a4ect reduces the demand for services as their price, the wage, increases. When preferences are Cobb-Douglas both e\u00a4ects have the same magnitude and cancel-out. 24 As a result, agricultural technical change can only a\u00a4ect the demand for services through its e\u00a4ect on the consumption of land owners: s r w T: In turn, agricultural technical change always increases land rents. Thus, the demand for services and employment in the service sector increase. We call 2 0 Our use of a homothetic utility function follows the \u2026ndings in Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013). They show that a homothetic utility function where the elasticity of substitution across sectors is smaller than one provides the best \u2026t to the Postwar U.S. data when sectoral consumption data is measured in terms of value added. Because we use data on employment to measure structural transformation, our analysis tracks value added better than \u2026nal goods consumption. As a result we use a homothetic utility function. However, we assume that the elasticity of substitution across sectors is equal to one to make the model simpler. We discuss below how the predictions of our model would be modi\u2026ed if this elasticity was smaller than one. 2 1 Note that is the share of services consumption of land owners that is spent locally. Thus, an alternative interpretation is that land-owners reside locally but consume some services in other regions. 2 2 Note that we are not taking into account the local consumption of land owners who reside in the region under consideration but own land in other regions. The reason for this omission is that, in the model, their demand for services would not be a\u00a4ected by technical change in the region where they live but in the region where they own land. 2 3 See appendix for detailed derivations and closed form solutions for r and L s : 2 4 If, instead of Cobb-Douglas, preferences were homothetic with an elasticity of substitution smaller than one, as suggested by Herrendorf et al. (2013), the income e\u00a4ect would dominate. Thus, the demand for services from workers would be increasing in wages. this the demand side e\u00a4ects of technical change: @L s @A i for i = N; T; L. When technical change is Hicks-neutral or land-augmenting, both the supply-side and demandside e\u00a4ects reduce manufacturing employment. However, when technical change is strongly laborsaving each e\u00a4ect moves manufacturing employment in opposite directions. On the one hand, the supply side e\u00a4ect releases labor from agriculture, increasing the labor supply for manufacturing. On the other hand, the demand-side e\u00a4ect increases labor demand in services, reducing the supply of labor for manufacturing. Therefore, the net e\u00a4ect on manufacturing employment depends on the relative strength of each e\u00a4ect. In the appendix, we show that the supply-side e\u00a4ect dominates as long as < (1 ) (1 s ) : Note that because 1 s < 1; this condition is stronger than the condition required for agricultural technical change to be strongly labor-saving : it is satis\u2026ed as long as land-owners's consumption share of local services ( s ) is not too large."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The main data sources are the Agricultural Census, the Population Census, and the FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones database.

The empirical analysis focuses on the last two rounds of the census which have been carried out in 1996 and in 2006. The Agricultural Census data is collected through direct interviews with the managers of each agricultural establishment and is made available online by the IBGE aggregated at municipality level. 26 The agricultural variables of interest are the share of agricultural land planted with soy and maize, the value of production per worker, and labor intensity. 27 The last two variables are aggregated across all agricultural activities. This is because the unit of observation in the census is the agricultural establishment, and these tend to perform several activities. As a result, it is not 2 5 In this section we brie \u2021y discuss the main data sources and variables of interest.

In terms of area, the average AMC has an area of around 2,000 square kilometers, while the average municipality has an area of 1,500 square kilometers. 2 7 The measure of agricultural employment used to construct the value of production per worker and labor intensity includes: employees, family members employed in farm activities, sharecroppers and people who reside in the farm and perform agricultural activities without a formal contract. There are two potential problems with this de\u2026nition. The \u2026rst is potential double counting of seasonal workers that work in more than one farm during the same calendar year. The second is that this variable does not include employees hired by service provider companies that are contracted by the farm to perform agricultural activities. See section A4 of the Appendix for a more detailed description of this variable. possible to obtain a measure of employment by crop. We use the Brazilian Population Census to construct measures of the sectoral composition of employment and average wages. The Population Census is conducted every 10 years and it covers the entire Brazilian population. We use data from the last two rounds of the census (2000 and 2010) so to observe the variables of interest before and after the legalization of the GE soy seeds. 28 Data on the sector of employment is collected through a special survey that is administered to a representative sample of the Brazilian population within narrow cells de\u2026ned by geographical district, sex, age and urban or rural residence. The variables we focus on are the sector in which the person was working during the previous week and its wage. 29 For each municipality, we compute employment shares as the number of workers in each sector divided by total employment. 30 We obtain an exogenous measure of technological change in agriculture by using estimates of potential soy and maize yields across geographical areas of Brazil from the FAO-GAEZ database. These yields are calculated by incorporating local soil and weather characteristics into a model that predicts the maximum attainable yields for each crop in a given area. In addition, the data- We construct a measure of technical change in soy or maize production for each municipality by deducting the average potential yield under low inputs from the average potential yield under high inputs. Figure 2 illustrates the resulting measure of technical change in soy at the municipality level, while Figure 3 shows the same measure at the micro-region level.

In the following section we report simple correlations between the expansion of the area planted with soy and maize and agricultural and industrial labor market outcomes in each municipality. As discussed above, these correlations are not informative about the causal relation between these variables.

These basic correlations in the data attempt to answer the following question: did areas where soy (maize) expanded experience faster (slower) structural transformation? In section 5.1.1 we present a set of OLS estimates of equations relating agricultural outcomes to the percentage of farm land cultivated with soy and maize. In the following section 5.1.2 we present the corresponding estimates for manufacturing outcomes. The basic form of the equations to be estimated in this section is: where j indexes municipalities, t indexes time, j are municipality \u2026xed e\u00a4ects and t are time \u2026xed e\u00a4ects. y jt is an outcome that varies across municipalities and time and Soy (Maize) Area Agricultural Area is the total area reaped with soy (maize) divided by total farm land. 33 We observe agricultural outcomes for the census years 1996 and 2006. Because \u2026xed e\u00a4ects and \u2026rst di\u00a4erence estimates are identical when considering only two periods, we estimate (7) in \u2026rst di\u00a4erences: 5.1.1 Agricultural Outcomes: Productivity, Labor Intensity and Employment Share Table 4 reports OLS estimates of equation 8for three agricultural outcomes. The \u2026rst is labor productivity, measured as the value of output per worker in agriculture.The second is labor intensity, measured as the number of workers per unit of land in agriculture. The third outcome is the employment share of agriculture. The \u2026rst two columns of Table 4 show that in areas where soy cultivation expanded, the value of agricultural production per worker increased and labor intensity in agriculture decreased. These empirical \u2026ndings are consistent with the characterization of soy technical change as strongly laborsaving. The estimated coe\u00a2 cients imply that a 1 percentage point increase in soy area share corresponds to a 0.58 percent increase in labor productivity, and a 0.48 percent reduction in labor intensity. In contrast, in areas where maize cultivation expanded labor intensity increased. This evidence is consistent with our characterization of technical change in maize as land-augmenting. The estimated coe\u00a2 cients imply that a 1 percentage point increase in maize area share corresponds to a 1.6 percent increase in labor productivity, and a 0.74 percent increase in labor intensity. Next, we analyze the relationship between the expansion in soy and maize area and sectoral employment shares. Note that we source information on sectoral employment shares from the Population Census which reports information for the years 2000 and 2010. Thus, our estimation of equation 8relates changes in employment shares between 2000 and 2010 to changes in the area planted with soy and maize between 1996 and 2006. In both cases the initial year precedes the timing of legalization of soybean seeds in Brazil 2003, as well as the \u2026rst date in which smuggling of GE soy seeds was documented (2001). Column 3 of Table 4 shows that the employment share of agriculture decreased in places where soy expanded while estimates for maize are not statistically signi\u2026cant. The estimated coe\u00a2 cient implies that a 1 percentage point increase in soy area share corresponds to a 0.09 percentage point reduction in the agricultural employment share. The \u2026nding that the agricultural employment share fell in areas where soy expanded suggests that soy technical change is not only labor-augmenting but also strongly labor-saving. In this case, our model predicts that technology adoption reduces labor demand in agriculture. and logging."}, {"section_title": "Manufacturing Outcomes: Employment Share, Total Employment and Wages", "text": "We now turn to the question of whether manufacturing employment expanded (contracted) in areas where soy (maize) expanded. Table 5 reports OLS estimates of equation 8for three manufacturing sector outcomes: employment share, level of employment, and average wage. The \u2026rst column of Table 5 shows that municipalities where soy expanded experienced a faster These \u2026ndings are consistent with the sequence of events predicted by the model, namely that the adoption of strongly labor-saving agricultural technologies reduces labor demand in the agricultural sector and induces a reallocation of labor towards the industrial sector. However, these correlations are not informative about the direction of causality. For example, these correlations are consistent with the following alternative sequence of events: productivity growth in the industrial sector increases labor demand and wages, inducing agricultural \u2026rms to switch to less labor-intensive crops, like soy. In this section we attempt to establish the direction of causality. Our empirical strategy relies on the assumption that goods can be traded across geographical areas of Brazil but labor markets are local. We investigate whether exogenous shocks to local agricultural productivity lead to changes in the size of the local industrial sector. Thus, our ideal unit of observation would be a region containing a city and its hinterland with limited migration across regions. We attempt to approximate this ideal using municipalities as our main level of geographical aggregation. This approach is adequate for municipalities in the interior of the country, which typically include both rural and urban areas. However, municipalities tend to be mostly urban in more densely populated coastal areas. To address this concern, we show that our estimates are robust to using a larger unit of observation: micro-regions. Figures 2 and 3 contain maps of Brazil displaying both levels of aggregation. 34 We propose to identify the causal e\u00a4ect the new technologies on structural transformation by exploiting the timing of adoption and the di\u00a4erential impact of the new technology on potential yields across geographical areas. Let us \u2026rst consider whether the timing of adoption is likely to be exogenous with respect to developments in the Brazilian economy. GE soy seeds were commercially released in the U.S. in 1996, and legalized in Brazil in 2003. Given that the seeds were developed in the U.S., their date of approval for commercialization in the U.S., 1996, is arguably exogenous with respect to developments in the Brazilian economy. In contrast, the date of legalization, 2003, responded partly to pressure from Brazilian farmers. In addition, smuggling of GE soy seeds across the border with Argentina is reported since 2001. Thus, in our empirical analysis we would ideally compare outcomes before and after 1996. This is possible when variables are sourced from the Agricultural Census. For variables sourced from the Population Census we compare outcomes before and after 2000. Because this year predates both legalization and the \u2026rst reports of smuggling, the timing can still be considered exogenous. Second, the new technology had a di\u00a4erential impact on potential yields depending on soil and weather characteristics. Thus, we exploit these exogenous di\u00a4erences in potential yields across geographical areas as our source of cross-sectional variation in the intensity of the treatment. To implement this strategy, we need an exogenous measure of potential yields for soy, which we obtain from the FAO-GAEZ database. These potential yields are estimated using an agricultural model that predicts yields for each crop given climate and soil conditions. As potential yields are a function of weather and soil characteristics, not of actual yields in Brazil, they can be used as a source of exogenous variation in agricultural productivity across geographical areas. Crucially for our analysis, the database reports potential yields under di\u00a4erent technologies or input combinations. Yields under the low technology are described as those obtained using traditional seeds and no use of chemicals, while yields under the high technology are obtained using improved seeds, optimum application of fertilizers and herbicides and mechanization. Thus, the di\u00a4erence in yields between the high and low technology captures the e\u00a4ect of moving from traditional agriculture to a technology that uses improved seeds and optimum weed control, among other characteristics. We thus expect this increase in yields to be a good predictor of the pro\u2026tability of adopting herbicide-resistant GE soy seeds. More formally, our basic empirical strategy consists in estimating the following equation: where y jt is an outcome that varies across municipalities and time, j indexes municipalities, t indexes time, j are municipality \u2026xed e\u00a4ects, t are time \u2026xed e\u00a4ects and A soy jt is equal to the potential soy yield under high inputs from 2003 onwards and to the potential soy yield under low inputs in the years before 2003. A soy jt can be thought of as the empirical counterpart of the labor augmenting technical change A L presented in our model. In the case of agricultural outcomes, our period of interest spans the ten years between the last two censuses which took place in 1996 and 2006. Similarly, in the case of sectoral employment shares and manufacturing outcomes, our period of analysis spans the ten years between the last two population censuses which took place in 2000 and 2010. We thus estimate a \u2026rst-di\u00a4erence version of equation 9: where the outcome of interest, y j is the change in outcome variables between the last two census years; A soy j is the potential yield of soy under the high technology minus the potential yield of soy under the low technology. Figure 2 contains a map of Brazilian municipalities displaying this measure of technical change. Additionally, we include a control for the share of rural population in 1991 to allow for di\u00a4erential trends for municipalities with di\u00a4erent initial urbanization rates. This is important because, as mentioned above, coastal municipalities tend to have higher urbanization rates and there were migration \u2021ows from rural to urban areas during the period under study. 35 In the case of maize, we follow a similar empirical strategy. However, it is important to note that the cultivation techniques necessary to introduce a second harvesting season were developed within Brazil. Thus, the timing of its expansion can not be considered exogenous to other developments in the Brazilian economy. Nevertheless, to the extent that the di\u00a4usion of this new technology across space depends on exogenous local soil and weather characteristics, the variation in adoption which we use in our empirical analysis is arguably exogenous to developments in the local industrial sector. As noted in Section 2, the introduction of a second harvesting eason for maize requires the use of modern techniques that are intensive in the use of fertilizers, herbicides and tractors. Then, we expect that the the di\u00a4erence in FAO-GAEZ potential yields between the high and low technology captures the pro\u2026tability of introducing a second harvesting season for maize. Thus, we augment the equation described above to include the following variable:  where A maize j is the potential yield of maize under high inputs minus the potential yield of maize under low inputs. A potential concern with our identi\u2026cation strategy is that, although the soil and weather characteristics that drive the variation in A soy j and A maize j across geographical areas are exogenous, they might be correlated with initial levels of development across Brazilian municipalities. For example, to the extent that municipalities with heterogeneous initial levels of development experience di\u00a4erent growth paths, our estimates could be capturing di\u00a4erential structural transformation trends across municipalities. To assess the extent of this potential concern we \u2026rst compare observable characteristics of municipalities with high and low levels of our exogenous measure of technical change in agriculture. Whenever signi\u2026cant di\u00a4erences emerge, we show that our estimates are stable when we introduce controls for di\u00a4erential trends across municipalities with heterogeneous initial characteristics. Table 6 compares municipalities above and below the median change in potential soy yields ( A soy j ) in terms of observable characteristics in 1991, before the introduction of GE soy. 36 Municipalities above the median potential increase in soy yields are characterized by smaller shares of rural population and agricultural employment. In addition, they display a larger manufacturing employment share, literacy rate, and income per capita than municipalities below the median. Thus, in what follows, we always show that our estimates are stable when we introduce controls for di\u00a4erential trends across municipalities with heterogeneous initial characteristics in our baseline speci\u2026cation 11, as follows: where X j;1991 are the set of municipality characteristics discussed above. In the following subsections we report estimates of the e\u00a4ects of technical change on agricultural production and the sectoral composition of employment. In particular, we report estimates of the e\u00a4ects of technical change on the expansion of soy and maize cultivation in section 5.2.1; on agricultural outcomes in section 5.2.2; on manufacturing outcomes in section 5.2.3; and on services in section 5.2.4."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Outcomes: Soy and Maize Expansion", "text": "In this section we document the relationship between technical change measured by the increase in the FAO-GAEZ potential yields of soy and maize, and the actual change in the share of agricultural land cultivated with each crop. The objective of this exercise is to check whether the change in potential yields is a good proxy of the pro\u2026tability of adoption of the new agricultural technologies. If this is the case, we expect the increase in potential yield of a given crop to predict the actual expansion in the share of agricultural land cultivated with that crop between 1996 and 2006. First, we expect that areas with a higher increase in potential soy yields when switching to the high technology are those adopting genetically engineered soy on a larger scale. Thus, we start by estimating equation 10where the outcome of interest, y j is the change in the share of agricultural land devoted to GE soy between 1996 and 2006. Note that because this share was zero everywhere in 1996, the change in the area share corresponds to its level in 2006. Estimates are shown in column 1 of Table 7: the increase in potential soy yield predicts the expansion in GE soy area as a share of agricultural area between 1996 and 2006. The point estimate remains stable when controlling for initial municipality characteristics, as shown in column 2. In columns 3 and 4 of Table 7 we perform a falsi\u2026cation test by looking at whether our measure of technical change in soy explains the expansion in the area planted with non-GE soy. In this case, the coe\u00a2 cients are negative and signi\u2026cant. This \u2026nding supports our claim that the change in potential soy yield captures the bene\u2026ts of adopting GE soy vis-\u00e0-vis traditional soy seeds. Next, we jointly analyze the e\u00a4ects of technical change in soy and maize on the area planted with each crop. For this purpose, we use the broader measure of planted area with soy instead of GE soy. 37 This permits to control for municipality \u2026xed e\u00a4ects by focusing on changes in area planted rather than levels. We start by estimating equation 12where the outcome of interest, y j is the change in share of agricultural land devoted to either soy or maize between 1996 and 2006. Estimates are reported in Table 8. First, note that while soy technical change has a positive e\u00a4ect on the area planted with soy (column 1), it does not have a signi\u2026cant e\u00a4ect on the area planted with maize (column 4). Similarly, maize technical change only has a positive e\u00a4ect on the area planted with maize (columns 2 and 3). These \u2026ndings suggest the change in potential yields when switching to the high technology are good measures of crop-speci\u2026c technical change in soy and maize during this period. In addition, both estimates are stable when we add controls for municipality characteristics. This \u2026nding suggests that the di\u00a4erential expansion of these crops across municipalities is not driven by di\u00a4erential trends across municipalities with di\u00a4erent initial levels of development. The size of the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j implies that a one standard deviation increase in potential soy yield corresponds to an increase in the soy share of agricultural land of 0.26 of a standard deviation. To understand the magnitude of our estimate, this is an increase of agricultural land devoted to soy by 877 hectares in response to a 0.85 tons per hectare increase in potential soy yield. The corresponding estimate for maize implies that a one standard deviation increase in potential maize yield corresponds to a 0.08 of a standard deviation increase in the maize share of agricultural land. This means that, in response to a 1.8 tons per hectare increase in potential maize yield, agricultural land devoted to maize increases by 426 hectares."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Outcomes: Productivity, Labor Intensity and Employment Share", "text": "In this section we study the e\u00a4ects of agricultural technical change on agricultural production and employment.

Estimates reported in columns 1 and 3 indicate that areas where potential soy yields increased relatively more, experienced a larger increase in the value of agricultural production per worker and a larger reduction in labor intensity between 1996 and 2006. Next, we study the e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change in soy on the agricultural employment share. Estimates reported in column 5 indicate that areas with a larger increase in potential soy yield experienced a faster reduction in the agricultural employment share between 2000 and 2010. Note that estimated coe\u00a2 cients are stable or slightly larger when we control for lagged municipality characteristics in columns 2, 4 and 6. This \u2026nding indicates that our estimates are not capturing di\u00a4erential growth trends across municipalities. Because technical change in soy is characterized as labor augmenting, these empirical \u2026ndings are consistent with the predictions of the model for the case where land are labor are strong complements in agricultural production (see Prediction 1). Thus, they imply that technical change in soy was strongly labor-saving. Thus, the estimates of the e\u00a4ects of soy technical change con\u2026rm the conclusions drawn from the simple correlations in the data reported in Table 4. The estimates discussed above can be used to compute the elasticity of the agricultural employment share to changes in agricultural labor productivity due to GE soy adoption. We compute this elasticity as the ratio of the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j when the outcome is agricultural employment share, and the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j when the outcome is agricultural labor productivity. 38 Using our more conservative estimates, namely those that include all municipality controls in columns 2 and 6, this ratio is equal to: 0:021=0:131 = 0:158. 39 The size of this elasticity implies that a 1 percent increase in agricultural labor productivity corresponds to a 0.158 percentage points decrease in the agricultural employment share. To illustrate the magnitude of these estimates, we compute how much of the di\u00a4erences in the speed of structural transformation across Brazilian regions can soy technical change explain, as follows. Note that a municipality shocked with a one standard deviation increase in potential soy yield experienced an increase in agricultural labor productivity of 11 percent, and a corresponding 1.76 percentage points decrease in agricultural employment share. 40 This estimate corresponds to 24 percent of a standard deviation in the change of the agricultural employment share between 2000 and 2010 (7.4 percentage points, see Table 3). In the case of maize, the estimated coe\u00a2 cients reported in columns 3 and 5 indicate that areas with higher increase in potential maize yield experienced a larger increase in labor intensity and the agricultural employment share during the period under study. These \u2026ndings are consistent with the predictions of the model for the e\u00a4ects of land-augmenting technical change (See Prediction 2). In addition, column 1 shows that areas where maize yields increased relatively more experienced a smaller increase in the value of agricultural output per worker. Our model is too stylized to capture this feature in the data, which is likely driven by the across-crop e\u00a4ect of technical change: reallocation of labor towards maize production reduces the value of output per worker in agriculture. This is because maize production is more labor-intensive than soy production, thus the value of the average product of labor is lower for maize. 41 3 8 Due to the di\u00a4erent timing of the Agricultural and Population Censuses, agricultural labor productivity changes are measured over the period 1996-2006 while employment share changes are measured over the period 2000-2010. Thus, the elasticity estimates correspond to the e\u00a4ect of 4-year lagged agricultural productivity changes on employment shares. 3 9 We compute this elasticity in the same way we would compute a Wald estimator in an instrumental variable setting, where the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j in column 2 is the \u2026rst stage coe\u00a2 cient, and the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j in column 6 is the reduced form coe\u00a2 cient. 4 0 The \u2026rst number is computed multiplying one standard deviation in A soy j by the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j in our speci\u2026cation with municipality controls when the outcome is agricultural labor productivity (column 2 of Table  9): 0:851 0:131 = 0:111: The second number is computed multiplying the predicted increase in agricultural labor productivity for one standard deviation in A soy j by the elasticity of agricultural employment share to agricultural labor productivity: 0:111 0:158 = 0:0176. 4 1 A more formal explanation of the e\u00a4ect of labor reallocation towards maize on the value of agricultural output per worker follows. Suppose that there are only two crops, soy and maize, and two production factors, land and labor. In addition, maize production is more labor-intensive than soy. The value of output per worker in agriculture is de\u2026ned as P Y To sum up, the results presented in Table 9 suggest that the introduction of new agricultural technologies in Brazil had a sizable impact on agricultural labor markets. Areas where the potential impact of GE soy adoption was higher experienced an increase in the value of agricultural production per worker, a reduction in the number of workers per unit of land, and a reduction in the employment share of agriculture. These \u2026ndings are consistent with the predictions of the model for the e\u00a4ects of strongly labor-saving technical change. In the case of maize, areas where the potential impact of the introduction of a second harvesting season was higher experienced an increase in labor intensity and in the employment share of agriculture. These \u2026ndings are consistent with the predictions of the model for the e\u00a4ects of land-augmenting technical change."}, {"section_title": "Manufacturing Outcomes: Employment Share, Employment and Wages", "text": "In this section we study the e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on manufacturing employment and wages. Table 10 reports the results of estimating equation 12 The estimates discussed above can be used to compute the elasticity of manufacturing employment share to changes in agricultural labor productivity due to GE soy adoption. We compute this elasticity as in section 5.2.2: we divide the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j when the outcome is manufacturing employment share by the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j when the outcome is agricultural labor productivity. When we estimate the speci\u2026cation including controls for lagged municipality characteristics, this ratio is equal to: 0:021=0:131 = 0:161. This elasticity implies that reduces the value of output per worker in agriculture. This is because if soy production is more land-intensive than maize production ( Ts Ls > Tm Lm ), the value of the average product of labor is higher for soy ( PsYs Ls > PmYm Lm ): To see why this is the case, note that the zero pro\u2026t conditions for maize and soy (PiYi = rTi + wLi for i = s; m) imply a 1% increase in agricultural labor productivity corresponds to a 0.161 percentage points increase in manufacturing employment share. As in the previous section, we illustrate the magnitude of these estimates by computing how much of the di\u00a4erences in the speed of structural transformation across Brazilian regions can be explained by technical change in soy. Recall that a municipality shocked with a one standard deviation increase in potential soy yield experienced an increase in agricultural labor productivity of 11 percent, 42 and a corresponding 1.79 percentage points increase in manufacturing employment share. 43 This estimate corresponds to 31% of a standard deviation in the change of manufacturing employment share between 2000 and 2010 (5.7 percentage points, see Table 3). In the case of maize, the estimates reported in columns 1 and 2 of Table 10 indicate that areas where potential maize yields increased relatively more experienced a smaller increases in the manufacturing employment share. In addition, columns 3 and 4 show that not only the share of manufacturing employment fell but also its absolute level. Finally, columns 5 and 6 show that manufacturing wages increased. These estimates are consistent with prediction 2 of the model. These estimates are consistent with the empirical predictions of our model: technical change in maize is labor-biased thus increases labor demand in agriculture, generating an increase in wages and a reallocation of labor away from the manufacturing sector."}, {"section_title": "Services and Other Sectors", "text": "In this section we complement our empirical \u2026ndings with an analysis of the service sector. First, note that the estimates of the e\u00a4ects of technical change on the agricultural and manufacturing employment shares discussed above have a similar magnitude. To make this point clearer, we reproduce them in Table 11, where we also include estimates for the service and other sectors. 44 The point estimates of the e\u00a4ect of soy technical change on the agriculture and manufacturing employment shares have the same size: they are -0.021 and 0.021, respectively, both with a standard error of 0.002. At the same time, the estimates of the e\u00a4ects on the service and other sectors are very small and not statistically di\u00a4erent from zero. This implies that labor reallocated from agriculture to manufacturing and not towards services. 4 2 This number is computed as before, by multiplying one standard deviation in A soy j by the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j in our speci\u2026cation with municipality controls when the outcome is agricultural labor productivity (column 2 of Table 9): 0:851 0:131 = 0:111 4 3 This number is computed multiplying the predicted increase in agricultural labor productivity for one standard deviation in A soy j by the elasticity of manufacturing employment share to agricultural labor productivity: 0:111 0:161 = 0:0179. 4 4 The services sector includes: construction, commerce, lodging and restaurants, transport, \u2026nance, housing services, domestic workers and other personal services. Other sectors include: public administration, education, health, international organizations, extraction and public utilities. In the theory section we identi\u2026ed two e\u00a4ects of labor-saving technical change in agriculture: the supply e\u00a4ect and the demand e\u00a4ect. The supply e\u00a4ect is generated by the reduction in the marginal product of labor in the agricultural sector, which reduces agricultural employment. The demand e\u00a4ect is generated by the higher income resulting from agricultural productivity growth which leads to increased demand for services. As a result, the net e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on industrialization depends on the relative strength of the supply and demand e\u00a4ects. In addition, the demand e\u00a4ect is driven by the increase land rents, thus its strength depends on the extent to which land-owners consume services in the region where their land is located. This suggests that the absence of an e\u00a4ect of technical change on employment in the service sector might be related to the fact that in some areas of Brazil land owners do not reside locally or consume services produced in large cities. In sum, our empirical analysis implies that in regions more a\u00a4ected by agricultural technical change labor reallocated from agriculture to manufacturing and not towards services. Our interpretation of these \u2026ndings is that the di\u00a4erences-in-di\u00a4erences empirical strategy is well suited to identify the supply e\u00a4ect to the extent that labor markets are local. However, our model suggests that it might not be suitable to identify the demand e\u00a4ect if land owners do not consume local services. Thus, a further investigation of the e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on non-traded sectors is left for future work."}, {"section_title": "Variable Factor Endowments", "text": "The model presented in Section 3 describes a small open economy where goods can be freely traded but factor endowments are \u2026xed.

However, the period under study is characterized by signi\u2026cant internal migration \u2021ows: 16 percent of the population aged between 16 and 55 years old had moved to their 2010 municipality of residence during the previous 10 years. In addition, Brazil has vast areas of underutilized land, which were in part converted to agricultural activities during the period under study. Between 1996 and 2006 the land used for cultivation or cattle ranching increased by 7 percent to 154 million hectares in the regions of the North, North-East and Center-West. Thus, in this section, we investigate the role of migration and the expansion in the agricultural frontier."}, {"section_title": "Labor", "text": "We \u2026rst investigate the impact of agricultural technical change on migration \u2021ows. The model predicts that municipalities more a\u00a4ected by labor saving technical change (GE soy) experience a larger contraction in labor demand in the agricultural sector. Because labor is assumed to be immobile across municipalities, all the adjustment to technological change occurs through a reallocation of labor towards the manufacturing sector. However, if workers could reallocate to other municipalities, some of this adjustment would occur through out-migration. To test this prediction, we construct net migration rates for every municipality between 2000 and 2010 using data from the population census. 45 Next, we estimate the baseline speci\u2026cation described by equation 12using the net migration rate in each municipality as dependent variable. Estimation results are presented in the \u2026rst column of Table 12. The estimated coe\u00a2 cient on the change in soy potential yields is negative and signi\u2026cant, indicating that municipalities with larger increases in potential soy yields experienced a net out \u2021ow of migrants between 2000 and 2010. These estimates can be used to assess the relative importance of the two adjustment mechanisms mentioned above: labor reallocation towards other sectors and out-migration. For this purpose, we can \u2026rst compute the elasticity of migration \u2021ows to changes in agricultural labor productivity due to GE soy adoption: a 1 percent increase in agricultural labor productivity corresponds to a 0.097 percentage points decrease in the migration rate. 46 This amounts to roughly a third (0.37) of the reduction in the employment share of the agricultural sector. 47 Finally, let us note that the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on the change in maize potential yields is positive and signi\u2026cant, indicating that municipalities with higher increase in potential maize yield experienced a net in \u2021ow of migrants in the same period, as expected. The \u2026ndings discussed above suggest that the presence of migration \u2021ows across municipalities dampen the e\u00a4ects of technical change on sectoral employment shares, as part of the adjustment occurs through migration \u2021ows. In particular, in our model, we can think of out-migration induced by labor-saving technical change as a reduction in the labor endowment, which would result 4 5 Net migration rates are de\u2026ned as the number of (net) migrants in a municipality divided by its population. A detailed explanation of how net migration rates are constructed is contained in the Appendix. 4 6 We compute this elasticity as in section 5.2.2: we divide the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j when the outcome is the migration rate by the estimated coe\u00a2 cient on A soy j when the outcome is agricultural labor productivity. When we estimate the speci\u2026cation including controls for municipality characteristics, this ratio is equal to: 0:013=0:131 = 0:097. 4 7 To compare the migration rate estimates with the reduction in the employment share of agriculture we need to take into account that the migration rate is computed relative to the overall population aged between 16 and 55 in 2000, while employment shares are computed relative to workers only. Thus, we multiply the elasticity of migration rate to changes in agricultural labor productivity for the overall population aged between 16 and 55 in 2000 (-0.097) by the share of active population in the age group 16-55 in 2000 (0.71) and the employment rate for that same age group (0.85). This adjusted elasticity is equal to -0.059. Then, we divide this number by the estimated elasticity of agricultural employment share to changes in agricultural labor productivity (-0.158) obtaining a ratio of 0.37. in a reduction in the manufacturing employment share. This is because equilibrium agricultural employment is una\u00a4ected by a change in the labor endowment (see equation 4). In turn, the equilibrium level of employment in manufacturing is determined by the labor market clearing condition, L m = L L a : Thus, the manufacturing employment share must fall when the labor endowment falls. As a result, the presence of migration dampens the positive e\u00a4ects of soy technical change on the manufacturing employment share. A similar argument implies that the in-migration induced by land augmenting technical change in maize would increase the manufacturing employment share and dampen the e\u00a4ects of maize technical change."}, {"section_title": "Land", "text": "In this section we study the role of the expansion in the agricultural frontier. During this period the frontier expanded not only over the Amazon rainforest but also in the Cerrado. This is a tropical savanna eco-region in central Brazil where soils used to be too acidic and nutrient poor. Starting from the 1980s these soils were treated by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, EMBRAPA, which enabled agricultural activities to expand over these areas. To assess the extent to which our estimates are a\u00a4ected by expansions in the agricultural frontier we test the predictions of the model in a subsample of municipalities where the land endowment did not increase. In particular, we de\u2026ne frontier municipalities as those which experienced an increase in land use for agricultural activities between 1996 and 2006 and split the sample of municipalities in two groups: frontier and non-frontier (see map in Figure A6 in the Appendix). Next, we estimate our baseline speci\u2026cation described by equation 12separately for each subsample. Our estimates of the e\u00a4ect of soy technical change on the agricultural and manufacturing employment shares in the subsample of non-frontier (frontier) municipalities are only slightly larger (smaller) in absolute value than estimates using the full sample, as shown in Columns 4 to 7 of Table 12. This \u2026nding suggests that the expansion of the agricultural frontier does not signi\u2026cantly mitigate our baseline estimates. In the case of maize, estimates of the e\u00a4ect of technical change on the agricultural and manufacturing employment shares in the subsample of non-frontier municipalities are slightly larger in absolute value than estimates using the full sample. In contrast, estimates are smaller and not statistically signi\u2026cant in the frontier. These \u2026ndings suggest that introducing a second harvesting season for maize only had signi\u2026cant e\u00a4ects on labor demand in non-frontier municipalities. Finally, we study whether migration patters di\u00a4er in frontier and non-frontier municipalities. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 12 show that the e\u00a4ect of soy technical change on migration is similar for both samples. In contrast, the positive e\u00a4ect of maize technical change on migration is concentrated in non-frontier municipalities. 6 Robustness Checks"}, {"section_title": "Additional Controls", "text": "A potential concern regarding our estimates is that municipalities that bene\u2026t the most from technical change in soy also have higher overall agricultural productivity. Thus, our estimates could be capturing di\u00a4erential structural transformation trends across municipalities that di\u00a4er in their initial level of agricultural development. To address this concern, we report estimates of equation 12 respectively, when we include the control for agricultural labor productivity. The reason why estimates are a\u00a4ected by the inclusion of this control is that, to some extent, places with higher initial soy yields bene\u2026ted more from the new technology. As a result, the control for lagged overall agricultural productivity captures part of the variation we are interested in. Thus, we interpret our estimates of the e\u00a4ects of soy technical change conditional on the initial level of agricultural productivity as indicative that at least 60 percent of our estimated e\u00a4ects of technical change on sectoral employment shares are not driven by di\u00a4erential structural transformation trends across municipalities that di\u00a4er in the initial level of agricultural productivity. 48 We obtain similar \u2026ndings in the case of maize. Estimated coe\u00a2 cients are robust to including these additional controls. Estimates of the e\u00a4ect of maize technical change on agricultural labor intensity and manufacturing wages are stable and signi\u2026cant at 1 percent. In the case of the agricultural and manufacturing employment shares, estimates fall by 25 and 40 percent, respectively, when we control for lagged labor productivity in agriculture."}, {"section_title": "Pre-Existing Trends", "text": "In this section we show that our results are robust to controlling for pre-existing trends. This exercise addresses the following concern: if municipalities that are better suited for adopting GE soy were already experiencing faster structural transformation before the legalization of this technology in Brazil, our exogenous measure of technical change would capture a long term trend instead of the e\u00a4ect of GE soy adoption. In order to test for the existence of pre-existing trends, we use data from the Population Censuses of 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010. We thus estimate a model similar to the one presented in our baseline equation 12, but with an additional time period, as follows. where the outcome of interest, y jt is the decadal change in outcome variables between the start of a period (year t 1) and the end (year t). Each period spans a decade: 1991 to 2000 and 2000 to 2010. t are time dummies for each decade and Af ter t is a dummy equal to 1 if t = 2010: Thus, 1 captures the e\u00a4ect of soy technical change that is common in the period before (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) and after (2000-2010) the adoption of GE soy seeds. In contrast, 2 captures the di\u00a4erential e\u00a4ect of soy technical change after the introduction of GE soy seeds. Similarly, the coe\u00a2 cient 2 captures the di\u00a4erential e\u00a4ect of maize technical change in the period 2000-2010. Finally, X jt 1 are a set of ten-year-lagged municipality characteristics including the share of rural population, average income per capita, population density and literacy rate. 49 Results for manufacturing employment are reported in column 1 of Table A3 of the Appendix. Our estimate of 1 , which captures the e\u00a4ect of soy technical change that is common in the period before (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) and after (2000-2010) the adoption of GE soy seeds, is extremely small and not statistically di\u00a4erent from zero. This \u2026nding indicates that there are no pre-trends in manufacturing employment. In addition, our estimate of 2 , which estimates the di\u00a4erential e\u00a4ect of soy technical change on manufacturing employment after the introduction of GE soy seeds, is positive and precisely estimated. Similarly, in the case of maize, we do not \u2026nd pre-existing trends in manufacturing employment. Note that we perform this test for the level of manufacturing employment but not for the manufacturing and agricultural employment shares. This is because there were important changes in the de\u2026nition of employment after the 1991 Census, thus employment shares can not be measured in a consistent way across the 1991 and 2000 Censuses. 50 Column 2 of Table A3 shows the results of estimating equation 13when the outcome variable is the average wage in manufacturing. In this case, A soy had an opposite e\u00a4ect on manufacturing wages between 1991 and 2000 with respect to the 2000-2010 period. Therefore, the existence of these pre-existing trends in manufacturing wages attenuates our baseline estimated e\u00a4ects of soy and maize technical change on wages in the period 2000-2010, presented in Table 10. Finally, we check for pre-existing trends in migration. A potential concern is that areas that are better suited for adopting GE soy experienced a pattern of migration prior to the legalization of GE soy that a\u00a4ected farmers'incentive to adopt this new technology. For example, if these areas experienced large out-migration in the decade before GE soy was legalized, farmers would have had a higher incentive to adopt a labor-saving technology to cope with labor scarcity. Column 3 of Table A3 shows the results of estimating equation (13) when the outcome variable is net migration rate. The coe\u00a2 cient on A soy shows that there are no di\u00a4erential pre-existing trends in migration for areas that have a higher increase in potential soy yields. Similarly, in the case of maize, we do not \u2026nd pre-existing trends in migration. 51 These tests validate our interpretation that our estimates of the e\u00a4ects of agricultural technical change on structural transformation are due to the introduction of new agricultural technologies 5 0 Between the 1991 and 2000 Censuses the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE) changed its de\u2026nition of employment in two important ways. First, it started to count zero-income workers as employed. In order to homogenize the Brazilian Census with international practices, the IBGE started to consider employed anyone who helped another household member with no formal compensation, as well as agricultural workers that produced only for their own consumption p. 218). Zero-income workers are more common in agriculture than in other sectors, and in 1991 were only partially included in the labor force. In the 1991 Census 15% of agricultural workers reported zero income, against 34% in 2000 and 35% in 2010. Second, the IBGE changed the reference period for considering a person employed: while in 1991 such period included the last 12 months, in 2000 it only included the reference week of the Census. This new rule implied that workers performing temporary and seasonal activities that were not employed during the reference week were counted in the 1991 census but not the in the 2000 census. This second change is likely to be especially problematic for the agricultural sector, considering that the reference week in the 2000 Census was in the middle of the Brazilian winter. This is why, to test for pre-existing trends, we focus on the absolute number of workers employed in manufacturing as an outcome (instead of its share in total employment). This measure is less likely to be a\u00a4ected by the changes introduced between the two censuses because: there are very few zero-income workers in manufacturing (0.5%, 1.9% and 1% of manufacturing workers declare zero income in 1991, 2000 and 2010, respectively); and manufacturing is less seasonal than other activities. 5 1 These results suggest that the migration \u2021ows generated by the expansion of the Brazilian road network in the years 1960-2000 that are studied by Morten and Oliveira (2014) are unlikely to be confounding our results. rather than to pre-existing trends in areas that were more a\u00a4ected by these new technologies."}, {"section_title": "Larger Unit of Observation: Micro-Regions", "text": "In the empirical analysis performed so far we assumed that municipalities are a good approximation of the relevant labor market faced by Brazilian agricultural workers. A potential issue is that local labor market boundaries do not overlap with a municipality's administrative boundaries. In particular, some municipalities might be too small to properly capture labor \u2021ows between urban and rural areas, provided that manufacturing activities mostly take place in the former, and agricultural activities in the latter. In order to take into account this concern we aggregate our data at a larger unit of observation: micro-regions. These regions are groups of territorially contiguous municipalities created, for statistical purposes, by the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE). Table   13 reports the results of estimating equation 12using micro-regions as a unit of observation. The outcome variables are the same as in Table 10: change in manufacturing employment share, change in manufacturing employment (in logs) and change in average manufacturing wage (in logs). The estimates are consistent and similar in magnitude to those reported in Table 10, both for soy and maize."}, {"section_title": "Input-Output Linkages", "text": "Our theoretical model predicts that agricultural technical change can have an e\u00a4ect on manufacturing employment through labor market forces. In the case of soy, for example, the adoption of new agricultural technologies releases agricultural workers that \u2026nd employment in the manufacturing sector. In this section we investigate to which extent our \u2026ndings re \u2021ect the strength of another channel through which agricultural technical change can a\u00a4ect manufacturing employment: input-output linkages. Soy and maize farming require inputs produced by other sectors, including manufacturing. Therefore, for example, an expansion of the area farmed with soy in a given municipality might drive an increase in manufacturing employment in industries that produce inputs used in soy production, such as chemicals or fertilizers. To the extent that manufacturing \u2026rms producing chemicals and fertilizers used in agriculture face high transport costs, there might be an incentive for them to locate in the same municipality in which agricultural production takes place. Therefore, the e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on manufacturing that we show in Table 10 could be explained by an increase in the agricultural demand for manufacturing inputs. A similar argument applies for manufacturing industries that use soy and maize as intermediate inputs, such as the food processing industry. In order to assess the contribution of these direct linkages on our estimates, we construct a measure of manufacturing employment that excludes the sectors directly linked to soy and maize production through input-output chains. In order to identify input-output linkages in the data, we proceed as follows. We use the Brazilian input-output matrix (IBGE, 2008) to identify manufacturing sectors that are providing inputs, or receiving outputs, from the soy and maize sectors. On the input side, soy and maize are used as intermediate goods in only one manufacturing sector: the food and beverage sector, which in 2005 purchased around half of the total Brazilian production of both crops. On the output side the matrix is less detailed, thus we use information on goods purchased by agricultural and breeding farms in general. Half of the inputs purchased by these farms are supplied by manufacturing sectors and four commodities account for 84% of the total value of inputs purchased: inorganic chemicals, fertilizers, diesel oil and maize oil. These commodities are produced by the chemical industry, the oil re\u2026ning industry and the food and beverage industry. We use this information to construct measures of employment and wages in manufacturing that exclude those industries that are providing inputs, or receiving outputs, from the soy and maize sectors. Table 14 reports estimates of our baseline speci\u2026cation described by equation 12 Table 10. 52 In turn, the e\u00a4ect of technical change in soy on manufacturing wages decreases substantially, and is not precisely estimated. In the case of maize, estimated coe\u00a2 cients are essentially una\u00a4ected by excluding workers in downstream and upstream manufacturing sectors when the outcomes are manufacturing employment share and level. As in the case of soy, the e\u00a4ect on manufacturing wages decreases in size and is not precisely estimated. Taken together, the results presented in this section imply that at least 62 percent of our estimated e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on the manufacturing employment share is not driven by the processing of soy and maize in downstream industries nor larger agricultural sector demand for manufacturing inputs. A more detailed analysis is needed to separate the role of labor market and input-output forces in the remaining 38 percent of the total estimated e\u00a4ect, which is an interesting avenue for further work."}, {"section_title": "Commodity Prices", "text": "In this section we show that our results are robust to controlling for international commodity prices. To the extent that variation in international prices of soy and maize a\u00a4ect agricultural outcomes in all Brazilian municipalities proportionally, their e\u00a4ects are captured by the time \u2026xed e\u00a4ects in equation 9. However, price changes might have heterogeneous e\u00a4ects across municipalities with di\u00a4erent suitability to the cultivation of soy and maize. For example, an increase in the international price of soy could induce farmers to expand the area devoted to soy relatively more in municipalities that are initially more suitable for its cultivation. we use data for the last two Agricultural Censuses: 1996 and 2006. In particular, note that the international price for both soy and maize was lower in 2006 than in 1996. However, when we use data from the last two Population Censuses, which took place in 2000 and 2010, the end of period year is characterized by high international soy and maize prices with respect to the initial year. To address this concern, we assess the robustness of our \u2026ndings for the manufacturing sector to controlling for changes in commodity prices. The data from the Population Censuses does not allow us to control for yearly variation in soy and maize prices. We therefore rely on an alternative source of data for manufacturing outcomes: the Annual Manufacturing Survey (PIA). The Annual Manufacturing Survey is carried out yearly, allowing us to both exclude years of high international commodity prices and fully control for price variation. It covers the universe of manufacturing \u2026rms with at least 30 employees in Brazil, and it is therefore representative at municipality level for this class of \u2026rms. We focus on two variables from this survey: manufacturing employment and average wages. 53 We estimate an equation of the following form: where y jt is total employment or average wage in a given municipality; A soy jt is equal to the potential soy yield under low inputs for all years before 2003 and to the potential soy yield under high inputs starting from 2003 (same criteria is used to de\u2026ne A maize jt ). We control for the prices of soy and maize by multiplying the potential yield under low inputs of each crop by the time varying international price of each crop. Finally, we add as controls the share of rural population and the same set of initial municipality characteristics used in our main speci\u2026cation, all interacted with a time trend. In all speci\u2026cations we control for both municipality and year \u2026xed e\u00a4ects ( j and t ) and cluster standard errors at the municipality level to address potential serial correlation in the error term. The results obtained using data from the Annual Manufacturing Survey are consistent with those obtained using the Population Census (see Table A4 in the Appendix): areas with higher increase in potential soy yield experienced a larger increase in manufacturing employment and a larger decrease in average manufacturing wages. The e\u00a4ect on wages is less precisely estimated than in Table 10, and it loses statistical signi\u2026cance when we add all controls. Importantly, when we control for di\u00a4erential e\u00a4ects of international prices in columns 2 and 5, our point estimates do not change. In terms of magnitude, the point estimates we obtain with this speci\u2026cation for the coe\u00a2 cients on both A soy and A maize are similar to those obtained with the same outcomes using the Population Census data."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Correlation", "text": "The maps we present in Figures A2 through A5 suggest that the potential yield of both soy and maize are correlated across space. Therefore, in this section we show that our estimates remain signi\u2026cant when we allow the residuals to be correlated within geographical areas larger than a single municipality. For the coe\u00a4cient estimates of the e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change reported in Tables 8, 9 and 10, we compute standard errors clustered at two additional levels of aggregation: micro-regions and meso-regions. 54 Tables A5, A6 and A7 report our results. The \u2026rst row below the coe\u00a2 cients reports baseline robust standard errors for comparison. The following two rows report standard errors clustered at micro and meso-region level, along with their signi\u2026cance levels.

In this section, we test the robustness of our results to an alternative de\u2026nition of technical change that uses potential yields under an intermediate technology to capture the level of agricultural technology before the introduction of GE seeds. The FAO-GAEZ dataset characterizes this intermediate technology as using improved varieties of seeds, partial mechanization and some use of chemicals. This technological level lies somewhere in between traditional and technologically advanced farming. We estimate equation 12 We prefer to use the di\u00a4erence between high and low level of inputs in our baseline speci\u2026cation as it is a more precise measure of technical change in agriculture. This is because the high and low level of technical inputs are clearly de\u2026ned, while intermediate inputs has a loose de\u2026nition that could span di\u00a4erent levels of agricultural technology. As a result, using this de\u2026nition might miss part of the variation that we are trying to capture.

We isolate these e\u00a4ects by studying the introduction of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. This technology allows farmers to employ fewer workers per unit of land to yield the same output, increasing labor productivity in agriculture. After its legalization in 2003, genetically engineered soy experienced a rapid and widespread adoption in Brazil. We exploit the di\u00a4erential impact of this new technology on potential yields across geographical areas to estimate the causal e\u00a4ect of agricultural technical change on sectoral employment shares. Our \u2026ndings contribute to the debate on the e\u00a4ects of agricultural productivity on industrialization in open economies. We argue that these e\u00a4ects depend crucially on the factor-bias of technical change. We provide evidence that when technical change in agriculture is strongly labor-saving, as in the case of genetically engineered soy, it can foster industrialization. When, instead, technical change is labor-biased, as in the case of the introduction of a second harvesting season in maize, agricultural productivity can retard industrialization.

This is because wages are set by the value of the marginal product of labor in manufacturing. As a result, the effects of each type of technical change on the agricultural employment share are the same as in the economy without non traded goods, discussed in Section 3.3.We call them the supply-side effects of technical change: The effects of technical change on the demand for labor in the service sector are illustrated by equation (A.14). First, note that workers spend a constant share of their labor endowment on services (\u03b1 s L). This is because the service sector uses only labor for production. Thus, any increase in wages has both an income and substitution effect on the demand for services by workers. The income effect increases their demand for services as their labor endowment is more valuable. The substitution effect reduces the demand for services as their price, the wage, increases. When preferences are Cobb-Douglas both effects have the same magnitude and cancel-out. 4 As a result, technical change can only affect the demand for services through its effect on the consumption of land owners: \u03b1 s \u03b8 r * w * T. which is an increasing function of land revenues relative to the price of services in trems of labor ( r * w * ). Thus, the effects of agricultural technical change on employment in the service sector depend on its effect on land rents. In turn, agricultural technical change always increases land rents, as we show below. As a result, the demand for services and employment in the service sector increase. We call this the demand side effects of technical change: In what follows, we show that when technical change is Hicks-neutral or land-augmenting, both the supply-side and demand-side effects reduce manufacturing employment. However, when technical change is strongly labor-saving each effect moves manufacturing employment in opposite directions. On the one hand, the supply side effect releases labor from agriculture, increasing the labor supply for manufacturing. On the other hand, the demand-side effect increases labor demand in services, reducing the supply of labor for manufacturing. As a result, the net effect on manufacturing employment depends on the relative strength of each effect. In the appendix, we show that the supply-side effect dominates as long as \u03c3 < (1 \u2212 \u0393 * ) (1 \u2212 \u03b1 s \u03b8) . Note that because 1 \u2212 \u03b1 s \u03b8 < 1, this condition is stronger than the condition required for agricultural technical change to be strongly labor-saving : \u03c3 < 1 \u2212 \u0393 * . Thus, it is satisfied as long as land-owners's consumption share of local services (\u03b1 s \u03b8) is not too large. Labor-augmenting technical change a) Land and labor are strong complements: Proof: As shown in section 3.3, when \u03c3 < 1 \u2212 \u0393 * labor augmenting technical change generates a reallocation of labor away from agriculture. Then, the labor market clearing condition implies that L m + L s must increase.

Finally, the effects of technical change on manufacturing employment depend on whether the increase in the demand for labor in the service sector is larger than the reduction in agricultural employment, given by equation A.9. To make this comparison we obtain \u2202L * s \u2202A L from the solution for L * s given by equation (A.15), as follows: where the last step used the solution for the elasticity of the land to labor share ratio with respect to labor-augmenting technical change given by equation (A.10).

Value of output per worker in agriculture. Data on value of agricultural production per worker is from the Brazilian Agricultural Census ) and it is sourced from the IBGE online data repository SIDRA. 5 . The variable \"value of output per worker in agriculture\" is defined as the logarithm of total value of agricultural production divided by the total number of workers employed in agriculture. Total value of production in agriculture in 1996 comes from tables: 500 (value of production by seasonal crop), 513 (value of production by permanent crop), 527 (value of production by horticulture product), 534 (value of production by forestry product), 551 (value of production by vegetable extraction product) and 338 (value of animals by type). worker, so subsistence farmers are also included in this definition. In addition, workers that perform non-agricultural activities within the farm, such as truck drivers, accountants, mechanics or any other worker performing tasks in support of the main activity of the farm are counted as agricultural workers. Instead, family members or farm residents who were not employed in farm activities, domestic workers that are employed within the household of the owner but are not assigned agricultural tasks, and workers that are hired by a service provider company that has a contract with the farm are not counted as agricultural workers. There are two potential issues with this definition of agricultural workers in the Agricultural Census. The first issue is about how seasonal workers are accounted for. In particular, there is a potential double counting problem for seasonal workers that work in more than one farm. This is because the variable is collected at farm level, and not at individual level, and the definition of agricultural workers includes both permanent (employed for at least 180 days during the Census year) and seasonal workers, even when the latter are not employed on the reference date of the Census (p. 53, IBGE, 2006). Therefore, if seasonal workers are employed by more than one farm during a year, and they are recorded by each of them in the Census, the variable \"number of workers\" may overestimate the actual number of workers. Notice that seasonal workers account for 10.35% of total workers in 1996 (p. 43, IBGE, 1996) and14% in 2006 (SIDRA). The second issue is that the variable \"number of workers\" in the Agricultural Census does not include employees hired by service provider companies that are contracted by the farm to perform agricultural activities. The Agricultural Census of 2006 was the first to report the number of employees of service providers hired by farms (separately from number of workers), while their number was not reported in the 1996 Census. This means that the only way to construct a definition of agricultural workers that is consistent across the Agricultural Censuses of 1996 and 2006 is to exclude workers contracted by service providers in 2006 (IBGE, 2006, p.34). Notice that in 2006, 238.825 agricultural establishments contracted service providers to perform tasks on their land: this accounted for 4.61% of all Brazilian establishments in that year (SIDRA). Notice that these two issues do not affect the agricultural employment variables calculated using the Population Census. All variables come at the municipality level and have been aggregated at the level of AMC and micro-region using the correspondence proposed by IPEA and IBGE. divided by the total number of people that reported being employed in any sector of the economy. 8 7 At http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/iframe_dicionario.aspx?width=1074&height=480 8 Both in 2000 and in 2010 some workers did not declare a valid sector of employment and were classified as working in a specific category: \"setor maldefinido\"(badly defined sector). These were around 1.2% in 2000 and around 6.2% in 2010. We do not count these workers in the denominator of the employment shares. This is the correct treatment if these workers are drawn randomly from the other sectors of the economy. Sector of employment is reported according to the first version of the CNAE-Domiciliar in both 2000 and 2010. We define the agricultural sector as any sector with code from 01000 through 09999 (section \"A\": agricultura, pecu\u00e1ria, silvicultura e explora\u00e7\u00e3o florestal and section \"B\": pesca). Notice that this definition includes also workers that are employed by firms that provide services related to agriculture (code 01401 in the CNAE Domiciliar). In the year 1991 sector of employment is reported according to the old classification. For these years, we define the agricultural sector as any sector with code from 010 through 049: these include both agriculture and fishery. In every year, the sector of activity refers to the sector of the firm where the worker is employed, even if the worker performs a task that is not directly related to this activity. Sector of employment is reported according to the first version of the CNAE-Domiciliar in both 2000 and 2010. We define the manufacturing sector as any sector with code from 15000 through 37999 (section \"D\": ind\u00fastrias de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o). In every year, the sector of activity refers to the sector of the firm where the worker is employed, even if the worker performs a task that is not directly related to this sector. Since 2000, employed people are defined as anyone who reported being employed during the reference week, both in permanent and seasonal jobs. People who during the reference week worked for no compensation helping someone else in the household and people who worked in agriculture or fishery for subsistence are also counted as employed people. People 9 Both in 2000 and in 2010 some workers did not declare a valid sector of employment and were classified as working in a specific category: \"setor maldefinido\"(badly defined sector).

Share of agricultural land cultivated with genetically engineered soy. Data on the share of agricultural land cultivated with genetically engineered (GE) soy come from the Brazilian Agricultural Census ). The variable is defined as area reaped with GE soy divided by total land in farms. Area reaped with GE soy comes from table 824 in 2006 (produ\u00e7\u00e3o, venda, valor da produ\u00e7\u00e3o e\u00e1rea colhida da lavoura tempor\u00e1ria por produtos da lavoura tempor\u00e1ria, tipo de semente, tipo de colheita, tipo de cultivo e destino da produ\u00e7\u00e3o) and it is assumed to be 0 in 1996. Total land in farms comes from table 314 in 1996 (\u00e1rea dos estabelecimentos por grupo de atividade econ\u00f4mica e condi\u00e7\u00e3o legal das terras) and table 787 in 2006 (n\u00famero de estabelecimentos e\u00e1rea dos estabelecimentos agropecu\u00e1rios, por condi\u00e7\u00e3o legal do produtor em rela\u00e7\u00e3o\u00e1s terras, sexo do produtor, grupos de atividade econ\u00f4mica e grupos de\u00e1rea total ). All variables come at the municipality level and have been aggregated at the at the level of AMC and micro-region using the correspondence proposed by IPEA andIBGE. First differences are defined between 1996 and and in all regressions with this variable we windsorize top and bottom 1% of observations of the variable to reduce the importance of extreme values in our estimates. Share of agricultural land cultivated with traditional soy. Data on the share of agricultural land cultivated with traditional (non-GE) soy come from the Brazilian Agricultural Census ). The variable is defined as area reaped with soy minus the area reaped with GE soy divided by total land in farms. Area reaped with soy comes from table 501 in 1996 (\u00e1rea colhida por produtos das lavouras tempor\u00e1rias e condi\u00e7\u00e3o do produtor ); and table 1823 in 2006 (produ\u00e7\u00e3o, venda, valor da produ\u00e7\u00e3o e\u00e1rea colhida da lavoura tempor\u00e1ria por produtos da lavoura tempor\u00e1ria e grupos e classes de atividade). Area reaped with GE soy comes from table 824 in 2006 (produ\u00e7\u00e3o, venda, valor da produ\u00e7\u00e3o e\u00e1rea colhida da lavoura tempor\u00e1ria por produtos da lavoura tempor\u00e1ria, tipo de semente, tipo de colheita, tipo de cultivo e destino da produ\u00e7\u00e3o) and it is assumed to be 0 in 1996.

All variables come at the municipality level and have been aggregated at the at the level of AMC and micro-region using the correspondence proposed by IPEA andIBGE. First differences are defined between 1996 and and in all regressions with this variable we windsorize top and bottom 1% of observations of the variable to reduce the importance of extreme values in our estimates. Change in potential soy (maize) yield. Data on the change in potential soy (maize) yield come from the FAO GAEZ v3.0 database. 11 Raw data for potential soy (maize) yield under low and high input levels are reported on Figures A2 and A3 in this appendix ( Figures A4 and A5 for maize). To construct the change in potential soy (maize) yield we use two variables from the Suitability and Potential Yield Series: Total production capacity for low input level rain-fed soybean (maize) and Total production capacity for high input level rain-fed soybean (maize). 12 These series are aimed at capturing the potential production capacity in terms of output density which equals total grid cell production potential divided by grid cell area. Variables are expressed in tons per hectare. The time is set to the baseline , which means that the FAO-GAEZ agricultural model has been applied considering the average climate of the period 1961-1990. To construct the change in potential soy (maize) yield we subtract the low input level variable from the high input level variable in each municipality. Data has then been aggregated at the at AMC-level using the correspondence proposed by IPEA and IBGE. Share of rural population. Data on the share of rural population come from Sample Supplement of the Brazilian Population Censuses (question\u00e1rio da amostra: IBGE, 1980 and1991). The Supplement reports information on the area where people live (rural or urban) for a sample of the Brazilian population that is representative of the whole population at the municipal level. The variable is calculated considering only people 10 years or older, as the total number of people living in rural areas divided by the total number of people. The type of area where a person lives is classified under four categories in 1980 (two categories for cities and villages, and two for rural areas, depending on density) and under eight categories in 1991 (three categories for cities and villages, and four categories for rural areas). In both years IBGE defines the boundaries of the cities using the most recent municipal law on the matter. We define rural population as everybody who does not live within the boundary of a city or village. Original data come at the individual level: we aggregate these data at the municipality level using the individual weights provided by the IBGE. Data at the municipality level have been in turn aggregated at the at the level of AMC and micro-region using the correspondence proposed by IPEA and IBGE. Income per capita. Data on income per capita come from Sample Supplement of the Brazilian Population Censuses (question\u00e1rio da amostra: IBGE, 1980IBGE, , 1991IBGE, , 2000IBGE, and 2010. The Supplement reports information on income received from any source for a sample of the Brazilian population that is representative of the whole population at the municipal level. The variable is calculated as the natural logarithm of the average real income of people between 10 and 60 years old earning strictly positive income. The IBGE collects data on income coming from both labor and other sources (including pensions, social programs, rents, capital income etc). We defined income for every person as the sum of income coming from all sources. In order to avoid our results being affected by pensions, we restrict our sample to positive income earners between 10 and 60 years old. Original data come at the individual level: we compute average income at the municipality level using the individual weights provided by the IBGE. Average income at the level of AMC is calculated as a weighted average of the income in all municipalities belonging to an AMC using the number of income earners in every municipality as weight. We matched municipalities to AMC and micro-regions using the correspondence proposed by IPEA and IBGE. All incomes are reported in (if improved cultivars are used, they are treated in the same way as local cultivars), labor intensive techniques, and no application of nutrients, no use of chemicals for pest and disease control and minimum conservation measures.\" High-level inputs/advanced management: \"Under the high input, advanced management assumption, the farming system is mainly market oriented. Commercial production is a management objective. Production is based on improved high yielding varieties, is fully mechanized with low labor intensity and uses optimum applications of nutrients and chemical pest, disease and weed control.\" current values of the currency in circulation in the year of the Census: these are Cruzeiros in 1980, thousand Cruzeiros in 1991, Reais in 2000 and 2010. In order to convert values to Reais, we divided income in Cruzeiros by 2.75 billion in 1980; and we divided income in thousand Cruzeiros by 2.75 million in 1991. In order to deflate all current values to July 2000 Reais we used the monthly\u00cdndice Nacional de Pre\u00e7os ao Consumidor (INPC). We set the index equal to 1 in July 2000 (the reference month for the 2000 Census) and divided the 1980 and 1991 values in Reais by the INPC index in August 1980 and August 1991 respectively (these were the reference months for the 1980 and 1991 Censuses). Population density. Data on population density are constructed from the Brazilian Population Censuses (IBGE, 1980 and1991) and geo-referenced maps of Brazil prepared by GADM (http://www.gadm.org/) using data from IBGE. The Brazilian Censuses report information on the total number of people of any age living in a municipality. Geo-referenced on Brazilian municipalities has information on the area of each municipality. The variable is calculated as the natural logarithm of the total number of people living in a municipality divided by the area of the municipality in square kilometers. Data at the municipality level have been in turn aggregated at the at the level of AMC and micro-region using the correspondence proposed by IPEA and IBGE. Literacy rate. Data on the literacy rate come from Sample Supplement of the Brazilian Population Censuses (question\u00e1rio da amostra: IBGE, 1980 and1991). The Supplement reports information on literacy for a sample of the Brazilian population that is representative of the whole population at the municipal level. The variable is calculated considering only people 10 years or older, as the total number of people who is able to read and write divided by the total number of people. In 1980 IBGE classified people who used to be able to read and write but were currently unable to do so in a separate category: we do not consider these people as literate. Original data come at the individual level: we aggregate these data at the municipality level using the individual weights provided by the IBGE. Data at the municipality level have been in turn aggregated at the at the level of AMC and micro-region using the correspondence proposed by IPEA and IBGE. Wage in agriculture. Data on the wage in agriculture in 1991 come from Sample Supplement of the Brazilian Population Censuses (question\u00e1rio da amostra: IBGE, 1991). The Supplement reports detailed information on income from employment for a sample of the Brazilian population that is representative of the whole population at the municipal level. The variable is calculated as the logarithm of the average wage of agricultural workers 10 years or older in 2000 Reais. Sector of employment is reported according to the old classfication. We define the agricultural sector as any sector with code from 010 through 049. See the discussion of employment in agriculture for details on the definition of the agricultural sector in 1991. The Sample Supplement reports the income from the principal job of every worker. We estimate the average wage in every municipality by looking only to the income from the principal job of workers who report being employees (empregado com carteira de trabalho assinada or empregado sem carteira de trabalho assinada). This definition of workers excludes entrepreneurs and self-employed workers, whose income from the principal job may include profits or rents. 13 The definition however includes all informal workers. Average wage 13 Income of entrepreneurs and self-employed workers is reported to the Census as business revenues minus business of agricultural workers at the municipality level is calculated as the weighted average of the wage of all employees who report working in the agricultural sector as principal job, using the individual weights provided by the IBGE. Average wage at the level of AMC (micro-region) is calculated as a weighted average of the income in all municipalities belonging to an AMC (micro-region) using the number of agricultural employees in every municipality as weight. All wages are reported in current values of the currency in circulation in the year of the Census: these are thousand Cruzeiros in 1991: see the discussion of income per capita for details on the way we deflate 1991 wages to 2000 Reais. Employment in manufacturing firms with more than 30 employees. Data on employment in manufacturing firms with more than 30 employees come from P IA, Pesquisa Industrial Anual. The data is collected yearly by the IBGE and made available for research purposes in the facilities of the IBGE -Rio de Janeiro upon approval of a research proposal. We restrict our analysis to the manufacturing sector as defined by CNAE 1.0 (code 15 to 37) and use micro-data from 1996 to 2006. We construct our measure of employment starting from variable V 0194, which is defined in the original documentation as: Total pessoal ocupado em 31/12 or end-of-year number of workers. We sum this variable across all plants located in the same municipality in each year. In order to have a representative sample at municipality level we use only plants that are part of firms with 30 or more employees (which are sampled with probability one). Average wage in manufacturing firms with more than 30 employees. Data on wages in manufacturing firms with more than 30 employees come from P IA, Pesquisa Industrial Anual. The data is collected yearly by the IBGE and made available for research purposes in the facilities of the IBGE -Rio de Janeiro upon approval of a research proposal. We restrict our analysis to the manufacturing sector as defined by CNAE 1.0 (code 15 to 37) and use micro-data from 1996 to 2006. We construct our measure of average wage starting from variable V 0195, which is defined in the original documentation as: Sal\u00e1rios, retiradas e outras remunera\u00e7\u00e3oes and includes total wage remuneration as well as pension contributions and other worker benefits. The average wage is calculated summing this variable across all plants located in the same municipality in each year and dividing it by the total number of workers in the same plants in the same year. In order to have a representative sample at municipality level we use only plants that are part of firms with 30 or more employees (which are sampled with probability one). Migration rate. The migration rate is estimated with data from the Sample Supplement of the Brazilian Population Censuses (question\u00e1rio da amostra: IBGE, 1991IBGE, , 2000IBGE, and 2010. To construct net migration in a municipality between two Census years we follow the cohort average method (Shryock, Siegel and Larmon 1980, pp. 630-635). Letting the first Census year be year 0, and the second Census year be year t, this implies computing, for every age a + t, the total number of people living in each municipality m in year t, and subtract from this number the total number of people of that age that one would expect given the population of age a living in that municipality in year 0 and given the average survival rate for that age group in Brazil."}, {"section_title": "expenses.", "text": "Formally, this implies computing the following formula: where M m,a+t and M m,a+t are net migrants in municipality m computed with the \"forward survival rate method\" and with the \"reverse survival rate method\", respectively: In these equations, P t m,a+t is the total number of people of age a + t living in municipality m in year t and P 0 m,a is the total number of people of age a observed in the same municipality in year 0. s t a is the probability that a person of age a in year 0 is still alive after t years. Both P 0 m,a and P t m,a+t are observed in the Brazilian Censuses of 1991, 2000 and 2010. Survival probabilities are estimated using data on the whole Brazilian population with the formula: where P 0 a = m P 0 m,a and P t a+t = m P t m,a+t . Notice that with this formula net migration for Brazil as a whole is zero by construction. Let M t a+t be the estimate of net number of migrants in a municipality with age a + t in Census year t: total net migration M t is the sum of net migrants with age between 10 and 60 years in the initial period 14 . We compute migration rates M R t m as net migrants in a municipality divided by the total number of people living in that municipality in year 0: The cohort average method implicitly imposes two assumptions that are worth discussing briefly. First, the method assumes that Brazil is a closed country (i.e. nobody emigrate or immigrate from abroad between two Census years). Second, the method assumes that in a given year everybody has the the same survival probability conditional on age. We discuss these assumptions in turn. We deal with the closed country assumption by computing net migration only of people born in Brazil. 15 In other words, in every Census year, we compute P 0 m,a , P t m,a+t and s t a using only people that report being born in Brazil, which means that our migration rates refer to Brazilian-born only. We do this because people born outside of Brazil are on average more likely to enter or leave the country between two Census years. Note however, that this decision creates three additional issues. First, it requires to interpret the survival probability as the probability of re-observing a person somewhere in Brazil after t years, rather than the probability of this person of simply being alive after t years. Second, it implicitly assumes that nobody born in Brazil emigrated outside of Brazil before year 0 and then returned between the year 0 and the year t. Finally, it entirely abstracts from migration of foreigners (both within the country and from abroad). The first of these three issues is inconsequential, but the other two may bias our estimates if Brazil as a whole experienced large migration flows between 1991 and 2010, or if foreign-born people accounted for a large share of the population. In practice this does not seem to be the case. In 2010, only 0.19% of the Brazilian-born population aged 15 to 70 reported having moved to Brazil from abroad during the previous 10 years. Moreover, people born outside of Brazil always account for less than 1% of the total population living in Brazil between 1991 and 2010 (the exact figures are: 0.52% in 1991, 0.4% in 2000 and 0.31% in 2010). In order to allow different survival probability across different groups of the population we compute net migration and survival probabilities separately for men and women and then add them to compute total migration.
