[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract In this study, I consider the ground motions generated by 11 moderate (M w 4.0-5.6) earthquakes in the central and eastern United States that are thought or suspected to be induced by fluid injection. Using spatially rich intensity data from the U.S. Geological Survey \"Did You Feel It?\" system, I show the distance decay of intensities for all events is consistent with that observed for tectonic earthquakes in the region, but for all of the events, intensities are lower than the values predicted from an intensity prediction equation that successfully characterizes intensities for regional tectonic events. I introduce an effective intensity magnitude M IE , defined as the magnitude that on average would generate a given intensity distribution. For all 11 events, M IE is lower than the event magnitude by 0.4-1.3 magnitude units, with an average difference of 0.82 units. This suggests stress drops of injection-induced earthquakes are systematically lower than tectonic earthquakes by an estimated factor of 2-10. However, relatively limited data suggest intensities for epicentral distances less than 10 km are more commensurate with expectations for the event magnitude, which can be reasonably explained by the shallow focal depth of the events. The results suggest damage from injection-induced earthquakes will be especially concentrated in the immediate epicentral region."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is a growing consensus that the rate of earthquakes in the central and eastern United States (CEUS) has increased significantly since 2009 due to an increase in activities associated with the extraction of fossil fuel. As summarized by Ellsworth (2013) , hydraulic fracturing or fracking, itself appears to induce only small earthquakes; to date, the largest earthquake associated directly with fracking was an M w 3.8 event in the Horn River Basin, British Columbia (Holland, 2013) . However, a growing body of evidence shows that the disposal of wastewater into deep injection wells can induce larger events. Although most injection-induced events are also small, a number of events in recent years have been large enough to cause local damage, and many more have been widely felt, causing considerable concern. The potential maximum magnitude of injection-induced earthquakes remains a matter of some debate. McGarr (2014) concludes there is an upper limit to magnitude associated with the total volume of injected fluid. Other studies discussed the possibilities that (1) a given event could nucleate as a result of increased pore pressure but release stored tectonic stress along an adjacent fault or (2) an initial injection-induced earthquake could effectively trigger a subsequent tectonic event, as has been suggested for the second and third principal earthquakes in the 2011 Prague, Oklahoma, sequence Sumy et al., 2014) . If these possibilities are admitted, maximum magnitude for induced earthquakes could potentially be no different from that of natural earthquakes in a given region.\nA number of studies have attempted to consider the hazard implications of induced earthquakes (see Ellsworth, 2013) . Assessment of future earthquake rates, the underpinning of probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment, is complicated by compelling evidence that earthquake rates can be influenced significantly by human decisions to increase, decrease, or even curtail the rate or amount of fluid injected at a site. It is further unclear if induced earthquakes follow the well-established statistical properties that characterize natural seismicity (e.g., Llenos and Michael, 2013) .\nIn this study, I consider the nature of shaking generated by 11 moderate earthquakes that are generally acknowledged or suspected to be induced by fluid injection (Table 1 , Fig. 1a ). This list includes an event in December 2013, for which only preliminary results are available, as well as earthquakes that remain the focus of active research. Ten of these events have magnitudes of 4.5-5.7, large enough to have well-characterized magnitudes and intensity distributions.\nAlthough instrumental recordings of CEUS earthquakes are sparse in general, the intensity distributions for events as large as M w 4.5 are now generally well characterized by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \"Did You Feel It?\" (DYFI) system. The largest event in the data set, the M w 5.7 Prague, Oklahoma, earthquake of 6 November 2011, was reportedly felt in over 100 widely scattered ZIP codes at distances greater than 1000 km (Fig. 1a) . I additionally include the 31 December 2011 M w 3.9 Youngstown, Ohio, earthquake (Kim, 2013) . Intensity distributions are not necessarily well characterized for M w \u2248 4:0 events in parts of the west, where population density is low. However, a spatially rich DYFI data set is available for the 2011 Youngstown, Ohio, earthquake.\nThere is a growing appreciation for the potential utility of spatially rich, systematically determined DYFI data to address key questions in earthquake ground-motion science (Atkinson and Wald, 2007; Hauksson et al., 2008; Hough, 2012) . Compared to the relatively limited number of instrumental recordings of the earthquake, modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) values calculated systematically from responses to the USGS Community Internet Intensity (CII) Map, also known as DYFI, website (Wald et al., 1999) provide far better spatial sampling. Although not an instrumental measure of ground motions, DYFI intensities provide a stable indicator of ground-motion parameters such as peak ground acceleration (Atkinson and Wald, 2007; Worden et al., 2012) .\nWhen individuals submit a DYFI response, a ZIP code is required but a street address is optional. For responses with street addresses included, DYFI responses can be geocoded to improve the spatial resolution of locations. However, geocoded locations can only be determined for a subset of the responses. In this study, I use the averages within ZIP codes. For the 11 earthquakes listed in Table 1 , DYFI responses ranged from a low of 726 to a high of over 66,000, yielding CII values for, respectively, 69-2939 separate ZIP codes. I compare these data sets to the intensity prediction equations determined for the CEUS by Atkinson and Wald (2007) . I will additionally consider intensities assigned using a traditional field survey approach for the 17 May 2012 M w 4.9 Timpson, Texas, earthquake (Frohlich et al., 2014) as well as local field observations following the 6 November 2011 Prague, Oklahoma, earthquake."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "DYFI data for the earthquakes listed in Table 1 can be compared with predicted intensities from relationships developed to fit DYFI data from the CEUS. The curves developed by Atkinson and Wald (2007) provide a generally good fit to data from moderate events (see Table 2 ; Fig. 2 ), such as the 2008 M w 5.2 Mt. Carmel, Illinois, (Herrmann et al., 2008) and the 2011 M w 5.8 Mineral, Virginia, earthquakes (e.g., Hough, 2012; Fig. 2) . CII values from the DYFI system are fit by intensity prediction relationships that include a nonlinear magnitude term as well as a piecewise-continuous distance decay:\nand B logD=D t ; D>D t : Here, d 1 -d 7 are constants, h is hypocentral depth, and D t is a transition distance that Atkinson and Wald (2007) estimate to be 80 km for CEUS earthquakes. The parameter D is defined as the nearest distance to the fault, which in theory is equivalent to hypocentral distance for small to moderate events. The parameter h is introduced to stabilize the inversion and can be regarded as an effective depth. Although R is thus a nonphysical parameter, because the bulk of the DYFI data for all events in this study is from distances greater than 20 km, R is effectively comparable to hypocentral distance. I return to the question of near-field intensities in the Interpretation section. Equation (1) is derived using data out to roughly 1000 km and magnitudes up to 7.8, although all data for events larger than 5.8 are from historical earthquakes. Intensity prediction curves for each event magnitude are shown in Figure 3 ; for all analysis I use the d 1 -d 7 values determined for the CEUS by Atkinson and Wald (2007) . There is a general tendency for these curves to overpredict observed intensity values. All of the data sets reveal the bias associated with underreporting ZIP codes identified by Boatwright and Phillips (2013) ; this bias involves both the tendency of CIIr to flatten at the largest distances and the absence of CII values between 1.0 (which corresponds to no felt reports received) and 2.0 (the minimum CII assigned if even a single report of felt shaking is received within a ZIP code). Because the Atkinson and Wald (2007) relationships were developed using DYFI data that share this same bias, it is appropriate to compare the data from all distances with predicted intensities. For this study I exclude the relatively few intensity values at distances greater than 700 km, although the corresponding results are indistinguishable from those using all available data.\nOne can then calculate the magnitude value that optimizes the fit between the intensities and equation (1), again considering data from distances within 700 km. For consistency, this analysis is done using only DYFI data. This magnitude is defined here as the effective intensity magnitude M IE of each event; that is, the magnitude that would on average generate the observed intensity distribution, given an intensity prediction equation for the region. For all events, given the optimal M IE value, predicted intensities from equation (1) are consistent with bin-averaged intensity values 1 standard deviation, with the exception of a few outliers that all correspond to distance bins for which few DYFI responses were received.\nResults for the 2011 Youngstown, Ohio, earthquake, shown separately in Figure 4 , are consistent with those of the other events. This event is notable in two respects: first, it is the only one of the events that occurred in the northeast rather than the central United States, and, second, it has the best-characterized near-field intensity distribution, with 15 ZIP codes within 10 km. Again, observed DYFI intensities fall below the predicted values for the event magnitude (3.9). Intensities for distances greater than 100 km are more consistent with predicted values than the other events analyzed in this study; however, due to the smaller magnitude, intensities at regional distances are likely more biased by underreporting ZIP codes. I further note that, for this event, DYFI intensities closely track predictions for M IE 3.5 but are close to the expected values for the event magnitude at distances less than 10 km. Similar trends are suggested for other events (Fig. 3) , although near-field intensities are less well constrained. (In contrast, M IE values are much closer to M w for the tectonic earthquakes, with an average difference of 0.14 units.)"}, {"section_title": "Interpretation", "text": "The estimated M IE value for all events is significantly lower than the event magnitude, by 0.4-1.3 magnitude units (with an average difference of 0.82 units), corresponding to a factor of 4-90 in moment. In other words, the shaking levels generated by the 11 inferred injection-induced earthquakes investigated in this study are commensurate with expected shaking for earthquakes 0.4-1.3 units lower than the event magnitude.\nIn general, intensity distributions are assumed to be controlled primarily by two factors: magnitude and regional attenuation (e.g., Atkinson and Wald, 2007) . However, one cannot appeal to attenuation differences to explain the systematic differences between the events analyzed here and the Atkinson and Wald (2007) intensity prediction equations for the CEUS because, for all events, the distance decay of DYFI intensity values is consistent with equation (1). Effectively this indicates that regional attenuation of perceptible ground motions is comparable for injection-induced and tectonic earthquakes. (Although one might conjecture that attenuation is locally higher in the vicinity of the induced events, that would lower intensity values at close distances; it could not explain why the distance decay is consistent with established regional intensity prediction equations.) Four further results argue against attenuation being the explanation for the inferred (M w \u2212 M IE ) values: (1) (Benz et al., 1997; McNamara et al., 2014) . (4) Although the induced earthquakes are generally more centrally located than the tectonic earthquakes used to develop the intensity prediction equations of Atkinson and Wald (2007) , the two populations do overlap, with more overlap of source-receiver paths (see Fig. 1 ).\nAn additional question is whether magnitude estimation might have changed because of the time of the earthquakes used by Atkinson and Wald (2007) to calculate intensity prediction equations. Their study used DYFI data for events between 1999 and 2007, augmented by historical intensity data for earthquakes larger than 6. For the DYFI data sets, moment magnitude was used; thus the magnitude estimates should be generally consistent between that study and this study. The incorporation of historical MMI data potentially raises issues (e.g., Hough, 2013) ; magnitude estimates for historical earthquakes are also highly uncertain. However, all of the induced and tectonic earthquakes analyzed in this study are smaller than M w 5.8; all but two are smaller than 5.6. Over the magnitude range 4-5.8, the intensity prediction equations of Atkinson and Wald (2007) are thus expected to be controlled by DYFI data, so magnitude estimates should be generally consistent.\nTo the extent that the results of Atkinson and Wald (2007) are influenced by historical earthquakes for which only m blg =m b values are available, according to the theoretical relationship presented by Boore and Atkinson (1997) , M w should be lower than m blg in the CEUS: 3.64 versus 4.0, 4.51 versus 5.0, and 5.63 versus 6.0. So, if anything, if regression curves were determined using older magnitudes, the DYFI data should generally be commensurate with higher magnitudes than the event magnitude.\nThe consideration of tectonic events provides a measure of support for the above statements, because the four events after 2007 are well characterized by the Atkinson and Wald (2007) intensity prediction equations, with (M w \u2212 M IE ) values of 0-0.2 units. There is a tendency for M IE to be slightly lower than M w , which might result from the inclusion of historical earthquakes, but on average the difference is small, on the order of 0.1 units.\nThe systematic amplitude bias for induced earthquakes thus points to a significant systematic difference in source properties. As discussed by Boore (1983) and Hanks and Johnston (1992) , consideration of basic scaling relationships reveals that high-frequency ground motions depend only weakly on M w but strongly on stress drop. Using results from random vibration theory, Boore (1983) relates peak acceleration (a max ) and velocity (v max ) to magnitude and stress drop \u03c3: log a max \u2248 0:31M w 0:80 log\u03c3 2 log v max \u2248 0:55M w 0:64 log\u03c3: 3 This result is illustrated in Figure 5 , which shows theoretical (omega-squared; Brune, 1970) velocity spectra for a range of magnitudes and a given stress drop (Fig. 5a ) versus spectra for a range of stress-drop values for a given magnitude (Fig. 5b) , assuming \u03c3 M 0 f c =0:42\u03b2 3 , in which \u03b2 is the shear-wave velocity near the source and f c is the corner frequency (Madariaga, 1976) .\nAssuming that the low-to-moderate intensities analyzed in this study are controlled by peak acceleration, and that (M w \u2212 M IE ) is controlled by source rather than path effects, one can use equation (2) to estimate the reduction in stress drop associated with a given value of M IE : 10 \u22120:39M\u2212M IE . Using equation (2), the inferred M IE values correspond to a factor of 1.5-3.2 reduction in stress drop, for a given M w . Alternatively, if intensities are controlled by peak velocity, a given value of (M w \u2212 M IE ) corresponds to a stronger reduction in stress drop: 2.2-13. It remains unclear whether intensities are more controlled by peak acceleration or peak velocity; equations (2) and (3) are moreover only approximations based on random vibration theory. I thus conclude that the average (M w \u2212 M IE ) values suggest that stress drops are lower by factors of \u22482-10.\nAlthough low stress drop provides a straightforward explanation for the depletion of high-frequency energy, an alternative hypothesis is that energy is depleted in a small volume around the source due to the presence of fluids. Such a near-source path effect could be virtually indistinguishable from a true source effect, in particular because key parameters are unknown. For illustration, if I assume a 200 m thick zone around the source with a Q of 10 and a shear-wave velocity \u03b2 of 1 km=s, with a standard attenuation operator exp\u2212\u03c0fQ=\u03b2 the spectrum is modified only slightly over the frequency range shown in Figure 5a . However, one can assume values of Q, \u03b2, and zone thickness (Q 5, \u03b2 1 km=s, thickness 1 km) that would produce more substantial effects (Fig. 5b) . The effect of a low Q zone is significantly more pronounced for frequencies above 1 Hz than over the frequency range 0.2-1 Hz. This suggests traditional, high-resolution analysis of source spectra might be Figure 2.

The dark line indicates the predicted intensity curve using the Atkinson and Wald (2007) central and eastern United States (CEUS) relations and the given estimated moment magnitudes. Light lines indicate predicted curves for M IE values that best fit the data for each event. Table 1 (gray dots), with averaged values in logarithmic hypocentral distance bins and 1 standard deviation (black squares). In each panel, dark and light lines, respectively, indicate the predicted intensity curve using Atkinson and Wald (2007) CEUS relations for the event magnitude and the magnitude that provides the optimal fit to the Atkinson and Wald (2007) relation. For the 17 May 2012 event, gray circles indicate modified Mercalli intensity > 6 values inferred from direct damage surveys (Frohlich et al., 2014). able to distinguish between the two alternative hypotheses, where good instrumental data are available. The inference of low stress-drop values for injection-induced earthquakes is consistent with the results of Goertz- Allmann et al. (2011) , who estimate low stress-drop values, around 1 MPa, near the casing shoe of the injection well at the Basel geothermal site, with values as high as, but generally lower than, 10 MPa at distances of a few kilometers.\nAlthough precise stress-drop values for intraplate earthquakes have been debated, available evidence consistently points to higher values than for interplate earthquakes (e.g., Scholz et al., 1986; Allmann and Shearer, 2009) . Analyzing global data with a systematic approach, Allmann and Shearer (2009) estimate a factor of 2 average difference between stress drops of intraplate versus interplate earthquakes. In contrast, for the events analyzed in this study, we find stress drops of injection-induced earthquakes are lower than stress drops of regional tectonic earthquakes, by a factor of approximately 2-10.\nThe results of this study potentially bear on the question raised earlier, whether the second and third principal events in the Prague, Oklahoma, sequence were also injection induced, or whether they were tectonic earthquakes triggered by the initial event. and Sumy et al. (2014) favor the latter hypothesis, concluding that the initial 5 November 2011 earthquake near Prague, Oklahoma, likely triggered the two subsequent events on adjacent faults. McGarr (2014) argues that all three events were likely induced by the large volume of fluids injected in multiple boreholes in proximity to the seismic sequence. The results presented in this study reveal comparable (M w \u2212 M IE ) values for all three events. I propose three alternative explanations:\n1. As argued by McGarr (2014) , all three events were injection induced.\n2. The second two events were triggered by stress transfer, but conditions on the neighboring faults were ripe for failure only because of the large volume of injected fluids in nearby wells. 3. Injection-induced earthquakes are characterized by low stress drops because of their shallow depths, and an initial shallow event triggered subsequent tectonic events that were also shallow.\nAt this point, Prague remains a singular case, and it may be impossible to reach a definitive conclusion about the driving mechanism(s) for the sequence. The second hypothesis is attractive, however, because it explains why all three values have similar depths and (M w \u2212 M IE ) values, whereas Coulomb triggering explains the temporal clustering of the events. However, the results of this study do not address the question of the general triggering potential of induced earthquakes. It is difficult to understand why static stress changes from induced earthquakes would not potentially trigger nearby tectonic events, although the shallow depths of induced earthquakes will tend to concentrate stress changes in proximity to the initial event, relative to a deeper earthquake of comparable magnitude (e.g., King et al., 1994) .\nAs noted, while the bulk of DYFI data for all events are more consistent with the inferred M IE values than the event (1), assuming M IE 3.5 and a focal depth of 5 km. Note that beyond approximately 50 km, the effect of the shallow depth is negligible. Short Note magnitudes, available intensity data for near-field distances, within 10 km, are more consistent with predictions for each event magnitude. Because, as noted, equation (1) includes nonphysical depth terms, there is a potential disconnect between the hypocentral distances provided by the DYFI system and the distance term R in equation (1). The difference between different distance measures will be consequential only for distances less than \u224820 km; distance ranges for which there is relatively little data in the CEUS, for either the calibration events or the events analyzed in this study. However, the intensity prediction equations determined using equation (1) provide a good fit to near-as well as far-field DYFI intensities for tectonic events. The question of interest is thus how near-field DYFI intensities for injection-induced earthquakes differ from near-field intensities for tectonic events.\nAs noted, high near-field intensities for the induced earthquakes analyzed in this study are consistent with expectations for shallow events. That is, whereas Gasperini et al. (2010) conclude depth cannot be reliably estimated from intensity data, basic wave propagation considerations predict that shallow earthquakes will generate higher intensities in the epicentral region than deeper events. Returning to the data from the Youngstown, Ohio, earthquake, whereas DYFI intensities within 10 km are consistent with predictions for the event magnitude assuming a standard CEUS depth, intensities at all distances are well fit by equation (1) given M IE 3.5 and a hypocentral depth of 5 km (e.g., Kim, 2013) .\nA shallow source depth is also consistent with the relatively high intensity values estimated by Frohlich et al. (2014) for the near field of the 17 May 2012 event in east Texas. In their study, DYFI data were supplemented with 100 intensity values estimated from local surveys based on questionnaires as well as in-person surveys and inspections. Traditionally assigned intensities will not necessarily be consistent with values determined from the DYFI system. Indeed, the values estimated by Frohlich et al. (2014) are higher than DYFI values at distances of 20-50 km, in which good DYFI data are available. This is consistent with the results of Hough (2013) , who concludes that, by design, DYFI intensities correspond to representative effects within a given spatial footprint and will be lower than intensities estimated from the most dramatic individual instances of damage. This caveat notwithstanding, Frohlich et al. (2014) estimate intensities as high as 7, and in one case 8, extending a few kilometers from the epicenter (as estimated from intensity data; Fig. 3) . These values correspond to instances of significant damage, for example, chimneys broken off at the roofline. Frohlich et al. (2014) also estimate shallow focal depths, ranging from 1.6 to 4.6 km, for aftershocks recorded on portable instruments, pointing to a comparably shallow mainshock focal depth.\nFollowing the M w 5.7 Prague, Oklahoma, earthquake of 6 November 2011, a field survey was undertaken to document evidence of ground deformation (B. Sherrod, personal comm., 2014) . Secondary effects such as liquefaction are now known to not be reliable indicators of shaking intensity. To the author's knowledge, no detailed damage survey was undertaken following this earthquake, but photographs again reveal instances of significant near-field damage: chimneys broken off at the rooflines, a spire broken off of a building at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee, etc.\nThe above discussion illustrates another potentially important point: Hough (2013) concludes that, within the footprint of a large city, intensity values tend to be normally distributed, with outlier values commonly exceeding the average by 1 intensity unit and not uncommonly by 1.5-2 units. It is therefore reasonable to expect intensities will also be normally distributed within the footprint of an individual ZIP code. Thus, for example, for M IE 4.0 and a hypocentral depth of 5 km, equation (1) predicts intensities 5.8 and 5.0 for epicentral distances of 1 and 10 km, respectively, but shaking effects at individual locations/structures are expected to be as much as 1.5-2 units higher. It is thus not surprising that a detailed damage survey (Frohlich et al., 2014) revealed effects commensurate with intensity 7."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Although instrumental recordings of injection-induced earthquakes remain sparse, the DYFI system now provides excellent characterization of shaking intensities caused by induced earthquakes. I show that, for 11 such events that occurred between 2011 and 2013, estimated intensities are consistent with effective intensity magnitudes that are lower by 0.4-1.3 units than the event magnitudes, with an average difference of 0.8 units. Using simple relations between peak acceleration, magnitude, and stress drop inferred from standard scaling relations and random vibration theory, these factors suggest stress-drop values for injection-induced events are lower by factors of roughly 2-10 than stress drops of regional tectonic events. However, at very close distances, the reduction in shaking intensity due to lower stress drop will likely be offset by increases in intensities due to the generally shallow source depths of injection-induced earthquakes. This suggests that, although moderate injection-induced earthquakes in the CEUS will be widely felt due to low regional attenuation, the damage from earthquakes induced by injection will be more concentrated in proximity to the event epicenters than shaking from tectonic earthquakes. In any case, that is, regardless of the interpretation, a growing body of well-constrained DYFI data provides prima facie evidence that shaking from injection-induced earthquakes is significantly lower at regional distances than shaking from tectonic earthquakes in the same region. Within approximately 10 km of the epicenter, intensities are commensurate with or potentially higher than expected for the event magnitude. These results can be explained as a consequence of the shallow depths of induced events."}, {"section_title": "Data and Resources", "text": "All intensity data were downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey \"Did You Feel It?\" website (http:// earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi, last accessed April 2014).
