[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The importance of research at higher education Scientific research conducted at higher education institutions is vital for identifying and developing new knowledge that leads to groundbreaking innovations. Innovation drives the state's economy and improves quality of life. High-quality, effective, and efficient research efforts require the appropriate level of funding, including from the federal government, the major source of research funds. Strong programs for all types of research -basic research, applied research, and technology transfer -build on one another, making them paramount to a strong economy. Strong research programs also provide state-of-the-art educational opportunities for students and attract the best faculty."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Comparisons between states are based on data collected by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Higher Education Research and Development Survey, which uses different reporting requirements to institution's annual financial reports. The federal calculation will be higher than state data. FY 2013 is the most recent year for which data are available. Texas was ranked third among the states, with $4.8 billion in total research expenditures as reported by the NSF, behind California ($8.4 billion) and New York ($5.5 billion). Texas ranked sixth in federal research expenditures for FY 2013 (see table below).\nExpenditures occur in one or more years after funds are obligated. Obligated funds are another measure of research activity. Texas institutions of higher education ranked sixth in federal obligations for FY 2012 (see table below). The total of federal obligations for FY 2012 was $27.4 billion, a decrease of 2.0 percent from 2011. Over the same time, federal obligations for Texas decreased by 1.4 percent.

An institution must meet legislatively specified benchmarks to be eligible for funds. All eligible institutions must be emerging research universities, according to the Coordinating Board's Accountability System, and must have expended more than $45 million on restricted research for two years in a row.\nTwo institutions, Texas Tech University and University of Houston, achieved eligibility for NRUF funding in 2012. NRUF provided $32.7 million for the 2012-13 biennium, $35.9 million for the 2014-15 biennium, and $37.8 million for the 2016-17 biennium. The two institutions received equal amounts of funding."}, {"section_title": "Autism Program", "text": "In 2015, the Texas Legislature funded the Coordinating Board to provide grant support for autism research centers at institutions of higher education, which currently provide evidence-based behavioral services and training (Rider 68, Appropriations Act, Strategy D.1.11). The funding will support parent-directed treatment; board-certified behavioral analyst (BCBA) training; and research, development, and evaluation of innovative autism treatment models. The Coordinating Board will report to the Legislature about the effectiveness of each funded program. 2006-07, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13, and 2014-15 biennia were $200 million, $117 million, $203 million, $141 million, and $57 million, respectively.
