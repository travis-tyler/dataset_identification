[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Climate change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is causing a range of environmental challenges and corresponding mitigation policies (Karl et al., 2009; Ellerman and Buchner, 2007) . Global GHG emissions from livestock production were recently estimated to be 18% of anthropogenic GHGs , which is roughly equal to emissions from all transportation systems globally, although this value has been disputed (Pitesky et al., 2009; Asner and Archer, 2010) . Global livestock production accounts for 78% of agricultural land, 33% of all cropland for feed, and covers roughly 30% of terrestrial area . Increasing population and rising living standards between 2000 and 2050 are expected to more than double global production of meat from 229 to 465 million metric tons . In conjunction, by 2050, direct GHG emissions from meat, milk, and egg production are expected to increase by 39% above year 2000 levels (Pelletier and Tyedmers, 2010 ), yet many technologies could be developed or used to decrease these projected emissions levels. In the U.S. in 2010, direct GHG emissions from beef cattle totaled 112 Tg carbon dioxideequivalent (CO 2 e), corresponding to 26.2% of emissions from agriculture or 1.6% of national GHG emissions (EPA, 2012) (Table A.1 and A.2 in Supplementary Information).\nComprehensive and standardized methods to assess the environmental impact of livestock are now being developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2013) . Large agri-food companies and distributors (e.g. Kellogg's, BASF, Walmart, Bunge; http://www.Field-toMarket.org) have also recently begun initiatives to track the sustainability of agricultural products for potential marketing purposes (Fliegelman, 2010; NCBA, 2011) . The full environmental impact of a product due to the extended impacts from its supply chain can be evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA). Currently the National Cattleman's Beef Association is working with BASF on an LCA of beef production to identify the most important areas for future innovation to reduce environmental burdens.\nIn general, LCA has two uses: 1) to quantify absolute emissions from production life cycles for comparison with other systems, and 2) to identify system components to maximize efficiency and/or minimize environmental impacts. To quantify all GHG emissions from meat production from beef cattle, a comprehensive inventory of production inputs within a defined boundary is required, which includes im-D u D l e y e t a l . i n J o u r n a l o f C l e a n e r P r o d u C t i o n 7 5 ( 2 0 1 4 ) pacts occurring away from facilities. Yet, a standard LCA boundary for GHG emissions from beef cattle is currently non-existent, which necessitates an investigation of possible significant emissions that may occur either directly or indirectly from production locations.\nThe multitude of related agricultural systems associated with beef production raises questions concerning appropriate system boundaries. The most extensive attributional LCA is only relevant to analyses with the same system boundaries, and could be less valuable for informing policy frameworks with a different set of boundaries, depending on the context and goals. Consequential LCAs that account for indirect effects from livestock production, such as related land use change that occurs nationally and globally (Dumortier et al., 2012) , provide a more expansive assessment of the real-world GHG emissions resulting from specific policies or actions. Because LCAs can have a range of complexity for the same system in question, particularly due to the inconsistent inclusion of indirect effects (Sanchez et al., 2012) , all LCA results are relative to the specific system boundaries used and the analytical context. Comparison of these approaches can provide insight to the limitations of each quantification approach and can provide better guidance in designing new LCAs to guide innovation and to be used within policy frameworks where needed.\nThe life cycle GHG emissions intensity of U.S. beef cattle production has recently been estimated to range between 5.9 and 15.5 kg CO 2 e per kg live weight (LW) (Hamerschlag, 2011; Phetteplace et al., 2001 ). Yet these studies did not include emissions from indirect land use change and use of co-products from biofuel production (Bellarby et al., 2013) . Furthermore, these studies have insufficiently documented variability and uncertainty in these systems. To clarify these issues, an LCA of GHG emissions from beef production was conducted using U.S. industry statistics and previously published data to assess the contribution of land use and biofuel co-products, and an uncertainty analysis was constructed using the Monte Carlo method and a sensitivity analysis. The resulting LCA identifies factors in the life cycle of beef production that have the greatest sensitivity for determining emissions and thus require additional measurements to increase certainty in GHG emissions estimates. As environmental regulatory policy could employ LCA in the future, the LCA results were also compared with current regulatory policy frameworks."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "System description", "text": "This study focuses on the cow-calf and feedlot systems of beef cattle production in the central United States. Consistent with standard LCA practice, output emissions are allocated by mass and are given on a per product basis (i.e. per unit live weight). System parameters were weighted by multiplying state-level data by the fraction of cattle in each state and summing the result (Table A.3 and A.4) . Most beef calves (74%) are born between February and May while on pasture with the cow (EPA, 2010) . At seven months, a designated number of beef heifers are chosen as \"replacements\" for breeding, while all steers and remaining heifers are fed on pasture (i.e. back-grounded) for ~0-17 months, depending on regional and temporal factors (such as availability of forage) and then transferred to feedlots."}, {"section_title": "Pasture", "text": "In addition to pasture and feedlot GHG emissions attributable to each slaughtered animal, each beef animal raised for meat is the product of a parent cow that lives on pasture. For this study, pasture GHG emissions were estimated using an arbitrary model cattle herd comprising 100 cows, 15 heifers, 3 bulls, and 90 spring-born calves (of which 75 are sent to finishing and 15 heifers kept as replacements) . Pasture GHG emissions of the entire herd were averaged over the yearly meat output of the herd, which included 75 feedlot-finished cattle (637 kg hd \u22121 ) and 15 cull cows (636 kg hd \u22121 ). Equations developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used to estimate enteric fermentation methane emissions (EPA, 2010) (Table A.5). Literature estimates were used to evaluate the potential of pasture land to sequester carbon; however, much uncertainty and spatial variability exists in these estimates, which range from \u22123.5 to 1.2 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW (Pitesky et al., 2009; Asner and Archer, 2010) (Table A .6) . For the resulting pasture portion of the LCA value, only emissions from enteric fermentation were counted; net soil GHG emissions and manure emissions were assumed to be zero, although variability was included in the uncertainty analysis. All pasture emissions are highly dependent on the number of cattle on pasture and the duration; this analysis does not include emissions from back-grounded cattle while on pasture, because aggregate statistics on this cattle population are not available. Several other GHG emissions including production of supplemental grain/forage, fossil fuel energy use for feeding, fuel for transportation of cattle, and embedded energy in equipment were excluded due to lack of data and their expected relatively smaller contribution compared to the other GHG emissions assessed )."}, {"section_title": "Feed production for feedlots", "text": "Energy use emissions and other GHG emissions from corn production were attributed to the beef feedlot phase (Table A.4) . Additional emissions attributed to urea and forage in feed were calculated (Table A.7) . For the LCA, GHG emissions from distiller's grains plus solubles (DGS) are assumed to be identical to corn grain by mass. Generally, some DGS are dried to facilitate storage and transportation (changes in emissions from energy to dry coproducts were not assessed); however, a scenario was modeled in which only wet DGS were fed at the maximum inclusion level (45%) to a subset of local feedlots near ethanol processing facilities (Max Wet DGS Use, Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Indirect land use change from feed grains and pasture", "text": "The approach used to estimate GHG emissions from land use change due to beef production allocates ongoing global land use change to aggregate global agricultural products . A recent LCA of European beef and dairy cattle employed four different methods for estimating land use change (LUC) directly from the rate of grain consumption (Flysj\u00f6 et al., 2011) ; however, some methods are not relevant to the U.S. since, unlike Europe, U.S. feed for beef cattle are not sourced from LUC sensitive areas (e.g. Brazil). The most general approach to LUC assumes \"agricultural commodity markets are global and interconnected, and all demand for agricultural land contributes to commodity and land prices, and therefore contributes to land use change\" ). This top-down method calculates the amount of LUC emissions attributable to global agriculture (assumed to be 58%) and divides it by global agricultural land regardless of use. Thus, for this study, it is assumed that GHG emissions of 1.43 Mg CO 2 e are emitted due to LUC from each hectare of agricultural land used, including both crop and pasture . Land use was determined by attributing all pasture acres to beef (subtract 2.8% of acres for lamb, USDA, 2013) and land needed for feed production was estimated using corn yield (Table A.7) . Unit conversions between kg CO 2 e hd \u22121 to kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 carcass weight assume 584 kg/hd, 192 days on feed, and 63% dressing percentage; conversion from kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 carcass weight to kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 beef; assume 75% meat:waste ratio.\nAttributional LCA quantifies related production emissions that occur away from the feedlot facility but are caused by the supply chain of the system (see Materials and Methods). Alternatively, a consequential LCA accounts for changes in emissions from a range of sources that change as a consequence of production, and include emissions that are not part of the supply chain (Finnveden et al., 2009) ; emissions from indirect land use change (ILUC) are one of many possible consequential indirect emissions (Sanchez et al., 2012) .\nEmissions due to ILUC from production of corn-ethanol were recently estimated based on an increase in the mandated demand for ethanol (Searchinger et al., 2008) . These ILUC emissions are currently included in regulatory LCAs for cornethanol at federal (EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard, RFS2) and state levels (California) (Hertel et al., 2010; Liska and Perrin, 2009; Searchinger et al., 2008) . These studies use economic analysis to estimate the marginal change in grain price due to the change in grain demand, and the related change in global land conversion due to the increased grain price. Carbon dioxide emissions are then released from soils and standing biomass during deforestation from expansion of cropping areas. While livestock production clearly has a large role in land use trends, allocation of these emissions in an LCA requires careful consideration.\nIf the U.S. beef cattle population were increasing, such an additional GHG emission from ILUC from corn demand could be applied to the LCA, as calculated by the EPA for corn-ethanol. Alternatively, if the cattle population were decreasing, U.S. beef cattle would receive a GHG emission credit based on this ILUC calculation. The cattle population cycles due to various factors, and has generally been declining since the 1970's, but it is assumed for this analysis that the population is at a steady-state; in July 2006 and July 2011, beef cattle totaled 33.3 and 31.4 million, respectively (USDA, 2013). The EPA approach used for ILUC from corn-ethanol is additionally limited in its applicability to beef cattle because it considers corn production only (not pasture) and the economic modeling assumptions are predicated on a government-mandated increase in corn-ethanol production.\nA recent examination of land use change explores potential future policy related to beef cattle (Dumortier et al., 2012) . In that study, a 10% tax is imposed on U.S. steer prices. Modeled beef prices increase worldwide and global consumption decreases. Specifically, U.S. production decreases by 17.1%, however, this is countered by increased production in Argentina (4.8%), Brazil (4.9%), Canada (6.7%), Indonesia (4.0%), and elsewhere, since production in these areas is not subject to a tax. The resulting land use change in these countries is estimated to cause an increased emission of 37-85 kg CO 2 e per kg of U.S. beef not produced. This result suggests that intensive U.S. beef production should be maintained in lieu of extensive production in carbon sensitive areas elsewhere (i.e. Brazil) in order to meet an inelastic global demand for beef. This consequential analysis is specific to the economic situation modeled (17% decrease in U.S. production) and is not appropriate for inclusion in an attributional LCA representing current average production.\nThe consequential ILUC emissions discussed above are calculated based on a change in the rate of production of a product; i.e. second derivative changes. Alternatively, consequential ILUC emissions can also be allocated to a product based only on the rate of production, and the associated rate of a related process; i.e. first derivative changes. The \"first derivative\" approach used here (see Materials and Methods) is useful in that it can be consistently applied to an allocational LCA framework in a transparent manner not dependent on external policies or short-term production trends. This ILUC methodology assumes all agricultural land contributes equally to ILUC, which simplifies calculations dramatically and has many advantages: 1) it allows allocation of ILUC emissions to all food types equally without the possibility of overcounting, 2) \"food-types which have high land use requirements (e.g. beef) are allocated higher LUC emissions, and switching to foodtypes with lower land use requirements will show a reduction in LUC emissions,\" ) and 3) it attributes emissions to all commodities that utilize agricultural land regardless of arbitrary territorial boundaries. For U.S. beef production and this LCA, land use change emissions (LUC) are 0.85 and 1.17 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW for cropping and pasture land use, respectively (Table 1) .\nA drawback of Audsley et al.'s first-derivative approach is the assumption that some marginal pasture lands are currently only productive when used for cattle grazing , thus grazing lands are not contributing to LUC from the consequential perspective. But alternatively, recent analysis suggests grazing lands could also be used to power horse-based transportation (in the developing world) or for cellulosic biofuels, and thus have other uses and tradeoffs (Liska and Heier, 2013) ; this would suggest pasture grazing should be attributed consequential ILUC emissions. Also, Audsley et al.'s approach does not capture increased soil carbon storage in pasture (compared to cropland) or address the impact of substitute products which may have an identical land area footprint, but different land use change impacts. Yet, this approach appears to be the most consistent with attributional LCA principles since it does not over-count and is not dependent on situational conditions. A second-derivative consequential framework, however, could be more insightful if needed to inform agricultural policy (Dumortier et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Feedlot", "text": "Equations developed by the IPCC were used to estimate direct emissions of enteric methane as well methane and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from manure management (EPA, 2010) , which is consistent with many other LCA studies (Crosson et al., 2011) . In order to characterize U.S. dry feedlots (e.g. those without bedding or confinement), relevant industry data was used wherever possible in place of EPA or IPCC default parameter values. Proprietary data (including in weight, out weight, average weight, days on feed, average daily gain, and dry matter intake) from the Professional Cattle Consultants (PCC) published in monthly newsletters was compiled and analyzed (Table A. 3). Data from the PCC are defined by five U.S. cattle regions; in this study, data from the North Plains, Central Plains, and Corn Belt, comprising 11,575,000 steers and 9,635,000 heifers, are used to examine spatial variability (Figure A.1, Table A.8) . Additional parameter values were used from the literature for feedlot performance, including energy content of feed dry matter (Vasconcelos and Galyean, 2007) and energy for maintenance (NRC, 2000) (Table A.9) .

Monte Carlo simulation (i.e. stochastic iteration) was used to evaluate parameter variability and to generate a probability distribution of the expected LCA intensities.

Three other parameters (methane conversion factor, corn cropping GHG intensity, and corn yield) were assigned a discrete distribution characterized by frequencies determined by spatial weighting (Table A.4) . Feedlot statistics such as dry matter intake and animal mass were assigned a normal distribution consistent with a known standard deviation."}, {"section_title": "EPA Methodologies", "text": "The EPA uses two methods for estimating GHG emissions. Annually since 1990, The Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, referred to as \"Annual Inventory,\" is consistent with methods developed by the IPCC for use within the Kyoto protocol (EPA, 2012 and IPCC et al., 2006) . Alternatively, the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, referred to as \"Mandatory Reporting,\" was created in 2009 to begin comprehensive data collection needed to inform future regulatory actions (Ellerman and Buchner, 2007; EPA, 2013a) . The EPA requires U.S. GHG emitters across all industries to report emissions of more the 25,000 metric tons CO 2 e per year. The 13,000 total facilities above this threshold encompass 85-90% of U.S. GHG emissions (http://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/ main.do).\nOf the two EPA approaches, the Mandatory Reporting includes only emissions from manure management (Table A. 10), while the Annual Inventory includes both manure management and enteric fermentation (Table A.9). The Annual Inventory method forms the basis for the pasture and feedlot sections of the LCA presented here; additionally, a feedlot-only scenario is presented ( Figure 2 ) for comparison with the Mandatory Reporting output (which covers feedlot manure emissions only); equations used are shown in supplementary materials (Equations A.1 and A.2). Industry-derived parameters (ASABE, 2010; NRC, 2000; Vasconcelos and Galyean, 2007 ) were compared to EPA defaults (Tables A.9 and A.10). To characterize geospatial variability in feedlots, data used for animal mass, volatile solids, excreted nitrogen (N), ambient temperature, methane conversion factor, and fraction of N runoff/leaching were weighted into regional and national averages (EPA, 2009 (EPA, , 2013b (Table A. 3). a.

Aggregate GHG emissions sum to 8.14 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW (Table 1) . Pasture emissions from the cow-calf system account for 3.53 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW of the beef life cycle, which is similarly estimated by other studies (3.76 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW) . Comparatively, Pelletier et al. reports that pasture GHG emissions occur primarily from enteric fermentation (~42%), feed production (~37%), and manure (~21%) and also assumes soil carbon sequestration at a rate of 0.12 kg C ha \u22121 yr \u22121 . Considerable uncertainty exists in the pasture component of the life cycle, especially with regard to stocking rate (Mu et al., 2013) , length of backgrounding, and supplemental feeding.\nAs a result of the expansion of ethanol production from grain in recent years, use of coproducts as livestock feeds has increased . Compared to corn grain, DGS has a higher energy density, which results in increased daily gain and less time in the feedlots (i.e. reduced days on feed) ( Table 1) . As DGS contain a larger fraction of protein than corn grain, N from urea is not added to DGS-supplemented feedlot diets. The higher N-content of DGS relative to corn correlates to an increase in excreted N and corresponding manure management N 2 O emissions ; it is currently not known how enteric fermentation is affected by DGS feeding. On average, DGS are fed at 20% of dry matter intake (Current DGS Use) when substituted in corn-based beef cattle diets (Corn Diet), which decreases feeding time by 8% and increases N-excreted by 18% (Table 1) . From a nutritional standpoint, inclusion of DGS in cattle diets is typically maximized at 45% of dry matter intake (Max DGS Use) . At this increased feeding rate, a 4% reduction in time on feed and a 49% increase in N-excretion would result. Compared to the Corn Diet, Current DGS Use reduces emissions by 1.7% over the entire life cycle (Table 1) . Emissions increase by 2.0% for Max DGS Use compared to Corn Diet, primarily due to increased N 2 O emissions from greater N concentrations in manure. Feeding of only wet distillers grain at 45% inclusion (Max Wet DGS Use) is nearly equivalent to the Corn Diet, since the increased rate of gain when fed wet DGS, relative to modified or dry, further decreases time on feed (Table 1) .\nWithin the feedlot portion of the life cycle, manure management and enteric fermentation contribute nearly equal emissions (766 and 888 kg CO 2 e hd \u22121 yr \u22121 , respectively); additionally, direct emissions from fossil fuels used during feedlot production were included (144 kg CO 2 e hd \u22121 yr \u22121 ) ( Table 1) . Net emissions from soil carbon from manure application was assumed to be zero since there exists a corresponding marginal decrease in soil carbon on land used to produce grain/forage feed from which the manure carbon is derived (Schlesinger, 1999) ."}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty in the beef life cycle", "text": "The sensitivity analysis performed here found that land use change clearly has the highest degree of uncertainty associated with beef production. Depending on the approach of the ILUC method (i.e. first-derivative vs. second-derivative), GHG emissions from land use change can vary 5-fold (Table 2) . Alternate parameter values for pasture soil emissions, feedlot manure soil carbon, enteric fermentation of cattle on pasture, and manure management in the feedlot could change the LCA GHG intensity of beef by 14-59%. Other parameters had less of an effect ( Table 2) .\nThe Monte Carlo method generated a probability distribution of GHG intensities that range from 0.23 to 11.19 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW, with 90% of results between 2.52 and 9.58, and a standard deviation of 2.16 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW (Figure 1) . The distribution is skewed to the left, due to the distribution of emissions from pasture that likely reduce the net GHG emissions, but (depending on pasture management) are possible to not sequester soil carbon in many situations (Figure A.2) . In the LCA (Table 1) , net pasture soil carbon sequestration was assumed to be zero; inclusion of lower emissions due to sequestration in the Monte Carlo simulation was the biggest factor in shifting the calculated value of 8.14 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW to a Monte Carlo-derived mean of 6.46 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW. In general, quantifying these distributions of possible results is limited by lack of information concerning the distribution of most parameters; only seven were tested in this analysis. Thus, it is acknowledged that this approach does not fully capture the variability of the system."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with other studies", "text": "Estimates of the life cycle emissions intensity of beef production from previous studies were summarized and compared with this analysis (Figures 2 & 3) . The life cycle emissions intensity reported here is very similar to a recent assessment for beef cattle in the U.S. , but the estimate provided here is roughly half of the intensity of two other estimates, at 12.8 and 15.5 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW (Hamerschlag, 2011; Phetteplace et al., 2001) (Figure 2 ). Previous estimates for U.S. beef were higher due to the unusual inclusion of mois- ture and fat loss in cooking, plate loss, and spoilage (Hamerschlag, 2011). Other analysis had higher enteric fermentation emissions and higher ill-defined N 2 O and pasture emissions (Phetteplace et al., 2001) . Also, the LCA documented here excludes cattle during backgrounding, as no statistics are available on time and amount of cattle that are raised on pasture for a brief time prior to feedlot entry. The number of backgrounded cattle could be conservative, which could also explain the relatively low value found here (Tables A.5 and A.6). Adjusting the number of backgrounded calves to 70 for every 100 cows, a relatively high estimate, increases methane emissions from enteric fermentation by 34% to 4.73 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 . Life cycle emissions from other studies globally encompass Australia, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia and range from 5.9 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW in the U.S. to 17.6 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW in Brazil (Cederberg et al., 2009) (Figure 3) .\nWhen considering LUC emissions, previous global assessments have indicated these emissions could range from 38 to 53% of all emissions from livestock (Asner and Archer, 2010; . A recent study in Brazil found deforestation associated with pasture expansion produced additional emissions in the range of 10.1-461 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW, depending on whether these regional land use change emissions are allocated to all beef cattle in Brazil, or to cattle only in areas of newly deforested land (Figure 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of LCA with EPA Mandatory Reporting and Annual Inventory methods", "text": "Climate change mitigation policies exist at international, national, and state levels; however, they generally do not include livestock GHG emissions. The Kyoto protocol, following the international approach of the 1987 Montreal Protocol (ozone depleting chemicals) and the 1972 London Convention (marine waste dumping), is distinctive in accounting for livestock GHG emissions; however, the U.S. was not a participant (IPCC et al., 2006; Weiss and Jacobson, 1998) . Carbon trading frameworks such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (2005), the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (2009, Northeastern States), and the AB 32 Global Warming Solutions Act (2012, California) do not quantify GHG emissions from livestock (Ellerman and Buchner, 2007) . Livestock would have been eligible for financial support as \"offsets\" within the cap and trade system of the proposed American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey bill) but quantification procedures and metrics were never finalized (Rabe, 2010) .\nIn lieu of national legislative policy on climate change, a recent Supreme Court decision (Massachusetts et al. vs . Environmental Protection Agency) on April 2, 2007 specifically granted the EPA authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions (Mass v. EPA, 2007) . In response, the Mandatory Reporting rule was created and a quantification framework for livestock was developed; however, the livestock section of the Mandatory Reporting rule was effectively eliminated by House Resolution 2996 in Section 425, which prohibits the EPA from using fiscal year 2010 appropriations to implement subpart JJ (Manure Management) of Part 98 of the Mandatory Reporting legislation (EPA, 2013b); this funding ban was further extended by the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (Public Law 111-242). While the government's role in climate issues is being debated, the majority of U.S. citizens believe climate change is real and support regulation by the government (Rabe, 2010) .\nSince there is clearly interest in GHG emissions from agricultural products from regulatory, political, and marketing perspectives, a comparison was made between the EPA feedlot quantification methods and other LCAs. Feedlots are the only phase of the production sequence where GHG emissions could be concentrated enough to meet the site-level regulatory threshold in the EPA's Mandatory Reporting methodology (25,000 Mg CO 2 e per year), designated by the EPA as 29,300 head and encompassing an estimated 50 operations in the U.S. (EPA, 2009 (EPA, , 2013a .

Variability in emission levels between three geographic regions was minimal, being less than 3-6% ( Figure A. 3). Sensitivity analysis shows that the N excretion rate has the greatest influence on final emissions (Figure 4a ). Since this approach calculates only manure emissions from feedlots, these levels are significantly lower when converted to an emissions-per-product value (0.27 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW) and compared to an aggregate LCA (Figure 2) .\nThe PCC industry statistics used with the EPA Annual Inventory methods formed the basis for a feedlot emissions estimate of 1653 kg CO 2 e hd \u22121 yr \u22121 , ranging from 1590 to 1716 kg CO 2 e hd \u22121 yr \u22121 (Table A.9). Spatial differences between the three PCC regions were 5% for EPA methods and industry values (Figure A.3) . In a comparison of the sensitivity of five parameters (animal mass, daily gain, energy for growth, N excreted , and energy for maintenance), variability of these factors had a roughly equal result on final values to be reported (Figure 4b ). For industry data, the distribution of emissions was roughly ~55% for CH 4 from enteric fermentation, ~2% for CH 4 from manure management, ~39% from direct manure N 2 O, and ~5% from indirect manure N 2 O from runoff/leaching with subsequent volatilization. The EPA Annual Inventory forms the basis for direct feedlot emissions used in the LCA (1.49 kg CO 2 e kg \u22121 LW) and is much lower relative to LCA values because it is only a component of the life cycle (Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 currently requires the use of LCA for quantifying GHG emissions from biofuels for comparison with petroleum products, and similar LCA methods are used in response to California climate policy Liska and Perrin, 2009; ). Thus, it is possible that future policy will use LCA to quantify emissions from other agricultural sectors. The quantitative methods underlying the EPA Mandatory Reporting rule are shown here to account for roughly 20% of feedlot GHG emissions (recognized by the more complete EPA Annual Inventory) and only 3% of life cycle GHG emissions (Figure 2 ). Yet, if an assessment of the total GHG emissions that result from beef cattle production were to be monitored or used for marketing purposes (Fliegelman, 2010; Hamerschlag, 2011) , then a much higher emissions level, as documented here, would be expected compared to EPA's local assessments.\nThe uncertainty analysis performed here found that net pasture emissions and land use change have the highest degree of uncertainty associated with beef production. Longer pasture durations has been shown previously to have higher GHG emissions compared with shorter and more intensive feedlot finishing (Peters et al., 2010) . Similarly, this analysis also found that the most GHG intense phase of the life cycle of beef cattle was during the pasture phase, and this was also associated with the greatest uncertainty in the life cycle. These results suggest that further research should focus on pasture level contributions to life cycle GHG emissions and validation of estimated feedlot emissions by direct measurement of GHG emissions.\nThe second-derivative and first-derivative approaches to ILUC from U.S. beef production produce dramatically different results in both sign and magnitude. Depending on the goals and scope of the LCA in question, either approach can be valid, but extensive effort should be made to clearly define the appropriateness of the application. In determining which approach is useful for government policy, first-derivative approaches could be used for national labeling programs, industry emissions thresholds, or comparison to other agriculture products, where appropriate. Alternatively, analysis of tax policies or other mandated management techniques should perhaps use a second-derivative methodology. Overall, it is clear that estimations of life cycle emissions from livestock are highly dependent on policy contexts, particularly concerning indirect effects, and results do not strictly reflect biophysical processes.
