[{"section_title": "", "text": "Researchers from ERS and Rutgers University have compiled a database of over 11,000 U.S. utility patents issued between 1976 and 2000 for a broad range of agricultural biotechnology applications (www.ers.usda.gov/data/agbiotechip/). The database includes a system of technology classification and extensive information on patent assignee ownership history-especially important in light of the large number of industry mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs in the last decade. The database was assembled to help science policy researchers understand the dynamic effects of intellectual property protection in emerging areas of technology, but also to provide a useful picture of \"who is doing what\" in agbiotech.

Net farm income, which is a measure of the sector's profitability, was a record $59.2 billion in 2003, up 59 percent from the $37.3 billion earned in 2002, and about 24 percent above the average of the preceding 10 years. Net cash income, which gives an indication of cash income generated from the farm business, was estimated at a record $68.6 billion in 2003, up 35 percent from the $50.8 billion earned in 2002 and about 20 percent above the 10-year average. The farm sector was estimated to have contributed a record $101.4 billion in value-added to U.S. national economic output in 2003, up 29 percent from 2002 and 16 percent above the 10-year average. Farm income forecasts for 2004 will be updated on November 9 (www.ers. usda.gov/briefing/farmincome/).

Presenters from ERS, academia, international organizations, and private industry discussed recent changes to agricultural policy in the U.S. and the European Union and alternative approaches to modeling to address challenges posed by decoupled payments.

The workshop was hosted by The Food Industry Center of the University of Minnesota. About 50 participants from the food industry, government, the media, and academia shared information on the effects of current consumer trends and nutrition issues on demand for grainbased foods. Participants also discussed how different data sources can contribute to the assessment and monitoring of consumption trends. Presentations by ERS economists addressed U.S. per capita food availability and intake and how intake estimates vary by demographic categories.

A pioneer in the field of agricultural economics, Taylor helped to create the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the predecessor of ERS, and served as its first director. Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, noted international trade economist at Columbia University, delivered the first Taylor Lecture. In his talk, \"In Defense of Globalization,\" Bhagwati shared observations on the outcomes of World Trade Organization negotiations and insights on outsourcing and other related current economic issues. Recognizing that Taylor was also the first leader of the Farm Foundation, the event concluded with a presentation of the Taylor Commemorative Plaque to Bhagwati by current Farm Foundation President Walt Armbruster. A reception followed honoring former leaders of ERS, including Ken Farrell, John Lee, and J.B. Penn. This annual lecture series is designed to promote discourse on contemporary economic issues of interest to agricultural economists within and outside ERS and USDA.

The interview explored the purposes and uses of USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), and informed farmers about the value of the information collected in the survey. ARMS surveys are being readied to go into the field this winter. Two 30-second Public Service Announcements about ARMS were also recorded for airing throughout the year.

Current research shows that baby boomers are shifting toward rural and small town destinations, but they seem to be attracted to a more diverse set of destinations, compared with older cohorts. Researchers from ERS and Vermont's Middlebury College are conducting a study to gauge the impacts of baby boomer retirement migration on rural and small town America. The study will examine how demographic, natural amenity, housing market, urban proximity, and economic factors affected the migration flows of baby boomers into rural areas during the 1990s. Findings will also help researchers to better predict the future migration patterns of baby boomers over the next 20 years.

The subcommittee, composed of government, academic, and industry representatives, was established to explore improvements and efficiencies in the data collection of pesticide use in agricultural and nonagricultural applications. These improvements would include analysis, processing, and communication of crop protection product information.
