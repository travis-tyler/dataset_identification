[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary set-aside program in the United States designed to ameliorate soil erosion, control crop overproduction, enhance water quality, and provide wildlife habitat by replacing crops with other forms of land cover. Because CRP includes primarily grass habitats, it has great potential to benefit declining North American grassland bird populations. We looked at the change in national and state population trends of grassland birds and related changes to cover-specific CRP variables (previous research grouped all CRP practices). Changes in national trends after the initiation of the CRP were inconclusive, but we observed signficant bird-CRP relations at the state level. Most bird-CRP relations were positive, except for some species associated with habitats that CRP replaced. Practice-and configuration-specific CRP variables were related to grassland bird trends, rather than a generic measure of all CRP types combined. Considering all CRP land as a single, distinct habitat type may obscure actual relations between birds and set-aside characteristics. Understanding and predicting the effects of set-aside programs (like CRP or agri-environment schemes) on grassland birds is complex and difficult. Because available broad-scale datasets are less than adequate, studies should be conducted at a variety of spatial and temporal scales."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "T he ability of set-aside programs to produce wildlife benefits at landscape and regional scales has been widely documented both internationally (see Van Buskirk & Willi 2004 for review and also Kleijn & Baldi 2005 , Van Buskirk & Willi 2005 and specifically for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the United States (Hohman & Halloum 2000 , Haufler 2005 ). The CRP was initiated as part of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Hohman & Halloum 2000) . The CRP provides a variety of financial incentives (rental agreements, cost sharing, etc.) for landowners in the United States to convert cropland in environmentally sensitive areas to grassland, forest, and other forms of land cover (see Suppl. A for available conservation practices, termed CPs) through voluntary contracts with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Originally designed as a set-aside program to control agricultural production, the CRP has been expanded by subsequent legislative modification. Environmental benefits and creation of wildlife habitat are now primary objectives of the CRP (Hohman & Halloum 2000) . Currently, approximately 14 million hectares of potential wildlife habitat are enrolled under a CRP contract (USDA 2004) . This represents both a substantial addition of potential wildlife habitat and a substantial landscape modification (Weber et al. 2002 and see Fig. 1 below) . Thus, CRP land may be an important contributor to changes in the composition and configuration of agricultural landscapes in the United States.\nEvaluation of the CRP has focused on grassland birds for two reasons. First, \u2248 81% of the total CRP lands are enrolled in grass-based conservation practices (USDA 2004) , although other cover types and practices are available (e.g., trees, woody shelterbreaks and windbreaks, etc.). The CRP has substantially increased the amount of potential grassland habitat for birds that breed in grasslands of the continental US. Second, almost 60% of North American grassland breeding bird species are declining (Sauer et al. 2004) , the most consistently negative trends of any group of North American birds in recent decades (Vickery & Herkert 2001 , Brennan & Kuvlesky 2005 . These declines have largely been attributed to conversion of native grassland to cropland, rangeland, and other human landuses (Brennan & Kuvlesky 2005) . Thus, grassland birds should respond to the types of landscape changes resulting from the CRP (Riffell et al. 2008 ).\nMany different types of evidence may be used to evaluate the effects of set-aside programs on grassland birds Agricultural Set-aside Programs and Grassland Birds ..."}, {"section_title": "/ 2008", "text": "(e.g., increased abundance or improved breeding success). Most studies of CRP effects have been conducted at small (local) spatial and short temporal scales, but Ryan (2000) suggested that the strongest evidence of CRP benefits would be positive population trend changes after the initiation of the CRP. The few existing regional-scale assessments of avian response to the CRP have short-comings. First, most have been restricted to single species and/or a single region (e.g., Roseberry & David 1994) . Second, studies that have assessed CRP over an entire species' range (e.g., Herkert 1998) or a large region (e.g., Murphy 2003) have treated all CRPenrolled lands as a single habitat type (but see Riffell et al. 2008) . However, different CRP practices may vary greatly in habitat quality for grassland birds. In the southeastern U.S., tree plantings (CP3, CP11, etc.) comprise over 60% of CRP-enrolled acres (Burger 2000) . Even within various grass cover practices, there are important differences (Johnson & Schwartz 1993) . For example, native warm-season grasses (CP2) may provide better habitat value than cool-season grasses (CP1) for some species (Delisle & Savidge 1997 , McCoy et al. 2001a . Similarly, birds do not equally use all types of practices used in European agri-environment schemes (Henderson et al., 2000; Bracken & Bolger, 2006) which vary from country to country (Kleijn & Sutherland, 2003; Kleijn et al. 2006) . Third, the shape of the grassland patches may influence habitat quality. Nests in linear strips (e.g., grass waterways, field borders) may experience greater predation rates than larger patches created by enrolling whole fields (Best 2000 and references therein) and thus may be of lower quality.\nOur overall hypothesis was that if CRP has been effective at improving landscape conditions for grassland songbirds, then this effect should leave a signal in population trends of grassland birds at broad scales. We conducted two analyses of CRP effects on grassland bird population trends, testing two specific hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that national population trends after the initiation of the CRP should be more positive (or less negative) than national population trends prior to the CRP. To test this, we tabulated the number of grassland bird species that exhibited changes in overall national population trends after the initiation of the CRP. \nStrips was the % of each state's land area enrolled in grassy strip practices: CP8 (Grass waterways) + CP13A, C (Filter strips -grass) + CP15 (Contour grass strips) + CP21 (Filter strips). Woody Strips was the % of each state's land area enrolled in woody strip practices: CP4A, B (Wildlife habitat corridor) + CP5 (Field windbreaks) + CP13B, D (Filter strips -trees) + CP16 (Shelterbelts) + CP22 (Riparian buffers). Grass and woody strip practices are often established adjacent to each other (e.g., CP21 filter strips are often placed adjacent to CP22 riparian forest buffers). Because CRP data with this level of detail is not available, this could have confounded constrasts between grass strips and woody strips in unknown ways. However, our main objective is to contrast linear strip practices with other practices that are often established in large blocks (e.g., CP1 and CP2).\nlands or other open habitats. Other studies corroborate benefit of CRP for Mourning Dove, Eastern/Western Meadowlark, and Bobolink (Reynolds et al. 1994 , Johnson & Igl 1995 , Patterson & Best 1996 , Best et al. 1997 , Herkert 1997 , Ryan et al. 1998 Best et al. 1997 , Ryan et al. 1998 , Hohman & Halloum 2000 for reviews) and heavily grazed habitats (Saab et al. 1995 , Ryan et al. 1998 . Thus, as CRP takes fields out of production, these species may lose habitat. Say's Phoebe may also prefer grazed habitats (Saab 1995) over CRP habitat. This is not a serious conservation concern in North America because these species expanded their ranges during the agricultural intensification of the last century, which occurred at the expense of other grassland birds. Other species were negatively related to configuration variables (e.g., Savannah Sparrow and Lark Sparrow), which we discuss below.\nTwo species were both positively and negatively related to CRP variables. Swainson's Hawks were positively re- lated to native grasses but negatively related to exotic grasses (Tab. 3, Suppl. C). In contrast, Mallard was negatively related to native grasses but positively related to exotic grasses. These species especially illustrate the importance of not lumping all CRP habitat into one cover type.\nIII. Importance of CRP cover type. Generally, native grass practices were more likely to be associated with more positive (or less negative) trends of grassland birds than were exotic grass practices (Suppl. C). Northern Harrier, Swainson's Hawk, Bobolink, and Mourning Dove were related to the ratio of native to exotic grass, indicating that they benefited from an emphasis on native grass practices in a given state. A potential explanation for the two raptors is that native grass plantings typically provide a variable canopy and vegetative structure that supports more abundant small prey compared to exotic grass (CP1) fields (Burger et al. 1990 ). This canopy structure may also facilitate foraging by Bobolink and Mourning Dove. In contrast, Mallard and Loggerhead Shrike were negatively related to native grasses. High breeding success in exotic grass plantings has been documented for Mallard (Kantrud 1993) , but the relation with Loggerhead Shrike is more difficult to explain. Potentially, native grass practices are correlated with less woody cover, which the shrikes use for perching and nesting.\nClearly, treating all CRP-enrolled land as a single, distinct habitat type may be inappropriate. Not all practices create equivalent (or even appropriate) habitat for all species. If all CRP practices are grouped into one variable, many cover-or practice-specific effects of CRP may go undetected. For example, Swainson's Hawks were positively related to the amount of native grass (CP2) but negatively related to the amount of exotic grass (CP1) in a state. Had we lumped these two types of CRP habitat, we may not have detected these relations. Understanding and evaluating the effects of CRP on grassland birds requires considering the effects of specific practices in the context of speciesspecific habitat requirements of grassland birds. However, combining all CRP practices may be appropriate for species that respond negatively (e.g., Horned Lark) because they respond to the loss of preferred cultivated and/or grazed habitats caused by participation in the CRP, rather than to the CRP cover type per se. Regardless of the CRP practice implemented, it is still lost habitat for this group of birds.\nIV. Importance of configuration. Our results suggest that ignoring configuration of habitats can also obscure bird-CRP relations. Although we were not able to describe fine detail about the configuration of CRP habitat (i.e., mean patch size, distance to nearest neighbor, etc.), we were able to construct two variables that represented linear habitat -grass strips and woody strips. Consistent with our expectations, two area-sensitive species -Savannah Sparrow (Herkert 1994) and Lark Sparrow (Coppedge et al. 2001 ) -were negatively related to both grass and woody strips (Tab. 3, Suppl. C). Presumably, these species were responding to the increased edge and fragmenation that these types of practices (shelterbreaks, grassed waterways, riparian buffers, etc.) create. Conversely, species that use use woody vegetation for singing perches, nesting substrate. or foraging (e.g., Eastern Kingbird, American Kestrel, Mourning Dove; see Suppl. C) were positively associated with strip practices. Thus, CRP practices that involve linear habitats (i.e., shelterbelts) may improve habitat for these species, but habitat quality for these species may be reduced in areas where CRP is mostly comprised of blocks of grass.\nV. Conservation Implications. Lumping all CRP habitat into one habitat has likely limited our understanding of how CRP influences grassland species. We observed many more relations with practice-and configuration-specific measures of CRP habitat than with a generic metric of CRP. Although our analysis was correlative (and involved small sample sizes for some species), our results suggest several ideas that should be tested at a variety of spatial scales. First, native grass practices may be generally more positively related to grassland birds than are exotic grasses. Second, linear strips (vs. block habitats) may benefit some birds, but negatively impact others. Investigations into the effects of configuration should strive to further quantify the configuration of CRP habitat, including clumpiness, mean patch size, and other important landscape metrics. Finally, our results underscore that government-Agricultural Set-aside Programs and Grassland Birds ...\nsubsidized set-aside programs may not be a panacea for all grassland birds because this group of species includes a variety of life-histories and habitat requirements, and the set-aside programs themselves (e.g. CRP, agri-environment schemes) themselves often include a variety of land-cover types. Rather, set-aside programs should be used as part of a comprehensive, regional conservation strategy that strives to create a mosaic of different habitat types and configurations (i.e., a mosaic of large and small patches) in agricultural landscapes.\ncused studies until detailed, spatially explicit data are available for large-scale analyses (Manel et al. 2000) . We encourage scientists conducting research on grassland birds in set-aside to use standard techniques and methodology to facilitate the future use of meta-analysis (e.g., Arnqvist & Wooster 1995) to further explore and understand large-scale effects of CRP on grassland birds."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trends of Grassland Breeding Birds", "text": "W e used the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to calculate population trends for obligate and facultative grassland breeding birds in the continental US (breeding designations according to Vickery et al. 1999 ). The BBS is a long-term monitoring program initiated in 1966 (Robbins et al. 1986 , Sauer et al. 2004 . Currently, over 4,000 routes in North America are surveyed annually during the breeding season (summer). Each 39.4-km route follows secondary roads and consists of 50 stops at 0.8-km intervals. At each stop, trained observer(s) record all birds detected by sight or sound during a 3-minute period (Robbins et al. 1986 , Sauer et al. 2004 . The wide distribution of these routes across the continental U.S. and the temporal frame (1966 -present) make the Survey appropriate for assessing broad-scale effects of CRP on grassland bird populations.\nWe calculated national and state population trends via estimating equations (Link & Sauer 1994 ) using the web-based analytical tools provided by the Breeding Bird Survey (Sauer et al. 2004 ). This approach adjusts trend estimates for potential sources of variation by weighting individual routes based on variability of counts along that route, missing counts (years), and observer effects (Sauer et al. 2004) . We calculated both national trends (continental US) and state-specific trends for each grassland bird species for two time periods: (a) 1966 -1986, the time period from the beginning of the BBS to the inception of the Conservation Reserve Program (hereafter referred to as pre-CRP); and (b) 1987 -2003, the time period from the beginning of the CRP to the most recent available data (post-CRP). Although the CRP was officially initiated in 1985 through legislation, we used 1987 as the starting date because that is when the first CRP contracts (and hence the first land cover conversions) were planted. One potential problem is that BBS routes may have underrepresented some land cover types. While this may be true for some land cover types, BBS routes generally provide adequate representation across most environmental variables within states (Lawler & O'Conner 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Landscape Change Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B", "text": "ecause CRP variables could have been confounded with other landscape changes over the time period of the CRP, we calculated the rate of change from 1987 -2002 for pasture (pastureland and rangeland), crops, forest, and housing density (Tab. 1) for each state using Census of Agriculture data (http:// www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/index.asp).\nOur assumption is that these four variables would capture major landscape changes occurring in each state over that time period. We calculated several variables potentially relevant to the ecology and management of grassland songbirds in North America (Tab. 1). Total CRP was the % of total state land area enrolled in CRP (all practices) in 2004. Exotic Grass, Native Grass, and Total Grass were the % of each state's land area enrolled in CP1 (Introduced grasses and legumes -new plantings), CP2 (Native grasses and legumes -new plantings), and CP1 + CP2 + CP10 (Existing grasses and legumes), respectively. To represent the relative importance of native practices to state agencies (which actually administer the conservation practices), we also calculated Native Ratio, which was the % of all new grass plantings that were native (CP2 / [CP1 + CP2]).

We retained only those species with data available from at least 10 BBS routes in both time periods (Sauer et al. 2004) . To test for possible effects of CRP on bird trends, we calculated the difference in national trends before (1966 -1986 ) and after (1987 -2003 ) the initiation of the CRP such that:\n\u0394 trend = trend post-CRP -trend pre-CRP .\nWe standardized \u0394 trends by dividing the difference by the square root of the sum of the variances of the individual trends (Link & Sauer 1994) . We considered any \u0394 trend with | z | > 1.654 (\u03b1 < 0.10) as significantly improved or worsened. We used a \u03c7 2 -square test of independence to determine if the distribution of trend changes was predominantly positive. To guard against high levels of Type II errors (not detecting real effects) that can occur with avian count data (Thompson & Schwalbach 1995) , we used \u03b1 < 0.10 (rather than \u03b1 < 0.05) for these and all other analyses we conducted (see Westmoreland & Best 1985) .\nII. State trends. Our motivation for conducting statelevel analysis was to circumvent some inherent problems of relying solely on national trend changes (see above). First, even if other factors had caused significant negative changes in a national population trend, the magnitude of this change should be smaller in states with greater participation in CRP. Second, by using states as our sampling unit, we were able to partition CRP land cover into different cover types. Finally, although CRP only comprises approximately 2 -3% of the United States' land area, 5 -7% of many states are enrolled in the CRP (Fig. 2) , which increases the potential for the CRP to produce observable effects (Herkert 1998 ) and less likely that CRP effects would be swamped by other factors (Peterjohn 2003) .\nWe used individual states as the observational unit for these analyses. For each state, our dependent variable was the difference in population trend before and after the implementation of the CRP standardized to z-scores. We retained only those state-level species trends that were based on at least 10 routes (in a particular state) in both time periods and only those species for which we were able to calculate \u0394 trends in at least 10 states.\nUsing state \u0394 trends as a dependent variable, we first evaluated all models containing 1 -4 of the landscape change variables to account for broad landscape change. For each bird species, we retained the model that explained the most variation in our dependent variable, with the criteria that all landscape change variables had \u03b1 < 0.10. Then, we built a regression model for each grassland species where the state-level \u0394 trend (z-scores) for a particular species was regressed against each of our CRP variables separately (each model also contained the retained landscape change variables). Because of limited sample size, we were not able to examine models that contained multiple CRP variables (Morrison et al. 1998) . CRP variables were retained in the model if \u03b1 < 0.10. We inspected bivariate plots to insure that statistical significance was not due to single data points. When multiple CRP variables were significant for an individual species, we present them as competing models and ranked them according to model R "}, {"section_title": "National Trends", "text": "W e estimated national population trends for 28 obligate and 46 facultative grassland breeding birds (Fig. 2, Suppl. B) . Twenty-eight percent of the obligate species improved (z > 1.645, P < 0.10) after the initiation of the CRP, and 18% worsened (z < -1.645, P < 0.10). Of the facultative species, 19% improved and 25% worsened. Proportions of improving species did not differ from the proportion of worsening species, nor did the proportion of improving species differ between obligate and facultative species (P = 0.372 -0.572).\nA pproximately the same number of grassland birds had national trends that worsened post-CRP (25%) as had improving trends (25%). This suggests that at the national scale, habitat created by CRP may benefit some species whereas other species may suffer as agricultural lands are taken out of production. We caution, however, that negative changes in the national trends after initiation of the CRP do not necessarily indicate a lack of CRP benefits, nor do positive changes necessarily indicate widespread benefits. Changes in national trends (which lack controls) may be confounded with other factors. For example, processes on a migratory species' wintering ground or changes in climate (Sauer & Droege 1990 , Igl & Johnson 1999 ) may cause changes in the national population trend that override, mask, or confound effects of CRP. Thus, factors other than CRP and agricultural land-use changes may be responsible for some national trends despite demonstrable benefits of CRP at smaller scales.\nInterpretation of national trend changes is further complicated because offsetting effects in state-to-state differences in the primary CRP practices may \"cancel out\" locally positive and negative effects. In our results, Eastern Meadowlark and Eastern Kingbird suggest this very phenomenon (Suppl. C). Both species exhibited worsening national trends but were positively related to one or more CRP variables in our state-level analyses. These species exhibited worsening national trends (accelerated declines) after initiation of the CRP. However, this was likely caused by unmeasured factor(s) because the change in trend was most negative in states with little land in the CRP. So, these worsening national declines might be mitigated in states with greater participation in CRP."}, {"section_title": "State-level Trends", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "I.", "text": "Landscape change variables.

Eight species were positively related to CRP variables, whereas 6 species were negatively related to CRP variables. Two species were positively related to some CRP variables but negatively related to other CRP variables. Only Horned Lark was related to Total CRP. All others were related to more specific descriptions of practice (habitat) type and/or configuration. \nLandscape change variables. We included landscape change variables primarily to account for variation due to landscape change to improve our ability to detect bird-CRP relations, and an indepth discussion of these relations is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the relations we observed with landscape change variables were generally consistent with what is know about the species' ecology. Relations with changes in cropland, pasture, and forest were primarily positive, reflecting species responding favorably to an increase in habitat. For example, species with an affinity for pasture like Upland Sandpiper (Houston & Bowen 2001) were positively related to pasture, and species with an affinity for croplands like Mourning Dove (Ryan et al. 1998) were positively related to cropland (presumably because of food resources). Relations with change in housing density were primarily negative, further underscoring the negative impacts of urban development on birds in agricultural landscapes (e.g., Bock et al. 1999 ). The only exception was Common Nighthawk, which has a known affinity for urban habitats (Poulin et al. 1996) .\nII. General CRP relations.

When these national trends are consistent with our analyses at the state level and with a body of research at landscape-, farm-, and field-scales (e.g., Best et al. 1995 , Patterson & Best 1996 , Ryan et al. 1998 , Hohman & Halloum 2000 , we gain confidence in the conclusions about how CRP set-aside habitat affects these species. However, without corroborating evidence at other scales, changes in broad-scale trends are not reliable evidence for effects of CRP (or lack thereof) on grassland birds because of variation in responses at local scales and confounding with other aspects of environmental change. Although we accounted for some variation due to other changes in the landscape, CRP participation could still be correlated (and hence confounded with) other changes in the landscape that we did not measure. Cause and effect relationships can only be deduced through replicated experiments using data about abundance, breeding success, and population responses at a variety of scales (field, farm, landscape, regional, and national). Thus, large-scale analyses are insufficient by themselves to accurately evaluate the mechanistic effects of CRP on grassland birds (Manel et al. 2000) .\nA serious limitation to relating broad-scale trends to landscape changes caused by government set-aside programs is that available datasets are not sufficient to model more complex relationships among grassland birds, CRP characteristics and distribution, and other environmental factors. We incorporated more complexity in our analyses than other studies by looking at cover-specific variables, but there are many other factors which could possibly influence grassland birds:\nOver the duration of a CRP contract, ecological succession can affect the suitability of a particular CRP tract for grassland bird species (Millenbah et al. 1996 , Coppedge et al. 2001 , McCoy et al. 2001b ). Thus, management of set-aside lands over the course of a 10-or 15-yr contract can affect the quality of a particular tract for grassland birds (e.g., stripdisking for Northern Bobwhite [Greenfi eld et al. 2003] ). Field size is variable, and grassland birds will likely have higher breeding success in large set-aside fi elds compared to smaller fi elds (Herkert et al. 2003) . Landscape context may infl uence the ability of a particular set-aside tract to provide population benefi ts. Isolated tracts may have lower nesting density (e.g., Herkert et al. 2003) or nesting success, while clustering tracts together may increase their benefi ts (e.g., Parkhurst et al. 2002) . Thresholds may exist. For example, Riley (1995) found that CRP benefi ted Ring-necked Pheasant only when the amount of cropland in the surrounding landscape was > 50%. Similarly, Herkert (1998) found that Grasshopper Sparrow population trends increased in landscapes with > 3.8 % CRP. In a given landscape or region, a suite of these factors may infl uence how set-aside does (or does not) benefi t grassland birds, and fully understanding the effects of set-aside requires that they all be investigated.\nDespite these substantial drawbacks, broad-scale evaluations of set-aside programs should continue because broad-scale questions are often politically and socially important to answer and because broad-scale effects can further support conclusions from manipulative experiments conducted at smaller scales. A major hurdle is that the practice-specific, spatially explicit data these analyses would require are not readily available for large regions.
