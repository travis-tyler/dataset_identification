[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and a leading cause of cancer death in the USA and Europe [1,2]. The widespread use of PSA testing has led to the diagnosis of earlier stage and grade disease [3], but this might come at significant cost, both in terms of men who undergo unnecessary invasive investigation and those who might be over-diagnosed with prostate cancer [4,5]. This might be compounded by recent findings of a high prevalence of prostate cancer in men with low PSA levels [6]. PSA velocity (PSAV) might have advantages over a single PSA value in differentiating prostate cancer from benign disease [7][8][9][10] and in identifying more highgrade cancers [11,12], but the precise role of PSAV in clinical practice remains to be defined [13]. Studies agree that the PSAV is higher in men with prostate cancer than in those with benign disease [7][8][9][10], although the optimum PSAV threshold remains controversial, particularly at low PSA levels and in younger men [8,[14][15][16]. Others have reported little benefit of PSAV over a single PSA value in prescreened populations [17][18][19]. Many studies have included only men who proceeded to prostate biopsy or had prostate cancer [8,11,12], or who had specific PSA changes [18,19]. An analysis of a well-defined population, irrespective of PSA change or diagnosis, might give additional information on the role of PSAV in clinical practice. We investigated the ability of PSAV to predict prostate cancer and high-grade cancer, and assessed different PSAV thresholds for identifying prostate cancer, in a populationbased study in a region where PSA screening is not recommended."}, {"section_title": "PATIENTS AND METHODS", "text": "The Northern Ireland Cancer Registry PSA database was described previously [20,21]; briefly, PSA results from all men in Northern Ireland are maintained on a central electronic database. Using unique identifiers (name, date of birth, address), PSA results are matched to identify repeat tests for each man. These data are linked to hospital discharge and histopathology data to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer or histologically confirmed benign disease. Although PSA screening is not recommended in Northern Ireland, PSA testing has been widespread since 1994, with \u2248 15 000 men having their first PSA test annually (6% of all men aged \u2265 50 years) [20]. However, general practice was not to proceed to prostate biopsy until the PSA level was \u2265 10.0 ng/mL, and therefore many men had a period of PSA monitoring before proceeding with prostate biopsy [22]. All men with an initial PSA level of < 10.0 ng/ mL, taken between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2003, were identified. Those with at least three PSA tests before diagnosis, carried out over \u2265 18 months, were included in this analysis [23]. All men were followed for a diagnosis of prostate cancer or histologically confirmed benign disease until 31 December 2003. A tumour was considered high grade if, from the full-text histopathology report, the Gleason score was \u2265 7 or, when Gleason scoring was not available, the tumour had any poorly differentiated component. Those without a diagnosis of prostate cancer or benign disease were considered to have no prostate-related diagnosis. The PSAV was calculated from all PSA values before diagnosis or before 31 December 2003 in men with no prostate-related diagnosis, using linear regression analysis [21]. The age was taken as that at the initial PSA test. Student's t -test, the Mann-Whitney U -test and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the respective means and medians of the group characteristics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine, and compare, the test characteristics of various PSAV thresholds with an initial PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs). All patient identifiable information was removed before the research team accessed the data used in the study, and no patient was contacted during the study; therefore, ethical approval was not sought."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "In all, 24 709 men were included, with 716 (2.9%) having prostate cancer, 1488 (6.0%) benign histology and 22 505 (91.1%) no prostate-related diagnosis. The mean age was 64.9 years, with 67.8% of men aged > 60 years. The mean ( SD ) follow-up was 6.1 (1.2) years; the group characteristics are shown in Table 1. On average, men with cancer were older than those with benign disease and those with no diagnosis ( P < 0.001). The initial PSA level was higher in men with cancer than in the other groups ( P < 0.05), with the last PSA level before diagnosis being markedly higher in men with cancer ( P < 0.001). The mean and median PSAV were substantially higher in men with cancer than in the other groups (Table 1, P < 0.001). The mean PSAV was similar in men with benign disease and no prostate-related diagnosis ( P = 0.47, Mann-Whitney U -test); these were subsequently considered together (no-cancer group). The test characteristics of the initial PSA level (4.0 ng/mL threshold) and various PSAV thresholds for cancer diagnosis are presented in Table 2; 8.4% of men with an initial PSA level of \u2265 4.0 ng/mL were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 1.3% with PSA level of < 4.0 ng/mL (OR 6.7, 95% CI 5.8-7.9, P < 0.001); 36.3% of men with prostate cancer had an initial PSA level of < 4.0 ng/mL, with 36.5% of these having high-grade histology. Of men with a PSAV of \u2265 0.75 ng/ mL/year, 18.4% were diagnosed with prostate cancer, vs 1.0% when the PSAV was < 0.75 ng/ mL/year (OR 21.9, 95% CI, 18.6-25.8). In all, 224 (31.2%) men diagnosed with prostate cancer had a PSAV of < 0.75 ng/mL/year, with 20.1% of these having high-grade disease. The positive predictive value (PPV) slowly increased with increasing PSAV threshold, although the ORs remained relatively stable for each PSAV thrreshold \u2265 0.5 ng/mL/ year. The tumour grade was available in 568 (79.3%) men. Although the proportion with high-grade cancer increased with PSAV category (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.001), this increase was small. The OR for high-grade cancer when the PSAV was \u2265 2.0 ng/mL/year was 5.0 (95% CI, 3.5-7.2). The proportion of men in each diagnostic group by PSAV category is shown in Fig. 1a,b. The distribution of men with cancer was markedly different from the no-cancer group, with only 9.1% of the latter having a PSAV of \u2265 0.75 ng/mL/year. The men with cancer were more evenly distributed; each PSAV category of < 1.0 ng/mL/year contained 1.0-7.0% of cancer cases, with 10.8% of men in the cancer group having a negative PSAV. Of those with cancer, 30% had a high PSAV ( \u2265 3.0 ng/mL/ year), vs 1.7% of those with no cancer. The proportion of cancers in individual PSAV categories is shown in Fig. 2a,b. Cancer was present in < 3.0% of men in all PSAV categories < 0.5 ng/mL/year. The proportion of men with cancer steadily increased with increasing PSAV category (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.001), although it remained at < 20.0% until the PSAV was \u2265 2.25 ng/mL/year (Table 2). When only men with an initially 'normal' PSA level ( < 4.0 ng/mL) were considered, although the cancer diagnosis rate was lower (1.3% vs 8.4%, P < 0.001), the pattern of cancer cases by PSAV category was similar ( Fig. 2a). ROC analyses were used to assess the most appropriate PSAV threshold to identify prostate cancer and high-grade cancer in this population (Fig. 3a,b). There was no definitive threshold that could be chosen to reliably predict cancer or high-grade cancer."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This is the largest study to date to assess the value of PSAV in diagnosing prostate cancer; our results confirm that PSAV is higher in men subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer than in those who do not have this diagnosis, and that in the present men, PSAV provided additional value in risk assessment over one PSA level in detecting prostate cancer [7][8][9][10]. However, given that > 10% of men with prostate cancer had a negative PSAV, and the relatively even distribution of cancer cases across PSAV categories (Fig. 1a,b), there are difficulties in choosing a PSAV threshold that would identify most cancers whilst not subjecting many men without cancer to invasive investigations (Table 2 and Fig. 3a).    The strengths of this study are that it included many participants in a well-defined population. All men in the population with an initial PSA level of < 10.0 ng/mL and sufficient data to calculate PSAV reliably (three or more tests taken over \u2265 18 months) were included [23]. Many men had numerous PSA tests (mean 4.5) taken over a relatively long period (mean 6.1 years), and therefore the PSA changes investigated will be applicable to most men undergoing PSA testing and monitoring. However, as the study was retrospective, there were no pre-defined biopsy criteria (using total PSA level or PSAV values) and the results cannot be considered as a direct 'head-to-head' comparison of total PSA and PSAV. Indeed, as total PSA is an integral component in the calculation of PSAV, total PSA and PSAV are not independent, which is a limitation of any study attempting to compare the two [10,[14][15][16][17][18][19]. Other limitations of the dataset relating to the variation in PSA assays used in individuals over time and lack of clinical information, e.g. the reason for PSA testing, DRE findings, prostate volume or use of 5 \u03b1 -reductase inhibitors, were discussed previously [21]. Furthermore, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy, and the biopsy technique, might have varied among clinicians, and might have been affected by the above clinical factors. Indeed, only a small proportion of men in the population (8.9%) proceeded to invasive investigation, with an overall rate of prostate cancer diagnosis of 2.9%. In a similar study from a pure screening population [16], the rate of investigation was 17.6% with a cancer diagnosis rate of 3.5%. Many of the men who did not proceed to prostate biopsy might have histological prostate cancer which has not yet been diagnosed; the present results are therefore subject to verification bias and likely to have differed if all men had had a prostate biopsy. A sensitivity analysis was done whereby all men with no prostate-related diagnosis were considered to have prostate cancer (Table 3). Although the test characteristics were very different in this setting, the pattern of results was similar, i.e. there was no definitive PSAV threshold identified. Whilst the present analysis could have been limited to only those men who were investigated, when deciding upon an appropriate PSAV threshold to use in clinical practice, the true distribution of PSAV in the population must be known, irrespective of PSA change or threshold for prostate biopsy. The distribution of PSAV values if men with no diagnosis were not included can be estimated from Figs 1 and 2. The lower rate of investigation in the present study is in keeping with practice relating to PSA testing in Northern Ireland in the 1990s, where men tended to be investigated only if their PSA level increased to \u2265 10.0 ng/mL [22]. Also, the men included in the present analysis represented only those with three or more PSA tests over \u2265 18 months. In all, 107 111 (81.3%) men in the population were excluded as they had insufficient data to calculate PSAV, with the vast majority having only one PSA value (75.7% of excluded men). Men not included were younger (mean 60.7 years, P < 0.001), with fewer PSA tests (mean 1.3, P < 0.001) and a lower initial PSA level (1.9 ng/mL, P < 0.001) than those who were included. The cancer diagnosis rate was also much lower in excluded men (0.6%, P < 0.001). Overall, 51.0% (716/1403) of men with prostate cancer in the population had data to calculate PSAV and were included in the present study. The rationale for using PSAV as opposed to one PSA level to predict prostate cancer appears to be logical. Malignant prostate tissue contributes 10 times more to PSA levels  than an equivalent volume of benign tissue [24]. As a prostate cancer enlarges, it will cause a greater increase in PSA level over time than will benign disease. This was confirmed by Carter et al. [7], who found exponentially rising PSA levels in men with prostate cancer at least 5 years before diagnosis. In that relatively small study, a PSAV threshold of 0.75 ng/mL/year had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 95% for detecting prostate cancer [7]. The main disadvantage of using PSAV is the variability associated with repeated PSA values. A recent systematic review of 12 studies assessing PSA variability found a mean variation of \u224820% [25], with a 95% CI of 33%. Therefore, to obtain an accurate estimate of true PSA change, the PSAV needs to be assessed using at least three PSA values taken over \u226518 months [23]. This delay and the need for multiple tests means that even though the PSAV might more accurately predict prostate cancer, it might be less useful than one PSA value in clinical practice, and in population screening. In the present population-based study, a PSAV threshold of 0.75 ng/mL/year had a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 91% for cancer diagnosis, which is similar to the data from Carter et al. [7]. On ROC analysis, the PSAV threshold that gave the optimum balance between sensitivity and specificity was 0.3 ng/ mL/year ( Table 2, sensitivity 80.3%, specificity 80.2%). Other studies suggested using lower PSAV thresholds; Smith and Catalona [8], although confirming the data from Carter et al. [7], recommended a lower threshold of 0.4 ng/mL/year. Studies assessing PSAV at low PSA values [14] or in younger men [15,16] also suggested lower PSAV thresholds, of 0.1-0.5 ng/mL/year. In the present study, several potential PSAV thresholds were assessed (Table 2); as the threshold increased the number of men potentially recommended for biopsy decreased, as did the number of prostate cancers diagnosed. There was a slow increase in PPV with increasing PSAV threshold, although the ORs remained comparatively stable across all PSAV thresholds. As many men (10.8%) with prostate cancer had a negative PSAV, and as the distribution of cancer cases in each PSAV category were relatively evenly spread, with a third having a 'normal' (<0.75 ng/mL/year) PSAV and a third having very high levels (\u22653.0 ng/mL/year), there was no PSAV threshold that identified men with prostate cancer reliably without also implying that many men without cancer required investigation. As previously shown with total PSA level [26], it is likely that there is no 'normal' PSAV but rather a continuum of prostate cancer risk based on PSAV level (as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3a). Lowering the PSAV threshold for recommending a biopsy will diagnose more prostate cancers but will greatly increase the number of men for whom biopsy is indicated. Therefore, age and comorbidity, and primarily patient choice after informed decision-making, will determine the relevant total PSA level and PSAV values to prompt a prostate biopsy in each man. Recently, Carter et al. [27] assessed the ability of PSAV to predict prostate-specific mortality. Using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a PSAV measured 10-15 years before diagnosis and 20-25 years before death was predictive of prostate-specific mortality. In 124 men with prostate cancer, a PSAV of \u22650.35 ng/mL/year was predictive of cancer-specific mortality, with a relative risk of 4.7 (95% CI, 1.3-16.5; P = 0.02). In men with a PSAV of <0.35 ng/mL/year, the 25-year prostate cancer-specific survival was 92%, vs 54% in those with a PSAV of \u22650.35 ng/mL/ year [27]. Interestingly, Carter et al. stated that the value of 0.35 ng/mL/year was one of many potential thresholds that could have been used, which supports the idea of a continuum of risk as opposed to a single threshold, even at this early stage. The present study showed that PSAV was associated with tumour grade ( Table 2, P < 0.001), with an OR of 5.0 (95% CI, 3.5-7.2) when the PSAV was >2.0 ng/mL/year rather then below that. However, even at a low PSAV, \u224840% of tumours had high-grade histology. Earlier studies assessing this association found that PSAV was not predictive of highgrade disease [28,29], although these studies were limited by having few participants. A more recent study including 1441 men with prostate cancer showed an association between PSAV and biopsy Gleason score [30]. When using PSA values restricted to the year before diagnosis, PSAV was associated with high-grade disease, and prostate cancerspecific and all-cause mortality after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy [11,12]. However, as the interval from the first to last PSA test was short and many men had only two PSA values from which the PSAV was calculated, there is potential for these PSA changes to be due to PSA variability as opposed to a true increase in PSA [23,25]. In the present study, only 285 of 1007 (28.3%) men with a PSAV of \u22652.0 ng/mL/year were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer, with a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, and therefore rapid increases in PSA level might also occur in men with benign disease; short-term changes in PSA level should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, in the present population, PSAV had a higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing prostate cancer than a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL. However, there was no PSAV threshold that accurately identified most prostate cancers whilst not potentially subjecting many men without cancer to invasive investigations. Many men with prostate cancer might have a low PSAV; there is no 'normal' PSAV but rather a continuum of risk associated with the PSAV value."}]
