[{"section_title": "Research", "text": "and Development in Industry 1969 FOREWORD I N RECENT YEARS, the national investment in research and development has been growing, but at a slower rate than in the fifties and early sixties. Despite this R&D slowdown, industrial R&D support has been the major influence behind the growth of research and development. It is uncertain, particularly in view of the recent economic slowdown, whether industrial R&D spending will continue to post significant gains. Yet, indr.c4rial research and development seems more important than ever for the Nation's economic vo elfare. At prese.lt, industrial research and development is undergoing a noticeable change. Although primary emphasis still focuses on the traditional objectives of achieving customer satisfaction, improving profitability through new and improved products and processes, and servicing the Nation's defense and space programs, an additional element, though still relatively modest in size is becoming increasingly importantresearch and development in the area of the Nation's mounting social and environmental problems. This research and development is not only directed toward alleviating our current difficulties, but is also attempting tc identify and minimile adverse effects which may accompany future scientific and technological advances. The National Science Foundation both conducts and sponsors surveys in the various sectors of the economy to better understand changes in R&D emphasis, as well as to measure the growth, magnitude, and. other characteristics of research and development.(The data obtained from these surveys are published by the Foundation and are designed to provide information useful to Government offficals, legislators, and other individuals concerned with evaluating the role of research and development in furthering the national welfare and ia the allocation of scientific resources.)

Estimates of total R&D spending for 1970 foresee growth over 1969 at a somewhat slower rate than that of the GNP. Although the growth rate of total industrial R&D expenditures is expected to be lower than that of the GNP between 1969 and 1970, the growth in company's own funds is expected to be higher. Industrial firms undertake about 70 percent of the national R&D effort, in dollar terms. This share has remained about the same over the period 1964-69, but is down from the 1960 level of 77 percent. In 1969 industry spent 86 percent of all development funds, about the same as the 1960 ratio.

In 1960 industry performed 28 percent of the country's basic research effort; by 1969 this had fallen to 17 percent. Over the same period industry's applied research share slipped from 66 percent to 59 percent. Although industrial research spending has increased at a slower rate than the overall national gain, there has been a substantial rise in absolute terms. Between 1960 and 1969 industrial basic research expenditures increased from $376 million to $646 million. A number of companies have established extensive research facilities designed to keep industry in the forefront of scientific advancement. The vast majority of this research, however, is directed toward areas related to current or potential product lines. This report covers R&D expenditures for 1969 and professional manpower in January 1970. The 1969 survey covered substantielly fewer companies than in previous years. The sample was restricted to the approximately 1,200 companies with R&D programs of $200,000 or more. These firms account for about 98 percent of all industrial R&D performance. The 1968 survey obtained data from approximately 2,400 companies. In the statistical tables, the companies xii ii previously included in the sample, but excluded for 1969, were carried forward at their 1968 R&D performance levels. If these companies were moved forward into 1969 based on their average change over the preceding 5 years, the R&D totals would be increased by less than 0.05 percent. See the technical notes for additional detail. This survey does not cover a few organizations, such as trade associations, which are estimated to account for less than 1 percent of the Nation's annual volume of industrial R&D performance funds. Although trade associations are nonprofit organizations, their primary mission is to serve industry."}, {"section_title": "R&D: Industrial vs. Product Classification", "text": "This report presents industrial R&D data on two different bases. First, appendix tables B-1 through B-35 and B-43 through B-56 furnish total R&D data on the traditional iadustry basis for the years 1953 to 1969. The second approach, in appendix tables B-36 through B-42, presents the applied research and development data on a pzoduct basis for 1959 to 1969. Because of its generalized nature, basic research cannot readily be classified by product field; instead, these data are classified by field of science."}, {"section_title": "R&D Funds", "text": "Industrial spending for research and development reached a level of $18.5 billion daring 1969, $1 billion more than in 1968. Over the past decade, industrial R&D funds have increased at the rate of In 1969 companies invested $9.9 billion of their owi. funds in R&D activities. This was 11 percent more than was spent on these activities in 1968 and compares with no increase in Federal R&D support between 1968 and1969. In addition to the $9.9 billion of companysponsored R&D effort conducted within the companies' own laboratorics in 1969, industrial firms provided $279 million to outside orgmizations. Onehalf of this money was contracted to other companies, while universities and colleges and other nonprofit institutions were the recipients of the remaining one-half. Company investment in research and development is one way for industry to improve its profit potential; for many firms, another way is investing in new plant and equipment. The following table shows that since 1960 industry has spent between one-third and one-fourth as much on R&D activities as on new plant and equipment. In recent years, however, this ratio has been increasing. (For detailed data on this section see appendix tables B-1 through B-11, and B-17.) "}, {"section_title": "Employment of R&D Scientists and Engineers", "text": "In January 1970, industrial firms employed the full-time-equivalent (FTE) of 380,600 R&D scientists and engineers, a decline of 6,500 from the January 1969 level. This decrease of nearly 2 percent over the year was primarily attributable to manpower cutbacks in the aircraft and missiles industry. Over the year, employment of scientists and engineers in this industry dropped from 97,600 to 90,000, with slightly more than one-half of the decline affecting professionals engaged in Federal contract work, primarily for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. There are indications that this decline is continuing. In addition, between January 1969 and January 1970, scientist and engineer employment on company-funded R&D activities in the aircraft and missiles industry fell by 3,500 persons, a decline of 13 percent. Despite this decline in personnel, aircraft firms increased their company R&D spending by 11 percent between 1968 and 1969, all of it in development work. This largely reflected the completion of the research phase of some commercial R&D projects, and the shifting of emphasis into the more expensive developmental work of producing prototypes. The only other industries reporting significant decreases in scientist and engineer employment over the year were motor vehiclesdown 1,000 to 23,700, and fabricated metal productsoff 600 to 6,000 R&D professionals. Virtually all of the manpower decline was in companies employing 10,000 or more persons."}, {"section_title": "Industries showing important increases between", "text": "January 1969 and 1970 were machinery (up 1,300), drugs (up 700), and electrical equipment (up 700)."}, {"section_title": "Sources of support", "text": "Beginning in 1964, the number of scientists and engineers engaged in Federal Government R&D efforts undertaken by industrial firms dropped by 18,000, from nearly one-half of the all-industry total, to less than 40 percent by the beginning of 1970. In contrast, the count of R&D professionals engaged in company-funded activities continued to rise all through the sixties. The industry employing the largest number of R&D scientists and engineers working on company programs in January 1970 was electrical equipment and communication, followed by the chemicals industry. The primary employer of R&D professionals engaged in contract work for the Government was the aircraft and missiles industry."}, {"section_title": "Employment gains: scientific vs. other industrial", "text": "A measure of the relative emphasis placed on science and technology within industrial firms is the ratio of R&D scientists and engineers to total employment. In 1969 there were 26 of these scientific professionals for every 1,000 employees in R&Dperforming companies, down from 30 in 1964 and 1965. Placement of scientists and engineers into R&D activities has not kept pace with the overall employment growth of these firms. The ratio decline has been particularly steep in the aircraft industry, falling from 113 in 1965 to 78 in 1969. (For detailed data on this section see appendix tables B-12 through B-16, B-18, and B-19.) Distribution of R&D Funds, by Size of Company and R&D Program Industrial R&D performance is heavily concentrated in a relatively small number of large R&D-performing companies. Only 3 percent of the estimated 11,000 R&D-performing companies had 10,000 or more employees in 1969. Yet these companies accounted for 85 percent of the research and development conducted in industry. The 209 R&Dperforming companies (2 percent of total) with employment between 5,000 and 9,999 spent an additional 6 percent of the industrial R&D total. Fifty-six percent of the research and development in industry in 1969 was performed by twenty companies. Thirty companies had R&D programs of $100 million or more during 1969. The average size R&D program of these companies was nearly $400 million. Only 6 percent of the R&D-performing companies had R&D programs of $1 million or more in 1969. Forty-two percent of these companies had 10,000 or more employees and these firms conducted 85 percent of all industtial research and development during the year.

Materials and supplies costs per R&D scientist or engineer were highest in the aircraft and motor vehicles industries during 1969. These were the only industries where average materials costs per R&D professional exceeded the all-industry average. (For detailed data on this section see appendix tables B-26 and B-27.) Basic Research, Applied Research, and Development In 1969 industrial firms spent $646 million on basic research, $3.3 billion on applied research, pAid $14.5 billion on development.

About two-thirds of this amount was spent on chemistry research during the year. The chemicals industry was the major performer of basic research in chemistry, conducting an estimated one-half of all basic research in this field during 1969. The chemicals industry also spent $60 million on basic research in the life sciences. This was about threefourths of all the life sciences basic research performed by industry in that year. Basic research in engineering amounted to $176 million during 1969. Over two-thirds of this work was financed by companies in the electrical equipment, aircraft, and motor vehicles industries. Applied research and development, by industry Apr! d research and development accounted for the bulk of industrial research and development in 1969$17.8 billion. Nearly $10 billion of this amount was spent by firms in the aircraft and electrical equipment industries. These industries, with their heavy involvement in Federal R&D contract work, financed about two-thirds of their applied research and development with Federal monies in 1969. All other industries combined financed only one-third of this effort with Federal funds. The electrical equipment industry, in addition to being the second leading performer of Federal applied research and development work in 1969 was also the leading performer of company-sponsored applied research and development, spending $1.9 billion. Other industries to spend more than $1 billion of their own funds on applied research and development projects in 1969 were chemicals, $1.4 billion; machinery, $1.3 billion; motor vehicles, an estimated $1.2 billion; and aircraft and missiles, $1.2 billion. Together, these five industries accounted for about three-fourths of all company-sponsored applied research and development spending during the year. Applied research and development, by product field Applied research and development spending can also be looked at by the product areas being empha-i sized by industrial firms.

Massachusetts, the leading gainer, rose 92 percent during this period. Between 1968 and 1969, the only region of the country to show a reduction in R&D expenditures was the South, down 2 percent. This largely reflected cutbacks in the South Central States of Texas, Alabama, and Louisiana. For the latter two States these declines are part of a long-term trend. Industrial R&D funds in Louisiana fell from $282 million to $104 million between 1964 and1969. In Alabama, the drop over the 1966-69 period was from $238 million to $125 million. In addition to the two South Central divisions, only one other division had fewer industrial R&D dollars in 1969 compared to a year earherNew England.

During 1969, the Pacific division accounted for over two-fifths of all industry-performed Federal R&D contract work. Yet, firms in this division speat only 14 percent of total company R&D funds. Conversely, R&D-performing companies in the East North Central division spent 31 percent of all company funds during 1969, but only 6 percent of the Federal total. (For detailed data on this section see appendix tables B-43 and B-44.) R&D Funds Related to Employment and Net Sales R&D f unds, when related to employment and net sales data, show the relationship between R&D spending and these two measurements of size. In 1969 R&D expenditures per employee amounted to $1,250, an increase of 3 percent over the 1968 ratio of $1,210. Company financing of R&D performance per employee increased 10 percent between 1968 and 1969 to a level of $670. Federal R&D funds per employee dropped by 3 percent over the year to $580. Four industries in 1969 had above average ratios of R&D expenditures to total employment. These were aircraft, $4,800; electrical equipment, $1,890; instruments, $1,590; and chemicals, $1,490. Two additional industriesmotor vehicles and machinery had R&D costs per employee of over $1,000. The ratios in these industries were $1,240 and $1,110, respectively. 14 These same six industries were also the ones to lead in relationship of company R&D funds per employee during 1969. A company's R&D/sales ratio is a useful indicator of the allocation of receipts to research and development. It is, however, an after-the-fact measure and is seldom the sole determinant of a company's R&D budget. In 1969 R&D-performing manufacturing companies spent an averq,ge of 4.0 percent of their net sales on R&D activities. This wes the same ratio as in 1968 but. down from a high of 4.6 percent in 1964. These same firms allocated 2.2 percent of their net sales to company-sponsored R&D programs, up from 2.1 percent in 1968, The aircraft industry bad the highest R&D/ sales ratio in 1969-19.3 percent. This is up from 18.7 percent in 1968 but down from the 1964 high of 28.9 percent. All of this decrease is due to the leveling in Federal R&D funds to this industry. Only six industries registered gains in their company R&D funds/net sales ratios between 1964 and 1969. They were rubber, 1.0 percent to 1.7 percent; stone, clay, and glass, 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent; primary metals, 0.7 percent to 0.8 percent; machinery, 3.2 percent to 3.4 percent; electrical equipment, 3.6 percent to 3.7 percent ; and aircraft, 2.5 percent to 4.3 percent. The cost per R&D scientist or engineer amounted to $48,200 in 1969, an increase of 5 percent over the 1968 level. These costs vary widely by industry. The industries with the highest cost per scientist or engineer ratios in 1969 were motor vehicles, $68,900, and aircraft, $61,800. In 1969, the 300 largest R&D-performing manufacturing companies spent nearly 2.5 times as much per R&D professional than all other R&Dperforming manufacturing companies.

Since then, the scope of the survey has gradually been expanded and refined in response to an increasing need for more detailed information on the Nation's R&D effort. The 1969 industry survey is the 13th in the annual series sponsored by the Foundation and conducted by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce. The Foundation also sponsored two industry surveys covering the 1953-56 period, which were conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Department of Labor.' Data obtained in the BLS surveys are not directly comparable with the Census figures for 1957-69 because of methodological and other differences in the surveys conducted by the two agencies. In addition, the Census surveys, beginning in 1957, have collected data on the R&D activities of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC's) operated by business firms, whereas the earlier BLS surveys did not. To account for the R&D performance of these research centers in 1956, Census adjusted data for that year (collected in the 1957 survey) to provide comparable trend data for 1956 and earlier years.

Data for these companies were estimatee at their 1968 levels. These companies accounted foi less than 2 percent of total R&D expenditures. In manufacturing, the sampling unit was the company, defined as all establishments under common ownership or control.

Single-unit manufacturing companies were a This section was prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the collecting and compiling agent for the National Science Foundation in this survey. 7 This indicates that a sampling ratio of 1:1 (or 1.000) was employed in the selection of companies in this particular size class. sampled from the 1963 Census universe file. The nonmanufacturing sample was drawn from the 1966 records of the Social Security Administration. Approximately 8,000 manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies are included in the sample. More than 1,800 of these are certainty companies (those with greater than 1,000 employees and others in selected industry-size strata) and they accounted for almost 95 percent of the total R&D performance funds. Appendix tables A-1 and A-2 show the probabilities of selection applied for each industry-. size stratum. Each year the annual Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration lists of R&D contractors are reviewed to insure that the large contractors are included in the sample. For the 1969 survey, the 80 largest companies from the Department of Defense list and the 50 largest. National Aeronautics and Space Administration contractors were included in the sample with certainty regardless of their industry class and employment size. The 80 largest companies from the Department of Defense list accounted for 94 percent, of the total funds of all companies listed. The 50 largest companies from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration list accounted for 96 percent of the total funds of all companies listed. The particular sample selected is one of a large number of samples of the same type and size that, by chance, might have been selected. Estimates from each of the different samples would differ somewhat from each other, and from the results of a complete canvass conducted under essentially the same conditions as the survey. This variation among the possible estimates is defined by the sampling error, measured in standard error units. The complete canvass total would be included in the range (1) From one standard error below to one standard error above the derived estimate for about twothirds of all possible samples. (2) From two standard errors below to two stand-, ard errors above the derived estimate for about. 95 percent of all possible samples, (3) From three standard errors below to three standard errors above the derived estimate, almost always. These values may be interpreted as defining approximate probabilities that the estimate shown would differ from a complet e canvass total by as much as one, two, or three standard errors, respectively. For example, if an estimate is shown as 400, with an associated relative standard error of 2 percent, the chances are roughly two out of three that the complete canvass total would lie between 392 and 408; the chances are roughly 19 out of 20 that the complete canvass total would lie between 384 and 416; and it is almost certain that the complete canvass total would lie between 376 and 424. As stated, the standard error refers only to sampling variations. In addition to the sampling errors as measured by the standard error, the estimates are subject to errors in response, coding, processing, and imputation for nonresponse. These nonsampling errors would also occur if a complete canvass were to be conducted under the same conditions as the survey. The 1969 standard errors of estimates for each industry, for all companier and for those with less than 1,000 employees, are shown in appendix table A-3. The forms for the survey were mailed in April 1970, and nonrespondents were followed up by mail. The basic form used was the Form RD-1, but since total R&D performance funds and total Federal funds expended by industry for research and development are included in the Census Bureau's statistical program, the very few large companies that did not reply were mailed the census mandatory Form MA-121. Less than 1 percent of total R&D funds were obtained in this way and included in this report. Appendix table A-4 shows the percent of total research and development funds for which a distribution by basic research, applied research, and development was estimated by the Bureau of the Census in the absence of respondent distributed data for 1968. This information is not available for 1969, but since these figures have changed little from year to year in past surveys, it is believed that the 1968 data will provide reasonable estimates for 1969."}, {"section_title": "Comparability of Data Over a Period of Several Years 6", "text": "In the surveys of industrial research and development, there has been substantial comparability over any two-year period. This is because the respondent has had before him, on the same report form used in filing current data, the figures for the previous year entered on the form by the Census Bureau before mailing; the respondent has been asked to adjust the data for the previous year as necessary to make it comparable to those of the current year. Such adjustments have been made to reflect, for example, changes in reporting concepts or changes in company structure such as mergers or acquisitions. To further insure comparability, the industry and size classification have been adjusted so that they 22 31 are the same for a company for the two adjacent years. Some measure of the degree of change reflecting these adjustments in contrast to an actual change in research and development activity, can be gained by comparing figures for the same year reported in two succeeding forms, e.g., 1968 R&D statistics in the final report of the 1968 survey and the revised 1968 R&D statistics in the final report of the 1969 survey. The totals for broad classification are likely to be very close in the two reports, but in tile finer detail larger differences are noticeable. The results underscore the point that the measures are approximate and indicative rather than precise. When tables covering more than two years were prepared for this report, it was not considered feasible to carry most revisions back more than one year. Industry Codes in These Historical Tab less Most industry groups were characterized by relatively minor changes in the SIC codes for companies classified in those groups, and the tabulated data for such groups remained substantially comparable between 1958 and 1963. However, some industry groups were characterized by significant changes in the SIC codes for companies originally classified in those groups in 1958. The effect of these changes became most noticeable toward the end of the 5-year intercensal period, with the result that revisions to industry totals resulting from these code changes tended to reflect disproportionately large fluctuations between the data for 1963 and the year immediately preceding. To remedy these apparent discrepancies, the data for affected industries were adjusted as follows: For companies changing industry codes between 1958 and 1963, the industry data for each of the five years affected (1958 through 1962) were estimated to have changed at a constant rate (20 percent per year). Accordingly, the data for the industry in which such a company had been classified in 1958 were deflated by 20 percent per year for each of the affected years. Similarly, the data for the industry in which such a company was classified in 1963 were inflated by 20 percent per year for each of the intervening years. For the period 1963-1969, no    account annually for a relatively email amount of research and development in terms of the national total (less than 0.25 percent). Note: For the 1989 survey, the approximately 1,100 companiea in the original sample with 1968 R&D programs of less than 200,000 were not mailed survey forms. Data for there companies were estimated at their a A description of the standard error of estimate is given in appendix A under \"Methodology of Survey.\" The percentage (or re:ative) standard errors in this table may be converted to standard errors of estimate by multiplying the percentage shown by the associated estimate. For example, the relative standard error of estimate for funds for R&D performance for all company size groups in the food and kindred products industry is shown as 1 percent.

As in the past, the figure on R&D scientists and engineers will be obtained primarily from two sources: 1. Records on the number of scientists and engineers assigned to research and development. Thi s source is satisfactory so long as the scientists and engineers of the unit are assigned to research and development on a full-time basis (i.e., no more than 5 percent of their time is spent on non-research and development). For example, for company laboratories performing only research and development, report the number of scientists and engineers on the rolls in January. For other units, use Source 2. "}, {"section_title": "Estimates of Man Years", "text": "Each of the above 2 methods yields an estimate of man-months (for the month of January). If the average of the two January figures is representative of the entire year, the average should be entered in item 4C, column 3, as an estimate of man-years. Otherwise, the figure in column 3 should be estimated separately on the basis of quarterly, monthly, or other time records. Where research and development work for the Government and for the company is performed by the same group of scien;ists and engineers, it will be necessary to distribute the total number of such scientists and engineers according to the program, Federal or company, for which the research and development work was performed; i.e. to use the proportion of the total work time of research and development scientists and engineers that is devoted to Exclude from the cost of research and development perforthed within the corn-. pany the cost of research and development carried on for the company by noncompany research and development organizations of any kind; or fellowships, grants, and gifts to promote research and development or the study of the sciences and engineering.

In most cases, companies have found it possible to allocate their own accounts to these categories. If your company does not keep records that meet or can be allocated to these specific categories, there are two principal ways to reduce the task of providing the data requested. 1. Isolate the projects that clearly fall in the development category. If your company fabricates products, such development activity will include the design, construction, and testing of prototypes and models. Some defense contracts typically call for several test models. If your company's research and development frequently involves the development of a \"process\" as in chemicals and petroleum, such development activity would include operations beyond the bench scale, primarily the design and operations of pilot plants cc semiworks."}, {"section_title": "Isolate the organizational units whose research", "text": "and development can be readily classified. If a company has two or more laboratories, the expenditures of some of these laboratories may be all classified in one or another type of research and development on the basis of the function assigned to the laboratory. There are laboratories assigned only development type work. There are others engaged only in applied or basic research. If research and development work is done in production units as well as in various laboratories, the research and development work in the production units will generally be of a development type. The separate classification of clearly identified development operations, particularly in the industries producing expensive prototypes, will greatly reduce the balance to be distributed. The distribution will have to be estimated on the 1,,asis of a review of individual projects or on the basis of other summaries of the work. Please use the definitions for basic, applied, and development, as given above. lf, despite these instructions, you feel that you are unable to distribute your research and development expenditures into groupings approximating the categories requested, please write to the Census Bureau describing your accounts and indicating your special problem& The Bureau may be able to make or obtain some suggestions that will be helpful in completing the report form. Types of Activity Included in Development The design and operation of pilot plants o r semi-works plants so long as the principal purposes are to obtain experience and to compile engineering and other data to be used in evaluating hypotheses, in writing product formulas or in establishing finished product specifications, in designing special equipment and structures required by a process, and in preparing operating instructions or manuals. The engineering activity required to advance the design of a product or a process to the point where it meets specific functional and economic requirements and can be turned over to manufacturing units. The design, construction, and testing of preproduction prototypes and models and \"engineering follow-through\" in ti._ early production phase is included. * The development of designs for special manufacturing equipment and tools is included but tool making and tool tryout are not included. The preparation of reports, drawings, formulas, specifications, standard practice instructions or operating manuals, and other media for transmitting to operating units information obtained from the above activities is included. However, the production of detailed construction drawings or manufacturing blueprints is not included. The question, \"When does development end and production begin?\" is often asked. If the primary obj ective is to make further improvements on the product or process, then the work comes within the definition of research and development. If, on the other hand, the product or process is substantially \"se t,\" and the primary objective is to develop markets or to do preproduction planning, or to get the production process going smoothly, then the work is no longer research and development.

Do not include here, or elsewhere in the report, research and development contracts and the portions of procurement contracts that you subcontracted to other research and development organizations.
