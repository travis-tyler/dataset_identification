[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Concerns regarding reproducibility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RfMRI) findings have been raised. Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability/replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability < 0.3 for between-subject sex differences, < 0.5 for withinsubject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g., < 80 [40 per group]) not only minimized power (sensitivity < 2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect \"true\" effects (PPV < 0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.

Much of the scientific enterprise, such as providing detailed descriptions of methods and peer-reviewing manuscripts before publication, is intended to optimize agreement of results when performed by different researchers. Such efforts are crucial because science cannot progress if results cannot be reproduced [Blackford, 2017] . However, concerns regarding the reproducibility of biomedical and psychological research are increasingly being expressed [Ioannidis, 2005; Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Prinz et al., 2011] . This is particularly relevant to the field of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) [Carp, 2012a; Poldrack et al., 2017] , which has appeared to be a fruitful approach for basic, translational and clinical neuroscience [Biswal et al., 1995; Fox and Raichle, 2007; Fox et al., 2005] . Beyond its reported sensitivity to developmental, aging and pathological processes [Hjelmervik et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2011; Tomasi and Volkow, 2012] , R-fMRI is being increasingly adopted due to the relative ease of data collection and amenability to aggregation across studies and sites . These advantages are counterbalanced by high data dimensionality, relatively small sample size of most studies and the great amount of flexibility in data analysis, all of which threaten reproducibility.\nSome aspects of R-fMRI reproducibility have been examined. Intra-class correlation (ICC), which models the ratio of between-subject variability to within-subject variability [Caceres et al., 2009; Shrout and Fleiss, 1979] , has been used to assess test-retest reliability, and moderate-to-high ICC has been reported for most R-fMRI metrics [Cao et al., 2014; Shehzad et al., 2009; Zuo and Xing, 2014; Zuo et al., 2013 Zuo et al., , 2010a . However, ICC may be less informative, given the common practice in the field of reporting P-or Zthresholded statistical maps [Kristo et al., 2014] . Different thresholding techniques vary in the sets and numbers of voxels, it is crucial to evaluate the test-rest reliability and replicability of the supra-threshold voxels. Thus, the first focus of the current study is to quantify the reliability and replicability of R-fMRI metrics with thresholding. We compared differences of common R-fMRI metrics between males and females (between-subject) and between eyesopen (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions (within-subject) and determined how well the significant clusters were reproduced on retests (test-retest reliability) or in totally different datasets/studies (replicability). Sex differences were chosen because sex is an objective category that can be readily investigated across large scale datasets. To wit, differences in brain function between men and women have been well documented in the R-fMRI literature [Allen et al., 2011; Beltz et al., 2015; Bluhm et al., 2008; Filippi et al., 2013; Hjelmervik et al., 2014; Kilpatrick et al., 2015; Scheinost et al., 2015; Tomasi and Volkow, 2012; Xu et al., 2015] . We chose to examine differences between EO and EC conditions to test whether our approach generalizes to within-subject designs. EO and EC differences have been reported to differ considerably in R-fMRI studies Zou et al., 2009] .\nTest-retest reliability and replicability of the suprathreshold voxels are highly sensitive to the statistical threshold used to define significance. Such reproducibility was reported decreased as the significance threshold is enhanced [Duncan et al., 2009] . However, liberalizing the statistical threshold can dramatically increase the family-wise error rate (FWER), as recently demonstrated systematically for widely used statistical methods [Eklund et al., 2016] . The trade-off between reproducibility and FWER requires a comprehensive investigation into different statistical approaches for multiple comparison correction to try to reach a balance. Accordingly, the impact of statistical method, especially multiple comparison correction strategies, on reproducibility is the second focus of the present study.\nA third concern is the low statistical power of small samples, which are prevalent in the field of neuroscience. Carp reviewed over 200 fMRI studies published since 2007, and found the median sample size was 15 for onegroup studies and 14.75 per group for two-group studies, resulting in unacceptable statistical power for most studies [Carp, 2012b] . Another recent analysis [Poldrack et al., 2017] , reviewed 1,131 sample sizes in neuroimaging studies over more than 20 years. Despite the steady increase in sample size (with median sample size up to 28.5 for single-group studies and 19 per group in multi-group studies), the median study in 2015 was only sufficiently powered to detect effects >0.75. Button and colleagues calculated the statistical power of neuroscience studies with data extracted from meta-analyses. They found that the median statistical power of studies in the field of neuroscience was optimistically estimated to be between 8% and 31% [Button et al., 2013] . Moreover, the statistical findings of low power studies are unlikely to reflect true effects (i.e., they have low positive predictive value, PPV) [Button et al., 2013; Ioannidis, 2005] . Although these concerns have long been known, empirical evidence of how sample size influences reliability, as well as power and PPV of R-fMRI data are still scant. The attempt to quantify sensitivity and PPV has been hampered by the problem of how to define truly positive results. Here, we define findings that are reproducible in many datasets as the \"gold standard\", which makes it possible to quantify sensitivity and PPV as a function of sample size.\nTo address the above issues, we systematically analyzed four independent datasets to quantify both the test-retest reliability and replicability of R-fMRI data and investigate how multiple comparison correction strategies impact them. We also considered how sample size might influence reliability as well as power and PPV. Five common R-fMRI metrics, namely, the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and its fractional version (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), degree centrality (DC), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) were employed to encompass possible sex and eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) differences. We conclude by recommending a guideline based on this quantitative analysis to address the challenge of reproducibility in R-fMRI research."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and Imaging Protocols", "text": "We performed our analyses on four independent datasets. Three of them are publicly available via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI, data available at http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org): the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CORR) , the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) [Biswal et al., 2010] and Beijing EOEC1 [Liu et al., 2013] . The fourth dataset (Beijing EOEC2) was available through The R-fMRI Maps Project (http://rfmri.org/BeijingEOEC2_Raw), and was the basis of previous studies Zou et al., 2009] . The first two datasets were analyzed to evaluate test-retest reliability, replicability and the influence of sample size on between-subject sex differences (for details, see Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2 ). The latter two datasets were employed to explore whether our approach generalizes to within-subject studies (EO and EC differences). In the former two datasets, participants were instructed to simply rest while awake in a scanner (mostly 3T, although three FCP sites used 1.5T scanners). In the latter two datasets, participants were instructed to open or to close their eyes while being scanned at 3T (8 min per session, EO and EC order counterbalanced across subjects). The R-fMRI data were acquired using an echo-planar imaging sequence. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was also obtained for each participant for spatial normalization and localization. The corresponding institutional review boards of each collection center approved or provided waivers for the sharing of anonymized data, which were obtained with written informed consent from each participant.\nThe first dataset originally included 549 subjects who underwent two scanning sessions (mean time range 5 205 6 161 days) available at CORR. Of those, 420 subjects (age 21.45 6 2.67, 208 females, henceforth the \"CORR dataset\", see Supporting Information Table S1 for details) were selected after quality control with the following exclusion criteria. To avoid the confounds of development or aging, only young adults (age between 18 and 32) were included. Subjects were excluded if their functional scans showed excessive motion, indexed by mean frame-wise displacement (FD) [Jenkinson et al., 2002] exceeding 0.2 mm. Participants with poor T1 or functional images, low-quality normalization or inadequate brain coverage were also excluded. The second dataset consisted of 716 young healthy subjects (age 22.34 6 2.92, 420 females, henceforth the \"FCP dataset\", see Supporting Information Table S2 for details) selected from FCP with the same inclusion criteria as the CORR dataset. The third dataset consisted of 48 healthy subjects (age 22.42 6 2.24, 24 females, henceforth the \"Beijing EOEC1 dataset\"). The fourth dataset included 20 subjects (age 20.95 6 1.82, 10 females, henceforth the \"Beijing EOEC2 dataset\"). The same inclusion criteria as the CORR and FCP datasets were applied, but no subject was excluded.

First, the initial 10 volumes were discarded, and slice-timing correction was performed with all volume slices corrected for different signal acquisition time by shifting the signal measured in each slice relative to the acquisition of the slice at the mid-point of each repetition time (TR). Then, the time series of images for each subject were realigned using a six-parameter (rigid body) linear transformation with a two-pass procedure (registered to the first image and then registered to the mean of the images after the first realignment). After realignment, individual T1-weighted MPRAGE images were co-registered to the mean functional image using a 6 degree-of-freedom linear transformation without re-sampling and then segmented into gray matter, white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [Ashburner and Friston, 2005] . Finally, transformations from individual native space to MNI space were computed with the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra tool [Ashburner, 2007] ."}, {"section_title": "Nuisance Regression", "text": "To minimize head motion confounds, we utilized the Friston 24-parameter model [Friston et al., 1996 ] to regress out head motion effects. The Friston 24-parameter model (i.e., 6 head motion parameters, 6 head motion parameters one time point before, and the 12 corresponding squared items) was chosen based on prior work that higher-order models remove head motion effects better [Satterthwaite et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2013a] . Additionally, mean FD was used to address the residual effects of motion in group analyses. Mean FD is derived from Jenkinson's relative root mean square algorithm [Jenkinson et al., 2002] . As r Chen et al. r r 302 r global signal regression (GSR) is still a controversial practice in the R-fMRI field, and given the recent advice that analyses with and without GSR be considered complementary [Murphy and Fox, 2016] , we evaluated results both with and without GSR. Other sources of spurious variance (WM and CSF signals) were also removed from the data through linear regression to reduce respiratory and cardiac effects. Additionally, linear trends were included as a regressor to account for drifts in the blood oxygen level dependent signal. We performed temporal bandpass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz) on all time series except for ALFF and fALFF analyses. Of note, temporal bandpass filtering was performed after nuisance regression, thus would not reintroduce nuisance-related variation [Hallquist et al., 2013] ."}, {"section_title": "A Broad Array of R-fMRI Metrics", "text": "ALFF and fALFF [Zou et al., 2008] : ALFF is the mean of amplitudes within a specific frequency domain (here, 0.01-0.1Hz) from a fast Fourier transform of a voxel's time course. fALFF is a normalized version of ALFF and represents the relative contribution of specific oscillations to the whole detectable frequency range.\nReHo [Zang et al., 2004] : ReHo is a rank-based Kendall's coefficient of concordance that assesses the synchronization among a given voxel and its nearest neighbors' (here, 26 voxels) time courses.\nDC [Buckner et al., 2009; Zuo et al., 2012] : DC is the number or sum of weights of significant connections for a voxel.

The resultant VMHC values were Fisher-Z transformed. For better correspondence between symmetric voxels, VMHC requires that individual functional data be further registered to a symmetric template and smoothed (4 mm FWHM). The group averaged symmetric template was created by first computing a mean normalized T1 image across participants, and then this image was averaged with its left-right mirrored version [Zuo et al., 2010b] .\nBefore entering into further analyses, all of the metric maps were Z-standardized (subtracting the mean value for the entire brain from each voxel, and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation) and then smoothed (4 mm FWHM), except for VMHC (which were smoothed and Fisher-Z transformed beforehand). To verify if our conclusions were affected by smoothing kernel, we have also reanalyzed our data with 8 mm FWHM smoothing kernel."}, {"section_title": "Strategies to Correct for Multiple Comparisons", "text": "We first evaluated the FWER of 31 different statistical strategies (see Tables I and II) . Statistical maps were thresholded using eight versions of the one-tailed Gaussian random field (GRF) theory [Friston et al., 1994; Nichols and Hayasaka, 2003] correction procedure, as implemented in DPABI [Yan et al., 2016] . These eight thresholding approaches used single-voxel thresholds (or cluster-defining thresholds) of P < 0.01 (Z > 2.33), P < 0.005 (Z > 2.58), P < 0.001 (Z > 3.09), or P < 0.0005 (Z > 3.29), and cluster size thresholds of P < 0.05, or P < 0.025. Given that GRF correction is only performed on onetailed tests, we set P < 0.025 to perform two one-tailed tests, which is equivalent to two-tailed P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, we evaluated FWER of two versions of Monte Carlo simulation (simulated 1,000 times) based corrections [Ledberg et al., 1998 ], which is implemented in AFNI (AFNI 3dClustSim, https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/doc/manual/3dclust.pdf) and DPABI (DPABI AlphaSim), separately. We note the bug reported in Eklund et al. [2016] had been fixed in the software versions used in the current study. Each version of Monte Carlo simulation based correction used the same eight thresholding approaches used for GRF.

Because assignment was fully random, no significant results should have emerged when these two groups' R-fMRI metrics were compared.

For each of the first two datasets, we employed a general linear model to examine the sex differences in R-fMRI measures while taking the confounding effects of age, head motion (mean FD) and site into account. Sex effect was estimated by the t value of the regressor corresponding to sex. Then the group difference map was corrected using different multiple comparison correction approaches described earlier to obtain statistically significant clusters.\nThe Dice coefficient was used to evaluate test-retest reliability as calculated by the following equation:\nWhere V 1 and V 2 represents the number of suprathreshold voxels in Tests 1 and 2 of the CORR dataset, and V overlap stands for the number of supra-threshold voxels in both tests.\nTo calculate replicability, we selected the voxels which were significant in both sessions in the CORR dataset, and then calculated how they overlapped with the significant voxels in the FCP dataset. We used the same Dice formula, with V 1 representing the number of voxels significant in both sessions in the CORR dataset, V 2 representing the number of voxels significant in the FCP dataset, and V overlap standing for the number of voxels that were significant in both sessions in the CORR dataset as well as significant in the FCP dataset.\nFor each multiple comparison correction strategy, we calculated test-retest reliability and replicability. To figure out which multiple comparison correction strategy yielded the best test-retest reliability and replicability, a nonparametric one-way repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman's test) on five metrics by two pre-processing strategies (with and without GSR) was conducted, and followed by post-hoc analyses corrected by Tukey's honest significant difference criterion.\nFinally, we defined the voxels that were significant in both CORR sessions and in the FCP dataset as the \"gold standard\" for further evaluation (see section below). We believe these consistently significant voxels reflect true differences between males and females based on their high test-retest reliability and replicability in two large sample datasets.\nTo see whether our findings on between-subject sex differences generalized to within-subject EOEC differences, we further evaluated the replicability of the EOEC differences across two Beijing EOEC datasets. For each dataset, paired t-tests between EC and EO conditions were performed to examine EOEC differences in R-fMRI measures, while taking the confounding effect of head motion (mean FD) into account. Of note, between-subject factors (e.g., age and sex) did not need to be covaried in this withinsubject design.

First, we randomized 100 times the order of female participants (and separately the order of male participants) from a single site (the \"SWU 4\" site in the CORR dataset, which has two sessions of 116 males and 105 females, for details see Supporting Information Table S1 ). Second, for each randomization of each k, we selected the first k/2 female participants and the first k/2 male participants. We then performed twosample t-tests on the ALFF maps (without GSR) between males and females (with age and head motion as covariates) and then applied PT with TFCE (which performs better, see \"Results\" section) to threshold the results. Finally, we calculated the Dice coefficient between the thresholded maps (binarized) of the first test and the retest, for each of the 100 randomizations and each k.\nWe also evaluated the sensitivity and PPV of the voxels which were significant in both tests of each randomization and each k, based on the \"gold standard\" defined in the prior section. The sensitivity of a study measures the proportion of positives that were correctly identified as such [Altman and Bland, 1994] , while PPV is the probability that a positive finding reflects a true effect [Ioannidis, 2005] . A recent analysis [Button et al., 2013] demonstrated that studies with small sample size not only reduce the chance of detecting a true effect, but also reduce the probability that significant findings reflect a true effect. To determine this effect of sample size, the sensitivity and PPV were calculated:\nwhere TP is equal to the number of \"true positive voxels\", which were statistically significant and reflected the true effect. As the true effect is difficult to define, we used the voxels that were significant in both CORR sessions and in the FCP dataset (the \"gold standard\" voxels defined above) after PT correction with TFCE. FN represents the number of \"false negative voxels\" that were statistically insignificant but reflected a true effect.

The appropriate multiple comparison correction strategy must control the false positive rate at an acceptable level. Here, we evaluated 31 different multiple comparison correction strategies with 5 different R-fMRI metrics by 2 different pre-processing strategies (with and without GSR) in 106 female young adults (selected from the Beijing site of the FCP dataset). Based on the group differences of two randomly assigned groups (20 subjects per group, permuted 1,000 times), we calculated FWER for each multiple comparison correction strategy. Table I presents FWERs and cluster sizes of GRF and Monte Carlo Simulation based correction strategies on ALFF without GSR. FWERs of other metrics with and without GSR can be found in supplementary materials (Supporting Information Tables S3-S11). For FWERs under GRF and Monte Carlo Simulation based corrections, the liberal voxel P thresholds (cluster-defining threshold) (P < 0.01 [Z > 2.33] and P < 0.005 [Z > 2.58]) far exceeded nominal 5% level (Table I , Fig. 1 , and Supporting Information Tables S3-S11). Furthermore, as most researchers are interested in two-tailed effects (e.g., both patients > controls and patients < controls), if they perform one-tailed thresholding twice (i.e., each tail P < 0.05), then the final FWER is higher than the nominal 5% level. Only if the researcher corrects the two tests of each tail (e.g., Bonferroni correction, each tail controlled at P < 0.025), can the FWER reach the nominal 5% level. For example, GRF was almost valid under the strictest threshold (voxel-wise P < 0.0005 and clusterwise P < 0.025, each tail): FWER of all metrics under 6.35% (the upper limit of approximate theoretical 95% CI of nominal 5%) except for DC (Table II) . However, for Monte Carlo Simulation based corrections, the cluster size for thresholding is looser (smaller) than GRF (Table I, and  Supporting Information Tables S3-S11) , thus the FWER is higher than GRF: there were much more FWERs exceeded 6.35% even under the strictest threshold, especially for DPABI AlphaSim (Table II) .

ALFF, fALFF and ReHo had relatively higher test-retest reliabilities: ALFF: 0.66 6 0.01, fALFF: 0.61 6 0.09, ReHo: 0.54 6 0.05. In contrast, DC and VMHC had lower test-retest reliabilities: DC: 0.39 6 0.05, VMHC: 0.43 6 0.06. Interestingly, we found GSR decreased the test-retest reliability of R-fMRI metrics. For example, the test-retest reliability of DC decreased from 0.48 to 0.31 under correction of PT with TFCE when computed with GSR.\nAmong those multiple comparison correction strategies that can control FWER under nominal 5%, we would like to identify which one could achieve the best test-retest reliability. We performed a Friedman test on five metrics by two pre-processing strategies (with and without GSR) among 10 strategies of multiple comparison correction: three kinds of cluster-based correction (i.e., GRF, AFNI 3dClustSim and DPABI AlphaSim, the latter two were added for comparison although they cannot always control FWER under nominal 5%) with the strictest threshold (voxel-wise P < 0.0005 and cluster-wise P < 0.025, each tail), six kinds of PT and FDR (Fig. 2A) . The 10 different multiple comparison correction strategies differed significantly (Friedman's chi-square 5 35.04, df 5 9, P < 0.0001). Further post-hoc analysis revealed that PT with TFCE achieved the best test-retest reliability. PT with TFCE had significantly higher test-retest reliability than three kinds of cluster-based correction (i.e., GRF, AFNI 3dClustSim, and DPABI AlphaSim) with the strictest threshold (voxelwise P , 0.0005 and cluster-wise P < 0.025, each tail), PT (voxel-wise threshold of P < 0.002 [Z > 3.09] and P < 0.001 [Z > 3.29] with cluster-wise thresholds of P < 0.05 [two tailed]) and PT with VOX in the post-hoc analysis (P < 0.05, multiple comparison corrected by Tukey's honest significant difference criterion) ( Fig. 2A) .

Lack of reproducibility may partly be due to (1) the abuse of liberal multiple comparison correction strategies and (2) the high prevalence of small sample size studies. Here, we provided a comprehensive examination of the impact of different multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size on test-retest reliability and replicability across widely used R-fMRI metrics. We found that multiple comparison correction strategies with liberal thresholds could yield higher test-retest reliability and replicability but at the cost of dramatically increasing FWER to unacceptable levels. We noted that PT with TFCE, a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between FWER (under 5%) and test-retest reliability and replicability (e.g., 0.68 test-retest reliability and 0.25 replicability of sex differences in ALFF without GSR). Although sex differences in R-fMRI metrics could be detected with moderate test-retest reliabilities, they were poorly replicated in a distinct dataset (replicability of sex differences < 0.3). Among the brain regions showing the most reproducible sex differences, PCC demonstrated consistently lower spontaneous activity in males compared with females. Furthermore, by calculating replicabilities with two independent within-subject EOEC datasets, we found that the better performance of PT with TFCE generalized to within-subject design studies. Defining the most reproducible brain regions in two large sample datasets as a \"gold standard\", and randomly drawing subjects with different sample sizes from one single site, we found that both test-retest reliability and sensitivity increased with sample size. However, PPV reached a plateau at k 5 80 (40 per group) and remained around 0.30 even with further sample size increases. Here we discuss the implications of our findings on decision-making regarding the choice of multiple comparison correction strategies and approach towards addressing the challenge of reproducibility."}, {"section_title": "Selecting a Multiple Comparison Correction Strategy with Respect to FWER", "text": "Appropriate multiple comparison correction strategies must control the false positive rate at an acceptable level. Our results replicated the findings of prior work [Eklund , 2016] , which analyzed R-fMRI data with a putative task design to compute FWER in task fMRI studies. They also performed between-group comparisons on simulated null task activation maps and calculated the FWER. They found an unacceptably high FWER for most widely used multiple comparison correction strategies. Our results provide additional evidence from group comparisons with a range of R-fMRI metrics. Our results confirmed that multiple comparison correction strategies with a liberal threshold (e.g., with voxel wise P < 0.01 and cluster wise P < 0.05) led to an unacceptably high FWER, while PT can maintain the FWER at nominal 0.05 levels.\nBeyond replicating Eklund et al.'s conclusions regarding FWER, two additional points should be noted. First, researchers should pay close attention to whether the test is one-or two-tailed. As most researchers are interested in two-tailed effects (e.g., both patients > controls and patients < controls), if they perform one-tailed thresholding twice (i.e., each tail P < 0.05), then the final FWER will be higher than 10% even if the voxel-level P is set to 0.0005 (Z > 3.29). Such researchers have to correct for the two tests at each tail, that is, researchers could perform onetailed correction twice, with each tail voxel-wise P < 0.0005 and cluster-wise P < 0.025. With such a setting in GRF correction, the FWER almost reaches the nominal level of 5%. Second, among the cluster-based thresholding strategies of GRF, AFNI 3dClustSim and DPABI AlphaSim, we recommend the use of GRF. At the strictest level (voxel-wise P < 0.0005 and cluster-wise P < 0.025, each tail), GRF is almost valid, while Monte Carlo Simulation based corrections (AFNI 3dClustSim and DPABI AlphaSim) still cannot control FWER at nominal 5% level in some cases. DPABI AlphaSim should not be used in the future, as it always gives looser cluster size threshold and higher FWER, even at a cost of high computational demand. Furthermore, several new options and programs, such as the \"ACF\" option implemented in 3dClustSim, 3dLocalACF and the \"ETAC\" option in 3dXClustSim have been proposed to overcome deficits pointed out by Eklund et al. However, according to the recent redux by the AFNI group, these approaches were either inefficient in reducing FWERs or still under development [Cox et al., 2017] . Thus we did not apply these new methods in this study, but we believe these efforts deserve further investigation in future work.\nIn sum, in considering FWER, eight different multiple comparison correction strategies can be used: (1) GRF Figure 5 . Test-retest reliability (Dice index), sensitivity and PPV on ALFF (without GSR) as functions of sample size. "}, {"section_title": "Selecting a Multiple Comparison Correction Strategy with Regard to Test-Retest Reliability and Replicability", "text": "FWER is not the only criterion in selecting a multiple comparison correction strategy; test-retest reliability and replicability may be even more crucial. An appropriate strategy should best balance FWER and reproducibility. For example, GRF with liberal thresholds (e.g., with voxel wise P < 0.01 and cluster wise P < 0.05) has relatively high test-retest reliability and replicability, but it has unacceptably high FWER. On the other hand, PT with VOX can control FWER at a low level (< 5%), but results in the lowest test-retest reliability and replicability, thus it is also not an appropriate strategy to correct for multiple comparisons. Fortunately, PT with TFCE provides a good balance between FWER and reproducibility. PT with TFCE can maintain the FWER under 5%, while yielding moderate test-retest reliability and replicability, for example, 0.68 test-retest reliability for ALFF on sex differences. Of note, test-retest reliability (sex differences) and replicability (both sex differences and EOEC differences) of PT with TFCE were not significantly lower than for the liberal GRF threshold (e.g., with voxel wise P < 0.01 and cluster wise P < 0.05).\nIn considering both FWER as well as test-retest reliability and replicability in both between-subject and within-subject design studies, we recommend using PT with TFCE. As an approach for defining a cluster-like voxel-wise statistic, TFCE avoids the limitation of defining the initial clusterforming threshold as do other common cluster-based strategy thresholding strategies [Smith and Nichols, 2009] . TFCE uses the height parameter (H) and the extent parameter (E) to enhance cluster-like features in a statistical image. Although tweaking of these two parameters is possible, we found the default parameters (H 5 2, E 5 0.5) already perform well. Of note, PT with TFCE can be easily performed for many different kinds of statistical tests in DPABI, which integrated functions from PALM [Winkler et al., 2016] ."}, {"section_title": "Are R-fMRI Findings Reproducible?", "text": "Concerns regarding the reproducibility of R-fMRI findings are increasing [Poldrack et al., 2017] . Assessing reproducibility is highly sensitive to the statistical threshold used to define significance [Rombouts et al., 1998 ]. After identifying the appropriate statistical approach (PT with TFCE), we could evaluate two important aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, in common R-fMRI metrics. We found most R-fMRI metrics demonstrated moderate test-retest reliability in betweensubject contrasts of sex differences (Table III) . Specifically, when computed without GSR, fALFF reached the highest test-retest reliability (0.75), followed by ALFF (0.68) and ReHo (0.54), under the correction of PT with TFCE. DC (0.48) and VMHC (0.44) had the lowest test-retest reliabilities in between-subject comparisons of sex differences. This is consistent with prior studies which reported test-retest reliabilities of R-fMRI networks localized by either seed based analysis [Kristo et al., 2014] or independent component analysis [Meindl et al., 2010; Pinter et al., 2016] , showing moderate to high test-retest reliability (between 0.29 and 0.76 in most regions).\nBeyond test-retest reliability, a unique contribution of our study is the investigation of replicability. That is, to what extent can a finding in one dataset (usually one study) be replicated in another dataset (another study)? We found the between-subject replicability of sex differences was much lower than test-retest reliability: replicability of all the R-fMRI metrics was below 0.3. ALFF had the best balance between test-retest reliability (0.68) and replicability (0.25), outperforming the other R-fMRI metrics. Although fALFF reached a high test-retest reliability, its replicability was poor (0.06), possibly because it is sensitive to variations in TR used in different datasets. Such low replicability should not be surprising, given the substantial differences between two different datasets, e.g., variation in ethnicity, sequence type, coil type, scanning parameters, participant instructions and head-motion restraint techniques. In evaluating replicabilities of withinsubject EOEC contrasts, we found better replicability than for between-subject sex differences, likely reflecting the much larger effect sizes of within-subject EOEC differences than between-subject sex differences (Fig. 6 ). However, this was still not adequate as all replicabilities were below 0.5. The best replicability that could be achieved was 0.49 for EOEC differences of ALFF under PT correction with TFCE. The present results question the generalizability of both between-subject and within-subject results reported in R-fMRI studies, and support the suggestion that future studies incorporate advanced data standardization techniques [Yan et al., 2013b ] to improve replicability.\nIt is noteworthy that we found convergent sex differences and EOEC differences across all metrics and all datasets, despite low replicability. The most replicable sex difference was located in PCC. Greater activity in females versus males was found in PCC, which is similar to previous studies [Allen et al., 2011; Biswal et al., 2010] . As this phenomenon replicated in two sessions of the same dataset, and was reproduced in two different datasets, we believe this reflects a true sex difference that should be reproducible in future studies. PCC has been shown to be more active in females than in males in several fMRI activation experiments of working and episodic memory [Filippi et al., 2013] . It has been suggested that the PCC is associated with self-referential thoughts, emotions relating to others, remembering the past and thinking about the future [Fransson and Marrelec, 2008; Leech and Sharp, 2014; Maddock et al., 2001 ], thus our results are consistent r R-fMRI Reproducibility: on the Impact of Correction Strategies and Sample Size r r 313 r with more inward thinking and empathy in women compared with men. As for EOEC differences, we found greater activity in EC versus EO in precentral and postcentral gyrus and weaker activity in bilateral occipital cortex. Our results were in line with previous studies [Marx et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2007] , indicating a subtle and important difference in brain activities between these two states."}, {"section_title": "What Can Be Done for Small Sample Size R-fMRI Studies?", "text": "A recent theoretical analysis [Button et al., 2013] highlighted the detrimental effect of low statistical power induced by small sample size on reproducibility. We confirmed that the reliability of results from small sample size studies was very low. For example, under PT with TFCE correction, test-retest reliability was only 0.08 6 0.17 when k 5 60 (30 subjects per group), which is a \"classical\" sample size in the R-fMRI field. According to the mathematical model of bias in scientific research [Button et al., 2013] , studies with a small sample size not only have a reduced chance to detect true effects, but they also reduce the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect. The current study used empirical data (R-fMRI metrics) to confirm that the power (sensitivity) of small sample size comparisons is extremely low (around 0.01 when k 5 60), which is consistent with the finding that the median statistical power across 461 neuroimaging studies was 8% [Button et al., 2013] . Further, small, underpowered samples are more likely to provide positive results through selective analysis and outcome reporting, which are prevalent in R-fMRI studies across a broad range of experimental design and data analytic strategies [Carp, 2012a; Poldrack et al., 2017] . Thus, our results add to the growing consensus in the field calling for larger sample sizes. Indeed, as sample size increased from k 5 30 to 200, we found reliability increased steadily from 0.02 6 0.08 to 0.46 6 0.07, and sensitivity increased from 0.0007 6 0.0004 to 0.43 6 0.07. Although PPV reached a plateau at k 5 80, it increased from 0.02 6 0.09 (k 5 30) to 0.30 6 0.02 (k 5 200). Our results quantify the insufficiency of the present classical sample size in the R-fMRI field. For studies examining effect sizes similar to or even less than those of sex differences, results from a sample size <80 (40 per group) should be considered preliminary, given their low reliability (< 0.23), sensitivity (< 0.02) and PPV (< 0.26). Alternatively, researchers could prefer within-subject design to between-subject design if it's possible, as larger effect size in within-subject design can increase reproducibility in small sample size studies, as we demonstrated here in the EOEC difference results.\nAnother consideration is smoothing kernel in preprocessing. Large smoothing kernels may systematically bias or even obscure evidence of underlying difference at the cost of anatomical specificity [Friston et al., 1994; Sacchet and Knutson, 2013] , thus we chose a relatively small smoothing kernel (4 mm FWMH) for pre-processing in the main analyses. We have re-analyzed our data with 8mm FWHM smoothing kernel in pre-processing, which verified our main conclusions in FWER (Supporting Information Figure 6 . Effect sizes (Cohen's f 2 ) of between-subject sex differences (A) calculated with the first session from CORR dataset, n 5 420) and within-subject EOEC differences (B) calculated with the Beijing EOEC1 dataset, n 5 48). Cohen's f 2 were thresholded at f 2 > 0.02 (small effect size). Table S12 ) and the superiority of PT with TFCE (Supporting Information Fig.  S2 and Supporting Information Tables S16-S18). Interestingly, we found higher smoothness (8 mm in pre-processing) increased test-retest reliability and replicability. For example, for ALFF without GSR under PT with TFCE, replicability of EOEC difference increased from 0.49 to 0.58 (Table VII) . Regarding to sample size effect, PPV kept increasing to 0.4 until k 5 180 (Supporting Information Fig.  S3 and Supporting Information Table S19 ). This indicates larger smoothing kernel (8 mm) improves reproducibility and is more likely reflecting true effect. However, finding the optimal smoothing kernel to balance anatomical specificity and reproducibility is out of the scope of this study, thus needs to be addressed in the future.\nMany suggestions have been proposed to address the challenges of reproducibility, for example, establishing large-scale consortia to accumulate big data, sharing custom analysis code, following accepted standards for reporting methods, and encouraging replication studies [Button et al., 2013; Poldrack et al., 2017] . Recently, data-sharing initiatives (e.g., grassroots efforts such as FCP/INDI, openfMRI, fMRIDC and coordinated efforts such as ADNI, HCP, PING and UKBiobank) enable big data research models to address the reproducibility challenge. However, raw data sharing requires intensive coordinating efforts, huge manpower demands and large-capacity data storing/management facilities. Furthermore, sharing raw data entails privacy concerns arising from the possibility of being able to identify participants from high-dimensional raw data. These concerns, together with the demands of data organization and the limitation of large data uploading, prevents the wider imaging community from publically sharing valuable brain imaging datasets. The R-fMRI Maps project (http:// rfmri.org/maps) was proposed to address the above concerns by only sharing the final maps of various R-fMRI indices, which only need light data storing/uploading requirements and remove the privacy concerns regarding raw data sharing. All of the R-fMRI metric maps of the current study have been made available through the R-fMRI Maps project, thus readers can easily confirm/reanalyze this data with our shared analysis code (https://github.com/Chaogan-Yan/ PaperScripts/tree/master/Chen_2017_HBM). Different from efforts to collect and share unthresholded statistical maps of the human brain [e.g., NeuroVault.org, Gorgolewski et al., 2015] , the metric maps available through the R-fMRI Maps project can be statistically reanalyzed or fed into machine learning algorithms. Through the R-fMRI Maps project, we hope to build an unprecedented big data repository of brain imaging analyses across a wide variety of individuals: including different neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders, as well as healthy people with different traits. We hope the availability of such a big data repository will help to address the challenge of reproducibility."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "To our knowledge, this was the first effort to comprehensively evaluate the impact of different strategies to correct for multiple comparisons as well as of sample size on the reproducibility of group differences in R-fMRI metrics. Our results revealed that PT with TFCE, a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between FWER and test-retest reliability/replicability. We found moderate test-retest reliability of the R-fMRI metrics we assessed. By contrast, replicability was low, bringing into question the generalizability of results reported in RfMRI studies. Finally, the present research demonstrated that reliability, sensitivity and PPV increase steadily as sample sizes grow. Of note, findings from R-fMRI studies with small sample sizes are poorly reliable, as well as yielding low sensitivity and PPV, which reinforces calls for increasing sample size in future R-fMRI studies.
