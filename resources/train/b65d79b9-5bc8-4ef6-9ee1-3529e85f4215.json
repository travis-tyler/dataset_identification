[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Anti-hypertensives that modify the renin angiotensin system may reduce Alzheimer's disease pathology and reduce the rate of disease progression. We report a phase II, two arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial (ISRCTN: 93682878;\nEudraCT: 2012-003641-15) of losartan to test the efficacy of Reducing pathology in Outcomes: The primary outcome is the rate of whole brain atrophy as a surrogate measure of disease progression. Secondary outcomes include changes to (i) white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF) (also surrogate markers of cognitive decline and disease progression); (ii) performance on a standard series of assessments of memory, cognitive function, activities of daily living and quality of life.\nAssessments: Major assessments (for all outcomes) and relevant safety monitoring of blood pressure and bloods will be at baseline and 12 months. Additional cognitive assessment will also be conducted at 6 months along with safety blood pressure and blood monitoring.\nMonitoring of blood pressure, bloods and reported side effects will occur during the open-label phase and during the majority of the post-randomisation dispensing visits.\nSample Size: 228 participants to provide at least 182 subjects with final assessments to provide 84% power to detect a 25% difference in atrophy rate (therapeutic benefit) change over 12 months at an alpha level of 0.05.\nAnalysis: Intention-to-treat analysis, estimating between-group differences in outcomes derived from appropriate (linear or logistic) multivariable regression models adjusting for minimisation variables."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Currently the care costs of Alzheimer's disease are almost equal to that of cancer, stroke and heart disease combined, and are predicted to increase in the current absence of long term effective therapies (1) (2) (3) . Thus there remains urgent need for better treatments to extend the quality of life of patients, their carers and to reduce the rising associated health care costs.\nAny treatment delaying the onset of AD by 5 years could halve its prevalence (4) .\nHypertension in midlife (5, 6) and late life (7) , and stroke (8) increase risk of dementia.\nRecently, we (9) and others (10) observed that angiotensin II (AngII) targeting drugs (AngII type 1 receptor antagonists (AT1RAs) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) had lower incidence of AD compared with other types of anti-hypertensive drugs. AT1RAs were significantly more beneficial than ACEIs. While the underlying cause of AD remains unclear, loss of acetylcholine and neurons due to the deposition in the brain of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide and tau pathology is key (11) . Significant cerebrovascular pathology (CVP), such as reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation, ischaemia and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs); pathologies associated with and predictive of loss of cognitive function (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) ; is also common (11, 17, 18) . Hypertension is associated with plasma levels of A\u03b2 (19) and AD risk (20). Molecular pathways, likely independent of cerebrovascular mediated pathology are also probably relevant. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neprilysin (NEP), which make AngII, are elevated in the AD brain (21, 22) . ACE activity is elevated in peripheral blood in AD (23); ACE and NEP degrade A\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo (2) ; variation in the ACE gene associated with lower plasma levels of ACE are also associated with AD risk (24) . AngII promotes the synthesis of the inflammatory mediator TNF\u03b1 (25, 26) , and has anti-cholinergic (27, 28) and anti-glutamatergic effects (29) , all of which are major sequelae of AD pathology.\nLosartan, an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1RA) is an effective anti-hypertension drug over a wide range of ages. Losartan crosses the blood brain barrier (30) and is of the class of AngII blocking drugs that we, and others, have observed to be associated with reduced incidence of AD (9, 10) . Losartan also improves CBF (14) , a surrogate marker of cognitive performance in humans (31) (32) (33) , and limits neuronal damage following ischaemia in stroke rat models (16) ; in low doses (i.e. not reducing blood pressure (BP)), it reduces pathology and improves cognitive performance in transgenic mouse models of AD (34) . Given its anti-hypertensive effect it is also likely to reduce ischaemia-mediated WMHs (12) .\nNo clinical trials studying losartan or any related AT1RA drugs as an intervention in AD have been undertaken to date. The most relevant related studies that used losartan (50mg) reported modest benefits, non-significant benefits on memory in non-demented hypertensive patients (35, 36) , which were thought to be independent of BP-lowering effects (37) . Yet, as a hypertension trial, cognition was not the primary outcome and thus was likely underpowered for more conventional study of cognition. To date, there are limited systematic reviews that have assessed the impact of BP-lowering on cognitive decline (38) . McGuinness and colleagues previously concluded, based on data from four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), that BP reduction was insufficient to prevent dementia and cognitive decline in hypertensive patients with no prior cerebrovascular disease. This is supported by secondary analysis of ONTARGET and TRANSCEND where neither the ACEI (ramipril) nor another AT1RA (telmisartan) appeared to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and any type of dementia in patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes (39) . Staessen (2011) also reported in a meta-analysis of hypertension treatment trials, that BP-lowering did not reduce dementia risk in populations with high cardiovascular morbidity (40) . In our opinion, these studies have limited scope for translation to the prognosis of AD since the study populations included were generally younger, selected according to high cardiovascular burden and cognitive assessment was not the primary outcome whereby assessment was generally less rigorous than that normally used in clinical trials of AD. In our opinion, these negative findings make any larger-scale (e.g. Phase III) multi-centre RCTs of an AT1RA in AD premature and currently unjustified without further supportive evidence.\nTo our knowledge, no studies have investigated losartan on MRI measures of brain atrophy, CBF, WMH and cognition in AD. One related smaller (n=100) phase II three arm US-based trial (NCT00605072) was the antihypertensives and vascular, endothelial, and cognitive function (AVEC) trial. Using only hypertensive participants with early (non-AD) cognitive impairment, it compared one year of candesartan (AT1RA) treatment with lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide for their effect on memory and executive function, CBF (measured by Transcranial Doppler) and central endothelial function (measured by changes in CBF in response to changes in end tidal carbon dioxide) (41) .\nWe have chosen losartan as our intervention because of the multi-factorial functions of AngII in the brain including vasoconstriction, reduction of acetylcholine (ACh) release, inflammation and neuronal excitotoxicity (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) 42) . Second, selective antagonism of the AT1 receptor (AT1R) by losartan does not inhibit ACE activity, which may be important as ACE is elevated in AD (21, 22) ) and can degrade A\u03b2 (21, 43, 44) . These preferential effects of AT1RAs over ACE-inhibitors have been reviewed at length and are supported by various pharmacoepidemiological and pre-clinical studies (9, 10, (45) (46) (47) . By testing an AT1RA in both hypertensive and normotensive AD patients, we enhance the generalizability of any finding and examine if any protective mechanisms may be operating independent of or in addition to BP-lowering effects.\nRADAR will test the hypothesis that AngII blockade in mild to moderate AD with 100mg of the AT1RA losartan will reduce the rate of brain volume loss and therefore slow the clinical progression of AD. We have opted for the highest dose of losartan normally recommended and titrated directly from 25mg, reflecting standard clinical practice, to attempt maximal engagement of the intervention with its receptor whilst having provision of appropriate monitoring of blood pressure both prior to and during the course of the study."}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "A two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, randomised, trial comparing 100mg losartan or placebo effects.

This will involve potential participants being on open-label active drug for 14 days (7 days at 25mg followed by 7 days at 100mg) and then 4 to 14 days washout on a placebo. This is to ensure all patients entering the trial can tolerate the maximum dose of losartan (based on daily monitoring of BP over the open-label period in conjunction with any clinically relevant issues, including potential deviations from baseline blood measurements (as assessed by the Principle Investigator), or self-reported concerns made by participants or study companions) and have had a sufficiently long wash-out period to assess laboratory assessment of bloods prior to being randomised. There are no dose modifications after the participant has entered the randomised phase. Drug adherence is monitored by pill counts undertaken at the regular follow-up visits (see figure 1 ).

The volumetric analyses of the MPRAGE images will be conducted in collaboration with the Dementia Research Centre at University College London (UCL) who provided initial advice and validation of the MRI protocol at all sites. The UCL team have developed semi-automated computerised methods to derive brain structure volumes from single time-point MRI and rates of atrophy from serial MRI (56) (57) (58) (59) similar to those previously reported for multi-centre trials (60) .

Consent will be taken at this visit and eligibility then confirmed after initial data collection. We have designed our inclusion criteria so that although the patients have a diagnosis of AD, they should still have capacity to consent, and they continue to have the right to withdraw consent in the future. If a participant loses capacity over the time of the trial, they will remain in the trial unless their legal representative (that may also be their companion) feels this is no longer appropriate.\nIf a potential participant meets the eligibility criteria, they enter the open label phase (see figure 1 ). This establishes that they can tolerate 100 mg losartan (as described, see also Table 1 ) and there are no safety issues and hence reduces potential drop out secondary to either self-reported drug side effects, or clinically significant (as assessed by the Priniciple Investigator) deviation from protocol specified ranges of BP and blood measurement of electrolytes, creatinine and LFTs, after randomization. They then proceed to the baseline MRI and any patients who cannot have an MRI scan are then withdrawn. At this stage other baseline data is collected and randomization determines whether they are allocated to the active or placebo arm. There are then 6 further follow-up visits (hospital or home-based), mainly to ascertain safety and compliance though cognitive function is re-measured half way through the study at 6 months. At the 12 month visit they stop treatment and have a 4 day washout period before the repeat MRI scan and final assessments. (see table 1 for further details). At each visit, research staff will perform a capsule count and return any unused medication to the site pharmacy. Participants who have taken between 80-120% of the expected number of tablets will be considered compliant (70) . Non-compliance will be discussed with the Principal Investigator or delegated clinician to determine if it is appropriate to discontinue medication.\nIn most cases data will be collected at a research clinic at the local site but in some cases, home visits may be undertaken.

Previous data suggested a 12month atrophy rate among AD patients of 15.2 mL (SD 8.6 mL/year) and that a relative difference in between group atrophy rate of 25% is clinically meaningful. This is equivalent to an absolute difference in atrophy rate of 3.8 mL/year in total brain volume between the trial arms at 12 month follow up (76) , and equivalent to a standardised effect size of 0.44 SDs. We will randomise a total of 228 participants that will leave 182 subjects for analysis assuming 20% missing primary outcome data.

Similar analyses will be undertaken for the secondary outcomes (where p-values will be adjusted to account for multiple testing) and adjusting for any variables exhibiting marked imbalance at baseline to check that this does not influence the findings. There will be three additional types of analyses. First, we will undertake sensitivity analyses using both multiple imputation methods and simple methods making different assumptions to investigate the potential impact of missing data. Second, the effect of compliance with treatment will be investigated using allocation-respecting methods such as complier averaged causal effects (CACE) modelling. Third, appropriate interaction terms will be entered into the primary regression analyses for atrophy rates in order to conduct pre-specified subgroup analyses according to baseline volume, previous history of hypertension and treatment on anti-dementia drugs.

If the findings are supportive of a potential neuroprotective effect, then a larger phase III is likely to be required to provide a more precise estimate of the clinical and quality of life benefits.
