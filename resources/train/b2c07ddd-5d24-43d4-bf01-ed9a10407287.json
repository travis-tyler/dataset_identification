The lower IQ in southern Japanese islands could be attributable to warmer climates with less cognitive demand for more than fifteen hundred years."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It has become increasingly evident that human populations have different behavioral propensities and intelligence levels. Those who have adapted to the harsh northern climate worldwide are taller, more intelligent, more pro-social, less crime prone, and exhibit less fertility. This is said to be due to the more cognitively demanding long winter season (Lynn, 2006 (Lynn, , 2008 . In a similar and more speculative vein, the differential r/K theory (Rushton, 1988 (Rushton, , 1994 predicts that a more demanding cold climate has induced more intelligent and pro-social personality in general.\nWhile these differences in intelligence and behavioral traits were reported mainly with respect to racial categories in the twentieth century (Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Rushton, 1994) , even finer gradients of these personality traits from all over the world have been reported in the twenty-first century (Lynn, 2006 (Lynn, , 2010 (Lynn, , 2012 Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002 McDaniel, 2006) .\nSince nation states like Italy and Spain exhibit north-south differences in their behavioral propensities in the above expected directions, it is natural to expect the same gradients in other parts of the world. In Japan, although casual observation sometimes admits that regional behavioral and IQ differences result in relatively poor economic performances in the south, there exists only one paper suggesting regional IQ differences on Okinawa, the southernmost region (Agarie, 1959) . Serious inquiry on this topic has been effectively prohibited due to the political correctness and self-censorship in Japanese academia. Since various kinds of IQ tests such as the WISCor Progressive Matrices were no longer being conducted after the 1970s, this paper examines this conjecture by utilizing national achievement test scores from Japan's 47 prefectural populations.\nAdditionally, income returns to IQ premium are calculated at the prefectural level so that it could be included in the database of the robust IQ/income relationships reported to date (Jencks, 1972; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998 Murray, , 2002 Altonji & Pierret, 2001; Zax & Rees, 2002; Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The prefectural IQs have been calculated from the national achievement survey uniformly conducted by the government with 11 and 14 year old students. Students at these ages are in their last year of compulsory elementary and junior high school, respectively, in Japan. These tests have been motivated by the concern that Japanese students are losing competitiveness, which was suggested by the results of successive international achievement tests conducted in Japan(PISA: Program for International Student Assessment; TIMSS: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study; PIRLS: Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study). The national achievement surveys in2007, 2008 and2009 were conducted with more than 2,400,000 students, including all of the 11-and 14-year-old students of each year. The surveys in 2010 and 2012 were conducted with randomly selected samples of the 11 and 14 year old students: and these samples consisted of about 40% of the whole student population: (a little over 1 million students) each year. This survey was not conducted in 2011 due to the Great East Japan Earthquake. The test scores of the 14-year-old students were analyzed in this paper because more advanced test material should reflect higher g loadings. The analysis utilized the simplest index of prefectural IQs, the sum of the math subtest scores and verbal subtest scores for those five years (full score = 482, average = 323.5, standard deviation = 102.9). These scores were obtained from more than 4 million students, which account for more than 3% of the whole population. Since these tests were highly stylized and very similar to PISA, TIMSS and PIRLS, IQ estimates thus obtained should be considered robust and reliable (Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Frey & Detterman, 2004; Hunt & Wittmann, 2008; Lynn & Meisenberg, 2010; Lynn & Mikke, 2007; Rindermann, 2007 Rindermann, , 2008 .\nStudent height records have been published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and this study used the averages from 2002 to 2012. These data include average height and weight for students aged 6 to 17 nationwide. Since boys' and girls' heights were perfectly parallel and utterly unchanged for these 11 years, only 17-year-old boys' heights were used in the analysis.\nSkin color data were obtained from the third largest cosmetic company in Japan, Pola Cosmetics (2012) . The dataset used was obtained by staining the epidermal melanosomes in cheek keratinocytes of 60,000 subjects nationwide. This is a very scientifically accurate indicator of the melanin amount on the skin. These scores were normalized to a mean score of 50, standard deviation 10 (the higher, the whiter).\nAs for criminality, the homicide rates and suicide rates per 100,000 were averaged for the 10 years from 2003 to 2012. Data were published in the crime statistical dataset by the National Police Agency. Infant mortality, divorce rates and birth rates per 100,000 were published by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (Statistics of Population Change). The 10 year averages from 2002 to 2011 were used in the analyses.\nThe data from 47 Japanese prefectures for average per capita income from 1996 to 2009 was given by the Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, and these 14 yearly data sets were averaged. Since income distributions have a fat tail and are nearly log-normal, we log-transformed these incomes for normality.\nTo compute the returns to IQ, it is essential to take into consideration the fact that many Japanese students who grow up in rural area go to universities located in cities and then tend to stay in the metropolitan area to work. To capture this productivity bias, data on the ratio of productive population (RPP: defined as a ratio of the population 15 to 65 years old population to the total population) were obtained and averaged from 2002 to 2011. These data have been published by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. These data are shown in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In Table 2 , except for infant mortality, all variables correlate significantly with the prefectural latitude. People living in the northern part of Japan are taller, more intelligent, and less crime prone. They divorce less often, have lower fertility.\nLatitude is correlated with IQ (r = 0.44) and height (r = 0.70). From many collected IQ measurements, the Japanese average IQ has been estimated to be 104, which is slightly lower than the Chinese and Korean averages (Lynn & Vanhanen, 2006; Lynn, 2008; Lynn & Meisenberg, 2010; Lynn & Vanhanen, 2012) . Assuming that the Japanese population has a standard deviation of 15 as in England, north-south IQ difference is estimated to be 11 points, with the prefecture with the highest IQ prefecture (Akita) having 107 while the one with the lowest (Okinawa) having 96. This is surprising in that it challenges the much-touted homogeneity of Japanese people.\nLatitude and height are correlated at 0.70, more than between latitude and IQ. The difference is at most 2.6 cm, or about one inch. To see if these results depend on some possible outliers, Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau were calculated. Latitudes correlate with height at 0.72 and 0.71, and height and IQ at 0.24 and 0.43. Other variables also showed the same directional coefficients as Table 1 , while some of the values were slightly lower than Pearson's. Together, these analyses suggest that the correlations above have validity.\nThe regions facing the Korean peninsula or the Asian continent have greater snowfall and are several degrees colder than those facing the Pacific Ocean. This might be the reason that people in the former prefectures have lighter skin than those in the latter. Skin whiteness is positively correlated with latitude (r = 0.47) and also with IQ (r = 0.42), as studies based on both theoretical and empirical grounds (Meisenberg, 2004; Rushton & Templer, 2012; Templer & Arikawa, 2006; Templer & Rushton, 2011) . It would be also due to genetic admixture with south east Asians from the sea route, although there exists no such description in the written history that dates back to 1500 years ago.\nIn keeping with the previous research findings, IQ correlates negatively with homicide rate (Wilson & Herrnstein, 1985; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Templer, Connelly, Lester, Arikawa, & Mancuso, 2007; Lynn, 2008; Rushton & Templer, 2009) , and fertility (Meisenberg, 2009 (Meisenberg, , 2010 Vining, 1982) .\nIQ has a positive correlation with IQ (Voracek, 2004 (Voracek, , 2009 ). However, after partialing out the influence from latitude, the partial correlation of IQ/homicide became \u22120.079. Hence, it seems more appropriate to conclude that weaker sunlights in the northern prefectures tend to make people feel depressed, which results in higher suicide rates. Also infant mortality does The original test score has standard deviation of 102.9 for the whole samples. \nnot correlate with other variables, presumably because Japan has well-developed medical institutions. Medical treatments are readily accessible for relatively poor people thanks to a long-established, nationally inclusive medical insurance system. Note the similarity of the gradients of these variables from north to south as shown in Fig. 1 .\nIQ and income correlate at 0.25, which is not statistically significant. However, as described earlier, many high school graduates from rural prefectures go to universities in urban prefectures and spend the rest of their lives there. This movement has resulted in less people productive ages in rural areas (ages 15-65). Although it is obvious that young people do not all begin to work at 15 years old (in fact, they typically do so at age of 18 or 22), nor are people older than 65 necessarily retired from their jobs, RPP can be a crude dummy variable of how the local populations are constructed. Partialing out RPP, the correlation coefficient between IQ and average income became 0.51 (p b 0.001). This figure is much higher than the 0.27 from the meta-analysis of 8 studies by Ng, Eby, Sorenson, and Feldman (2005) , the 0.20-0.27 from Strenze (2007) , and the 0.32-0.37 from Irwing and Lynn (2006) .\nTo analyze the relationship between IQ and income in detail, average per capita income was regressed on IQ and RPP. Coefficients of regression were given in Table 3 .\nA 1% increase in RPP raises the income level by 4.1%. RPP statistics range from 59% (Shimane) to 69% (Tokyo), the average being 63%. If we assume that 60% of the population work, a 1% increase in RPP would raise the average income by 1.7%, which is less than half of the estimate above. This suggests that there exist huge structural gaps in regional productivities among prefectures. In fact, metropolitan regions enjoy much higher average incomes.\nWe can calculate that 1 IQ point raises their average income by 2.5%. This estimate is in line with the 2-3% given by Jencks (1972) and Murray (1998 Murray ( , 2002 , but higher than the 0.8-1.5% reported by Altonji and Pierret (2001) and Zax and Rees (2002) for the U.S. and Alderman, Behrman, Ross, and Sabot (1996) for Pakistan. However, these estimates are well below the 4.7% return obtained from Lynn (2010) . Since Lynn did not directly estimate the return, we conducted a regression analysis using 12 regions in Italy based on his paper. The result is shown in Table 4 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Many people worldwide seem to have an image of Japan as a highly homogeneous nation. However, the Japanese islands were initially populated by the hunter-gatherer Jomon people (Y haplogroup C1, C3 & D1) and experienced a great deal of immigration from the Korean peninsula and mainland China from 2900 to 1500 years ago. These incoming Yayoi people (Y haplogroup O2b from Korea and O3 from China) brought wet-rice agriculture and bronze and iron tools to the islands. Because of these cultural advancements, they had shown much more fecundity and have in number dominated the native Jomon people. There still exists a genetic cline from the Western Yayoi population in the Eastern Jomon population in Japan (Hammer et al., 2006) . Haplogroups, C1, C3 and D2 are most common among the Ainu people in the northmost Japan (almost 100%) and in the Okinawans in southmost Japan (about 60%),while the western regions closer to the Korean peninsula are more densely populated by Yayoi descendant haplogroup of O2b and O3 (60-70%).\nSince the continental Northeast Asians (Han Chinese and Korean) have a higher intelligence compared to the rest of the Eurasian population, it would be natural to assume that these Yayoi people were more intelligent. This conjecture is based on the facts: 1. The fossil evidence shows that the Yayoi people"}, {"section_title": "IQ", "text": "Height Homicide rate 97 -108 (Greenwich IQ) 160.9 -171.7 (centimeter) 14.7 -5.6 (/100,000 a year) Fig. 1 . IQ, height and homicide rate in Japan (light blue-gray-bright red). were 5-8 cm (2-3 in.) taller than the Jomon; 2. Modern-day Koreans are about 3 cm (1.2 in.) taller than the Japanese; 3. The IQs of Chinese and Korean people have continuously outscored that of Japanese people (estimated to be 106 and 105, respectively). Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the prefectures closer to the continent exhibit higher intelligence than those in the Northeast. However, this tendency was not observed and instead there exists a simple intelligence gradient from south to north. This may be due to an almost perfect admixture within the last 1500 year (about more than 60 generations) as far as genes for taller stature and higher intelligence are concerned, as well as the selective pressures of the last 1500 years of civilization, which have been strong enough to reshape the original east-west IQ gradient into the current north-south cline. This conclusion would be in line with the Hawks, Wang, Cochran, Harpending, and Moyzis (2007)idea of ever-accelerating human evolution. They insist that more and more beneficial mutations swept populations, after the advent of agricultural civilizations with metallurgy, letters and complex hierarchical organizations. The Japanese northsouth gradient in height and intelligence can be evidence that modern humans have evolved to higher intelligence within the last two millennia."}]
