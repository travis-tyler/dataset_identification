[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by immune cells and other cell types such as microglia throughout the brain. Higher levels of IL-6 in older adults have been cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with physical and cognitive impairment, as well as increased dementia risk. The association between IL-6 levels and structural and functional brain changes is less clear. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between IL-6 concentrations and cortical thinning with aging. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were analyzed for 121 older subjects (M = 69.3; SD = 7.3; range = 56.1 -85.9 yrs) who were repeatedly tested over an average period of 7.5 yrs, and who remained non-demented for the entire follow-up period. The Freesurfer longitudinal processing stream was utilized for image processing, and IL-6 measures were based on serum ELISA assays averaged across time points. Results showed that higher mean IL-6 concentrations were associated with accelerated annual rates of cortical thinning in the inferior temporal poles bilaterally. Additional pronounced regions of IL-6 -accelerated thinning included the transverse frontopolar gyri within the left hemisphere, and subcentral gyrus and sulcus within the right hemisphere. Our results indicate that sustained high levels of the inflammatory biomarker IL-6 are associated with regionally increased rates of age-related cortical thinning. These data build on previous findings that link to chronic disease and demonstrate one mechanism through which high levels of inflammation may have adverse effects on physical and cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cytokines are small protein molecules produced by immune cells aimed at regulating several aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity.\nCytokines are also produced by a number of other cells types, including hepatocytes, adipocytes, myocytes and brain microglia, for reasons that are still not known. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and an important mediator in any inflammatory response, so that all patients affected by overt inflammatory disease have high IL-6 levels [1] . Moreover, in inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis [2] and Crohn's disease [3] , elevated IL-6 levels are a marker of disease severity and activity.\nIn the absence of physiologic stress, the expression of IL-6 is normally low in young adults, but levels increase with age and with age-related disease [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, elevated levels of IL-6 have been linked to age-related cognitive decline [7] , increased dementia risk [8] , physical disability [5] and mortality [8, 9] .\nOf note, the mechanism by which high levels of IL-6 are associated with high risk of physical and especially, cognitive disability have not been elucidated. For example, whether older adults with high IL-6 develop structural brain changes with age has not been investigated.\nCerebral changes such as reduced brain volumes and the thinning of gray matter are known to occur as part of the normal aging process [10] [11] [12] [13] . Withstanding the absence of age-related neurological disease, the cortex begins to experience a global thinning by middle age, with some regions such as the prefrontal cortex more affected than others [14, 15] . Importantly, structural brain changes of this nature have been linked to poorer cognitive [16] and health [17] outcomes.\nIn older adults, prior research has shown associations between inflammatory biomarkers and brain MRI measures. For example, IL-6 has been found to be associated with decreased total brain volume [18] , cortical atrophy [although note as part of a chemokinecytokine factor; 19], and increased white matter hyperintensities [20] . However, these findings have been based on cross-sectional associations between IL-6 and MRI measures.\nIn this study we aimed at expanding our understanding of the relationship between IL-6 levels and cortical brain changes in two important ways. Firstly, we assessed whether elevated IL-6 levels are associated with excessive cerebral cortical thinning over time. Secondly, whereas most of the previously cited studies have studied the relationship between IL-6 and neuroimaging at one point in time, we used longitudinal MRI data spanning on average seven and a half years, and collected in a large sample of well-characterized non-demented older adults from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Given prior research indicating a primarily deleterious impact of IL-6 -indexed inflammation on brain anatomy, we hypothesized that higher sustained levels of IL-6 would be associated with a thinner cortex at baseline and an accelerated rate of cortical thinning over time."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We used data acquired from the BLSA neuroimaging study (BLSA-NI) [13] , a subset of the larger BLSA study of longitudinal changes in physical and cognitive health [21] .

The minimum detectable level of IL-6 was less than 0.70 pg/ml. Samples were taken at approximately two years intervals and averaged across all visits (Table 1) and thickness estimates [31] . Specifically, an unbiased within-subject template space and image [32] was created using robust, inverse consistent registration [33] . Several processing steps, such as skull stripping, Talairach transforms, atlas registration as well as spherical surface maps and parcellations were then initialized with common information from the within-subject template, significantly increasing reliability and statistical power [31] .

These maps are thresholded to show rates of cortical thinning at 0.001-0.008 mm per year.

Figure 1D This is perhaps not surprising given that neuroinflammatory evolution serves to promote both neurodegeneration and regeneration processes [36] . For example, in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 35-85 yrs, Jefferson et al.
