Standard (commonly used) MR imaging methods include high resolution structural scanning (T1 or T2 contrast) for brain morphometry changes, functional changes (BOLD) to study the dynamic changes in the brain related to a stimulus or in the resting condition, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and derived fractional anisotropy (FA) maps for monitoring white matter integrity and connectivity.\nIncreasingly clinical trials are adopting multiple sites/centers to increase their subject pool and to expedite the studies. Data sharing is another effective approach to increase the subject pool in populations that are difficult to recruit or require large numbers, eg. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Multidisciplinary Advances in Pelvic Pain (MAPP), and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (fcon 1000). Longitudinal studies following the progression of disease have to consider the variability induced by software and hardware upgrades to the MRI scanner. Additional complications arise when incorporating scanners from different vendors, field strengths, software levels, and coil architecture. Careful investigation of the test-retest reliability and image quality of inter-or intra-scanner neuroimaging measurements are critical in the statistical analysis and interpretation of results. Previously, such studies have focused on a single imaging methodology specific metric: e.g. Cortical thickness based on T1 (Wonderlick et al., 2009), temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (Parrish et al., 2000) and FA values based on DTI (Vollmar et al, 2010) .\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for quantifying the reproducibility and image quality for multimodal neuroimaging data (structural, BOLD and DTI) collected across identical scanners and following a major hardware repair (gradient coil replacement). The uniqueness of our study is (1) we examined the three standard brain imaging methods (T1, BOLD, DTI); (2) we examined the impact of a major hardware repair (gradient coil); and (3) we tested a battery of metrics for image quality and reliability assessment applicable to local and multi-center imaging trials."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Experimental Design", "text": "Six healthy volunteers (five males, one female, mean age in years 2664) participated in this study.

DTI images were also visually checked to ensure there was no slice drop-out due to excessive motion. Motion during the T1 scan often affects the background intensity anterior to head since the phase encoding direction is from anterior to posterior. To detect motion during the T1 scan, the ratio of background intensity between a region anterior to head (as sensitive measure to motion) and a region superior to eye (as reference), were calculated. Both regions contain 8000 voxels. A ratio larger than one raises concerns for motion and needs more careful visual inspection.

A stretch factor larger or smaller than 1 indicates expansion or contraction required to register each individual to the template respectively. Two templates were used for comparison; one was the 1 mm brain template from the Montreal Neurological Institute provided with FSL (MNI152_T1_1 mm).

We explored the tSNR within two functional networks, the default-mode network (DMN) and the attention network (ATT), shown in panel A of Figure 1 .

[8] and Jovicich et al. [9] examined the scanner upgrade's (from Sonata to an Avanto) effect on reliability of T1-derived measurements, e.g. cortical thickness and subcortical, ventricular and intracranial brain volumes. The upgrade included replacement of the 1.5T magnet, the RF and gradient system, and software. They showed that pooling data across the scanner upgrade did not degrade the measurement reproducibility. Recently Kruggel et al. [10] examined impact of scanner hardware and imaging protocol on image quality and segmented compartments (CSF, GM and WM) volume precision in the ADNI cohort. Image quality was rated by the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), higher SNR corresponds to better image quality. They reported that although SNR is dependent on hardware, software, environmental and subject parameters, the SNR is mostly dependent on the scanner hardware and explained up to 74% of variance. For compartment volumes, they reported the precision of repeated scans of the same subject on different scanners with different field strengths and vendors is much worse than that on the same scanner over time.\nIn the present study, we focused on the differences between two identical scanners sited the same way and the effect of a major repair (gradient coil replacement) on morphometry measures (brain volumes and stretch factor). Our results show the metrics proposed are highly reproducible for volumetric data and when the data are pooled to a standard template. However when using a study specific template, the native anatomic data were sensitive to geometric distortions introduced by the gradient replacement and between different scanners. It is not surprising that differences between same scanner before and after hardware repair were smaller than differences between the two different scanners. Note that these differences in scale are far less than 1% and did not alter volumetric measures in the ROIs tested."}, {"section_title": "BOLD", "text": "For task-based fMRI studies, a diverse collection of methods have been used to assess fMRI task-induced activation reliability (see review by Bennett et al. [11] , including activated cluster overlap and Intra-class correlation). For resting-state fMRI, the test-retest variability of the resting state network has been examined by Shehzad et al. [12] using seed-based resting state networks and by Zuo et al. [13] using ICA-based networks. Temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) is an important factor influencing fMRI reliability in both task and resting state studies that represents an overall measure of image quality. In the case of resting state fMRI, the best way to quantify ''signal'' and ''noise'' is not clear and depends on the method of data analysis. We propose the use of tSNR to indicate temporal stability of the BOLD data for both task and resting state analysis. The rationale for using two resting state networks as ROIs for calculating tSNR instead of anatomical ROIs is that signals within the same functional network exhibit similar/coherent spontaneous fluctuations and registration issues while small anatomical ROIs may introduce additional variation which can be large enough to obscure the scanner induced variations. Default-mode and attention networks were selected for their reliable and complementary nature [14, 15] .\nOur results showed that the measurement error caused by different scanners is small relative to noise introduced by different subjects. This demonstrates that the BOLD data were not sensitive to the differences between conditions using the tSNR in resting state networks. A potential metric for resting state data is the ratio of connectivity strength within a known network divided by the connectivity strength between a functional irrelevant network. However unlike T1 and DTI measures, the strength of the connectivity heavily depends on the physiological/cognitive status of the subject during the data collection, therefore it may not be a suitable metric for testing reliability of the imaging hardware and environmental changes."}, {"section_title": "DTI", "text": "Using ROI-based analysis, Vollmar et al. [16] showed that with two identical 3T scanners there was a consistently low variation of FA measures between scans for both intra-and inter-site rescanning. Using a similar ROI-based analysis, we showed that the FA values are highly reproducible likely due to the close proximately so that they share the same physical environment and resources as well as the identical installation design. In contrast, using whole brain Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and voxelbased analysis, Takao et al. [17] showed inter-scanner variability and a software upgrade (not hardware upgrade) introduced a significant bias on longitudinal (1 year) FA comparisons. The difficulty in interpreting Takao's data is that these changes could be real or introduced by the software. Any sort of adjustment made by the service engineer during a software upgrade or tuneup could alter these gradient demanding data. In our study we measured the different conditions over a short two week period to avoid these complications.\nFollowing Vollmar et al. [16] , whole brain white matter, SCC, RFWM, and RUF were chosen in the current study as they represented four kinds of fiber characteristics in white matter: the fibers are mainly parallel and densely-packed in SCC, orientationcrossed in RFWM, and small in RUF. The ROI representing SCC was defined carefully in the standard template as shown in panel A (i) of Figure 2 to make sure after projecting back to the native space of each subject it remained only in the WM regions. The mean FA values of the aforementioned three ROIs and whole brain white matter were comparable but in general lower than those reported by Vollmar et al., which might be due to the differences in the ROI selection, scanner type, field strength, coils, the number of directions, data analysis and individual differences. At all scales of assessment, our data did not find any differences across scanners or following the gradient coil replacement for either FA or MD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We achieved consistent measures for T1 brain structure volumes, stretch factor, tSNR for resting state BOLD signals and mean FA/MD values in specific ROIs and the whole brain between two identical 3T scanners, and before and after gradient coil replacement. These findings provide statistical validations for conducting longitudinal work on multiple systems that are identical. Furthermore, even a major hardware repair did not alter the metrics for all three types of neuroimaging data. It is important that the proposed metrics be used for routine quality control for all data collected to identify any issues related to hardware, software or subjects. Finally, in order to use these metrics in a multi-center study, one would have to employ the ''human phantom'' approach resulting in someone travelling to all of the sites. A traveling phantom may be appropriate for short term multi-center trials but not ideal for longitudinal studies as changes are expected in the ''human phantom'' that could complicate the interpretation of the results.
