The hippocampus then represented as an open boundary genus one surface, i.e., a cylinder, and was conformally mapped to a rectangle. To model the lateral ventricular surface, we automatically located and introduced three cuts, based on the topology of the lateral ventricles, in which several horns are joined together at the ventricular \"atrium\" or \"trigone\". With holomorphic flow segmentation (Wang et al., 2011) , each lateral ventricular surface was automatically partitioned into 3 pieces . Although surface geometry is widely variable across subjects, these zero point locations are stable and intrinsically determined by the surface conformal structures, and the resulting surface partition into component meshes is stable. We registered the hippocampal and lateral ventricular surfaces across subjects using a constrained harmonic map."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion:", "text": "Our method consists of automated surface extraction, conformal parameterization and partitioning, harmonic mapping, and tensor statistics.
