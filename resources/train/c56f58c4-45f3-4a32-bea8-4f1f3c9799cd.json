For accompanying me on the many rides, runs, and yoga sessions that have helped me keep my sanity throughout this process, I thank all of my workout buddies -Alexx, Lauryn, Shannon, Serena, Josh, Celia, Melanie, Noelle, Janis, Mary, Lara, Gustavo, and Rebecca H. Thanks for sweating it out with me. I extend my gratitude to the fantastic faculty, students, and staff in the higher education and gender and women's studies departments for building up my theoretical and analytical thinking and for providing such a fruitful space for academic development and social awareness.                         In this study, I used the mixed-methods approach of critical discourse and critical quantitative analyses to understand how the pipeline model ideology has become embedded within academic discourse, research, and data surrounding STEM education and work and to provide alternatives for quantitative analysis. Using critical theory as a lens, I first conducted a critical discourse analysis of contemporary STEM workforce studies with a particular eye to pipeline ideology. Next, I used that analysis to inform logistic regression analyses of the 2006 SESTAT data. This quantitative analysis compared and contrasted different ways of thinking about identity and retention. Overall, the findings of this study show that many subjective choices are made in the construction of the large-scale datasets used to inform much national science and engineering policy and that these choices greatly influence likelihood of retention outcomes."}, {"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES -Continued", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the 2011 State of the Union address, deemed \"our generation's Sputnik moment,\" President Obama highlighted the role of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and STEM education in helping America \"win the future\" against the global competition (NPR, 2011). President Obama praised STEM innovation and very clearly articulated that the importance of educating American children is so that they can take on scientific jobs on behalf of the nation. This global competiveness discourse views education as a means to producing large numbers of STEM workers and stretches back to the Cold War (Lucena, 2005;Metcalf, 2007). In the 1970s, as lingering Cold War fears paired with emphasis on technological competition, the National Science Foundation developed the pipeline model underlying, though not named in, President Obama's speech. This model was used to quantify and predict the number of scientists and engineers necessary to fulfill national competitiveness needs by depicting a linear set of steps through various educational stages required to become a scientist or engineer as follows: \"Q 1 + \u2211f i + \u2211f o = Q 2, Where Q 1 = the number of people in stock at the beginning of the period, \u2211f i = the sum of flows into the stock, \u2211f o = the sum of flows out of the stock, and Q 2 = the number of people in stock at the end of period\" (Lucena, 2005, p. 105;National Research Council, 1986, p. 29). Those not \"flowing\" along the prescribed sequence are considered \"leaks.\" Certain points are seen as particularly \"leaky,\" especially for U.S. women and minorities (Blickenstaff, 2005;Blum, 2006;Camp, 2002;Kuck, 2001;Metcalf, 2010;. Despite criticism, the leaky pipeline model has grown in popularity since its inception to symbolize issues surrounding women and people of color in STEM by focusing almost entirely on the supply-side. For example, in a November 2010 report entitled, \"Keeping Women in the Science Pipeline, \" Mason, Goulden, and Frasch explain that Premier science largely depends on the quality pool of future scientists. For this reason, the United States has made a major effort over the past 30 years to attract more outstanding U.S. students, particularly women, into research science. Women have risen to the challenge\u2026 [and] now represent a large part of the talent pool for research science, but many data sources indicate that they are more likely than men to \"leak\" out of the pipeline in the sciences before obtaining tenure at a college or university (p. 1). They frame retention issues as a problem of workforce supply that puts the U.S. at risk of \"losing our edge\" as a global leader in science (p. 2). With all of these pools of women trickling out of the academic research science pipeline, what is the nation to do to plug up the leaks so women cannot get out? Participation in science, when framed this way, is not about, for example, fostering scientific work that addresses social issues faced in the U.S. or even in U.S. relations with other nations. It is about \"attracting\" and \"keeping\" bodies in science to further highly capitalistic and competitiveness goals. Moreover, the model is expanding as a way to understand retention issues in higher education more generally. For example, Seidman (2005), in a chapter on minority student retention, explains why pre-degree exit from universities by racial and ethnic minorities is a concern in terms of \"consequences of the leaking pipeline\" (p.3). The primary consequences offered are economic in nature, including loss of funds by the government, society, students, and colleges who invested in the failed degree attainment of the student, student loan debt, loss of tuition to the institution, loss of income to the businesses surrounding the institution that the un-retained student would no longer frequent 1 , and the loss of occupational and financial attainment that the student may have had with the degree. Again, retention in this case is not about helping students reach whatever educational goals and purposes they might have. When framed by the pipeline model, education retention becomes about keeping students at an institution for capitalistic purposes that are more likely to serve the economic interests of the government, businesses, state, and institution over those of the student."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "This largely quantitative and statistical pipeline model has been the basis of recruitment and retention efforts aimed at women and people of color in STEM for the last forty years; yet the problems of inequity, underrepresentation, and STEM workforce shortage are still proclaimed in the discourse of much current research and programming (Blickenstaff, 2005;Blum, 2006;Camp, 2002;Kuck, 2001;Metcalf, 2007;. Solutions to the leaky pipeline are to patch the leaks and/or increase the input and hope for more output, oversimplifying what constitutes participation in STEM and leaving the pipes themselves unchanged (Lucena, 2000;Lucena, 2005;Metcalf, 2007).

How do these studies discuss identity factors, particularly gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, disability, and class? b. What discourses about workforce shortages are seen in the studies? c. Who is targeted by the studies, for what purposes, and with what outcomes? 2) What assumptions are embedded within the national level surveys and data used by the majority of these studies? a. What data sets are used and how is the data collected? b. What assumptions underlie the collection and measurement of various identity and demographic factors? c. What counts as STEM and what does not? 3) How might alternative assumptions produce different interpretations of the survey data? a. What alternative ways might the survey data be analyzed or interpreted? b. How do alternative constructs for or levels of disaggregation of identity measures influence statistical retention outcomes? c. How do alternative measures of what counts as STEM influence statistical retention outcomes? d. How do alternative measures of retention compare/contrast with pipeline leaks as a measure of retention? The first research question considers the ways in which the pipeline metaphor and its inherent assumptions have survived and become increasingly pervasive in academic studies over the last 40 years despite a wide range of critiques. Drawing on varies bodies of critical theory, this question looks at the reproduction of pipeline discourse and ideology as well as connections between multiple discourses and ideologies, such as the pipeline metaphor's connection to supply and demand and neoliberal beliefs in free market solutions to social ills. Additionally, this question critically considers the perpetuation of problematic representations of identity through the pipeline model in STEM workforce scholarship. The second research question is closely related to the first and continues this line of inquiry with an epistemological lens that turns to the national level surveys and databases that form the basis of many contemporary quantitative studies on STEM The final research question asks how statistical results might vary under different assumptions. In particular, it considers how different assumptions about what it means to be \"retained\" might produce different models for who is engaging in STEM work and how different assumptions about how to measure and account for identity might result in different retention outcomes. In particular, this question seeks to compare pipeline assumptions to various alternatives."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Dissertation", "text": "This dissertation is organized into six chapters.

In most dissertations, the theoretical or conceptual framework that guides the study is presented with the literature review and the literature review provides background information necessary for understanding the study. The literature review for this dissertation, however, is more than just contextual background information. The literature itself is a part of the qualitative analysis. As such, the theoretical framework is presented before the literature review and acts as a lens through which I analyzed the literature related to the STEM workforce and the surveys and databases that underlie much of that literature. This framework also guided the development of the research questions, influenced my methodologies, and shaped the quantitative analysis presented in Chapter Five. The theoretical and epistemological bases of this project lie in the interstices between various viewpoints that are often positioned oppositionally and even hierarchically. As critical and queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (2003) has argued, critical work need not engage in the \"drama of exposure.\" Instead of positioning other scholarship as something that is \"beneath\" or \"behind\" or even necessary to move \"beyond,\" she suggests \"beside\" as an alternative spatial descriptor: Beside is an interesting preposition also because there's nothing very dualistic about it; a number of elements may lie alongside one another, though not an infinity of them. Beside permits a spacious agnosticism about several linear logics that enforce dualistic thinking: noncontradiction or the law of the excluded middle, cause versus effect, subject versus object. Its interest does not, however, depend on a fantasy of metonymically egalitarian or even pacific relations\u2026Beside comprises a wide range of desiring, identifying, representing, repelling, paralleling, differentiating, rivaling, leaning, twisting, mimicking, withdrawing, attracting, aggressing, warping and other relations (p. 8). Working \"beside\" multiple theoretical and epistemological positionalities does not mean that one must take up a romanticized and benevolent form of communion with other scholars, nor does it mean that critical engagement with such work is unnecessary. Like Sedgwick, feminist science studies scholar Donna Haraway (1991) argues that the gap between feminist technophobia and technophilia offers a space ripe for critical thinking about the linkages between technology, capitalism, militarism, patriarchy, and stratified relations and the possibility of technofeminism. With these two scholars as exemplars, I seek to critically engage in and work beside multiple theoretical, epistemological, and methodological positionalities, including the structural and poststructural, qualitative and quantitative, and the so-called \"hard\" and \"soft\" sciences. In so doing, I will draw on work from several branches of critical theory, including feminist science studies. Here, I provide an overview of how this body of theoretical work has informed my research design, epistemological view, research questions, and positionality."}, {"section_title": "Critical Theory", "text": "Originating in the 1920s with scholarship coming from the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany, critical theory builds on Marxist critiques of capitalism to offer broader social and cultural critiques (Baez, 2007;Habermas, 1971;Macey, 2000;Stage, 2007). Critical theory is \"self-conscious, self-critical and non-objectifying\" (Macey, 2000, p. 75) and aims to reveal \"hidden power arrangements, oppressive practices, and ways of thinking\u2026for the purpose of changing society to make it more just\" (Baez, 2007, p. 19). Thus, critical theory stems from a history of emancipatory and social-transformative goals, is particularly attentive to language, knowledge production, power, and oppression, and how oppression is reproduced. As such, has a number of intertwined areas including (post)Marxist, feminist, queer, race, disability, postcolonial, postmodern, and poststructural theories (e.g. Berlant & Warner, 2000;Butler, 1993;Crenshaw, 1994;Sedgwick, 1992;Soto, 2005). Much of critical theory sees the relationship between concepts, such as gender, and subjects, such as people, as unstable, fluid, and historically, socially, and politically mediated and constructed (Baez, 2007;Soto, 2005). In this section, I provide some examples of how critical theory has informed my research. These examples are by no means exhaustive, but are meant to illustrate the usefulness of critical theory as a framework for this project. Viewing the pipeline model through the lens of ideology that pays attention to its discursive and material existence provides a way to see through the illusion to the underlying power dynamics and oppressive beliefs that allow for its reproduction. My third research question, how might alternative assumptions (e.g. about identity, what counts as STEM, how to measure 'retention') produce different interpretations of the data? not only seeks to disrupt pipeline ideology and work toward change, but draws on another portion of Althusser's work related to ideological subject formation (Althusser, 1971). In theorizing ideology, Althusser develops an additional concept of interpellation to explain the complex ways in which individuals are marked as proper subjects. He uses the example of a police officer hailing, \"Hey, you there!\" to which \"the hailed individual will turn around. By this mere one-hundred-and-eightydegree physical conversion, he becomes a subject\u2026 [b]ecause he has recognized that the hail was 'really' address to him, and that 'it was really him who was hailed' (and not someone else)\" (p. 174, emphasis in original). He argues that ISAs (always already) \"hail\" individuals as subjects to enforce particular ways of thinking about their relations to the conditions of production. This hailing produces particular actions in accordance with these ways of thinking and that create a contradictory sense of freedom: \"the individual is interpellated as a (free) subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject; i.e. in order that he shall (freely) accept his subjection\" (p. 182). According to Althusser, this interpellation and hailing of proper \"good\" subjects often functions on its own without the violent or forceful intervention of the State, except for the occasional \"bad\" subject, because of this illusion of freedom. He argues that \"individuals are always-already interpellated by ideology as subjects\" (p. 175). Performance by and about individuals, as well as relations their relations to others and to social institutions, continually instantiates them as subjects, even before birth (Althusser, 1971;Butler, 1993;. Surveys, particularly digital surveys, lay the foundation for proper subjects by detailing the categories that with which an individual may freely select to identify. These categories hail individuals as subjects in very particular ways. For example, the first question on many surveys asks for a participant's gender, with the \"acceptable\" categories of response most often being male or female. Participants who answer the call enter into a performance of marking a checkbox indicating that they acquiesce to the dominant ideology that their gender can be represented by fixed, binary, and biologicallybased categories. Those who do not answer the call mark themselves as \"bad\" subjects and, in the digital case, as non-subjects who may not proceed with the survey. They are rendered marginal, other, and even \"abject 2 \" without the forceful intervention of the State, despite that gender is fluid (Butler, 1993;Spivak, 1988). Critical theory, then, allows for an analysis that looks between the lines of surveys and existing data to see who and what counts as the proper subjects of STEM and to suggest new possibilities for understanding the \"real\" experiences of those who do not necessarily fit into the ideological illusion. While Althusser's theory of ideology (and critical Marxist theory in general) specifically focuses on economic class as the site of repression and other critical theorists (e.g. Butler, 1993;Butler, 1997;Chow, 2002) have critiqued his work for being overly simplistic, it can and has been extended to conceptualize other forms of ideological reproduction, such as those surrounding gender (as the survey example above illustrates), race, ethnicity, ability, and sexuality (Crenshaw, 1994;Omi & Winant, 1994;Spivak, 2003). Much contemporary critical theory argues for the importance of considering the inseparable and complex intricacies, histories, and contexts among identities, particularly those that have traditionally been theorized and researched individually (Baez, 2007;Crenshaw, 1994;Ferdman, 1999;Sedgwick, 1992;Soto, 2005). While some critical theorists call for an intersectional view of identity (e.g. Crenshaw, 1994;Ferdman, 1999), others argue that \"it has become clear that race, class, sexuality, and gender -to name the usual categories -are much too complex, porous, mutually constitutive, and dynamic to be apprehended through the spatial metaphor of intersection\" (Soto, 2005, p. 241). Soto (2005) explains that intersectionality, as a lens, \"can end up stabilizing (not to mention rendering equivalent) the discursive and material concepts brought into single view, making it difficult not only to question their apparentness in the first place but to apprehend the dynamic transformations of power relations and espistemologies\" that accompany the discourse of identity categorization (p. 241). Critical theory encourages reading through ideology for hidden subtexts, important omissions, and answers to questions unposed in order to disrupt, destabilize, and denaturalize those ideologies. In describing the usefulness of such critical reading, Soto (2005) writes that queer reading or reading like a queer conscientiously illuminates the iterations, tautologies, and narrative devices that occlude the constructedness of -as well as the labor entailed in producingnormativity (in relation to, for instance, citizenship, sexuality, racialization, or literary conventions). Moreover, queering can appropriate the most intractable foundations of normativity and transgressively infuse them with innovative queer meanings (p. 238). In this dissertation, I draw on this critical theoretical work to challenge the ideologies underlying the pipeline model as they relate to gender, race, citizenship, global capitalism, neoliberalism, family, normativity, and constructions of scientific work using STEM workforce studies, surveys, and data as texts for critical discourse, rhetorical, methodological, and statistical analyses."}, {"section_title": "Feminist Science Studies", "text": "Applying critical theoretical lenses to science as a social and cultural text, feminist science studies has greatly informed this project epistemologically and is integrated into its entire design as I, too, turn a critical eye to STEM and the study of STEM. The feminism in feminist science studies, for me, is not just about the study of women or gender, but involves the broader study of entangled and inseparable systems of power, oppression, and subject formation. Feminist science studies scholars have considered the history of hierarchy, oppression, and exclusion within science and engineering (Oldenziel, 2004;Hacker, 1989;Rosser, 1995;Tobias, 1993). This body of work also raises questions about bias and knowledge construction in science and engineering scholarship (Cowan, 1983;Fausto-Sterling, 1996;Fausto-Sterling, 2000;Martin, 1992), problematizes the very notion of objectivity, interrogates the gendered, classed, sexualized and racialized assumptions underlying such work, and questions the overall project of \"Science\" and positivism (Harding, 1991;Harding, 2006;Haraway, 1991;Keller, 2001). Feminist science studies work has illustrated how \"nature always already appears to scientific observation as normative, as discursively constituted through such scientific practices as, for example, measurement or modeling\" and has been helpful in revealing \"discursive practices that can counter the dominant ones organizing research disciplines\u2026[This work contributes] to understanding and changing the antidemocratic aspects of sciences' political unconscious\" (Harding, 2006, p. 10). In particular, such scholarship brings to light this \"political unconscious\" that is connected to militarism, environmental destruction, global capitalism, research used against or to \"prove\" the inferiority of women and people of color, and \"the failure of the transfer of Western sciences and technologies to the developing world to benefit the vast majority of the globe's least-advantaged citizens\" (pp. 4-5). Pushing back against the beliefs that science is value-neutral, feminist science studies scholars encourage researchers to take ownership of their subjectivities and how these influence research, scientific or otherwise. Sandra Harding (1991; and Donna Haraway (1991) offer especially useful discussions about objectivity, self-reflection, and positionality. Harding (1991) argues for what she calls \"strong objectivity\" as a way for scholars to acknowledge that all knowledge, its production, and beliefs are socially situated. She purports that scientific research must include a \"systematic examination of such powerful background beliefs\" shaping that work (p. 149). Similarly, Haraway (1991) extends Harding's notion of strong objectivity through the concept of \"situated knowledges.\" Through situated knowledges, researchers engage in critical self-reflexivity and are responsible for their positionalities by acknowledging them throughout their work. Situated knowledges and strong objectivity perspectives view the \"object\" of research as an active part in producing the research and thus the knowledge. This scholarship charged me to think critically about the scientific claims and claims about science in workforce and pipeline studies and to question the assumptions made therein. The epistemological underpinnings of feminist science studies pervade this project -from my critical disbelief in traditional objectivity and questioning of what counts as \"truth,\" to the design of my research questions and methodological choices and to the need to include self-reflection on my positionality as a part of this text."}, {"section_title": "Positionality", "text": "This dissertation is not just an academic or scholarly project, as few research projects are. It is personal, political, and largely shaped by my personal experiences. This dissertation not only allows me to theorize and politicize broader systemic issues related to STEM and identity, but it has provided a space for me to do so for my own experiences. I confess. I am a \"bad\" subject -at once both and neither inside/outside of \"the pipeline.\" As an undergraduate, I majored in mathematics and computer science while minoring in English writing and taking a number of electives in women's studies. In my first master's degree, I studied computer science while minoring in gender and women's studies and researching gendered computer interfaces. In my second master's degree in women's studies, I engaged in social science research on STEM recruitment and retention efforts. Now, as I pursue my doctorate in higher education, I continue to bridge feminism, science, and quantitative work. Straddling the illusory STEM/non-STEM-line, I apparently have threatened to \"leak\" from the system for most of my life. The pipeline narrative, in its most basic form that categorizes women's studies as a non-science, would tell the story of my educational trajectory as the sad tale of a lowincome, U.S. citizen \"female\" who leaked from the STEM pipeline at the master's level. This narrative would see me, as you will see in Chapter Four, as putting the nation at competitive risk. After all, STEM needs me! America needs me (in traditional STEM fields)! I should have just put on my metaphorical (American flag) sweater and fulfilled my patriotic duty in the \"chilly climate\" of science. What this narrative does not explain is that I am very clearly still involved in STEM work, even if STEM itself is the subject of that work. It also does not explain how the critical thinking skills from gender and women's studies are allowing me to conduct work that encourages change in STEM that is broader in scope than the numeric and demographic composition of its workforce. The narrative doesn't tell you that I actively sought out women's studies and higher education as spaces in which to try to make that change because of the active resistance I experienced from within my computer science program. It does not say that, in conducting my research, I use mathematical analysis mediated by computer software through coded algorithms that I have written. I did not just passively trickle \"out\" of STEM; in some ways, I ran; in others, I was pushed; and in many ways, I never left at all. As in feminist science studies, a large part of my ongoing theoretical, personal, and political projects seeks to place feminism and science in conversation with one another. As Anne Fausto-Sterling (2000) argues about her work in critical biology studies, there is a \"need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development\" (ix). I first sought to deconstruct the pipeline metaphor in my women's studies master's thesis as a way to push back against a discourse that I saw (and continue to see) as encouraging surface solutions to \"diversity\" in STEM that materialize into problematic policies, programs, and recruitment and retention efforts (Metcalf, 2007). These efforts leave the often oppressive and assimilationist culture of STEM untouched. The pipeline metaphor assumes that the flow will take the shape of its container, when, perhaps, it is time to change the container. In this dissertation, I continue to use critical theory to disassemble the pipes by focusing on how pipeline ideology has worked its way into STEM workforce studies and datasets."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this chapter, I provided a brief overview of the theoretical framework informing my research questions, design, epistemology and positionality. Various branches of critical theory, such as Marxist and post-Marxist theory, queer theory, critical race theory, feminist theory, and theory from feminist science studies, are combined to create a critical lens. I will apply that critical lens to uncover pipeline ideologies in contemporary STEM workforce studies, surveys, and datasets and to suggest potential non-normative and disruptive statistical alternatives. In the next chapter, I discuss the qualitative portion of this study by describing critical discourse analysis as a methodological approach to critically reading the STEM workforce studies, surveys, and data. I present the results of this analysis as a critical review of the STEM workforce literature and data.\nThe context of much STEM workforce research is its reliance on a flawed linear model that views students and workers as passive flows through leaky pipes and its focus on numeric diversity at best. Overall, the STEM workforce studies reviewed highlight the complicated and often problematic ways in which discourse, ideology, and survey research meet. They speak to the limitations of survey definitions, particularly those used to measure identity characteristics, family, STEM fields and degrees, ability, and success. These studies raise the importance of balancing appropriately disaggregating data with considering interactions among these measures, particularly measures of demographic characteristics. This literature indicates the importance of critical consideration of claims, both in the popular and scientific press, about workforce shortages and desired (or undesired as is the case with some international populations) demographics and the pervasive influences these claims have on workforce studies. This critical review is an initial call to actively interrogate the values, assumptions, and power structures underlying STEM workforce research, particularly as they have historically been and will continue to be embedded within policy and programs nationally and internationally (Driori, Meyer, Ramirez, & Schofer, 2003). Over the past forty years, STEM policies and programs have claimed goals of equity, diversity, increased representativeness, and access, yet little headway has been made. The same set of assumptions and models for understanding identity and career paths have been continually (re)produced both discursively and quantitatively, even in the face of criticism, to the detriment of these goals and social change. As economic and national investment in STEM continues to grow, even in a time of proclaimed economic crisis, it is particularly important to take a critical eye to the assumptions, values, and limitations of the pipeline model and its manner of understanding educational pathways. In the next chapter, I detail critical quantitative methodologies as the second half of my mixed methods approach. This critical discourse analysis largely informs the quantitative portion of the study. In Chapter Four, I use the 2006 SESTAT data to demonstrate how, despite the limitations within the dataset itself, critical quantitative analyses that run counter to the pipeline ideology are still possible.\n\nIn this chapter, I presented several descriptive and regression analyses that offer up quantitative alternatives to the traditional pipeline model as a way for understanding retention. Chapter Three offered a critique of the SESTAT surveys and their resulting measures and data, but this does not mean, however, that all hopes of quantitative analysis of these data are lost. This chapter demonstrates that critical quantitative analysis that disrupts the normative pipeline discourse is possible. In the next chapter, I offer up some implications of these findings and potentials for future research. Each of these efforts claims equity-related goals; yet, they heavily frame the problem, through pipeline discourse, in terms of national needs, workforce supply, and competitiveness. This particular framing of the problem may, indeed, be counter to equity goals, especially when paired with policy that largely relies on statistical significance and broad aggregation of data over exploring the identities and experiences of the populations targeted for equitable outcomes in that policy. Without a deeper understanding of the experiences of these targeted populations and without a focus on change that extends beyond the individual to address systemic and institution issues, little progress toward realizing equity goals can be expected (Etzkowitz, Kemelgor, & Uzzi, 2004). As this study's findings indicate, many workforce studies and their underlying datasets have a tendency to greatly oversimplify the ways in which retention outcomes and rationales, especially for targeted underrepresented groups, are measured and understood. Applying a critical eye to how retention and identity are conceptualized, regardless of whether the mode of analysis falls into qualitative and/or quantitative camps, is just one step toward deepening our understanding of retention issues. Increasing the depth and breadth of our understanding, in turn helps generate a richer pool of resources to aid interested parties in achieving their ultimate equity-based goals. In this study, I aimed to understand the ways in which the pipeline model ideology has become embedded within academic discourse and data surrounding STEM education and work. The purpose of this study was to draw upon and work alongside existing scholarship on identity and STEM participation to broaden who and what counts in and as STEM. This study took a critical look at and re-conceptualized the variety of problems and rationales underlying STEM recruitment and retention efforts, data collection, and analyses to offer an additional perspective for research, policy and practice. In this final chapter, I first summarize how this study's findings have answered its research questions and relate its findings to the STEM workforce literature discussed in Chapter Three. Then, I return to my critical theoretical framework to provide further historical and social context for these findings. Next, I discuss the implications of the findings for policy and practice. Lastly, I consider potential directions for future research.\nAs I explained in my positionality statement in Chapter Two, this dissertation has been a personal, political and academic journey for me. Engaging in critical discourse and critical quantitative research has allowed me to attempt to merge feminism and science in ways that I hope can have transformative outcomes for the ways that research, policy and practice surrounding science and engineering retention is conducted in the future. This work can validate and better understand a broad range of already ongoing scientific activities undertaken by people with complex identities. In the mean time, I will continue to conduct my work promiscuously in the interstices that are both and neither STEM and non-STEM work. The sample from the data set that I used focused on those respondents who were employed at the time of the study. I chose this subset because I wanted to look at one stage within the pipeline model -the stage that assumes leaks occur during the transition from one's highest degree obtainment to occupation. By using only those who are employed, I could look at their highest degree field compared to their occupational field to see if they would be counted as a leak or not in this model. Also, there are numerous cases where the year in which the first bachelor's degree was obtained contains missing values. These cases were also dropped, leaving 85,258 observations. Table 20 below lists the descriptive statistics and correlations for the relevant variables in this sample. Table   20 shows that about 36% of the sample is female, 70% white, non-Hispanic, 14% Asian, non-Hispanic, 92% U.S. citizens, and 60% obtained their first bachelor's degree between This is self reported by respondents rather than channeled into science and engineering or non-science and engineering by predefined NSF categorization. Perceived job-degree fit may be a better measure of whether or not one is still \"doing science and engineering\" because it allows for more flexibility in how and where science and engineering degrees are being used. Three sets of regressions were modeled using the SESTAT data. For the first regression, a binary logit was used to represent the traditional pipeline model assumptions. This regression looked at \"leak\" rates as would be measured by the pipeline model using NSF definitions of what counts as science, with the STEM leak variable as a dependent variable. Sex, race/ethnicity, citizenship, parental status, and year of first bachelor's degree are independent variables. Another assumption in the pipeline metaphor is that \"women and minorities\" leak at higher rates than others. This assumption often disregards that \"women\" and \"minorities\" are not mutually exclusive categories and ignores women of color as a category of analysis. Likewise, the model often focuses on \"women and minorities\" of U.S. citizenship. To raise questions about these identity assumptions, I also use a second binary logit in an interaction model that interacts the sex variable with each of the other independent variables. For those who do count as \"leaks,\" a multinomial regression was analyzed to see how the above independent variables (sex, race/ethnicity, citizenship, parental status, year of first bachelor's degree) have a marginal effect on the primary reason for working outside the field of highest degree. Lastly, to consider alternate ways of measuring retention, the extent job is related to highest degree was used as a dependent variable with sex, race, citizenship, parental status, and year of first bachelor's degree as independent variables. An ordered logit regression was used since relatedness of STEM education to one's occupation is measured as a set of ordered categories (closely related, somewhat related, not related). For the first regression, a binary logit was used to represent the traditional pipeline model assumptions, with the leak variable as a dependent variable. Sex, race/ethnicity, citizenship, parental status, and year of first bachelor's degree were independent variables. Table 21 shows the results of the binary logit regressions. The binary logit regression model (1) uses the traditional pipeline metaphor assumptions. Odds ratio results are not surprising given these assumptions. Females are 1.378 times more likely than males to leak. Underrepresented minorities are 1.379 times more likely than white, non-Hispanics and 1.84 times more likely than Asian, non-Hispanics to leak. U.S. citizens are 1.303 times more likely to leak than non-U.S. citizens. Parents are only slightly more likely to leak than those who are not parents, but this finding is not statistically significant. The pipeline model often assumes the categories \"women\" and \"minorities\" are mutually exclusive and rarely considers interactions among class and sex and/or gender. To consider the possibility that being a female of color influences whether one is a leak or not differently than does being a white female or a white male, I used binary logit regression models (Table 21 columns (2) and (3)) in which the sex variable is interacted with each of the other variables. Holding all other variables constant, for females being an underrepresented minority is associated with a 1.397 times greater likelihood to leak than it is for white, non-Hispanic females. For males, being an underrepresented minority is associated with a 1.361 times greater likelihood to leak than it is for white, non-Hispanic males. For females, being a U.S. citizen is associated with a 1.236 times greater likelihood to leak than it is for non-U.S. citizen females. For males, being a U.S. citizen is associated with a 1.342 times greater likelihood to leak than it is for non-U.S. citizen males. Thus it seems for males, being a U.S. citizen has a larger impact on likelihood to leak than it does for females and for females, being an underrepresented minority has a larger impact on likelihood to leak than it does for males. While it is not statistically significant, the follow pair of findings are still quite interesting, particularly when compared to model (1). For females, being a parent is associated with a slightly greater likelihood to leak compared to females who are not parents (1.015). Whereas for men, being a parent is associated with a slightly smaller likelihood to leak compared to males who are not parents (.983). Pipeline exits are not just an issue for white women and men of color. .678 Notes: Coefficients, standard errors (in parenthesis), and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. Table 22 details the results of the multinomial regression where the primary reason for working outside the field of highest degree is the dependent variable. For this regression sample, only those participants who were considered to be \"leaks\" and who had a primary reason listed were used as observations. For the purposes of this proposal, key findings surrounding sex and race will be discussed. Some key findings from this regression related to the sex variable are that, holding all other variables constant, the odds of working outside one's degree field because of working conditions rather than pay or promotion is 1.9 times greater, family reasons rather than working conditions is 2.76 times greater, family reasons rather than job location is 4.89 times greater, family reasons rather than change in interest is 3.89 times greater, family reasons rather than pay or promotion is 5.2 times greater, and job in doctoral degree is not available rather than pay or promotion is 1.17 times greater for females than males. Holding all other variables constant, for underrepresented minorities compared to white, non-Hispanics, the odds of working outside of one's degree field because of job location rather than working conditions is 1.17 times higher, job in doctoral degree is not available rather than working conditions is 1.32 times higher, job in doctoral degree is not available rather than job location is 1.12 times higher, job in doctoral degree is not available rather than change in interest is 1.31 times higher, and job in doctoral degree is not available rather than family reasons is 1.73 times higher. Family reasons stand out more in females' reporting of their primary reasons for working outside the field of their highest degree despite the statistical insignificance of the parent variable in the previous regressions. Likewise, working conditions and lack of jobs post-doctoral degree are also important factors for the females and underrepresented Notes: Coefficients and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. Another measure of retention could be respondents' perceptions of the use of their science and engineering degrees in their current occupations. The 2003 SESTAT data contained such a variable that measured the extent to which one's job is related to one's degree (closely related, somewhat related, not related). To consider this measure of retention, the extent one's job is related to one's highest degree was used as a dependent variable with sex, race/ethnicity, citizenship, parental status, and year of first bachelor's degree as independent variables in an ordered logit regression. Table 23 contains the details of the ordered logit regression in which retention is measured not in terms of leaks but in terms of degree-occupation fit. Some key findings from this regression are that, holding all other variables constant, the odds of having a more closely related degree/occupation fit are 1.13 times more likely for females than males, 1.11 times more likely for underrepresented minorities than white, non-Hispanic students, 1.13 times more likely for parents than non-parents, and 2.52 times more likely for those who obtained their first bachelor's degrees in 1950 or earlier than for those who obtained it in 2001 or later. Those who obtained their degree in any other year grouping than 2001 or later are more likely to have a closely related fit.  : 1986-1990 0.332* (0.347) 1.393 Degree Year: 1991Year: -1995 0.294* (0.345) 1.342 Degree Year: 1996Year: -2000 0.275* (0.317) 1.317 Notes: Coefficients, standard deviation of x (in parenthesis), and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in the model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. These findings demonstrate that the way retention is conceptualized makes much difference in the statistical outcomes. While the binary logit regressions which used leaks as a measure of retention found that females and underrepresented minorities had the lowest retention rates, this regression demonstrates that females and underrepresented minorities actually have higher retention rates when retention is measured as perceived degree/occupation fit. 68.10% Notes: Coefficients, standard errors (in parenthesis), and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. n = 105,064 and S&E-related fields count as non-S&E for all models.

Next, I present the findings of this analysis in the form of a critical review of the literature and data in which I interrogate the assumptions underlying contemporary STEM workforce studies and the data upon which they are based. I examine the ways in which identity, recruitment, and retention are commonly represented in scholarly work through a particular focus on the U.S. STEM pipeline model. This largely quantitative and statistical model has been the basis of recruitment and retention efforts aimed at women and people of color in STEM for the past forty years, yet the problems of inequity and underrepresentation are still proclaimed in the discourse of much current research and programming (Blickenstaff, 2005;Blum, 2006;Camp, 2002;Kuck, 2001). In this chapter, I first provide an overview of critical discourse analysis. Next, I begin the review by providing a brief overview of the pipeline model's history and critiques. Then, I look at the contemporary use of the model in STEM workforce studies, focusing on the ways in which recruitment and retention, scientific work, and identity are represented, measured, and understood. I argue throughout that the pipeline model has a limited view of retention that is based upon socially constructed ideas about what constitutes \"valid\" scientific and engineering work and who counts as \"real\" scientists and engineers."}, {"section_title": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "text": "Foucault (1972) argues that \"in every society the production of discourse is at once controlled, selected, organised [sic] and redistributed according to a certain number of procedures, whose role is to avert its power and its dangers, to cope with chance events, to evade its ponderous, awesome materiality\" (p. 216). Like and connected to ideology, discourses, often competing and contradictory, produce knowledge (as well as power and subjectivity) through language, images, and signs that seem to happen naturally. Ayers (2005) explains that discourses act as mediums \"through which economic, social, and cultural processes transpire\" (p. 529) and argues that that powerful discourses are often reproduced in problematic and hegemonic ways. Paired closely with critical theory, critical discourse analysis focuses on \"the role of discourse in the (re)production and challenge of dominance\u2026the exercise of social power by elites, institutions or groups, that results in social inequality, including political, cultural, class, ethnic, racial, and gender inequality\" (van Dijk, 1993, pp. 249-250). Critical discourse analyses allow for an understanding of the reproduction and consequences of dominant discourses, whether those discourses are found in qualitative or quantitative texts, by closely reading those texts through the lens of critical theory. Such analyses provide a space for problematic discourses, rhetoric, and assumptions to be contested by revealing their underlying ideologies, power relations, values, and beliefs. This study uses critical discourse analysis to read current STEM workforce studies, survey, and data with a particular focus on the ways in which the pipeline model is embedded within these texts. Using multiple databases, including Web of Science, ProQuest, Social Science Citation Index, J-Stor, and the National Science Foundation's Science Resource Statistics Publications, I reviewed academic articles and reports written over the past 10 years on the STEM workforce, with a particular focus on quantitative studies. Quantitative studies were primarily used because of their scale and influence on policy decisions. Some qualitative studies were included to supplement gaps in the quantitative research, such as the work discussed below on LGBTQ STEM students and STEM students with learning disabilities. The articles were thematically analyzed to identify not only specific references to the STEM pipeline, but also with attention to power and resistance and for the themes underlying the pipeline discourse, such as rationales for diversity emphases, discussions of workforce supply and demand, how STEM is defined and measured, how identity and demographics are accounted for, and how pathways to STEM were discussed. In addition, I focused on what datasets were used within the studies. I then looked to the dataset most often used by the studies reviewed and analyzed it for the above themes as well, with attention to the survey questions and measures used to derive the data. By unveiling the problematic aspects of these texts and how they reproduce certain discourses and assumptions, we can create room for a more critical understanding of STEM educational and workforce processes. Critical discourse analysis as a methodological approach, then, helps answer each of the three research questions by pinpointing pipeline discourses in the current studies, surveys and datasets (questions one and two) and creating space for alternatives that will be utilized within critical statistical analyses (question three). The results of this analysis are presented next as a critical review of the STEM workforce literature and data."}, {"section_title": "The Pipeline Model", "text": "U.S. STEM workforce studies over the past several decades have primarily focused on the supply side, often premising the work on claimed and predicted workforce shortages that are based on the pipeline model. This model for measuring the workforce was introduced to the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the 1970s and used to make long-term projections and policy decisions in the 1980s as fears about technological competition with Japan arose (Lucena, 2005;Metcalf, 2007). During this period, governmental involvement in education became more acceptable as competitiveness agendas within policy encouraged the use of governmental funds to assist in the commercialization of science and technology (Slaughter & Rhoades, 1996). However, this involvement was restricted to the supply side in order to adhere to neoliberal principles of the \"free market\" (Lucena, 2005, p. 100)."}, {"section_title": "The pipeline model was designed by engineers and the National Research", "text": "Council's Committee on the Education and Utilization of the Engineer who based the model on flow modeling, social engineering, and supply-side economics. Supply-side economics, sometimes referred to as \"Reaganomics,\" \"trickle-down economics,\" or even \"voodoo economics,\" as a theory holds that supply is the central determinant of economic growth and as such, producers and their willingness to create products and services set the pace. Proponents of supply-side economics are in favor of creating a variety of incentives for production, such as reduced governmental regulation and conservative tax policies, and view demand as largely irrelevant (Roubini, 1997;Harper, 2005). Depicted as a balance equation, the model describes the linear sequence of steps necessary to become a scientist or engineer, shows the large number of scientists and engineers that would be needed to maintain national competitiveness, and uses past events in quantifying and predicting future needs as follows: \"Q 1 + \u2211f i + \u2211f o = Q 2, Where Q 1 = the number of people in the stock at the beginning of the period, \u2211f i = the sum of flows into the stock, \u2211f o = the sum of flows out of the stock, and Q 2 = the number of people at the end of period\" (Lucena, 2005, p. 105;National Research Council, 1986, p. 29). Over a set time period (e.g., one year), the model attempts to quantify the flow of people who move from an entry pool of secondary school students admitted to higher education institutions, to students engaged in educational preparation for STEM occupations, to employment in the STEM community, and followed by temporary or permanent departures from the STEM community (National Research Council, 1986). As you will see, since its inception, researchers have used the model repeatedly to predict large shortages in the workforce supply and to focus on key populations and points along the pipeline. The category \"women and minorities\" became especially important to the NSF as claims about the hesitancy of white males to enroll in STEM programs created a need to rely on alternative populations to fill the \"pipeline.\" In particular, the NSF's Policy Research and Analysis Division's pipeline studies of 1984, 1987, and 1988 assumed a fixed percentage of students entering science and engineering fields and claimed that without some effort to increase the flow in the pipeline, by 2006 there would be a 675,000 shortfall of graduates with bachelor degrees in those fields (Lucena, 2000). As part of their focus on supply, researchers conceptualized those who entered the pipeline but did not exit it at the appropriate point as \"leaks\" (Blickenstaff, 2005;Blum, 2006;Camp, 2002;Kuck, 2001;Lucena, 2000;Metcalf, 2007). Certain points along the \"pipeline\" were especially \"leaky 3 ,\" such as the transition between secondary school and college, particularly for [U.S.] \"women and minorities\" as an aggregate demographic category (Blickenstaff, 2005;Blum, 2006;Camp, 2002;Kuck, 2001;Metcalf, 2007). The pipeline model has survived for decades despite critiques surrounding its flawed predictions and supply-side focus (Etzkowitz, Kemelgor, & Uzzi, 2004;Lucena, 2005;Teitelbaum, 2003), poor measurements (Lucena, 2005;Metcalf, 2007), linearity and inability to account for varied career paths (Xie & Shauman, 2003), tendency to homogenize people, fields, sectors, and stages (Hammonds & Subramaniam, 2003;Husu, 2001), discursive view of people as passive pipeline \"flow,\" and lack of focus on systemic change and power relations, particularly those related to gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, and citizenship (Hammonds & Subramaniam, 2003;Husu, 2001;Metcalf, 2007). The flaws of the pipeline metaphor have become embedded, in various ways, as assumptions within the majority of STEM workforce studies and the surveys and datasets upon which they are based. Consequently, its use for understanding and measuring STEM educational and career paths and expansion as a model for education in general is particularly problematic. The rest of this review will discuss how each of these problematic aspects of the pipeline model has made its way into STEM workforce studies and their underlying surveys and datasets."}, {"section_title": "Pipeline Predictions and Supply-Side Focus", "text": "In 1992, the NSF's initial pipeline studies were reviewed in hearings of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Members of the committee determined that valid criticism of the pipeline model was purposefully disregarded at the NSF (Lucena, 2000, p. 20). The model was criticized for its flawed measurements and failed predictions. Of particular influence on the pipeline model's failed projections were the Immigration Act of 1990 and the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992. After their passing, the growth of international students in STEM programs was about 87% and therefore the shortage predicted by the pipeline model did not materialize. Researchers conducting current studies that focus on the supply-side continue to base the motivation for their work on the assumption that there will be a mass shortage of scientists and engineers (Teitelbaum, 2003;Black & Stephan, 2005). For example, Dowd, Malcom, & Bensimon (2009) argue for the creation of programs and policies to assist in the retention of Latino/a students in STEM because of the growing demand for a highly educated and skilled workforce and the decreasing proportion of college-educated adults, particularly in states experiencing rapid growth in the Latino population (p.1). The United States, they argue, \"is falling behind other countries-including Canada, Japan, Korea, Norway, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and France-in the proportion of 25-to 34-yearolds with college degrees\" especially STEM degrees (p. 1). One of the reports they cite is the 2001Bureau of Labor Statistics' \"Occupational Outlook\" report. This report projected shortages, particularly in computer-related fields, over the next decade, arguing that these are likely to be the fastest growing industries. Teitelbaum (2003) explains that the majority of current workforce studies that claim shortages cite this same report despite its limitations. The lack of supply argument is especially popular in research advocating for the increased representation of women, people of color, and international students in STEM (Abriola & Davies, 2006;Teitelbaum, 2003). As seen in the above example, the discourse often proceeds as follows: STEM will have a shortage of (white, male, U.S. citizen 4 ) workers, putting the nation at competitive risk. Women, people of color, and more recently, international students are populations of \"untapped\" resources. Therefore, STEM needs more women, people of color, and international students to fill these shortages. The supply-side focus then becomes about recruiting and retaining these students as resources, particularly at each of the \"leaky\" points in the pipeline, often in problematic ways. The view of women and people of color as passive resources to be harnessed not only ignores agency and assumes that the sole purpose of education is employment, but it also hides the ways in which certain populations are disciplined, produced, and used for the benefits of others (Harding, 2006;Metcalf, 2007). For example, in \"Attracting and Retaining Women in Engineering: The Tufts Experience,\" Abriola and Davies (2006) write, \"The United States is facing a crisis in the creation and maintenance of its scientific and technical labor force, and is no longer training enough people to fill current anticipated demand. If one is concerned about the competitive position of the United States, Engineering needs women\" (pp. 1, 3). They also provide two additional arguments for why people are concerned about the participation of underrepresented populations in STEM. The first is that without demographic diversity, STEM suffers from a lack of diverse perspectives -\"If one is concerned about quality, Engineering needs women\" (p. 4). The second is that men and women should have equal access to the variety of career options in society -\"If one is concerned about equity, Engineering needs women\" (p. 4). Regardless of the argument made -patriotic competiveness, diversity of perspective, or equity of access -it is Engineering that needs women, not women who need Engineering. Supply-side STEM studies focus on creating supply through recruitment and retention strategies at different key points in education: PK-6, high school, undergraduate, masters, doctorate, and postdoctoral levels (Abriola & Davies, 2006;Castillo-Chavez & Castillo-Garsow, 2006;Davis, 2005). Retention becomes a short-term measure because it is defined in terms of supply at a given point in the pipeline without much concern for the demand at the next point. Supply-side studies often focus on those respondents who are enrolled in a degree program or who have graduated and are employed at the time of the survey, eliminating from their studies those with training in STEM but not currently employed (e.g., Tsapogas, 2004;Regets, 2006). These individuals could speak to the variety of reasons that a highly trained person in STEM might not be employed, including lack of job availability (i.e., demand). Recent critiques of the supply-side focus of workforce shortage claims have much to say about the connection between supply and demand. Etzowitz, Kemelgor, and Uzzi (2004) use data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates to explain that simply recruiting more women has and will not automatically result in equity across STEM positions and ranks. They argue that a singular focus on the supply-side \"tends to neglect analysis of the 'demand side', especially organizational resistance to change and the persistence of barriers to entry of women into the scientific and engineering professions\" (p.13). Black and Stephan (2005) also illustrate the problematic aspects of a singular focus on supply. Their study analyzes degree offerings, position announcements, and key firms' perceptions of the market to explore trends, placements, and job opportunities in bioinformatics from [2001][2002][2003][2004]. They found that the number of programs and students enrolled in bioinformatics drastically increased over the time period while positions in industry largely declined. Their study demonstrates that the focus on the supply and inattention to the connection between the pipeline output and demand has created an oversupply of bioinformatics graduates who have difficulty finding jobs in industry. Teitelbaum (2003) critiques workforce shortage claims because of the abundance of empirical evidence and unemployment rates that counter such claims. He writes, \"in most areas of science and engineering at present, the available data show sufficient numbers or even surpluses of highly qualified candidates with extensive post-graduate education\" (p. 45). He further notes that this is particularly evident in the academy, which has shifted increasingly to part time and temporary appointees. Teitelbaum explains that the 2003 Bureau of Labor Statistics shows high unemployment rates even in the trendy areas (e.g. computer science) of science and engineering. The national unemployment average in 2003 for the entire workforce was six percent. High-tech areas like computer programming, electrical engineering, and electronic engineering were higher than this average. Teitelbaum explains that high skilled and educated areas like these usually have significantly lower unemployment averages than the national average. He points out the incentives that may encourage the continued insistence on shortages for universities that seek to fill seats and utilize graduate student and postdoctoral labor, government sciencefunding agencies that may see increased wages as accompanying increased costs for research, corporate employers who seek to hire skilled employees at competitive rates, and immigration lawyers who want to increase their billable hours. Teitelbaum warns that these shortage claims may become self-fulfilling prophecies and recommends that workforce researchers should \"encourage objective appraisals of current career paths, as well as innovations in higher and continuing education designed for more agile adjustments to inevitable changes in these dynamic fields\" (p. 53). While many scholars (e.g. Black & Stephan, 2005;Lowell & Salzman, 2007;Teitelbaum, 2003) have critiqued the supply-side focus of the majority of STEM workforce studies, little research, especially recently, has actually looked at the demandside, the connection between supply and demand or unemployment rates. In one study that begins to interrogate the transition point between degree obtainment and employment, Fox and Stephan (2001) utilized Fox's national-level survey of 3,800 doctoral students combined with the NSF's 1993 Survey of Doctoral Recipients to compare the career aspirations and prospects of STEM doctoral students with the employment experiences of recent doctoral graduates. They found that students assessed their employment prospects as less than good, which was a fairly accurate assessment as one in twelve recent PhDs were engaged in activities unrelated to their degrees (i.e. unemployment or employment in a non-related field), with women more likely than men to be unemployed or working part-time. In addition, they also found salary disparities and that, while women and men expressed equal preferences for employment in industry, more men than women actually found employment in that sector which, they argue, indicates that women are filling in the lower paid, \"left-over\" spaces of employment. Their study showed that women and men were roughly equally employed in fields that were closely related to their doctoral degrees. Shettle's (1993) study using the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) explored unemployment among S&E doctoral degree holders and found that the unemployment rate of 1.6 in 1993 was the highest rate observed between 1973 and 1995. According to Shettle, the doctorate recipients most likely to be unemployed were those with hearing or mobility impairments, married women 5 , women with children, those who were 40 years of age or older when they received their doctoral degree, those with degrees in geological and environmental sciences, those in the private sector in 1988, those with a disruption in full-time employment after receiving their doctoral degree, and those living in California. While these studies consider who is unemployed, they leave unexplored why they are unemployed. In addition, Shettle points out that the SDR did not ask respondents whether they had ever had a postdoctoral position, leaving her unable to consider patterns of unemployment among this growing population. Postdoctoral positions are playing increasingly important roles in the career trajectory of certain science fields largely because of immediate job unavailability (Davis, 2005;Teitelbaum, 2003 Much of the report focuses on addressing the well-being and satisfaction of the postdocs. The survey included questions about postdocs' satisfaction with their postdoctoral position, expectations, salaries, employment benefits, and training/education. The researchers found that about 70% of postdocs are satisfied overall with their position despite the inverse relation between years of education and salary beyond the high school degree level. In terms of salaries, postdocs earn more than those of similar age with a high school diploma, but less than those with bachelor's degrees, considerably less than those with masters or professional degrees, and less than PhD holders regardless of age. Davis (2005) writes, \"If one factors in the 51 hours they report spending on the job each week, postdocs are drawing a rather modest wage of $14.90 per hour, not much more than the $14 per hour that janitors earn at Harvard\" (p. 6). While this example speaks to the level of value that the researchers attach to janitorial work, it also highlights expectations that higher levels of degrees, particularly in STEM, should also be accompanied by higher salaries. The study also included some open-ended questions, allowing for direct quotes from a number of postdocs throughout the report. Of particular interest relative to supply and demand, Davis argues that while many postdocs hope to one day secure faculty positions, this expectation is unlikely to be met: Given that the growth in the number of science and engineering postdocs over the past decade (2.8% per year) has outstripped the rate of increase in the number of full-time science and engineering faculty positions (0.8% per year)\u2026despite their high hopes, most of the postdocs surveyed will probably not become faculty members at a research university. Indeed, they will likely end up outside of academia altogether (p. 6). While most of the report focuses on the satisfaction of the postdoc, this quote highlights that postdoc positions are not always stepping stones to independent positions, but instead might function as a way to maintain a cheap, yet highly skilled and productive, workforce. In their study of the career paths of international postdocs, Cantwell and Lee (2010) (National Science Foundation, 2008;. This limits researcher's potential to understand STEM educational pathways for those who have had community college experiences. The NSF also defines science and engineering fields and degrees through the use of six categories: computer and mathematical sciences, biological, agricultural and other life sciences 6 , physical and related sciences 7 , social and related sciences 8 , and engineering. Teaching in any of these areas at a postsecondary level also counts as science and engineering (S&E) work. However, the degrees and occupations listed in  Given the trend in higher education for academic capitalist modes of knowledge production which encourage partnerships among faculty, managerial professionals, and workers in industry across a variety of different fields, there is increasing boundary blurring between the private and public sectors as well as between disciplines (Harding, 2006;Mukerji, 1990;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). As academic capitalism provides the most benefits to fields that are closest to the market (most often those which involve science and technology), numerous non-technology-based fields are building relationships with those that are technology based. Biotechnology is a prime example of this, but certainly not the only one. Graphic design in art departments, educational technology in education departments, entrepreneurial science courses, technology transfer management, and science patenting law are other examples of this blending. One might expect more fields to involve technology, scientific work to have elements of the \"nonsciences\" and the \"non-sciences\" to incorporate scientific work. As  point out, \"[a]lthough not unemployed, young physicists can often be found utilizing their quantitative and analytical skills in the back rooms of Wall Street or even in their own financial firms\" ( p. 2). Similarly, Harding (2006) explains, graduates in the natural sciences increasingly can find employment only in corporate labs; mostly, they are working for defense contractors, for pharmaceutical companies, or in electronics or biotech industries. And university science departments, which historically isolated themselves from commercial interests and now and then from national state interests, today can claim little such autonomy (pp. 7-8). These partnerships and blurred boundaries are not represented in these definitions of science and engineering/non-science and engineering, reducing the accuracy with which researchers can understand what constitutes scientific work. An NSF Division of Science Resource Studies report, \"Counting the S&E Workforce -It's Not That Easy,\" uses data collected from the 1995 SESTAT surveys to point out some of these measurement issues (Pollak, 1999). In this report Pollak writes: In addition to the 3.2 million scientists and engineers [as measured using the above definitions], an estimated 3.1 million people reported that their jobs are closely or somewhat related to their highest degrees (in science and engineering). Approximately one-third of these workers are classified as managers, and 11 percent as pre-college teachers. (p. 1) She also explains that there are a little over two million more people who have a degree in science and engineering, but not their highest degree and that the survey does not measure the degree to which these respondents' S&E degrees are related to their current occupations. In an NSF InfoBrief on data from the 1999 surveys, Wilkinson (2002) also raises the issue of \"what counts,\" saying that the 1999 S&E workforce size would be about 3.5 million if we count those who have bachelor's degree or higher and are employed in S&E and more than 10 million if we count any employee with a S&E degree. He explains that there are two primary ways of defining what counts as science and engineering workthose who are employed in S&E and those with a degree in S&E. He argues that \"one limitation of counting by occupational classification is that it will not capture individuals using S&E knowledge, sometimes extensively, under occupational titles such as manager, salesman, or writer\" (p. 1). Counting by degree also has its limitations, he explains, because people often get multiple degrees that are not always in the same field. In addition, the SESTAT database creates a hierarchy for multiple degrees by level of degree and field for the highest degree and four next highest degrees preceding that. The degrees are sorted from highest to lowest by doctorate, professional, master's, and then bachelor's. If an individual has two degrees at the same level, then field information is used such that S&E degrees take precedence over non-S&E degrees (National Science Foundation, 2009). Wilkinson also raises the issue of degree-occupation relatedness, saying that of the 5 million S&E degree holders not working in S&E classified occupations in 1999, about 67% have occupations that are at least somewhat related to their degree."}, {"section_title": "In the NSF's Division of Science Resource Statistics and National Science", "text": "Board's annual Science and Engineering Indicators report, a third option for counting the S&E workforce is mentioned: S&E technical expertise (National Science Board, 2010). In each of the surveys in 2003 and earlier, employed respondents were asked to indicate whether or not their current job required the technical expertise of a bachelor's degree in engineering, computer science, mathematics, or the natural sciences. Using the 2003 data, this report explains that \"12.9 million bachelor's degree holders reported that their jobs required at least this level of expertise in one or more S&E fields. This contrasts with 2003 SESTAT estimates of 4.8 million in S&E occupations and 11.9 million whose highest degree is in an S&E field\" (pp. 3-11), which illustrates even further the drastic differences in each of these potential measures of the S&E workforce. To complicate matters further, in the creation of the SESTAT database since the 2003 surveys, the NSF has expanded its classification of degrees and occupations beyond the S&E/non-S&E distinctions to include a third grouping, S&E-related. All health fields are now moved into this category rather than being split between S&E/non-S&E based on degree level. The S&E-related category also contains a handful of fields that were previously classified as non-S&E, including S&E pre-college teachers, S&E managers, S&E teacher education, technology and technical fields, architecture, and actuarial science (National Science Board, 2010). Little analysis has been done using this third category, however, Science and Engineering Indicators 2010 explains that, in 2006, of the 6.2 million employees whose highest degree is in S&E, 1.1 million of them work in S&E-related occupations (National Science Board, 2010). Because this definitional shift is so new, it is not yet clear how workforce studies will handle this new category, particularly as it relates to pipeline ideology. Previously, the majority of these 1.1 million workers would be described as leaks from the pipeline. Will these workers now count as continued pipeline flow or leaks or will the dichotomous nature of the pipeline be disrupted by this new category that has the potential to be simultaneously both and neither STEM? If the current state of the workforce is so difficult to measure, it is no surprise that studies that attempt to predict future demand so frequently fail to do so accurately. These reports not only demonstrate the complicated ways in which science and engineering work intersects with non-science and engineering work, but also call into question the ways in which this work is defined and measured."}, {"section_title": "Linearity and Homogenization", "text": "One critique of the pipeline model related to what counts as STEM is of its linearity and its inability to account for varied career paths, exit, and re-entry (Metcalf, 2007;Xie & Shauman, 2003). This is reflected in workforce studies that primarily focus on key transition points, such as from bachelor's degree obtainment to enrollment in a graduate program in STEM (Regets, 2006;Tsapogas, 2004). Only to a limited extent do these studies consider varied career paths and multiple ways of entering and re-entering STEM. Some workforce studies account varied career paths and exit by looking at students who obtained a bachelor's degree in STEM, but went on to get a non-STEM advanced degree (Pollak, 1999;Wilkinson, 2002). Others consider exit and re-entry in the form of periods of unemployment (Shettle, 1997). None of these studies, however, consider exit and re-entry in the form of varied employment in STEM and non-STEM fields. For example, Stage and Maple (1996) interviewed women who obtained undergraduate degrees in mathematics and then pursued graduate degrees in educationrelated fields. They claim that their participants \"left the mathematics and science pipeline in pursuit of a doctorate in a social science field\" (p. 25), assuming that social science is not a \"real\" science and is therefore not part of the science pipeline. Furthermore, considering that most of the women left their math PhD programs to pursue math education, there is an implication that mathematics education is not \"real\" math. Part of the difficulty in considering varied paths in the above studies comes from the ways in which fields, levels, and people are grouped together, homogenizing and oversimplifying the complex ways in which people identify, learn, and work. Many studies group science, technology, engineering, and mathematics together when discussing the workforce. The case of defining what counts as STEM raises the questions about levels of disaggregation by field and sector. How can we best understand those occupations in which people do not \"count\" as part of the STEM workforce but whose STEM degrees are closely related to their jobs without disaggregating the data by field and sector? At the same time, could it be just as problematic to overly disaggregate the data? Becher (1994) and Ylijoki (2000) argue that disciplines can be conceptualized as academic tribes, each with its own set of values, virtues, vices and culture, suggesting the importance of disaggregating among them. In addition, in her dissertation on gendered boundary making in Engineering, Pawley (2007) argues that the case has yet to be made for continuing to study STEM in the aggregate. She explains that while the fields comprising STEM overlap in many ways, they also have distinct histories that influence their values and demographic composition. Teitelbaum (2003) also argues that science and engineering differ in terms of the personal and financial investments required to enter the field, with engineering requiring lower level degrees which are often obtained by state-subsidized universities. Some workforce studies disaggregate this data in such a way, but few consider degree-occupation relatedness, limiting our understanding of which NSF-defined non-S&E fields have a tendency to contain employees who use S&E knowledge regularly. Tsapogas (2004) considers the employment outcomes of recent STEM graduates by field and sector. Using the National Survey of Recent College Graduates and focusing on respondents who earned S&E bachelor's or master's degrees in 1999 and 2000, he found that those with degrees in computer science and engineering are more likely than those from other degree fields to find full-time employment and upon finding work are more likely to earn higher salaries. In addition, the private, for-profit sector is the largest employer of both bachelor's and master's degree holders. Regets (2006) used the SESTAT database to explore what graduates do after earning their S&E bachelor's degrees. He found that a decade or more after earning their S&E bachelor's degrees, about half of these degree recipients earned no additional degrees. However, this varied greatly by field. The proportion of respondents who continued to earn an advanced degree in their same field ranged from 9% in the social sciences to 21% in the physical sciences, with engineering, mathematics, and computer science having the lowest percentages of individuals earning additional degrees. He also found that 29% of respondents went on to earn advanced degrees in non-S&E fields, with 38% of this population having their initial bachelor's degrees in the life sciences and 17% in engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences."}, {"section_title": "Identity and Power Relations", "text": "Many workforce studies and their underlying data consider identity factors in problematic ways. A large and limiting bias in the SESTAT surveys and the studies based off of them is that gender and racial identities are biologically based. These surveys measure gender using a dichotomous male/female variable and race with a set of mutually exclusive categories. A considerable amount of work has been done within women's studies, gender studies, and feminist science studies to refute this dichotomy (e.g. Butler, 1997;Connell, 1987;Fausto-Sterling, 1996;Kessler, 2001;Oudshoorn, 2000). Even if gender, which is fluid, socially constructed, historically contextual, and highly performative, were the same as biological sex, intersex as a category of biological sex is excluded (Butler, 1997;Kessler, 2001). Likewise, not a single study in this review considers transgender as a category of analysis (Valentine, 2007). Race and ethnicity, also fluid, performative, and socially constructed (Omi & Winant, 1994) are often merged together and the use of mutually exclusive and limited categories does not allow respondents to indicate various mixed racial identifications. despite that critical race research has shown drastically different social and educational experiences between those who identify with these groups (Teranishi, 2002;Seidman, 2007). Race and ethnicity responses are then compiled in the SESTAT database into a number of variables including indicator variables for each of the racial categories, for the broad Hispanic or Latino ethnicity category, and a \"minority\" indicator variable for all respondents who indicated that their race or ethnicity was anything but white or Asian. The responses are also used to create two additional race/ethnicity variables within SESTAT that, along with the \"minority\" indicator, are most often used by researchers. The first race/ethnicity variable uses the Hispanic/Latino indicator as its own category and groups all racial categories together within it under the label \"Hispanic, any race.\" It then distinguishes each of the racial categories separately from that indicator with the following categories: Asian, non-Hispanic only, American Indian or Alaska Native, non- if they chose to leave the question completely blank, a response was imputed for them using imputation classes and donor records 9 (National Science Foundation, 2010). While researchers could use the series of indicator variables to create their own constructs, these prefabricated variables encourage otherwise and point both to the contextual underpinnings of racial and ethnic definitions and the highly subjective choices that are made in quantitative studies. Not all of the assumptions in the studies can be credited to survey construction. Most studies that consider gender and race look at these identity factors separately, comparing males in the aggregate to females in the aggregate (e.g., Abriola & Davies, 2006;Lal, Yoon, & Carlson, 1999;Rapoport, 2004) and whites to various racial groups, sometimes disaggregated to a limited extent and at other times aggregated to a \"minority\" group (e.g., Castillo-Chavez & Castillo-Garsow, 2006). Regardless of motivation, the pipeline model and many of these studies have as an end goal the recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented groups. Although this is an important aim, such a limited understanding of identity not only marginalizes those who do not see themselves reflected in the data collection instruments, but also restricts the understanding researchers could have of the STEM workforce. Few studies consider the ways in which race and gender are intertwined and even fewer studies also add class or other identity characteristics into the analysis, let alone interact these variables statistically despite the usefulness of this technique in alerting researchers and \"policymakers to possible areas of concern that merit monitoring or further study\" (Toutkoushian, Bellas, & Moore, 2007, p. 596). The most popular trend in studies that consider gender and race together is to focus on women of color in the aggregate (Hines et al, 1994; Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, 1995;SJB Research Consulting, Inc, 2004). These studies sometimes describe the racial categories used to define \"women of color\" and these are not always the same across These studies report results for women of color but what \"women of color\" means varies greatly across studies. In one study that considers a particular racial group and gender, Hanson (2004) used the National Educational Longitudinal Survey data to consider the science achievement, access, and attitudes of African American women throughout various points along the science pipeline. She looked at key points along this trajectory for these women, focusing on high school, college, and the transition from degree obtainment to employment and compares them to the experiences of white women. Through what she called a \"multicultural gender framework,\" she argued that the way gender functions in African American communities may provide young African American women with unique motivators for creating interest and success in science 10 . She found that, eight years out of high school, African American women were more likely than white women to report a job in science. Given the increasing time to obtain advanced degrees and thus the more \"prestigious\" jobs in science, though the kind of science job and the field and sector in which it resides is not explained. Hanson 2004also found that the women in her study maintained a continued interest and involvement in science and access to science courses throughout the career path, often even more so than white women, even though the interest does dwindle over time. She describes this decline in interest as a \"cooling out\" and explains it using the \"chilly climate\" metaphor. Pawley (2007) explains that this metaphor is connected to the pipeline metaphor: Chilly-climate based models\u2026are a subset of the pipeline metaphor, and suggests that leaks are caused by a 'chilly environment' that discourages people already under environmental stress (again, women and people of color) from remaining. Programs that attempt to stem these leaks provide metaphorical 'sweaters' (survival tools for underrepresented populations to better withstand the chilly environment) or train their white, male counterparts on how to 'turn up the thermostat' by implementing, for example, parent-friendly tenure procedures, gender-neutral hiring protocols, or the much-maligned idea of 'sensitivity training'\" (p. 7). Here, Pawley illustrates the problematic ways in which metaphors can be used to explain away a problem rather than critically engaging with it. In addition, workforce studies that focus on \"gender\" often are studies about \"women\" and invoke the need to consider the role that family plays in gender differences, making the assumption that gender studies are about women and that, with the study of women, comes the study of family. The study of \"family\" also becomes normatively constructed as indicators for family in these studies are most often marriage and children. While these can be used to get a sense of some aspects of family life, they certainly are not the only measures. In particular, considering the ways in which access to marriage and adoption are legally structured from state to state based on the biological sex of one and one's partner, these studies take on a particularly heteronormative slant (Berlant & Warner, 2000). Berlant and Warner describe the structural and ideological functioning of heteronormativity as: \"the institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality seem not only coherent -that is, organized as a sexuality -but also privileged\" (p. 312). Heteronormativity, which has no \"parallel,\" is a collection of institutional, political and foundational practices and discourses that impose and assume a heterosexual-based society and is distinct from heterosexuality, which presumes homosexuality as its opposite. In the case of these studies, the family structure, particularly in relation to biological sex and the construct of marriage, is narrowly and heteronormatively defined and measured. For instance, prior to 2003, the SESTAT surveys included the following categories of response for a respondent's marital status: married, widowed, separated, divorced, or never married. Starting in 2003, an additional category was added -\"living in a marriage-like relationship\" -and four percent of the respondents selected this option. While providing an additional option for respondents, it is still phrased in terms of a comparison to state-sanctioned marriage. Because this change to the surveys is so recent, most research is based on the five categories of marriage offered prior to 2003. One study on female-male differences in academic careers of scientists uses the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to consider how \"successful\" movement along the academic career path for doctorate recipients who earned a degree in S&E in the U.S. is influenced by sex (Rapoport, 2004). Rapoport (2004) argues that female scientists and engineers are less successful than their male counterparts at traveling along the career path, but that these \"gender\" differences are indirect-they are more related to sex differences in the influence of family on success than they are to direct sex differences in success. He finds that women with children and who are married are less likely to be on the tenure track than men with children and who are married, and women who have young children later in their careers are more likely to earn tenure. Further, women are less likely to be promoted to senior ranks then men, but this third result is statistically insignificant when gender differences in family influences are accounted for. Rapoport measures success by four outcomes: gaining tenure-track placement, earning tenure, promotion to the rank of associate professor, and promotion to the rank of full professor. Although success could be measured in a number of other ways including subjective measures of career satisfaction, we once again see a linear pipeline model applied to career success. Another study on unemployment patterns of doctorate recipients in 1993 considers gender differences in unemployment rates and also measures family using marital status and having children as indicators (Shettle, 1997). This study found that there were no direct gender differences in unemployment rates, but when family was considered, for women, being married and having children were associated with relatively high unemployment rates whereas for men, they were associated with relatively low unemployment rates. In other words, gender does not directly impact unemployment rates; rather, it impacts the influence that family has on unemployment rates. While these studies show how marriage and children influence employment and academic career trajectories, they fail to consider how family obligations influence the career \"success\" of those who have non-normative family arrangements, such as queer couples, the scientist who is the caregiver for an aging parent, domestic partnerships, and non-biological chosen families 11 . Likewise, in focusing on family as the site of \"acceptable\" non-work responsibilities that might interfere differentially with one's work success, these studies do not interrogate the variety of personal lives that scientists and engineers have or desire to have in attempting to achieve success in the workforce (Metcalf, 2007). Additionally, this focus on family, its frequent connection to women under the argument that women are often unequally held responsible for household duties, and the pipeline metaphor's encouragement of surface solutions rather than systemic change often leads to the suggestion that workplaces provide childcare as the \"solution\" to women's underrepresentation (e.g. Cuny & Aspray, 2002). This not only perpetuates childcare as women's responsibility, but disregards the many childless women who \"fail\" to achieve these measures of \"success.\" While there has been an increase in focus on LGBTQ scientists and engineers in online support and activism forums 12 and in the popular and academic media 13 , very little empirical research has been conducted on the experiences of those who identify as LGBTQ. In the only research study on sexuality and identity in STEM, Cech and Waidzunas (2011) conducted focus groups and interviews with lesbian, gay, and bisexual engineering undergraduates at a major U.S. research university and found a heteronormative engineering culture that included \"pervasive prejudicial cultural norms and perceptions of competence\" that limited LGB students' opportunities and often encouraged these students to hide their identities (Cech & Waidzunas, 2011, p. 1). This work took a critical and intersectional approach and found that, for those who identified as men, heteronormativity functioned to undermine their engineering abilities by casting them as feminine, while those who identified as women were stereotyped as masculine which did not work to their advantage largely because of \"general biases against women\" in the department (p.21). In addition, they found that Latino/a LGB students in their study felt their racial and ethnic identities negatively rendered them more visible. It is unsurprising that this study is qualitative in nature given that the national-level surveys have yet to ask any questions about sexuality. They, and I, argue that more work needs to be done, both qualitatively and quantitatively to consider intertwined identity characteristics that include sexuality. In addition, research should broaden gender categories beyond the male/female dichotomy and begin to look at the experiences of people who are categorized as transgender or gender queer in the profession. No research has been done on this population despite trans-advocacy and activism from within and outside of STEM. Some STEM workforce studies consider the role that international students and \"foreign born\" employees play in measuring the workforce. This is an important area to consider not only in light of global competition, but also within the context of changing immigration policies and because the vast majority of studies that consider \"women and minorities\" refer to U.S. citizens. Using the National Survey of College Graduates and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients from 1980 and 1990, Stephan and Levin's (2003) study considers the costs and benefits of the increasing presence of foreign-born and foreign-educated scientists and engineers in the U.S. workforce. They found that a large percentage of foreign-born workers are primarily educated abroad, allowing the U.S. to benefit from the investments made by other countries. These workers contribute disproportionately to science and engineering 14 and represent a highly select group. Contrary to popular belief, they explain that the costs have not been to U.S. citizen scientists and engineers. While U.S. citizen scientists and engineers have been replaced by non-U.S. citizen workers in some jobs, they show that those jobs are temporary academic jobs, suggesting a hierarchy that favors U.S. citizen scientists and engineers. They argue that citizen-scientists are being pulled (rather than pushed) from the temporary academic positions by higher paying and more permanent job opportunities in industry as non-U.S. citizen scientists and engineers fill the less valued job spaces. While Stephan and Levin (2003) focus on the influx of international students and workers to the U.S., Black and Stephan (2003) turn their attention to who stays. Their study focused on sixteen fields of science from the 1981-1999 Survey of Earned Doctorates with particular interest in the likelihood of staying in the U.S. for those respondents who held a temporary visa at the time of degree receipt. They explain that at the time of the study one in three science and engineering doctoral degrees was awarded to a student on a temporary visa, accounting for 50% of the growth in Ph.D. production between 1981 and 1999. Their study disaggregated the data not only by citizenship, but by residency status, country of origin, and field and considered the popular claims following 9/11 that students from particular countries in \"sensitive\" fields would take their U.S. education back to their country of origin only to work on nuclear weapons and chemical warfare. They found that students in sensitive fields 15 and students from targeted countries 16 actually reported higher than average stay rates. In addition, they conclude that stay plans as well as definite plans are clearly related to age, field, country of origin and quality of training. The field with the highest stay rate is biology/chemistry. The field with the lowest stay rate is agriculture. Individuals trained at top programs consistently are more likely to have definite plans to stay than are individuals trained at lower tier institutions (p. 12). The Black and Stephan (2003) study does not disaggregate the data by gender or sex which could be useful, especially when considering that post-9/11 policies focus on males in sensitive fields from targeted countries. In addition, the researchers assume, like many other studies, that institutional ranking is an adequate indicator for quality of training. While these studies on international populations do not disaggregate their data by race, ethnicity, class, or gender, they shed light on the increasingly influential role that international students, graduates, and employees with varying levels of residency have in the U.S. STEM workforce. In addition, in addressing and dispelling popular beliefs about job displacement and how U.S. education and training are being used, these researchers counter various xenophobic claims about \"foreigners\" taking \"our\" jobs and \"terrorists\" taking \"our\" science. Very few workforce studies consider students and employees with disabilities in STEM fields, despite the signing into law of the NSF Task Force  The few studies on students with learning disabilities in STEM tend to be qualitative because of the variation in defining and reporting on disability. In one such study,  conducted interviews and focus groups with 65 undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities in STEM majors, 28% of whom had learning disabilities. They found that, despite the greater barriers faced by these students, they could be considered more likely to persist than their peers because of their high levels of commitment to their major and clarity about their goals. The three major barriers, listed here in order of significance, faced by the students in their study were the \"hostile attitudes of science, mathematics, and engineering faculty\" particularly in regards to time-related accommodations (p. 66), financial issues and difficulty navigating the financial aid system, and, finally, their disability itself and the limitations that accompany it. Seymour and Hewitt's study suggests that systemic and structural issues largely impact both accessibility and persistence for students with disabilities in STEM to a larger degree than do the disabilities themselves."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER FOUR: METHODOLOGIES", "text": "The use of statistical evidence in representing \"objective\" \"truth\" has been debated in numerous fields (Harding, 1991;Haraway, 1991). Statistics in and of themselves are often thought to be scientific and objective despite the numerous values and choices that become embedded within statistical studies. As Sandra Harding (1991) explains, \"[i]n a hierarchically organized society, objectivity cannot be defined as requiring (or even desiring) value neutrality\" (p. 134). Because the very notion of objectivity is imbued with value-laden discourse that impacts the production of scientific work, [s]cientists and science theorists working in many different disciplinary and policy projects have objected to the conventional notion of a value-free, impartial, dispassionate objectivity that is supposed to guide scientific research and without which, according to conventional thought, one cannot separate justified belief from mere opinion, or real knowledge from mere claims to knowledge (p. 138). Even within the law, a field which often subscribes to the notion of objectivity, the use of statistics as evidence is frequently debated in theory and in practice and is largely context-dependent. For example, within a case on employment discrimination, the Supreme Court argued that the use of statistics is repeatedly approved in the law, but also offered a warning: \"We caution only that statistics are not irrefutable; they come in infinite variety and, like any other kind of evidence, they may be rebutted. In short, their usefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances\" (City of Los Angeles, 1978, pp. 339-340). Often, the surrounding facts and circumstances that accompany statistical analyses are best made evident when aspects of quantitative research are paired with elements qualitative research in a meaningful and critical way (Baez, 2007;Carter & Hurtado, 2007;Stage, 2007). In this chapter, I present the quantitative methodologies portion of the mixed-methodological approach that I used to answer the third research question: How might alternative assumptions about identity, what counts as STEM, how to measure 'retention' produce different interpretations of the survey data? I describe critical quantitative analysis as a methodological approach to answering critical questions using the quantitative data found in the National Science Foundation's 2006 Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) database. This quantitative analysis is largely informed by the critical discourse analysis presented in the previous chapter. Next, I discuss the data and sample, measures of the independent, dependent, and contextual variables used, and the statistical techniques used for analyzing the data. Finally, I discuss some limitations of the study."}, {"section_title": "Critical Quantitative Analysis", "text": "Within higher education, feminist, and queer studies research, among other areas, is a growing interest in critical quantitative analysis (e.g. Baez, 2007;Browne, 2007;Carter & Hurtado, 2007;Kinzie, 2007;Stage, 2007). Baez (2007) explains that this kind of analysis asks how research \"can be critically transformative -that is, to what extent educational research can offer critiques of our world that allow us to transform it\" (p.18). He further elaborates that \"the idea of critical must be understood in particular contexts, and such an understanding has to recognize the politics and political arrangements associated with such an idea\" (p.19). He argues that pairing quantitative research with critical theory, critical reflection of self and of the ways in which research and the institutions in which it is conducted are implicated in oppression, and transformative outcomes form the nexus of critical quantitative research. In applying critical queer theory to quantitative research, Browne (2007) provides a useful example of the possibilities that such an analysis offers: I am interested in how, through the processes of quantitative research, categories of sexualities come to be (re)created\u2026 I will draw on contemporary queer epistemologies to explore the construction of the assumed, and seemingly fixed, categories that are often deployed in measuring sexualities. In seeking to disentangle sex, gender and sexuality, these epistemologies point to the (im)possibilities of measuring plural, fluid and contingent identities, by exposing how these are always becoming (in this context, through research practices and interactions). My purpose is to reveal both the constructedness of questions that ask for sexual and gender identities within the tick-box frameworks necessary for large scale quantitative research and how these processes reproduce the identities they supposedly 'measure.' By exploring quantitative research in this way, I challenge the uncritical use of sexual identity/orientation/behavioural [sic] categories and their reproduction in a proliferating variety of disciplines and subject fields. Here, Browne uses queer theory to read the data critically and turns quantitative research on itself to look at how that research acts as an ideological discourse, producing subjectivities, knowledges, and power relations. In a similar vein, I use critical quantitative analysis to answer my third research question: How might alternative assumptions (e.g. about identity, what counts as STEM, how to measure 'retention') produce different interpretations of the survey data? Because the critical discourse analysis of the STEM workforce studies, surveys, and data largely informs the critical quantitative analysis, it was conducted first and used to select the dataset, construct and select the key variables for analysis, and to choose the statistical technique for the analysis. In the following sections, I further detail the quantitative methods that will be used to analyze the dataset most often used by the STEM workforce studies. First, I describe the dataset and sample.

The NSCG is a longitudinal survey that has a baseline survey each decade with follow-ups every 2-3 years (National Survey of College Graduates, 2007). It primarily covers experienced scientists and engineers with bachelor's or master's degrees as well as those who earned non-U.S. doctorates or who are working in science and engineering fields, but who do not have science and engineering degrees. It draws from the U.S. Census long form responses to determine initial eligibility status and form stratification cells for the sampling frame. NCSG uses a two-stage random sample design. Households were first surveyed from the long form sample using a stratified systematic sample. Then, individuals within households who were in the target population were subsampled. Surveys are first distributed to the sample through the use of a selfadministered mail survey using a pre-notification letter, a first mailing, a reminder letter, and a second mailing. Non-respondents were then contacted using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Finally, if neither form received response, a personal visit was conducted. The response rate for 2006 was 63%. The NSRCG uses a two-stage sample design. In the first stage, a stratified nationally representative sample of 300 educational institutions was asked to provide lists of their graduates who received degrees between July 2002 and June 2005. The graduate list collection had a 98.7% response rate. In the second stage, bachelor's or master's degree holders in science, engineering, and health fields were identified and included in the sampling frame and classified into sampling strata based on cross-classification of academic degree year, degree type, sex, major field, and race/ethnicity. Within each eligible responding institution, sampling rates by stratum were applied. The NSRCG survey was then administered in two phases: a self-administered mail survey that was followed up with computer-assisted telephone interviewing for those who did not respond to the mail survey. The response rate was 68.2%. The SDR is a longitudinal survey that draws its sample frame from the NSF's Doctorate Records File, which is primarily comprised of data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (Survey of Doctorate Recipients, 2007). The 2006 sampling frame included those who had a U.S. earned doctorate in a science, engineering, or health field before July 2005, resided in the U.S. at the time of the survey, and were younger than 76 years of age as of the survey week. The frame was divided into two cohorts based on year of receipt of first doctorate and stratified by demographic group, degree field, and sex. The sample was systematically selected from this frame. Surveys were administered in three modes, self-administered mail surveys, computer-assisted telephone surveys, and selfadministered online surveys, with the initial contact mode assigned based on mode preference reporting in the 2003SDR. Follow-up for initial non-respondents was conducted using alternative modes and individuals were allowed to request any of the other modes. Much of the information on respondents' first U.S. S&E or health Ph.D. is drawn from the Doctorate Records File and meshed with the responses obtained from the SDR such that the SDR responses supplement already collected information. The overall response rate to the 2006 SDR was 78%. The questionnaires in each of the component surveys were very similar with about 90% of the questions being identical (National Science Foundation, 2008). Each collected information on respondents' employment, education, and demographics (see Table 2 17 ) check boxes and open text boxes. Often, questions were asked via both response types so that the data can be verified when the surveys are compiled. For example, when asked about the primary responsibilities and duties for their principal job, respondents are provided six lines for open text and are also given a series of thirteen yes/no checkboxes for specific activities and an \"other, specify\" option. The results of the three surveys were compiled to form the 2006 SESTAT database. Missing data for critical items such as degrees received and occupation was first attempted to be collected via telephone follow-up. Then, the missing data were imputed using hot deck imputation that replaces missing values using similar donor records (National Science Foundation, 2010). In addition, general editing was conducted on the data using \"best coding\" for education and occupation reporting and \"other, specify coding.\" Best coding was used to select the most accurate code for occupation and degree information between repondents' verbatim and selected codes. Other, specify coding was used to edit responses that the editors believed should have belonged in an existing category and to verify that the \"other\" response was legitimate. The final 2006 SESTAT database contains a total of 105,064 responses. Because the focus of the SESTAT data is on scientists and engineers, the surveys are compiled into the SESTAT database such that several key variables surrounding science and engineering work and degrees are constructed to organize fields by S&E fields (computer and mathematical sciences, life and related sciences, physical and related sciences, social and related sciences, and engineering), S&E-related fields (such as the health fields), and non-S&E-related fields. Table 2 details the type of employment, educational, and demographic information collected by each of the surveys and which information is compiled into SESTAT. In the following sections, I further discuss the variables of interest for this study that were obtained or constructed from the 2006 SESTAT data. Reasons for working part-time X X X X Worked part-time but wanted to work full-time X X X X Employer sector X X X X Employer size X X X X Employer location X X X X Job is a postdoc X Reasons for taking postdoc X Duration and location of postdoc X Employer is an educational institution X X X X Educational institution employer type X X X X Post-secondary educational institution employer Carnegie classification X Post-secondary educational institution employer public/private status X Type of post-secondary position held X Post-secondary academic rank X Post-secondary tenure status X Attended work-related training in previous year X X X X Reasons for attending work-related training X X X X Annualized salary X X X X Total income before deductions X X X X For unemployed, looking for work during survey week X X X X For unemployed, reasons for not working X X X X Never worked X X X X For unemployed, month and year last worked X X X X For unemployed, job code for last job worked from list of job categories provided   (Eitle & Eitle, 2002;Perna & Titus, 2005;Seidman, 2005;Tierney, 1992). In particular, higher education research on major choice, access, and persistence in STEM have included predictors such as achievement, aptitude (as measured by SAT scores), attitudes towards STEM, and course-taking patterns, and institution type, size, and selectivity, as well as other factors like self-concept, beliefs about mathematics, STEM behaviors, student values, social and cultural capital, and stereotype threat (Dowd, Malcom, & Bensimon, 2009;Dowd, Malcom, & Macias, 2010;Kinzie, 2007;Seymour, 2001). However, these studies all focus on persistence in terms of degree attainment in a STEM major and do not look at what students do with their degrees upon graduation. Instead, they tend to look at transitions that occur between K-12 and higher education, including a look at community college transfers. Little research has been done to consider if any of these factors predict or are associated with continuation in the same or a related field upon graduating. Part, but not all, of this has to do with the type of information collected in the national-level surveys. Because this study has a particular focus on the connection between supply, demand, and identity within retention discourse and because of limitations within the SESTAT data, many of these traditional measures are not used discuss the key dependent, independent, and contextual variables either available in or that I constructed from the 2006 SESTAT data."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "Key dependent variables from the 2006 SESTAT data were based on my analyses of the workforce studies, surveys, and data and are used to measure various aspects of retention as an outcome. These variables are detailed in Table 3  Second, the primary reasons for obtaining work outside of the respondents' highest S&E degree fields were used as a categorical dependent variable to provide the context for why respondents may \"leak\" from the pipeline. The potential reasons from which respondents could choose included: pay or promotion, change in interest, family reasons, job in highest degree unavailable, job location, working conditions, or other. Respondents were able to select multiple reasons and then were asked on the survey to select their singular primary and secondary reasons. Only those who answered that their degrees and occupations are not related in the prior survey question were asked to complete this question. In addition, I further limited the sample to those whose highest degrees were in S&E fields to provide some retention context for this group. This reduced the sample size to 7,165 observations. Third, the level of relatedness between respondents' highest degrees and their current occupations was used as an alternative measure of retention and ordered dependent variable. This variable resulted from a subjective survey question that asked the respondents to select among the following how related their highest degrees and occupations are: not related, somewhat related, and closely related. For this variable, the domain is those respondents who were employed at the time of the survey, limiting the sample to 90,711 observations. "}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "Tables 4, 5, and 6 detail this study's independent variables and the range of values that they can take. Based on the critical discourse analysis of the STEM workforce studies, surveys and data, key independent variables were selected for analysis from the 2006 SESTAT data, including identity and demographic variables. These include sex, minority status, race, ethnicity, citizenship, age, physical disabilities, marriage or partnership status, children living with the respondent (including age groups), annualized salary, total earnings before deductions, and parental/guardian education. Table 4 details the key demographic variables included in this study. In addition, employment-related variables such as occupational field, occupational sector, job code, reasons for unemployment, and secondary reasons for working outside one's field of highest degree are included as independent variables and in descriptive analysis. These variables are detailed in Table 5. Table 6 shows the key education-related variables included as independent variables and in descriptive analysis. These include various levels of degrees obtained (including type, field, and year) are used as independent variables to provide context and illustrate workforce patterns by degree, field, and sector. Varying levels of disaggregation of the data based on these independent variables were used to reflect and then challenge the pipeline ideology. I describe these variables in further detail next."}, {"section_title": "Sex", "text": "As I discussed in Chapter Three, the surveys ask for respondents' gender using two mutually exclusive options for selection: Male and Female, which, I argued, represent a limited view of biological sex. No further information on gender is collected. As such, I use the male/female dichotomy as a dependent variable and refer to it as sex instead of gender, all the while acknowledging that these two labels are both socially constructed. Because so much emphasis on STEM retention is on women, some measure of sex or gender must be included in the analysis, even if it is overly simplistic. In addition, as I will explain further when I discuss the data analysis, I interacted the sex variable with the other independent variables to disrupt this dichotomy and to illustrate the complexity of identity further (Peng et al., 2002;Toutkoushian, Bellas, & Moore, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Race and Ethnicity", "text": "In Chapter Three I also discussed the emphasis in the research on the retention of To address each of these shortcomings, I created a fourth race/ethnicity variable that is intended to place the frame of reference on the Hispanic/Latino population. This construct uses the following categories: American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic Only, Asian, Hispanic Only, Black, Hispanic Only, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic Only, White, Hispanic Only, Multiracial, Hispanic Only, and Non-Hispanic, any race. This not only shifts the standard reference point, but also addresses the growing interest in the literature in Hispanic and Latino retention in STEM (e.g. Dowd, Malcom, & Bensimon, 2009;Dowd, Malcom, & Macias, 2010;Seidman, 2007). Each of these categorical variables is broken into indicator variables for use in the regression models. In addition, to provide further context for the sample, descriptive statistics are provided for the four Hispanic/Latino subgroups: Mexican or Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Other."}, {"section_title": "Physical Disabilities", "text": "As I mentioned in Chapter Three, disability issues in STEM retention are rarely researched, despite the discursive inclusion of \"persons with disabilities\" in the NSF Task Force on Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering. The SESTAT 2006 data contains information on respondents' physical disabilities as measured by a series of scalar questions about levels of difficulty hearing, see, lifting, and walking. The scale is as follows: none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do. If a respondent marks severe or unable to do, they are coded as having a physical disability in SESTAT, rather than being asked directly if they identify as having a physical disability. This indicator is used as an independent variable along with individual indicators for any level of difficulty greater than none for hearing, seeing, lifting, and walking."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "While few workforce studies consider age, age can provide further context into retention demographics. As Shettle (1993) points out, certain age groups may be more likely than others to experience unemployment, despite being highly educated in STEM. Likewise, Teitelbaum (2003) explains that, as certain STEM fields have growing lengths of time to doctoral degree, students may be dissuaded from pursuing those fields because they could mean starting careers and families at older ages. Age group variables in five year increments are also used as independent variables."}, {"section_title": "Citizenship", "text": "As I used the literature to argue in the previous chapter, citizenship is an important factor in the pipeline discourse, whether the underlying fear is about lack of U.S. citizens participating in STEM or about non-U.S. citizens using their STEM education against the U.S. In addition, critical researchers (e.g. Black & Stephan, 2003;Cantwell & Lee, 2010;Stephan & Levin, 2003) have uprooted these fears and even connected them to neoracism. As such, an indicator variable for U.S. citizenship and a categorical variable (divided into individual indicator variables) that accounts for different types of citizenship (native U.S. citizen, naturalized U.S. citizen, permanent resident, and temporary resident) were used as independent variables. In addition, for contextual purposes, citizenship region data is also provided descriptively."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic Status", "text": "Limited measures of socioeconomic status exist in the 2006 SESTAT data; however, there are a few measures that can be used as proxies for socioeconomic status . Annualized salary and total earnings before deductions were selected as current measures of respondents' SES. Father or male guardian education and mother or female guardian education were used to reflect respondents' socioeconomic status at the time that they were making college enrollment and major decisions. Sirin (2005) has shown these measures to be indicative of individual socioeconomic status. While some researchers merge such measures into socioeconomic scales, I have chosen to keep them separate to look at how each measure individually influences retention likelihoods."}, {"section_title": "Family", "text": "As I argued in the previous chapter, as women have been the focus of many pipeline studies, the focus has turned to the influence of family on retention, albeit under problematic rationales. Family, I explained, is most often measured in terms of whether or not a respondent has children or whether or not one has a spouse or, more recently, a partner. The 2006 SESTAT data contains these measures, but also allows for further disaggregation. As such, to represent the basic pipeline model representation of family, indicator variables for whether or not one has children living with them and whether or not one is married/partnered were used as independent variables. To provide further details, indicator variables that account for the ages of the children (under 2, ages 2-5, ages 6-11, ages 12-18, and older than 19) were used to account for the impact that age of the children one is caring for might have on retention outcomes. Likewise, marriage or partnership was expanded beyond a dichotomy to include the following statuses: married, living in a marriage-like relationship, previously but no longer married, and never married. These statuses were broken into dummy variables for use in regression analysis. "}, {"section_title": "Employment", "text": "As employment in the S&E workforce is central to the pipeline discourse, several variables related to employment were included as independent variables, used to narrow the sample for several of the regressions, and used to provide further context. First, is an indicator variable for whether or not the respondent was employed at the time of the survey. This indicator was used to narrow the sample for several regression models, as will be discussed further below. Next, is employer sector, which was broken into dummy variables for K-12, community college, 4-year college or university, medical school, university research institute, other pre-college educational institution, private-for-profit, private-non-profit, self employed (not incorporated), self employed (incorporated), local government, state government, U.S. military, U.S. government, other, and unemployed. In addition, occupational field in terms of major group was used as an independent variable in some cases and to create several of the leak dependent variables, as will be discussed below. This variable contains the following categories: computer & mathematical sciences, life and related sciences, physical and related sciences, social and related sciences, engineering, S&E-related fields, non-S&E fields, and unemployed. As an independent variable, it is broken into dummy variables for each category. Finally, I used additional employment-related variables to provide further context on retention related issues through descriptive analysis. For those who were unemployed at the time of the study, I provide descriptive statistics of the reasons they listed for their unemployment including family responsibilities, illness or disability, layoff, did not need or want work, suitable job unavailable, retired, student, and other. For those who, in one sense were found to have low retention rates and, in another, were found to have high retention rates, a respondent's job code was used in descriptive analysis. This categorical variable contains both field and sector data. Secondary reasons why respondents worked outside the field of their highest S&E degree, which include change in career interest, working conditions, family-related reasons, job location, job in highest degree field unavailable, pay or promotion, other, and no secondary reason were also analyzed descriptively. Table 5 details the values that each of these employment-related variables can take.  "}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Data Analysis", "text": "To analyze the 2006 SESTAT data for retention outcomes, I used a series of logistic regressions. Because each of my dependent variables is categorical, logistic regressions are more appropriate models than linear regressions (Field, 2005;Peng, 2002). As its name implies, linear regressions are used to predict the outcome variable by fitting the data to straight line and assumes that the relationship among the variables is linear as the following equation for a simple linear regression shows: Y is the outcome variable, b 0 is the y-intercept, b 1 is the regression coefficient for predictor variable X 1 as well as the slope of the line, and \u03b5 is the residual terms (Field, 2005). When the outcome variable is dichotomous (or comprised of a series of dichotomies), the relationship is rarely linear. Logistic regressions use natural logarithmic transformations to convert the form of the relationship to a linear structure even if the relationship itself is not. Logistic regressions express the outcome variable in terms of its probability of occurring in the following most basic form: Because this equation expresses the outcome variable in terms of probability in this way, interpretation of the regression coefficients is in the form of e b , which indicates \"the change in odds [i.e. the probability of an event occurring/the probability of that event not occurring] resulting from a unit change in the predictor\" (Field, 2005, p. 225). As such, odds ratios are reported for each regression. For the several pipeline leak dependent variables, I used a binary logit since the leak variables are dichotomous (leak = 1, not a leak = 0). For the dependent variable that represents the seven potential primary reasons why respondents are employed outside the field of their highest S&E degrees, I used a multinomial logit regression (Hilbe, 2005;Long, 1997;Long & Freese, 2006). For the dependent variable that represents the ordered categories for degree-occupation relatedness, I used an ordered logit regression (Hilbe, 2005;Long, 1997;Long & Freese, 2006). I used SPSS version 18 (also known as PASW 18) to code and clean the 2006 SESTAT data and StataSE version 10 to conduct these regression analyses."}, {"section_title": "Binary Logistic Regression Models", "text": "I performed nine different binary logistic regressions to compare and contrast different ways of accounting for identity and S&E fields, particularly against the pipeline model. For each of these model, the sample was all 105,064 cases included in SESTAT. For the first three regressions, I followed the pipeline model assumptions. All three models took as their independent variables sex, the minority indicator measure of race/ethnicity, the disability indicator, the U.S. citizenship indicator, the marriage/partner indicator, and the children living in household indicator. In the first model, highest degree to occupation leak, measured such that S&E-related fields count as non-S&E, was the outcome variable of interest: In the second model, second highest to highest degree leak, measured such that S&Erelated fields count as non-S&E, was the outcome variable of interest: In the third model, third highest to highest degree leak, measured such that S&E-related fields count as non-S&E, was the outcome variable of interest: The fourth binary logit model uses highest degree to occupation leak, measured such that S&E-related fields count as non-S&E, as its outcome variable, and expands on the first model by including the second measure of race and ethnicity instead of the minority indicator and by disaggregating the remaining demographic variables as follows: The fifth through eighth models continue to focus on the highest degree to occupation leak and expand the independent variables included in the models to incorporate measures of socioeconomic status, age, employer sector, and highest degree type and year. The fifth model uses the second measure of race and ethnicity as follows: where The eighth model is the same as the fifth model, except it changes the definition of highest degree to occupation leak such that S&E-related fields count as S&E. In the ninth model, I used a full interaction regression model that interacts the sex variable with every other independent variable provided in the previous models. This model was intended to represent the complicated way in which sex as a social construct overlaps with other identity and social factors. A full interaction regression model that interacts all dummy variables is the equivalent to running two separate regressions -one for males and one for females (Hilbe, 2009). As such, the regression equations for this interaction model are both equivalent to the fifth model -one run where sex = 0 and the other run where sex = 1. For each of the binary logit models, goodness of fit was assessed using classification tables which provide a measure of how well the models predict their outcome variables (Hilbe, 2009;Long & Freese, 2006;Menard, 1995). Classification tables detail the percentage of cases correctly predicted by the sample which can be compared to chance to see if the model improved prediction of the independent variable."}, {"section_title": "Multinomial Logistic Regression Model", "text": "To consider further context for why respondents might not be retained between obtaining their highest S&E degrees and entering the workforce, I ran a multinomial logistic regression in which the dependent variable was primary reason why respondents are employed outside the field of their highest S&E degrees. This variable is an unordered categorical variable comprised of the following categories: pay or promotion, change in interest, family reasons, job in highest degree unavailable, job location, working conditions, or other. For this model, the sample (n=7,165) is those who were considered to be highest degree to occupation leaks and who have listed a primary reason. Multinomial logit models essentially simultaneously estimate binary logits for all comparisons among the alternative categories in the dependent variable (Long & Freese, 2006). The formal model for multinomial logit regression is: where, in the case of the specific model that was used in this study, \uf0b7 \u03b2= a vector of the log-odds coefficients associated with each explanatory term for the comparison binary logit model indicated by the two terms in its subscript. The goodness of fit for this model was assessed using the fitstat command in Stata, which produces a number of measures of fit. As recommended by Long & Freese (2006), McKelvey and Zavoina's R 2 will be reported as it most closely approximates R 2 as it would be obtained for linear regression models. While it is not a perfect measure, it comes the closest in approximating the amount of variance in the predictor explained by the variables included in the model."}, {"section_title": "Ordered Logistic Regression Models", "text": "For the final regression model, I used an ordered logistic regression to consider highest degree-occupation relatedness as an alternative to leaking as measure of retention outcomes. As in binary logistic regressions, an ordered logistic regression model transforms the form of the relationship between the outcome and independent variables using natural logarithmic transformations; however, in ordered logistic regressions the outcome variable is a categorical variable which has three or more ordered levels (Hilbe, 2009). Highest degree-occupation relatedness is measured in terms of the ordered categories: not related, somewhat related, and closely related. Hilbe (2009) explains that the categorical dependent variable can be viewed as a continuous variable with a series of cut points that separate the different levels of the variable. In the case of highest degreeoccupation relatedness, these levels and cuts can be depicted as follows: Highest degree-occupation relatedness can be seen as a continuous line that is cut twice to delineate between three levels of relatedness. The ordered relationship then can be described in terms of probabilities along this line. More specifically, the form of the relationship is defined as the natural log of \"the ratio of probability of levels under or equal to a given cut to the probability of those over the cut, for each ascending level of the cuts\" (Hilbe, 2009, p.356). First, I modeled the pipeline assumptions about how to account for identity and family factors via a basic set of indicator variables as follows: In both models, b n is the regression coefficient associated with each independent variable and each \u03b1 j is the cut which also act as intercepts. The ordered logit regression for highest degree-occupation relatedness actually runs two regressions, using each cut as an intercept and relies on the proportional odds assumption, which assumes that the model coefficients (each b n ) for each cut are equal (Hilbe, 2009). As such, testing the goodness of fit for an ordered logit regression involves testing the proportional odds assumption first by predicting the probabilities that respondents will belong to each of the three levels of degree-occupation relatedness, then by using Brant's test both with standard errors and finally by adjusting the standard errors by robust stand errors, clustered by degree-occupation relatedness. If there is no appreciable difference in the respective standard errors, the model is a well-fitted ordered logistic model."}, {"section_title": "Pilot Study", "text": "Prior to obtaining the 2006 SESTAT data, which is a restricted-access dataset requiring a user agreement that includes an affidavit of non-disclosure, I tested these measures and methods with a pilot study of the 2003 publicly-available SESTAT data. The pilot study illustrated that that the ways in which sex and race statistically interact with one another and how retention is conceptualized make much difference in understanding who is doing what STEM work. For example, when retention was measured in terms of pipeline leaks, white women, women of color, and men of color were the populations least likely to be retained. Whereas when retention was measured in terms of fit between one's degree and one's occupation, then this population was the most likely to be retained. Further details on this pilot study can be found in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "The limitations of this study are shaped by its source of data, in its reporting, and in its methods. Many of the limitations of this study are inherent in the SESTAT surveys and their resulting data, as I have explained at length in this chapter and in the preceding chapter. However, I argue that these limitations often deter researchers from engaging in critical analyses of these data, when such analyses are still possible. There is an abundance of data available in the SESTAT surveys and this study only briefly touches on the surface of what is possible. In addition, in the reporting of the quantitative findings, I attempted to strike a balance between results that are meaningful with those that are statistically significant. Results can carry meaning without being statistically significant and can be statistically significant without being meaningful (Toutkoushian, Bellas, & Moore, 2007;Ziliak & McCloskey, 2011). In this sense, when a balance could not be found, I erred on the side of focusing on results that were meaningful. Finally, quantitative methods, even those that are critical, are limited in their ability to understand how students and graduates make sense of their identities and career and educational pathways, let alone how they perceive the relationship between those identities and pathways. While the data does provide some reasons for the respondents' positions, a qualitative approach is better suited to delving into the realm of personal retention experiences. "}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "As mentioned in chapters three and four, the 2006 SESTAT data contains 105,064 responses from individuals who either received a college degree (bachelor's or higher) in a science or engineering field or who work as a scientist or engineer and have a bachelor's degree or higher in any field (National Science Foundation, 2008). Tables 7, 8, and 9 show the descriptive statistics surrounding key demographic-, employment-, and education-related variables for these respondents. Roughly 39% of the sample identifies as female and 18% are recoded as minorities (i.e. did not identify as only white or only Asian). About 40% are under the age of 40 and 35% are between the ages of 40 and 54. In Table 7, I show four measures of combined race and ethnicity. The first three measures are provided within the SESTAT data. Measure 1 is a minority indicator variable for all respondents who did not identify as only white or only Asian. Measures 2 and 3 view Hispanic identification as separate from, or rolled into, the other racial categories respectively 18 . I constructed the fourth measure to account for racial identification solely within the Hispanic population in the sample. Within the second and third measures of race and ethnicity, the majority of the respondents identify as white (69% and 76% respectively), followed by Asian (14%) and black (7%), with the fewest respondents identifying as multiracial (1 and 2% respectively), American Indian/Alaska Native (.6 and .8% respectively) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (.4%). About 8% of the respondents identify as Hispanic and of those, about 36% indicated that they are Mexican or Chicano (about 3% of the total respondents), 24% Puerto Rican (about 2% of the total respondents), 7% Cuban (about 0.6% of the total respondents), and 32% Other (about 2% of the total respondents). As seen in Table 7 under the fourth measure of race and ethnicity, most of the respondents who identify as Hispanic also identify as white only (83%), but unlike those who do not identify as Hispanic, this is followed by multiracial (8%), black (7%), American Indian/Alaska Native (1%), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.6%), with the fewest respondents indicating that they are Asian (0.4%). As mentioned in Chapters Three and Four, the SESTAT 2006 data contains information on respondents' physical disabilities as measured by a series of scalar questions about levels of difficulty hearing, see, lifting, and walking. Rather than being asked directly if they have a physical disability, if a respondent marks the highest level of difficulty in any of these areas, they are considered within the SESTAT data as having a physical disability. In terms of current socioeconomic status, the mean salary of the respondents is $65,604 and the mean total income before deductions is $70,500. In terms of socioeconomic status factors that would have influenced college going patterns (Sirin, 2005), I have included measures of parent/guardian education. Respondents' male guardians overall have a larger representation in higher education degrees than do their female guardians (44% compared to 33%). Most respondents' male and female guardians have a high school or equivalent education (22% and 30% respectively), followed by a bachelor's degree (21% and 20% respectively). Very few of the respondents' female guardians have a degree at the professional or doctoral level (1.6% and 1.5% respectively). Around 14% of their male or female guardians have less than a high school education. As I explained in Chapters Three and Four, the family characteristics accounted for in the 2006 SESTAT data surround partnership (now expanded beyond marriage to include what the surveys call \"marriage-like relationships\") and children. 68% of the respondents are married, 4% are living in marriage-like relationships, 8% were previously, but are no longer, married, and 19% were never married. Around 43% have children living with them and of those in the sample who have at least one child living with them 19 , 19% have children under the age of 2, 29% are between the ages of 2 and 5, 38% are between the ages of 6 and 11, 40% are between the ages of 12 and 18 and 19% are older than 19. .1911 .39315 Notes: a Unless otherwise noted, n = 105,064. b These statistics are for those who have one or more of their children living with them (n = 45,602). c These statistics are for those who have earned a second degree (n=62,522). d These statistics are for those who have earned a third degree (n=27,472). Table 8 provides descriptive statistics for employment-related variables. The survey respondents have experienced relatively high employment rates in the year that the survey was conducted. 86% of the respondents are employed, with 34% working in the private-for-profit sector, 19% working in institutions of higher education, 12% as self-employed, 9% working for the government, and 5% working in K-12 education. Of those who are employed, 14% work in computer and mathematical sciences, 8% in life and related sciences, 6% in physical and related sciences, 8% in social and related sciences, 17% in engineering, 19% in S&E-related fields, and 29% in non-S&E-related fields.  Table 9 includes descriptive statistics for education-related variables. In terms of their own education, 40% of the respondents have bachelor's degrees as their highest degree, followed by professional degrees (31%), master's degrees (23%), and then doctorates (5%). 75% of those degrees are in the five traditionally defined S&E areas, the largest proportion of which is in engineering (29%of the S&E highest degrees). 13% obtained their highest degrees in S&E-related fields and 12% did so in non-S&E-related fields. Most obtained their highest degree in 1990 or later (56%). 62,522 (60%) of the respondents earned at least two degrees and 27,472 (26%) earned at least a third degree. As expected, respondents second highest degrees were mostly earned between 1975 and 1999 and their third highest degrees between 1965 and 1994. Second highest degrees were mostly bachelor's degrees (57%) or master's degrees (41%) while third highest degrees were almost exclusively bachelor's degrees (97%), with similar proportions of those degrees coming from S&E and non-S&E fields to their highest degrees. S&E second and third highest degrees tended to come from social and related sciences rather than engineering, however.  : 1975-1979.0843 .27785 Highest Degree Year: 1980-1984.0953 .29364 Highest Degree Year: 1985-1989 .1062 .30811 Highest Degree Year: 1990-1994.1198.32477 Highest Degree Year: 1995 .  : 1965-1969.1115.31475 Third Highest Degree Year: 1970-1974.1289.33513 Third Highest Degree Year: 1975-1979.1236.32911 Third Highest Degree Year: 1980-1984.1371.34394 Third Highest Degree Year: 1985-1989.1294.33569 Third Highest Degree Year: 1990-1994.1310.33741 Third Highest Degree Year: 1995 .0786 .26910 Third Highest Degree Year: [2000][2001][2002][2003][2004] .01416 .11815 Notes: a Unless otherwise noted, n = 105,064. b These statistics are for those who have earned a second degree (n=62,522). c These statistics are for those who have earned a third degree (n=27,472). For the first set, the traditional pipeline ideology is used. In other words, pipeline leaks are defined such that fields and degrees that are clustered within SESTAT under the category S&E-related do not count as S&E. In the second set, they do. As mentioned in Chapter Four, those who obtain a degree in S&E and then go on to obtain a second degree or occupation in non-S&E are counted as leaks and the respective leak dummy variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. As you can see, in both ways of accounting for S&E-related fields, respondents who count as leaks tend to do so between obtaining their highest degrees and occupation (32% and 35% respectively). When counting S&Erelated fields as S&E compared to counting them as non-S&E, we see a slight increase in the percentage of respondents who are leaks at all levels which indicates that those who obtain S&E-related degrees have a tendency to get additional degrees or work in areas that are strictly defined as non-S&E. Roughly 40% of all respondents have \"leaked from the pipeline\" and re-entered it at least once, which points to the importance of understanding educational and career paths in a non-linear and, perhaps, cyclic way. In addition, about 3% of the respondents have no degrees in S&E, but work in S&E. While this proportion is small, it indicates that S&E education is not the only means by which individuals enter into S&E careers. The SESTAT data also provides information on why respondents work outside their highest S&E degree field. Table 10 reports on the primary and secondary reasons. Pay or promotion (25%), change in career interest (23%), and job in highest degree area unavailability (29%) are the top three primary reasons provided by the respondents who are working outside their highest S&E degree field. Aside from not listing a secondary reason, pay or promotion (18%), working conditions (17%), and job location (16%) are the top three secondary reasons reported. As job unavailability ranks highly among the primary reasons that respondents are seeking employment in fields other than their highest S&E degree field, I have included reasons for unemployment in Table 10 as well. There were 14,353 respondents who were unemployed at the time of the survey. Aside from retirement (55%) and not needing or wanting work (26%), family responsibilities (17%), continuing education as a student (15%) and suitable job unavailability (13%) are the major reasons respondents are unemployed. Lastly, Table 10 reports descriptive statistics for degree-occupation relatedness, which is another potential measure for retention. Of those who are employed, 60% of the respondents indicated that their highest degree is closely related to the principal activities of their occupations. 26% of the respondents have highest degrees and occupations that are at least somewhat related. Only 14% reported that their highest degree and occupations are not related. This is about 12% of the total respondents who would not be retained by this measure, compared to the 32% of respondents who count as highest degree to occupation leaks. .6022 .48944 Notes: a Unless otherwise noted, n = 105,064. b These statistics are for those who responded that their degrees and occupations are not related and whose highest degree was in S&E (n = 10,736). c These statistics are for those who were unemployed at the time of the survey (n=14,353). d These statistics are for those who were employed at the time of the survey (n=90,711)."}, {"section_title": "Disrupting the Pipeline: Comparing Identity and S&E Measures in Binary Logit", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regression Models", "text": "In this section, I present the results of several binary logit regressions that used pipeline leaks as the dependent variable. I consider multiple ways of accounting for identity factors and contrast those with the traditional pipeline discourse on \"women and minorities\" in S&E. Presented with each binary logit regression table are the results of the classification table assessment of fit, which includes the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes by chance versus by the model. Table 11 presents the results from a series of binary logit regressions. Regressions 1 through 3 rely on basic pipeline assumptions. These regressions take as their independent variables sex, a minority indicator (race/ethnicity measure 1), a physical disabilities indicator, a U.S. citizenship indicator, a marriage indicator, and a children indicator and highest degree to occupation leak, second highest to highest degree leak, and third highest to second highest degree leak as their dependent variables, respectively. Regression 4 also has the highest degree to occupation leak as its dependent variable, but the independent variables for race/ethnicity, physical disabilities, citizenship, marriage, and children are expanded beyond just singular indicators. For the full details of these models, see Appendix B, Table 24. white, non-Hispanics respectively and while holding the other predictors constant. The measures hearing, lifting, vision, and walking difficulties have lost their statistical significance in model 5, and those with difficulty hearing, lifting, and seeing are now slightly less likely to leak than their counterparts when in model 4, this was only true for those with vision difficulty. Native U.S. citizens have higher odds of leaking than naturalized or non-U.S. citizens. Those who are living in marriage-like relationships are 1.2 times more likely to leak than those who are married, holding the other predictors constant. While model 4 showed that those without children living with them have higher odds of leaking than those who do, model 5 shows that those will children ages 6-18 living with them have higher odds of leaking than those who do not, though the level of statistical significance of these findings is not as high. In addition to these measures, model 5 also shows that those who are employed in K-12 have higher odds of leaking then those who are employed in any other sector except for those who are self-employed, in local government, or in the military. The exception to this is that unemployed respondents are 24.4 times more likely to leak than those in the  In Table 12, models 5 through 7 use different measures of race/ethnicity as independent variables. Model 5 uses the second measure of race/ethnicity from Table 7 in which racial measures are disaggregated separately from Hispanic/Latino identity (i.e. those who identify as Hispanic or Latino are given their own category and all racial groups with which they also identify are lumped together under the category, \"Hispanic, any race\") . Model 6 uses the third measure of race/ethnicity from Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Hispanic subgroups are significantly more likely to leak than those who are white and Hispanic. These findings again reiterate that much difference is made in race/ethnicity-related retention likelihood when we shift how we account for racial and ethnic identity and its disaggregation in the data. Retention, even when measured as pipeline leaks, is more complicated than what the \"women and minorities are/will be leaking\" discourse allows for. This discourse often assumes the categories \"women\" and \"minorities\" are mutually exclusive and rarely considers interactions among race, class, sex and/or gender. To consider the possibility that, for example, being a female of color influences whether one is a leak or not differentially than does being a white female or a white male, crosstabulations were calculated using the traditional definition of S&E in which S&Erelated fields count as non-S&E. As is shown by the counts and percentages offered in   than pay or promotion is 1.8 times greater for females than males, family reasons rather than working conditions is 2.6 times greater for females than males, family reasons rather than job location is 3.4 times greater for females than males, family reasons rather than change in interest is 2.8 times greater for females than males, family reasons rather than pay or promotion is 4.7 times greater for females than males, and job in doctoral degree is not available rather than pay or promotion is 1.5 times greater for females than males. Clearly, family reasons stand out more in females' reporting of their primary reasons for working outside the field of their highest degree despite the statistical insignificance of many of the children variables and the statistically significant higher likelihood of leaking associated with being unmarried or living in a marriage-like relationship compared to those who are married in the previous binary logit regressions. There may be several reasons for this. One is that family is more than just one's children and state-sanctioned spouse. The participants in this sample may have other family ties that they wish to prioritize and that are not accurately being accounted for in the data.    Coefficients and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. Sample (n=7165) is those who are considered to be highest degree to occupation leaks and who have listed a primary reason for all models. McKelvey and Zavoina's R 2 =.168. Table 16, column 1 reports the findings for non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander respondents. Although none of the results hold statistical significance, some key findings for this group are that, holding all other predictors constant, for non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander compared to white, non-Hispanic respondents, the odds of working outside the field of one's highest S&E degree because of working conditions rather than pay or promotion are 2.3 times greater, job location rather than pay or promotion are 1.3 times greater, change of interest rather than pay or promotion are 1.3 times greater, job unavailability rather than family reasons are 2.4 times greater, and job unavailability rather than pay or promotion are 1.2 times greater. For these respondents, pay and promotion carries the least weight in influencing the likelihood that they will obtain work outside of their highest S&E degree fields, while job unavailability and working conditions seem to matter most. Table 16, column 2 shows the findings for Hispanic or Latino respondents of any race. Some key findings for this group are that, holding all other predictors constant, for Hispanic or Latino compared to white, non-Hispanic respondents, the odds of working outside the field of one's highest S&E degree because of job location rather than working conditions are 1.3 times greater, job unavailability rather than working conditions are 1.4 times greater, job unavailability rather than job location are 1.1 times greater, and job unavailability rather than family reasons are 1.4 times greater. Other reasons that are unnamed in the survey also outweigh family reasons for these respondents. For Hispanic or Latino respondents job unavailability in their degree field stands out as a major reason for working outside their field of highest S&E degrees. Table 16, column 3 reports the findings for non-Hispanic multiracial respondents. While none of the results are statistically significant, some key findings for this group are that, holding all other predictors constant, for non-Hispanic multiracial compared to white, non-Hispanic respondents, the odds of working outside the field of one's highest S&E degree because of job location rather than working conditions are 1.6 times greater, job location rather than working conditions are 1.6 times greater, change of interest rather than working conditions are 1.2 times greater, job unavailability rather than working conditions are 1.5 times greater, job unavailability rather than change of interest are 1.4 times greater, job unavailability rather than family reasons are 1.6 times greater, and job unavailability rather than pay or promotion are 1.5 times greater. Like non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and black respondents, other reasons that are not named in the survey also account for a great deal of likelihood of working outside the field of non-Hispanic multiracial respondents' highest S&E degrees. For these respondents, it seems that job location and job unavailability weigh highly in their likelihood of working outside the field of their highest S&E degrees. Notes: Coefficients and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. Sample (n=7165) is those who are considered to be highest degree to occupation leaks and who have listed a primary reason for all models. McKelvey and Zavoina's R 2 =.168. Table 17, column 1 reports the findings for those respondents who have indicated high levels of difficulty hearing, seeing, walking and/or lifting. Some key findings for this group are that, holding all other predictors constant, for those with physical disabilities compared to those without physical disabilities, the odds of working outside the field of one's highest S&E degree because of job location rather than working conditions are 1.7 times greater, job location rather than pay or promotion are 1.4 times greater, job unavailability rather than working conditions are 1.2 times greater, job unavailability rather than change in interest are 1.2 times greater, and job unavailability rather than family reasons are 1.2 times greater. Again, other unnamed reasons also rank highly for these respondents and delving into those reasons could provide further insight into the retention of those with physical difficulties. Job unavailability in their highest S&E degree fields and job location also matter most for these respondents. Table 17, column 2 shows the findings for those respondents who have children living with them. Some key findings for this group are that, holding all other predictors constant, for those with children living with them compared those living without children, the odds of working outside the field of one's highest S&E degree because of family reasons rather than working conditions are 3.3 times greater, family reasons rather than job location are 3.7 times greater, family reasons rather than change in interest are 3.4 times greater, family reasons rather than pay or promotion are 2.5 times greater, job unavailability rather than working conditions are 1.2 times greater, job unavailability rather than job location are 1.4 times greater, and job unavailability rather than change in interest are 1.2 times greater. Not surprisingly, family reasons have much influence in the likelihood of working outside the highest S&E degree field of respondents who live with children. Table 17, column 10 reports the findings for U.S. citizens. While few of the results are statistically significant, some key findings for this group are that, holding all other predictors constant, for U.S. citizens compared to non-U.S. citizens, the odds of working outside the field of one's highest S&E degree because of change of interest rather than working conditions are 1.14 times greater, change in interest rather than job location are 1.6 times greater, change of interest rather than pay or promotion are 1.15 times greater, and family reasons rather than job location are 1.3 times greater. While change in interest acts as a major reason for U.S. citizens to work outside the field of their highest S&E degrees, job location and job unavailability, on the other hand, stands out for non-U.S. citizens. Coefficients and odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. Sample (n=7165) is those who are considered to be highest degree to occupation leaks and who have listed a primary reason for all models. McKelvey and Zavoina's R 2 =.168. Taken together, these results indicate the need to further explore ways of accounting for the influence and meaning of family related to retention and to unpack other reasons that respondents might have for working outside their field of highest S&E degrees. The results also point to job unavailability as a major reason for respondents who were the least likely to be retained in the previous section to work outside their field of highest S&E degree. In the next section, I continue to analyze the 2006 SESTAT data, this time considering an alternative measure of retention: degree-occupation relatedness."}, {"section_title": "Retention as Degree-Occupation Relatedness", "text": "Thus far, I have presented regression analyses on S&E retention that trouble the pipeline narrative while still using \"leaks\" as the measure of retention. In this section, I use a different definition of retention that accounts for self-reported S&E degreeoccupation relatedness. Degree-occupation relatedness is a set of ordered categories (not related, somewhat related, and closely related) and is used as the dependent variable in the ordered logit regressions. For these regression analyses, only those who were employed at the time of the survey were included in the sample, reducing the number of observations to 90,711. Table 18 presents the results of the ordered logit regressions. For the full details of these models, please see Appendix B, Table 27. Model 1 again represents the most basic pipeline assumptions, like model 1 in Table 11. Model 2 expands the independent variables to broaden the demographic categories and include contextual information on the type and timing of degree and occupational sector, like the models in Table 12, and also adds in degree and occupational field. Column 3 provides the means for those who are employed, have high degree-occupation relatedness, and are highest degreeoccupation leaks (n=6,534) to provide some further context about those respondents who would be considered to have low retention rates by the pipeline model, but high retention rates according to degree-occupation relatedness. Notes: a For models 1 and 2, odds ratio terms are reported and an intercept term is included in each model. *, **, and *** indicate statistically significant at the .001, .01, and .05 levels respectively. n = 90,711. While Brant's test for proportional odds was violated in both models, no appreciable difference was seen in the respective standard and robust standard errors. b Column 3 displays the means for those who are employed, have high degree-occupation relatedness, and are highest degree-occupation leaks. n=6534. Model 1 in Table 18 shows that, holding the other predictors constant, females are 1.032 times more likely than males, minorities are about 5% less likely than nonminorities, those who are married are 1.2 times more likely than those who are not, those who have children living in their households are 1.1 times more likely than those who do not, those who are U.S. citizens are roughly 30% less likely than those who are not, and those with high physical difficulties are about 13% less likely than those without high physical difficulties to have high degree occupation relatedness. While some of these findings mesh with what we saw in model 1 from Table 11 when retention was measured as pipeline highest degree to occupation leaks, this is not the case for females. While the pipeline model showed that females are 1.4 times more likely to leak, model 1 in Table   18 shows that females are more likely than males to have high degree occupation relatedness. Model 2 in Table 18 expands the independent variables in Model 1 to broaden the demographic categories, include contextual information on the type and timing of degree and occupational sector, and also adds in degree and occupational fields. This regression shows that those who are employed in the social and related sciences have the highest likelihoods of having high degree-occupation relatedness. In addition to this finding, I present some key differences between model 5 in Table 12 (the fully expanded pipeline model) and model 2 in Table 18. While model 5, Table 12 shows that non-Hispanic American Indian/Native Alaskans have a 1.2 times greater likelihood of leaking than white, non-Hispanics, model 2, Table 18 shows that non-Hispanic American Indian/Native Alaskans have a 1.2 times greater likelihood than white non-Hispanics of having high degree-occupation relatedness. While model 5, Table 12 shows that Hispanics of any race have a 1.3 times greater likelihood of leaking than white, non-Hispanics, model 2, Table 18 shows that Hispanics of any race have a 1.04 times greater likelihood than white non-Hispanics of having high degree-occupation relatedness. While model 5, Table 12 shows that non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders have odds of leaking that are about 10% less than white, non-Hispanics, model 2, Table   18 shows that non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders have odds that are about 14% less than white non-Hispanics of having high degree-occupation relatedness. While model 5, Table 12 shows that those who have difficulty walking have a 1.03 times greater likelihood of leaking than those who do not, model 2, Table 18 shows that those who have difficulty walking have a 1.05 times greater likelihood than those who do not of having high degree-occupation relatedness. Although not statistically significant in either model, having a female guardian with an education that is between the high school and professional degree levels (inclusive) is associated both with higher odds of leaking and with higher odds of having high degree-occupation relatedness compared to those with female guardians that have less than a high school education. While model 5, Table 12 shows that respondents with children between the ages of 6 and 18 living with them have a greater likelihood of leaking than those who do not, model 2, Table 18 shows that respondents with children between the ages of 6 and 18 living with them have a greater likelihood than those who do not of having high degree-occupation relatedness. These findings complicate how we understand retention even further by showing that it is possible for respondents in this sample to both count as leaks and have highly related S&E degrees and occupations. To explore this intersection further, column 3 in Their mean annualized salary is above $76,000 and their mean income before deductions is above $82,000. A large proportion of the respondents are employed in the private-forprofit sector (29%). 12% are employed in K-12, 14% at 4-year colleges and universities, and 11% in the private-non-profit sector. 53% are educated at the master's or professional level, 31% obtained their highest degrees between 2000 and 2004, and 51% obtained those degrees in social and related sciences.  Table 19 do not require a far stretch of the imagination to see how respondents might be utilizing their S&E degrees in their occupations. Counselors and social workers likely have degrees from the social and behavioral sciences that inform their work. Increases in science and technology management make the high representation of managers in the leak/degree-occupation relatedness intersection unsurprising. Marketing, sales, accounting, and insurance work can be math intensive. Science and technology patenting law is a growing field which could explain the presence of lawyers and judges in this table. Farming, fishing, and forestry can all be benefitted from degrees from the agricultural and life sciences.

Chapter Three answered the first two research questions: 1. In what ways does the pipeline model underlie current STEM workforce studies? 2. What assumptions are embedded within the national level surveys used by the majority of these studies? In that chapter, I described the pipeline ideology and, drawing on critical theory, offered several critiques of its underlying assumptions. As discussed, the pipeline model's shortcomings include its flawed predictions and supply-side focus, poor measurements, linearity and inability to account for varied career paths, tendency to homogenize people, fields, sectors, and stages, discursive view of people as passive pipeline \"flow,\" and lack of focus on systemic change and power relations, particularly those related to gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, and citizenship. I demonstrated how each of these flaws has made its way into contemporary studies on STEM education and work and into the surveys and datasets upon which they are based."}, {"section_title": "Findings from the Critical Quantitative Analyses", "text": "In Chapter Five, I applied the findings from Chapter Three to replicate and then disrupt the pipeline model through critical quantitative analyses of the 2006 restrictedaccess SESTAT data. Chapter Five addressed my third research question: 3. How might alternative assumptions (e.g. about identity, what counts as STEM, how to measure 'retention') produce different interpretations of the survey data?"}, {"section_title": "Disrupting the Pipeline: Complicating Identity Measures", "text": "Using a series of logistic regressions, I first replicated the pipeline model assumptions which use leaks as a measure of retention and focus primarily on high levels of aggregation for identity characteristics. These models had the expected results: females, racial and ethnic minorities, those with physical disabilities, and U.S. citizens were found to have higher odds of leaking between third and second highest degrees, second highest and highest degrees, and between their highest degree and occupation than their respective counterparts. This is the story that is told in the discourse underlying much of STEM recruitment and retention efforts. To disrupt this discourse, I then presented several binary logit regressions that continued to use highest degree to occupation leaks as the measure of retention, but that unpacked identity and demographic related variables, such as marriage or partnership status and parental status, and included additional variables for age, socioeconomic status, employer sector and highest degree type and year. By disaggregating various measures for race/ethnicity and interacting sex and race/ethnicity variables, I showed that retention resists the simple \"women and minorities are leaking\" story espoused by the traditional pipeline narrative. The deeper levels of disaggregation used in the models demonstrates two major points: first, there is great variation in retention likelihood within and between racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly when mediated by sex, that is largely unaccounted for in the pipeline ideology; second, contrary to much contemporary discourse, it is both possible and feasible to construct models that better account for some of the complexity the pipeline washes over. For example, in terms of highest degree to occupation retention, some models showed that, compared to whites, those who identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, black, or multiracial had higher odds of leaking and Asians and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders had lower odds of leaking, while others illustrated that the American Indian/Alaska Native, black, and multiracial Hispanic subgroups actually had lower odds of leaking and Asians and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Hispanic subgroups were significantly more likely to leak than those who were white and Hispanic. In addition, for males, identifying as black or Hispanic had a larger impact on a respondent's chances of leaking than it did for females and for females, identifying as non-Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native or multiracial had a larger impact on a respondent's chances of leaking than it did for males. Most studies that consider gender and race compare males in the aggregate to females in the aggregate (e.g., Abriola & Davies, 2006;Lal, Yoon, & Carlson, 1999;Rapoport, 2004) and whites to various racial groups, sometimes somewhat disaggregated and at other times aggregated to a \"minority\" group (e.g., Castillo-Chavez & Castillo-Garsow, 2006). While some studies have considered the retention of women of color (Hines et al, 1994; Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, 1995;SJB Research Consulting, Inc, 2004), they do not compare and contrast results within and between sex or gender groups. Few of these studies on women of color disaggregate racial and ethnic categories and, when they do, they tend to focus in on one particular racial group (e.g. Hanson, 2004) or they exclude smaller racial and ethnic subgroups because of statistical significance issues (e.g. SJB Research Consulting, Inc, 2004). This study contributes to these efforts by highlighting the importance of considering between and within group patterns and exploring varying levels of disaggregation of racial and ethnic categories in the study of retention. The findings for the series of binary logit models illustrated similar results when disaggregating types of physical disability and citizenship status, demonstrating the need to delve further into a category or variable's content. For instance, at times, those with vision difficulties have lower likelihoods of leaking that those without and those with walking difficulties have higher likelihoods of leaking than those without, especially for males. This adds to the little research on disability in STEM retention, which is mostly qualitative (e.g. , by demonstrating that the type of disability, especially within and between additional demographic subgroups, can make a difference in likelihood of retention. For citizenship measures, naturalized U.S. citizens tended to have higher likelihoods of leaking than native U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens and, in some instances, native U.S. citizens had lower leak likelihoods than temporary residents. This further disrupts the pipeline discourse fears that non-U.S. citizens are \"stealing\" the STEM positions that \"should\" belong to U.S. citizens or are taking their STEM degrees back to their countries of origin only to use them against the U.S. (Black & Stephan, 2003;Stephan & Levin, 2003). Those who are not native U.S. citizens, but are naturalized, are likely to reside in the U.S. for a long period of time and thereby would be using their S&E degrees in the U.S. and not against it. This group is most at risk of leaking and, at times, native U.S. citizens experience the higher retention likelihoods than non-U.S. citizens, particularly temporary residents."}, {"section_title": "Disrupting the Pipeline: Complicating STEM Measures", "text": "In addition, I shifted the definition of what counts as S&E work to include those fields labeled as S&E-related within one of the binary logit models. This definitional change led to a shift in likelihoods of leaking for several groups. These findings indicated that those groups who were less previously likely to leak, but are now more likely to leak (i.e. males, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and naturalized U.S. citizens) may have a tendency to obtain their degrees in S&E related fields, but then work in fields that are strictly defined as non-S&E. In terms of the sector data, these findings also pointed to those sectors where work defined as S&E-related may likely reside (i.e. in the U.S. military, local government, and self-employment). These findings indicate that even the definition of S&E itself makes an impact on how the S&E retention story is told. The findings mesh with research on previous years of SESTAT data that argues that the size of the STEM workforce varies greatly depending on how it is measured (Pollak, 1999;Wilkinson, 2002). These studies only reported counts and percentages and did not look at how retention likelihood trends vary based on what counts as S&E. This study contributes to this literature by using a more recent version of the SESTAT data and by taking a different analytic approach via regression analysis that points to where S&E-related, but not often included, work is likely to be taking place."}, {"section_title": "Disrupting the Pipeline: Providing Context", "text": "To provide further context for the reasons why respondents work outside the field of their highest S&E degrees, I used their primary reasons as a categorical dependent variable in a multinomial regression. This particular regression illustrated that family reasons stand out more in females' and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives' reporting of their primary reasons for working outside the field of their highest degree. This is contradiction to the statistical insignificance of many of the children variables and the statistically significant higher likelihood of leaking associated with being unmarried or living in a marriage-like relationship compared to those who are married in the previous binary logit regressions. Further, family reasons here are not narrowly defined in terms of one's children or marriage as they are in the binary logit models and in many other studies (e.g. Cuny & Aspray, 2002;Rapoport, 2004;Shettle, 1997). The importance of family outside of marriage and children to respondents' retention outcomes once again points to a need for further research. In this instance, additional research would allow for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes family and the family reasons listed for S&E degree holders and workers. Job unavailability in their highest S&E degree field also stood out for many of the racial and ethnic minority subgroups and for those with physical disabilities as did \"other\" reasons that were not named in the surveys. Job unavailability was also a major reason influencing the likelihood of working outside the highest S&E degree field for non-U.S. citizens. These findings resonate with the critics of the pipeline model's workforce shortage claims and focus on supply without regard to demand. These critics argue that unemployment rates and surpluses of scientists and engineers, not shortage of supply, is the reality of the S&E workforce (Black & Stephan, 2005;Shettle, 1997;Teitelbaum, 2003). These findings point to job unavailability as a major influence on retention rates at the highest degree to occupation level, particularly for racial and ethnic minorities and non-U.S. citizens who are often the focus of recruitment initiatives."}, {"section_title": "Disrupting the Pipeline: Complicating Retention", "text": "Lastly, to use an alternative definition of retention, I performed an ordered logit regression using highest degree-occupation relatedness as the variable of interest. The findings from this regression further complicated how retention is understood. The findings show that it is possible for respondents to both count as leaks and have highly related S&E degrees and occupations. In many cases, those who were most likely to count as leaks were also most likely to have high degree-occupation relatedness (e.g. females, minorities, especially non-Hispanic American Indian/Native Alaskans and Hispanics, those with walking difficulties, and those with children between the ages of 6 and 18 living with them). Additionally, in the expanded model, doctoral degree holders were most likely to work in occupations that were closely related to their degrees and women and men had similar likelihoods of close degree-occupation relatedness. This supports the findings of Fox and Stephan's (2001) study that used the 1993 SDR data which found that male and female doctoral degree holders were roughly equally employed in fields that were closely related to their degrees. They argued that more women than men were filling in the lower paid, \"left-over\" positions in academia. This work expands upon these findings to include measures for race/ethnicity, physical disability, family, and all degree types, and to consider more closely those fields that constitute the \"left-over\" spaces of employment. These findings showed that measures of S&E work largely exclude educational and management work, as well as other fields in which ties to S&E are not difficult to see (e.g. farming and accounting). These findings contribute to the STEM retention research that includes analyses of field and sector (Regets, 2006;Tsapogas, 2004). Previous research has used field and sector to highlight trends surrounding additional degree attainment and employment rates, sector, and salaries. This study's findings add to this work by considering which demographic groups and what fields and sectors are likely to have high STEM degree-occupation relatedness despite being categorized as \"non-STEM\" work. Such an approach sheds light on retention patterns as well as usage of degrees earned in the workforce."}, {"section_title": "On Power and Context", "text": "Science, whether at the intent of scientists or not, has a long history of constructing difference in ways that maintain the power dynamics already at play within the social structure. Such a history should not be forgotten, especially when current policy requests that women and people of color serve the nation through scientific work. Harding (2006) points out three major discriminatory practices within science that have all been defended under the argument that science is value-neutral. The first, she explains, took place \"[f]rom the beginning of the nineteenth century until well after World War II [when] biological and biomedical sciences sought to divide and rank human groups, persistently 'discovering' the natural inferiority of non-Europeans, as well as Jews, women, and other politically, economically, and socially vulnerable groups\" (p.19). Techniques used to \"prove\" such inferiority included using skull size and capacity, palm size, skin color, hair texture and \"virtually every other body feature\" that could be used to justify the \"white supremacist projects of these sciences\" (p. 19). The second practice involves the use of women, people of color, and the poor as objects of science and technology research in highly problematic ways, including \"Nazi eugenics, the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, discriminatory testing and uses of reproductive technologies, and the environmental racism that disproportionately locates toxic industries and dumps in nonwhite neighborhoods and Third World societies\" (p.19). The third practice has been the focus of this dissertation and involves inequitable participation in STEM \"through exclusion, marginalization, and restriction to lower-level jobs\" (p. 20). Taken together, this history not only highlights the values that enter into scientific work, but demonstrates that socially and economically disadvantaged groups have long been used and abused within science to the benefit of the already socially and economically privileged. Harding points out that these three practices are not relegated solely to history and can be seen as ongoing, for example, through continued debates over gender and race as purely natural, purely social, or both, with many sciences tending to divide humans into categories assumed to be natural. To fail to consider this historical and social context leaves out a key piece of the puzzle surrounding STEM participation pathways and experiences. As Pawley (2007) points out, The large number of efforts to solve the Problem of women's underrepresentation speaks to the fact that the engineering community in the U.S. today wants more women and people of color to participate as engineers. However, why would these groups participate in an enterprise that chooses to systematically overlook their needs, desires, and problems, defining them out of engineering? Until engineering as a discipline decides to ask about, value, and respond to the needs of those groups of people who have historically and systematically been excluded from every official aspect of engineering problem definition and solution, then I suspect they will not be interested in becoming engineers (p. 195). In addition, failure to account for historical and social context also limits our very understanding of what constitutes scientific and engineering work itself. Harding (2006) draws on postcolonial science studies to argue that \"[a]s we rethink the dominant legacy, we need to do so with both eyes open -one on the history and practices of modern Western science, and the other on the history and practices of the peoples of color who modern Western cultures have encountered\" (p. 30). Such a view takes into consideration not only the ways in which \"Western\" science has adopted, laid claims upon the creations of, and disempowered \"non-Western\" knowledges such that the possibilities of multiple ways of doing science and critically thinking about truth, evidence and nature are opened up. The pipeline discourse tends to take a modern-day fairy tale approach to the experiences of women and minorities who have obtained STEM degrees and/or employment in a STEM career. The discourse not only disregards the potential for unemployment, but glosses over or censors out historical and social context, including any sexism, racism, or other hostile or discriminatory behavior experienced along the path, and replaces the complicated narrative with a simpler, normalized trope that focuses almost exclusively on the so-called happy ending. Much research has indicated that the lived experiences of women and people of color in STEM may more adequately be described as a pre-Disney version of a fairy tale that has not censored out the cruel and grotesque elements of the story 35 . Researchers have continually indicated that STEM and its reward structure, through all education and career stages, is sharply stratified, particularly along gendered, racialized, and disciplinary lines (e.g. Fox, 1999;Kulis, Sicotte, & Collins, 2002;Long & Fox, 1995;Sonnert, Fox & Adkins, 2007;Zuckerman, 1970;. Research has questioned whether inequality in STEM is based on unbiased and merit-based evaluation of STEM 35 Fairy tales have been edited over time, often purposefully creating a discourse about mores, values, and manners, as they were taken from oral tradition, put through various iterations in writing, and adapted into film, with Walt Disney offering the most \"prudish changes\" and earning him the title of the \"twentiethcentury sanitation man\" (Zipes,1991, p. 53). For example, in the Grimm's version of Cinderella, the (step)sisters have feet too large for the slipper and, at the encouragement of their mother, each in turn removes parts of her feet to fit into the slipper (Tatar, 2003). The prince only realizes that they are not his desired bride upon seeing the blood spurting from the shoe. In the end, the (step)sisters are punished for their falsehood by pigeons that peck out their eyes. work or biased and discriminatory practices. Harding (2006) and Mukerji (1990) both illustrate that academic science is highly connected to commercial and state interests, refuting that STEM is value-neutral. Mukerji (1990) argues that, through their dependence on the state, academic scientists, in this case oceanographers, form a reserve force that is paid by the government to do research that is politically essential to the state. Long and Fox (1995) connect such practices to discrimination. They consider universalism, the belief that the validity of scientific work will be judged impartially and that contributions to scientific knowledge will be fairly rewarded, versus particularism, the use of \"functionally irrelevant characteristics, such as sex and race, as a basis for making claims and gaining rewards in science\" (p. 46) as processes by which inequality in academic science career attainments have occurred. They argue, based on a review of quantitative studies, that universalism in science fails such that women and racial minorities experienced hindrances to their advancement when all else was held equal and women received differential returns for similar productivity investments as men, indicating that discrimination rather than unbiased assessment based on merit is taking place. Discrimination, stereotypes and/or implicit/unconscious biases, particularly surrounding gender and race, still play a role not only in admissions and hiring (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004;Issac, Lee, & Carnes, 2009;King et al., 2006;Steinpreis et al., 1999;Trix & Psenka, 2003;Uhlmann & Cohen, 2005), but also in ongoing salary disparities between and within fields (Crothers et al., 2010;Fox & Stephan, 2001;Nzeukou, 2006;Valian, 1998), individual attitudes and increased moderately without an accompanying change to the workplace structure, women continued to experience stigma and exclusion (Etzkowitz et al., 1994). Similarly, Etzkowitz, Kemelgor, and Uzzi (2004) argue that the supply-side and numbers-based approach, at the very least, \"needs to be supplemented by a focus on changing the institutional structures where science takes place\" (p. 245). Etzkowitz, Kemelgor, and Uzzi (2004) point out that there is a degree of intentionality to the current structure, which is highly resistive to change. STEM has a long history of competitive and individualistic weed-out courses, for instance, that function as hazing into STEM culture as an elite and exclusive institution (pp. 50-51). In large part, these courses send a clear message: if students cannot or will not assimilate to the current culture of STEM, STEM does not really want them. They argue that \"instead of changing a structure that the people in power are satisfied with, it is much easier to deal with other people's problems, elsewhere\" by, for example, creating support groups for STEM women or hosting workshops that train minority faculty in how and where to publish their work (p. 242). As I have argued before, the pipeline narrative may be functioning exactly as it was intended -to \"create divisions, perpetuate difference, preserve advantage, and maintain the rusty pipes for as long as possible\" (Metcalf, 2007, p. 134)."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice", "text": "Overall, these findings show that many subjective choices are made in the construction of the large-scale datasets used to inform much national science and engineering policy and that these choices greatly influence likelihood of retention outcomes. What counts as science and engineering, and who counts as a scientist and engineer is highly socially constructed. I argue that these data need to be looked at critically and considered within context, especially when used to make policy decisions. As this dissertation has shown, individuals and the datasets that attempt to capture their seek to make substantive change rather than to reproduce problematic ideology, critical attention to the language within that policy and the underlying values and choices that are made within the research informing those decisions is even more of a necessity than the standard push for entrants into the fields. Engaging in statistical analyses and survey methodologies that more accurately represent the populations in which policy claims to have vested retention interests is also a key step in understanding the educational and career pathways of these groups. These findings point to the necessity of expanding the ways in which family is accounted for in the data and to explore the unnamed other reasons that many respondents offer for their departure from the field of their highest S&E degrees. In addition, these findings indicate that, while the pipeline model focuses on increasing the supply of scientists and engineers that exit the pipeline at the end, it does not adequately consider what happens to these scientists or engineers post-exit. While the motivation for increasing the pipeline supply is largely tied to a fear about a shortage of workers to fill jobs, these respondents indicate that there may be too many scientists and engineers and not enough jobs to meet supply. These findings also demonstrate that, despite the shortcomings in the surveys and datasets, researchers can still do much to consider the complexity of identity and S&E work and education using existing data. Even slight changes in how these data are accounted for in analyses can result in big differences in terms of how we think about who is retained and in what fields. Differing levels of disaggregation and consideration of between and within group differences and similarities can provide important insights into retention issues even if the findings are not statistically significant. I argue that statistical significance in and of itself is not reason enough to exclude particular groups from analysis, as is often the case for studies that exclude, for example, Native American respondents from their samples. In their book, The Cult of Statistical Significance: How the Standard Error Costs Us Job, Justice, and Lives, Ziliak & McCloskey (2011) argue, \"for the past eighty years it appears that some of the sciences have made a mistake by basing decisions on statistical 'significance'\u2026which should be a tiny part of an inquiry concerned with the size and importance of relationships\" (pp. 2-3). They explain that, especially in the life, human, and social sciences, focus on statistical significance has come at the expense of broader philosophical inquiry such that, instead of asking whether or why certain phenomena are occurring, researchers have begun instead focusing on how much of the phenomena are occurring. This is largely the case in the study of STEM retention, which, through a focus on the supply-side, tends to look at how many women and minorities are retained rather than asking the why's of their experiences . As Hill, Corbett, and St. Rose (2010) point out, \"[i]mproving women's position among STEM faculty will apparently require more than simply increasing the pool of female STEM degree holders\" (p. 17). By not focusing solely on statistical significance in this study, I have opted to return to the questions of whether, why, and what retention patterns are occurring, even for smaller groups created through detailed levels of disaggregation. The implications of the resulting findings are that researchers, practitioners, and even policy makers can gain insights into groups often excluded by narrow statistical significance foci. If the discourse in research, policy, and practice purports to care about the STEM participation of, for example, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, then insights are needed into the STEM participation experiences of those who identify as women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, regardless of statistical significance levels. This work needs to be clear about and critically reflect upon what each of these concepts means. These findings also have large implications for higher education retention research more broadly, particularly given the expansion of the pipeline model for addressing student retention in general (Seidman, 2005), retention within particular fields like mathematics (Stage & Maple, 1996) and law (Rodriguez, 2010), retention for particular populations (Dowd, Malcom, & Bensimon, 2009), recruitment and retention on the tenure track (Mason, Goulden, & Frasch, 2010;Roach, 2009), advancement to upper administrative positions (June, 2008), and recruitment and retention via a focus on high school graduation through higher education degree attainment (The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, 2004). Each of these examples from higher education research uses the pipeline model discourse of economic competitiveness through the labor force to advocate for why the issue addressed is important; however, even with this emphasis on the labor force, none critically address the transition from degree attainment to occupation. While not all students seek out higher education solely for occupations, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners basing their recruitment and retention motivations on increasing participation in various fields and sectors of the workforce should begin to further study degree to work transitions in more detail. This detail-oriented shift is especially pertinent given the conflicting stories between the pipeline workforce shortage discourses and the findings in this study that indicate many may be seeking work outside of their degree areas because of job unavailability. These findings support the little research that does consider transition from degree to occupation, which argues that the number of college graduates, especially high achieving graduates, in STEM degrees far outnumber the demand (Lowell & Salzman, 2007;Shettle, 1993;Teitelbaum, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Directions for Future Research", "text": "As mentioned earlier, future research that critically addresses the limitations with the current SESTAT surveys and data is greatly needed. Research that engages in survey methodology that collects demographic data in a more complex and contextual way would largely aid researchers' understanding of the populations they are seeking to benefit. In particular, expanding the surveys to collect information on gender (rather than a limited view of sex), sexuality, other types of disabilities (such as learning disabilities), other ethnic groups, and additional family arrangements, would all be useful additions. This study only looked at a few ways in which different identity categorizations interact by creating a handful of different racial and ethnic groupings and by interacting sex with the independent variables. Additional permutations of identity groupings and interactions could deepen our knowledge relative to STEM participation and identity. Further research on, for instance, various multiracial subgroups and interactions of racial identifications with other demographic factors could deepen our statistical knowledge of the complicated ways in which identity factors are intertwined and influence retention patterns. Broadening the surveys to include additional information on educational and career paths, such as entries and exits from the workforce and community college attendance, and the reasons that people take the paths that they do would greatly improve our understanding of STEM participation. The current surveys collect the most information on the transition from highest degree to occupation, including reasons for working outside the field of one's highest degree and the level of closeness between one's degree and occupation. Such information on other transition points would also be useful. The pipeline model assumes that the purpose of STEM education is to obtain a STEM job, when in actuality, individuals may be participating in STEM education and even getting degrees for a number of other reasons that have yet to be accounted for in the surveys. A \"leak\" assumes a mistake or failure has taken place; yet, the goals and purposes that STEM students have for their educations are not even considered. Understanding the reasons for entering college, selecting particular majors, switching between educational fields and the perceived relationship between those fields would also add context to the educational pathways that respondents are taking. Exploring the experiences of postdoctoral and temporary workers and those who are experiencing difficulties with job availability is another potential avenue for future research. As I mentioned in Chapter Three, postdoctoral positions are growing as a proportion of the academic science and engineering workforce and their experiences are highly under studied (Cantwell & Lee, 2010;Davis, 2005;Teitelbaum, 2003). Postdoctoral and temporary positions are growing particularly in fields that tend to have workforce surpluses and job unavailability. Given the prominence of job unavailability in retention likelihood in this study and in previous work (Black & Stephan, 2005;Shettle, 1997;Teitelbaum, 2003), further research on the experiences of those struggling with job unavailability can, again, enrich the knowledge we have on the demand side."}, {"section_title": "Using Qualitative Research for Depth, Context, and Survey Redesign", "text": "Supplementing the SESTAT data with further qualitative analyses can provide further context and clarity to the quantitative data and can serve as a useful tool for editing future versions of the surveys. These qualitative components need not even come in the form of interviews or focus groups, though these would allow for semi-structured processes that could delve deeper into participants' experiences; they could be presented in the form of open text boxes on the surveys themselves. As discussed earlier, the surveys already contain a number of these that are used for checking \"other\" responses and recoding them into pre-existing categories if the coder perceives the response as redundant. As such, researchers do not have access to the open text fields, which could actually have rich data. This study illustrated a number of points that could benefit from qualitative research. In particular, qualitative data can provide a wealth of information on how STEM degree holders form (or do not form) their STEM identities and how such an identity relates to gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, nationality, disability, age, etc, which could then inform the creation of new categories for representing these aspects of identity on the surveys. Some qualitative research on STEM students and faculty that explores STEM identities related to gender has already been done. For instance, Pawley (2007) considered the formation of engineering identity by engineering faculty using interviews. Her interviews did not specifically ask about respondents' gender identities, but the respondents did discuss engineering in gendered ways and provided much detail about the construction of engineering as a field and the development of their own identities as engineers. In my own previous work with computer science students, I used open-ended questions on surveys to ask about their gender and computer science identities and how they influence one another (Metcalf, 2007). I found that many of the respondents had internalized stereotypes of what it means to be a computer scientist (nerdy, passionate about and focused on all things computer related, socially awkward, unconcerned about appearance, etc) and had varying degrees of taking on those traits and/or rejecting them as part of their own identities, particularly related to constructions of masculinity/femininity. I found that just leaving an open text box for the gender question was not enough to get respondents thinking about their gender identities and how those relate to a computer science identity largely because of the history of surveys asking for gender via fixed categories. Several questions that got at this issue in different ways were necessary. Valentine (2007) offers a critical ethnography of transgender as a category of analysis that can guide researchers in beginning to think about conducting research on the experiences of transgender, transsexual, gender queer, and/or gender non-conforming STEM students and workers. Again, considering the history, politics, and context of these categories, especially related to power and oppression, is particularly important for such analyses. He argues that it is \"essential to think about how [these categories] work[] not only against the solidity of identity categories but against the solidity of the broader categories of social experience which [they] describe[]: gender, sexuality, sex, race, class, and so on\" (p. 254). Qualitative research could also delve further into the reasons for unemployment and employment in fields that are not related to respondents' degrees beyond the rigid categories in the current data sets. Such work can provide further context for STEM degree holders' experiences. For example, when respondents indicate that they are working outside of their highest degree fields because of job unavailability, what does that mean? Qualitative research could supplement this finding by providing more details on the respondents' job search processes. Were there literally no jobs in their field available anywhere? Did they apply to a number of jobs and receive rejections? Did they receive offers that were unacceptable? What criteria did they use? What was the scope of their search? Even though job location was not the primary reason, did geographic location impact the search process? Similar questions could be asked about the family reasons (what constitutes family for the respondent? What reasons impacted their decision?) and \"Other\" reasons (what reasons specifically?) that ranked highly for female, non-U.S. citizen, and racial and ethnic minority respondents as well as the remaining reasons, such as working conditions (Is this referring to the perceived working conditions of a job in the field? Working conditions of the current place of employment? Both? Neither?), pay/promotion (is this just a salary issue? Did the respondent experience barriers to advancement?), change of interest (what was the original interest? What and how did it change?), job location (does this mean geographical location, geo-political location, climate location, urban versus rural, etc? Could it also be referencing the particular institution or workplace? Might it also encompass proximity to cultural, social, environmental, and/or political resources?). This research illustrated that it is possible for respondents to have NSF-defined STEM degrees, be employed in non-STEM fields, and have close STEM degreeoccupation relatedness. Again, qualitative research could not only tell us more about the educational and occupational pathways that these respondents took, but also how the respondents are determining the level of closeness between their degrees and occupations. Were they filling in the less desirable, \"left-over\" job spaces? What values and power relations were at play? Did these respondents aspire to work in these places? How did they come to work in their current field and place of employment?"}, {"section_title": "Toward a New Model", "text": "Because, as I've argued, the complexity of experiences between, within, and outside of STEM have largely been oversimplified in the research and, I believe, language fails to capture the complexity of human experiences in general, I am hesitant to offer at this time a specific alternative metaphor through which researchers, practitioners, and policy makers can better understand STEM participation. However, I argue that any such model and future research should be flexible and include elements that address issues of power, intentionality, stratification, and oppression both historically and ongoing, particularly related to gender, race, ethnicity, class, citizenship, and sexuality. In her study on gender and engineering faculty, Pawley (2007; offers a useful example of what a potential alternative model might look like. She uses interviews with engineering faculty to illustrate the disciplinary narratives that are told about what counts as engineering, who counts as an engineer, and the processes by which one takes on an engineering identity. Pushing back against the pipeline and chilly climate models for understanding pathways to and in engineering, she uses this qualitative data with a critical eye to power and political, historical, and social contexts to present a boundary metaphor as an alternative. A boundary, she explains, \"is not a physical thing in this context, but an idea that researchers can use as a tool to understand people's experiences. It need not be a literal division, but it conceptually denotes the margin of a clump of accepted practices, that may be determined differently by different people\" (Pawley, 2007, p. 8). Thus, a boundary is contextual and continually (re)constructed in multiple ways by different people at different times. She argues, because of its built-in conceptions of inclusion and exclusion, a boundary metaphor can provide a better tool for understanding how discourse can include/exclude people and ideas in engineering and how engineering itself may be considered a gendered discipline. The use of this metaphor that considers gender, power, and context allows her to consider how faculty make sense of, influence, While the faculty in her study described engineering as applied science, as solving problems, and as making things, the boundary metaphor allowed her to look deeper at their narratives to explore the space, time, and actors involved in or absent from their discourse: The \"where?\" question of space allowed us to specify engineering as the act of solving problems in industrial, commercial, and military spheres, and at large production scale; the parallel boundary question of \"where not?\" made clear that engineering has not focused on domestic contexts or on small scales of production, effectively excluding areas where women have had to do much work over the course of the history of the engineering profession (p. 193). Additionally, the lens of time allowed her to provide historical context to the narratives and : helped us see how participants relied on how things had been done in the past, often without having a historicized conception of how the social forces of gender, class or race had impacted the development of engineering as a profession and as an educational field. In addition, participants' reliance on precedent (through additional constructs of academic lineage) in combination with a prioritization system applied to deal with a lack of time has resulted in a continuing failure to reconceptualize engineering in such a way as to reject historical boundaries erected at a time when women and people of color were explicitly and intentionally excluded from engineering (p. 193). Similarly, in considering the actors involved allowed her to consider \"who defines the problems engineers solve, who benefits from the solutions, and who actually makes the things that engineers claim to make? Answers to these questions can then be put in the context of \"who not?\": based on participants' interview responses, women, people of color, and the poor are excluded again\" (p. 193). While this boundary metaphor is applied to the study of engineering faculty's construction of engineering work rather than to consider their identities and educational and career pathways specifically, it provides a useful example of how shifting the metaphor to include aspects of power and context can allow for researchers to reveal social and structural issues influencing who participates in and benefits from engineering work. Another useful avenue for consideration in the development of an alternative model to the pipeline comes from philosophy, queer theory, and the anthropological and social studies of science. In describing the interconnectedness between science and culture, Martin (1998) uses two metaphors: the citadel and the rhizome. She argues that science is not a closed off citadel with culture residing outside, but instead is always already connected to culture in discontinuous, fractured, and nonlinear ways, like a rhizome. A rhizome, she explains, comes from the work of French philosopher Deleuze and, like crabgrass or bamboo, has an underground rootlike stem that sends up leafy shoots from the upper surface and roots from the lower. Unlike other plants, such as pine trees, which depend on all their major parts (roots, trunk, and leaves) to live and which propagate by seeds, rhizomes can be broken entirely apart into segments and still grow up again as complete organisms (p. 31) Likewise, the rhizome is always a multiplicity, resists binarisms, is constantly in flux, and has no beginning or end (Nigianni & Storr, 2009). As such, it is also a useful metaphor for thinking about the complexities of identity, subject formation, and participation in STEM. As Nigianni and Storr (2009) explain, \"the kind of subjectivity suggested by the rhizome, then, is not singular, but multiple, inhabited by a radically constitutive and productive otherness\u2026[and is in] constant rearrangement of the self which exceeds the ideality of a stable and unified 'identity'\"(p. 161). As the rhizome has no beginning or end, is at once fragmented and interconnected, and resists rigid categorization, as a metaphor for understanding STEM pathways, it has the potential for and insists upon complicated, non-linear trajectories, attention to the in-between spaces, and connections to organizations of power. The rhizome is, however, \"non-representable, and thinkable only through a concept of multiplicity that shatters the unity of the subject and fixed meanings of logic\" (p. 161), making it impossible to represent quantitatively. This is both its strength and weakness when applied to STEM participation which has for too long been oversimplified through a heavily quantitative focus. It can offer a complex theoretical tool for thinking through and interpreting STEM experiences in ways for which the pipeline model has not allowed and provides a useful starting point for creating an alternative model that blends the quantitative and qualitative."}]
