[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). By 20 April 2020 there had been more than 2,360,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, and over 165,000 deaths. It has been suggested that the total number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections is an underestimate of the actual number of infections, due to mild and asymptomatic cases [1] . COVID-19 patients exhibit various clinical courses, but the most common symptoms are fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and coughing (67.8%) [2] .\nLaboratory tests and computed tomography (CT) scans have been used in clinical practice to diagnose COVID-19 and monitor treatment responses [3] , and more recently multiple SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits have been developed. To date real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR is the most reliable technology for the detection and quantification of target nucleic acid fragments. It constitutes a rapid and accurate method of viral nucleic acid detection, and it has been widely utilized for viral DNA detection in both clinical and environmentally derived samples.\nThe most substantial aspect of real-time RT-PCR is that it facilitates monitoring of the amplification of the target DNA sequence that is reverse-transcribed from RNA, then mathematical quantification of the starting material after background correction [4] . For assays designed for diagnostic applications, viral nucleic acid in a patient-derived sample is often the detection target. Notably however, it has been reported that in clinical practice the false-negative rate of real-time RT-PCR-based assays can be as high as 20% [5] . This potential false-negative rate raises a general concern given its diagnostic purpose, and may result in substantial clinical consequences [5] . There is a need for improvement of detection assays used for COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis. 4 Digital PCR is an emerging technology designed to achieve absolute quantification after real-time PCR, and it has been successfully applied in various fields, including clinical laboratory diagnosis [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the current study the use of a novel digital PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both clinical patient-derived samples and environmentally derived samples was investigated, with the ultimate aim of reducing the rate of false negative results."}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "All SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed at a genetic diagnosis center from January 2020 to April 2020."}, {"section_title": "Ten patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in accordance with the World Health Organization Interim", "text": "Guidelines were included in the study [10] .

Different positivity rates were associated with different sample types (Table 3) . SARS-CoV-2 was more frequently detected in respiratory tractderived samples (35.0%) than in non-respiratory tract-derived samples (0.0%).

The application of digital PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection may play a critical role in diminishing the false-negative rate of diagnostic COVID-19 laboratory tests."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Numerous clinical symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients, and the clinical course can vary from asymptomatic to critical [2] . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are reportedly fever, coughing, and a sore throat [2, 11] . COVID-19 patients can also present with sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, dyspnea, diarrhea, and lymphopenia [13] [14] [15] . In clinical laboratory tests elevated C-reactive protein and D-dimer as well as decreased levels of lymphocytes, leukocytes, and blood platelets are detected in some COVID-19 patients [2] . Notably however, many COVID patients do not exhibit fever [2, 13, [16] [17] [18] . In the current study 27.3% of patients presented with fever, 54.6% with coughing, and 36.4% with diarrhea. At least one symptom listed was evident in 72.7% of the patients. CT scans depicted clinical features of bilateral pneumonia in 81.9% of patients and unilateral pneumonia in 9.1% of patients.\nAs in some previously reported studies [11] , SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequences were more frequently detected in respiratory tract-derived samples (35.0%) than in non-respiratory tract-derived samples (0.0%). The mucosa of the conjunctiva and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct, share the same SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor on cell membranes (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and may act as a transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 infection [19] . Notably however, no SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequences were detected in eye conjunctiva in the current study. This may be related to the fact that no eye infection symptoms were evident in any of the patients in the study. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been isolated from serum from SARS-CoV-2infected patients [20] , but no SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequences were detected in plasma/blood samples in the current study. This may be because the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in these samples was below the detection limits of the tests.\nIn a recent study the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection threshold concentration of real-time RT-PCR was reportedly 1 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL, which is considered to constitute inadequate sensitivity and insufficient stability [21] . In another report the false-negative rate of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR was approximately 20%, and this led to serious consequences [5] . Chest CT was once considered better than real-time RT-PCR for COVID-19 screening, comprehensive evaluation, and follow-up in epidemic areas [21] . Given the need for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis, it has become necessary to minimize possible causes of false-negative nucleic acid-based test results, or develop a new more sensitive nucleic acid detection-based assay.\nIn the current study, of all respiratory tract sample types the detection rate in phlegm (66.7%) was the highest, and the detection rate in nasopharyngeal swabs (28.6%) was higher than that in oropharyngeal swabs (42.9%). This suggests that detection of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by sample type. The rate of detection was greater in lower respiratory tract-derived samples than in upper respiratory tract-derived samples. Due to practical considerations, procedural factors, and comparative patient intolerance there are many difficulties associated with lower respiratory tract sampling. It has also been reported that nasopharyngeal aspirate had a higher positivity rate within 2 weeks of symptom onset, whereas combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were the least harmful to medical staff during sampling [22] .\nWith regard to the environmental samples in the current study, the positivity rate of air samples was higher than that of surface samples. Environmental sampling results are influenced by the concentration of virus in the samples. 12 The low detection rate of real-time RT-PCR is associated with many factors including sampling procedures, nucleic acid quality, specimen source (upper or lower respiratory tract), and sampling timing (different periods of disease development). The quality of extracted nucleic acid has a strong influence on the outcomes of real-time RT-PCR. The template volume can be increased to raise the sensitivity of detection, and reagents containing guanidine salt can be used to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA [23] . To improve the positivity rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable, stool and blood samples can also be used at later stages of illness [23] . Nucleic acid tests are based on the concentration of virus, and serological tests using proteins can be utilized to supplement nucleic acid tests, enabling clinicians to track both sick and recovered patients, providing a better estimate of total SARS-CoV-2 infections [3] ."}, {"section_title": "Digital PCR improved SARS-CoV-2 detection", "text": "Digital PCR has higher sensitivity and accuracy than standard real-time RT-PCR, and is developing rapidly and being widely applied in clinical microbiology, in fields such as drug resistance mutations in hepatitis C virus, Staphylococcus aureus, and influenza A virus [24] [25] [26] . To prevent false-negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-based test results, and develop a new sensitive detection assay, we evaluated the performance of real-time RT-PCR and digital PCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in clinical patient-derived samples and environmentally derived samples.\nA newly developed digital PCR assay was performed with samples that had previously been tested using real-time RT-PCR. All the real-time RT-PCR positive samples also tested positive in the digital PCR assay. Strikingly, digital PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in several samples that had previously tested negative via real-time RT-PCR, including 3 patient-derived samples and 5 environmentally derived samples. These results suggest that digital PCR is a more efficient and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 detection than real-time RT-PCR.\nDigital PCR improved SARS-CoV-2 detection 13 In some recent studies reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 was evident in some recovered patients, and there were no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them [27, 28] . In another study a recovered COVID-19 patient returned to being SARS-CoV-2-positive, raising concern about the present standards for patient discharge [29] . These observations indicate that a proportion of recovered patients may still be virus carriers. Stricter patient discharge standards and more sensitive detection assays are required to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Digital PCR can serve as a more sensitive nucleic acid detection assay. It can detect viral nucleic acid present at low concentrations. Thus, it has the potential to improve the detection rate in asymptomatic carriers.\nDigital PCR constitutes a fundamentally different approach to quantifying the number of DNA molecules in a sample, and quantification is achieved without the need for PCR cycle threshold values and standard curves [30] . In conclusion, digital PCR can be used in clinical applications as a new sensitive nucleic acid detection assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the future. Its use will reduce the rate of false-negative results, and improve the detection rate of asymptomatic carriers. "}]
