[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "On December 1 2016, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) will Background: be updated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The key changes are an increase in the salary threshold for exemption from overtime for working more than 40 hours per week, and indexing the salary level so that it is updated automatically every 3 years. This update is predicted to have a profound effect on the academic enterprise as a large proportion of the postdoctoral researcher population is currently paid at a salary below the new threshold for exemption. Here we review the key changes to the FLSA, how they came about, and how the postdoctoral population is affected by the ruling.\nWe describe recent data collection efforts (checking university Methods: websites and contacting HR departments) to uncover what institutions in the 2014 NSF Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering are doing to comply with the FLSA ruling for postdocs.\nOur data show that 41% of the estimated postdoctoral workforce in Results: STEM and 57% of institutions checked have not decided or have no public decision yet available one month prior to implementation, and only 35.5% of institutions are planning to raise salaries to the new minimum.\nOur data show the uncertainty of postdoc salaries in the U.S. Conclusions: one month prior to implementation of the FLSA ruling.

One key change is an increase in the salary threshold for exemption from overtime pay from the 2004 level of $23,660 to $47,476. The other key change is indexing the salary level so that it is updated automatically every 3 years pegged to the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowestwage Census region, estimated by the DOL to be $51,168 in 2020.\nWe first describe the timeline of how these updates were decided, and how they affect the postdoctoral researcher population.\nUpdating the FLSA On March 13 2014, a memorandum (https://www.whitehouse.gov/ the-press-office/2014/03/13/presidential-memorandum-updatingand-modernizing-overtime-regulations) was issued by the White House from U.S. President Barack Obama to Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, instructing the Department of Labor to investigate updating and modernizing current overtime regulations:\n\"I hereby direct you to propose revisions to modernize and streamline the existing overtime regulations. In doing so, you shall consider how the regulations could be revised to update existing protections consistent with the intent of the Act; address the changing nature of the workplace; and simplify the regulations to make them easier for both workers and businesses to understand and apply (Obama, 2014) .\"\nOn July 6 2015, the Department of Labor issued a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\" soliciting feedback by September 4 2015. The notice proposed increasing the current exemption salary of $23, 660, set in 2004, to $50,440 in 2016 , with automatic updates to the level every 3 years (Obama, 2015 ; United States Department of Labor, 2016b).\nOn May 18 2016, the Secretary of Labor, Thomas Perez, gave notice of the final decision on the updates to overtime regulations in the FLSA. The exemption salary would be set at $47,476 (lower than the $50,440 originally proposed) with updates every 3 years determined by future wage growth (United States Department of Labor, 2016f). The date for implementation was set as December 1 2016. Therefore, 2 years after the first indication of a change to overtime regulations, and just under a year from the indication of what those changes were likely to be, an additional 6 months allowance was made to prepare for compliance with the new rule. There is an assumption that postdoctoral salaries are, on average, around $45,000 per year for a full-time postdoc (Collins & Perez, 2016) and that most institutions follow the NIH National Research Service Award (NRSA) stipend levels. In theory, therefore, the salary changes expected for postdocs in many cases should approximate the changes in the new NRSA levels (National Institutes of Health, 2016) as shown in Figure 1 .\nThe minimum salary should therefore rise from $43,692 for new postdocs to $47,484, which constitutes an increase of 8.7%. Thus, postdocs with more than 3 years of postdoctoral experience are, in theory, already exempt from this rule. However, it is difficult to gauge exactly how postdoctoral salaries are changing across the U.S. Transparent salary information for postdoctoral positions is very hard to find and the administration of postdocs (McDowell, 2016b) means that many may be on lower salaries than expected. It is not currently possible for all institutions in the United States to identify and obtain information on the salaries of all of their postdocs with certainty.\nAnother problem with the NRSA assumption is that not all institutions peg their salaries to NRSA levels, and institutional salary policies may indicate more realistic effects of the FLSA on salaries.\nIn 2014, 89% of institutions had a minimum salary policy, where 51% of those institutions set their postdoctoral salary scales to the NRSA scale but ~30% set their minima lower and 7% did not enforce these policies (data in Figure 21 , (Ferguson et al., 2014) ; for a visual description of this see also (McDowell, 2016) ). It is also unclear how many postdocs are employed at each of these institutions (populations potentially from 1 to 5761, according to 2014 data from the National Science Foundation (NSF, (National Science Foundation, n.d.))) and therefore the number of U.S. postdocs at different points on this salary range is also unclear. If 11% of U.S. institutions haven't set a minimum salary level, it is therefore possible (and legal) that there may be full-time postdocs currently earning as little as $23,660, and these salaries will need to double if they are to meet the FLSA exemption ruling.\nImplementing the salary change. Institutions have the choice to either increase the minimum salary for postdocs to $47,476, or to classify postdocs as hourly workers.\nThe first option is difficult because there is no extra money for this ruling, and PIs may have to pay postdocs from research grants such as R01 grants. Salaries of postdocs on training grants/ fellowships (NRSA, HHMI and possibly NSF) are likely to be increased (National Institutes of Health, 2016; National Science Foundation, 2016).\nThe second option, however, may cost more. It would involve implementing a system for keeping track of the hours that postdocs spend in the lab. Many postdocs work, and are expected to work, in excess of a standard 40-hour week. One calculation posits that a postdoc earning the NRSA minimum of $43,692 working 50 hours a week under the new rule would have an increase in salary to $60,076 (Polka, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "What are institutions planning to do under the FLSA?", "text": "In an effort to make salary information as transparently available as possible, we have been gathering information at the FLSA and postdocs resource at Future of Research (Future of Research, 2016b) . This data-gathering has involved checking university websites and contacting HR departments at institutions for information on complying with the FLSA ruling for postdocs. We made it clear that this information is to be made publicly available, using as our guide data from the 2014 NSF Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (National Science Foundation, n.d.) using the total number of Science, Engineering and Health postdocs as our postdoc population (as all postdocs are affected).

In this analysis, we looked at both the percentage of the postdoctoral workforce at institutions implementing various plans for the FLSA, as well as provided data on the percentage of institutions implementing various FLSA plans, as of October 21 2016.\nRepeating this analysis a month before compliance is required, we are now able to discuss data for institutions that we have checked or contacted covering 97.5% of the estimated postdoctoral workforce, or every U.S. higher education institution listed in the NSF dataset with > 35 postdocs in 2014 (Dataset 1).\nOut of these, 51% of the estimated postdoctoral workforce comes from institutions that have stated they are raising salaries,1.5% from institutions focused on tracking hours, and 4% from institutions allowing the tracking of hours while promoting (but not mandating) salary raising. However, still 41% of postdocs come from institutions that have either reported to us that they have not decided, have no information available, and/or have not yet responded to a request for information (Figure 2A ).\nOne month away from Dec 1st, we have now checked 56% of institutions, and of those checked, 35.5% are planning to raise salaries, and 57% have no public decision yet available ( Figure 2B )."}, {"section_title": "A case in point: Boston postdocs", "text": "To illustrate the point of what postdocs may know at this point in time, with one month prior to implementation, we take Boston postdocs as an example. The Boston Postdoctoral Association has been taking an active role in gathering institutional information and preparing resources on the FLSA for its members (Boston Postdoctoral Association, 2016). There are 14 academic postdoctoral associations in the Boston Postdoctoral Association (http://bostonpostdocs.org/) and we list them here along with the numbers of postdocs from the NSF dataset we used for our analysis (where known: \"Harvard\" and \"MIT\" are each listed as a single institution) and current estimates of 9,000 postdocs in Boston (Table 1) The dataset, which comprises data obtained for Figure 2 , is a compilation of information obtained from checking HR websites or contacting HR departments at various universities listed in the 2014 NSF Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering. The majority of these data are publicly available on institutional websites (listed where available), and some were obtained by e-mail from HR contacts."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion of the data collected", "text": "We are assuming that all institutions will make information transparently and publicly available, whereas of course there is bound to be a great variation in the institutions that will publish postdoc salary information on the web or respond to queries for FLSA compliance information, and this does not seem to be linked to the size of the institution.\nSome institutions (such as \"Harvard\" and \"MIT\") are listed as a single institution in the NSF dataset, and as we have so little data for each (as discussed above) we count them as not having yet made decisions. Combined with previous discussions that the NSF dataset may only approximate postdoc numbers, and this is 2014 data (not up to date), the numbers likely have some degree of a b variation. Also, in contrast to the Council on Governmental Relations report of August, we see a very striking difference in what has been publicly declared compared with private data. Decisions that have been made this time were predicted to be at 97% whereas we have found only 47% have publicly done so. The ratio of institutions planning to raise salaries to those planning to track hours was 3:1 in the report whereas our data show the ratio closer to 9:1.\nWe have not yet done a thorough analysis comparing salary reporting by region, or comparing between public and private institutions, however we hope to carry out this analysis as data continues to be collected through December 1st. The \"employer\" is the institution that \"suffers [someone] to work,\" so institutions are the ones responsible for ensuring FLSA compliance. Postdoc fellows are \"permitted\" to work at the institution. In combination with further guidance from the Department of Labor on independent contractors, the closest possible analogy to postdoctoral fellows (United States Department of Labor, 2014), it is our understanding that if fellowships do not pay full FLSA rates, the employer is still responsible for making sure employees get supplemented up to federal standards. What matters is not where the money comes from, but what a person is doing at an institution that \"suffers or permits them to work\" there. Guidance in the latest update to the NRSA stipends and applying for supplements (NOT-OD-17-002) makes clear that NIH is taking no position on the status of workers at institutions (National Institutes of Health, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Issues encountered so far", "text": "This may become part of the larger conflict in the debate over whether postdocs are trainees or employees, and what services (including intellectual property) they do or do not provide (Haak, 2002a; Haak, 2002b; Haak, 2002c If violations to the FLSA ruling occur, will they be reported? One question that has occupied some discussion about the FLSA is whether violations, such as directing employees to give false reports on timesheets, will actually be reported. The Department of Labor gives advice on how to report these violations (United States Department of Labor, 2016d) and points out that there is a three year statute of limitations, reporting is completely confidential until the point of allegation being pursued and the person then deals with the Department of Labor and not the institution, in reporting violations. In addition, it is illegal for employers to take action against employees based on reporting of violations, and immigration status will not be investigated.\nA comparison is often made about the perceived lack of reporting hours' violations during medical residency, a similar role in the medical system to the postdoc in academia, and so we use this comparison here to illustrate why reporting could be more common in academic science. First, medical residents are exempt from FLSA so a different system of reporting exists to begin with. Medical residents can have up to an additional ~$250,000 debt for tuition, compared to the relatively lower (undergraduate) student debts in the academic path, as well as the cultural eschewing of financial gain, and perhaps have more \"skin in the game\". The bottleneck in the medical system is often getting into residency, from where job certainty is much higher than in academia, whereas most postdocs end up leaving academia despite a high interest in staying in it (Sauermann & Roach, 2016) . In addition, medical residents may consider that reporting hours may actually harm their own training and the training of others, whereas whether many postdocs actually receive training is of great concern in academe (Pickett et al., 2015) and perhaps the perceived harm to that training may be seen as minimally impacting them. All of this, combined with the 3-year statute of limitations, makes \"burning bridges\" a much stronger possibility for postdocs.\nIf a violation of the FLSA is reported, it seems that the burden of proof is on the institution to counter the evidence from the complaint (discussed in (American Council on Education, 2016)). There are many common false assumptions being discussed in academia about how federal labor law can be implemented (Reynolds & Rudnick, 2010) , which makes it very interesting that a number of institutions will let departments, or even PIs, decide on how to administer postdocs.\nMoving towards greater transparency in postdoc salaries. Our goal in presenting these data is to increase transparency about the postdoc position, in terms of the administration and benefits, in a similar manner to a call for transparency in career outcomes (Polka et al., 2015) . We have presented our impression of the information currently available to postdocs about how their roles may be changing in one month, and aim to continue collecting and further analyzing data as we go forward until December 1, 2016.\nPossible effects of the FLSA ruling. Tracking hours runs counter to academic culture, and the notion of the postdoc as a \"trainee\", someone in a mentored environment developing independence. It is also in contrast to behaviors learned in graduate school and the working culture of the faculty positions to which postdocs are meant to be directed. Analyzing data, writing and reading papers and carrying out other job related duties of the postdoc are often performed during nights and weekends, while away from the lab. How will those hours be tracked to everyone's satisfaction? Conflicts arising could force postdocs to work fewer hours and thus make themselves less competitive compared to postdocs exempted by salary level or under/over-report their hours, risking reporting violations to the Department of Labor. An institution that tracks hours could also put its postdocs and PIs at a competitive disadvantage compared to other institutions raising salaries. At the moment, the relatively small numbers of institutions tracking hours suggest that the larger implications of the FLSA may be as a result of the raise in postdoctoral salaries.\nIt is unclear what the effects of the FLSA ruling may be on academe. How will this affect smaller institutions? Will there be a drop in new postdoc hires as they become more expensive? How many postdocs are about to lose their jobs? How many will have to shorten their current positions? Will junior faculty bear the brunt, will mid-career researchers be most strained, or will tenured professors be more likely to cut postdocs loose? Will institutions look to increase admission of graduate students, to keep up the labor at the bench? Will there be a shift to more postdocs on particular training mechanisms or fellowships, where the salary is provided, and less on other types of fellowships or research grants?\nPerhaps most importantly, will we as a research enterprise start acting on recommendations in a more timely fashion? The academic system will survive this modernization, and in the long term the likely decrease of the postdoctoral population may be a necessary cap on the expanding \"trainee\" population. This will make the research enterprise more sustainable by limiting the number of postdocs in the system that can be supported. The FLSA ruling change could have been handled far better by the system in favor of postdocs and hopefully is a call to action in terms of how to deal with other issues affecting the research enterprise in the future. The FLSA ruling imposes changes on the system, but these changes had been recommended for some time and could have been implemented more gradually, and with less pain inflicted on postdoctoral researchers (and not only), than they are now. How to correctly deal with the administration of postdocs at institutions has been in discussion over decades (Curtis, 1969) , and raising postdoc salaries has been advocated for as we also describe above. Will other recommended changes within the research enterprise be made by the deliberate action of scientists and administrators, or will they have to be imposed by federal statutes? We hope that the abrupt nature of the FLSA revision serves as a call to redouble efforts for academia to become the driver, rather than the subject, of change.

The Bankston & McDowell article is highly informative on two counts. First, it highlights the extreme difficulty encountered in collecting information regarding postdocs. The Boston data are but one case in point. Second, it contributes information concerning the percent of postdocs which, at the time Bankston & McDowell collected their data, were likely to be affected by the FLSA ruling. This constitutes a significant contribution to our understanding of how the law may affect actual salaries."}, {"section_title": "Grant information", "text": "For my taste, however, the article could go a bit further. First, the authors present no information regarding who will pay for the increase on campuses that intend to raise salaries sufficiently so that postdocs will be exempt. The authors speculate that the funds will come out of grants. And in the long run, they are probably right. But, in the short run the evidence is that universities and departments will pick up some of the increases. (See Council on Governmental Relations 2016 Survey). Second, they do not speculate on how the increase will likely affect the number of postdocs employed. To the extent the demand for postdocs is sensitive to salary, one would predict that in the long run the regulation will lead to a decrease in the number of postdocs working at universities.\nThe authors also imply that it is not clear as to whether the regulation applies to postdocs on fellowships. It is my understanding that a decision by the Department of Labor means that those on fellowships are to be treated the same as are postdocs supported in other ways.\nThe authors also make no effort to explain why their results seem so at odds with the results found by the Council on Governmental Relations Survey, which suggests that something like 75% of campuses surveyed were choosing to raise salaries so that postdocs would be exempt from overtime pay.\nFinally, there is the issue that the authors could not have foreseen that a Federal Judge would issue an injunction November 22, 2015 which preserves the status quo. While the injunction is temporary, many believe that the judge's language \"indicated he was likely to strike down the regulation.\" http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/business/obama-rule-to-expand-overtime-eligibility-is-suspended-by-judge.html .\nTo the extent the implications of the regulation for postdoc pay were difficult to understand before this ruling, they are even more so today. Assuming the rule is found to be invalid, campuses will find themselves in the awkward position of having to decide if they will take back a promised increase. Or, take back an increase that has already taken effect.\nThe conclusions section opens with a meandering and confusing sentence and the first section is about the difficulties of data collection. I agree these are real concerns, but the authors should state their overall and most important conclusions at the beginning of this section as a way to frame the rest of the discussion."}, {"section_title": "Minor concerns Background", "text": "The sentence beginning, \"The other key change is indexing\u2026\" is not clear. Recommend\nBankston and McDowell provide a comprehensive and well-written report on the status and impact of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) on the US postdoc population. This article is very timely given the \"go-live\" date for implementing this Act is less than a month away and given that there has been great consternation among academic institutions in terms of how the mandates will be implemented and what impacts it will have on institutions, postdocs, and science in general.\nWhile acceptable for publication now, there are minor changes that could improve the article. The non-yes (i.e, the \"X\" and \"-\") annotations in dataset 1 should be defined.\nThe y-axis of Figure 1 should be labeled.\nAt the top of page 7, a deeper analysis comparing salary by region, public vs. private institutions, etc. is mentioned as a future direction. This is a critical aspect of understanding how the FLSA will differentially impact institutions and postdocs across the country. I believe it is a very important point that, for example, the cost of living in the middle of the country is not comparable to the cost of living on the east and west coast, which begs the question of whether such differences should be considered within the FLSA. Will this analysis be added to this current article as more data is collected or will this form the basis of another article? It is my opinion that this analysis would greatly strengthen and compliment the current article's argument and impact. At the bottom of page 8 the authors begin to question how the FLSA will impact the biomedical enterprise. It would be more powerful if the authors were more definitive and concrete with their own opinions as to what impact FLSA will have on science. Some have argued that the FLSA will shrink the postdoc pool thus shrink the pipeline of future researchers thus set back the momentum of new science discoveries. The article could be more impactful if the authors wrote specific speculations as to the threats and opportunities that the FLSA will have on the biomedical enterprise.\nSimilar to point #4, could the authors provide some specific recommendations to institutions, postdocs, the government, etc.?\nWhat implications will/could a new political party and leader have on FLSA?\nIn summary, this is an important article that is acceptable for publication now although there are several areas that could be improved upon as noted above. As such, I look forward to reviewing any revised version of the article.\nI have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard."}]
