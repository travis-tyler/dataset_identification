[{"section_title": "", "text": "It is difficult to establish a completely consistent series of degree data over a long period of time because of changes in definitions, instructions, and field classifications, including the introduction of new specialties. The data for earlier years are presented as consistently as possible with the classifications used in the current Classification of Instructional Programs (Washington, DC, Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office). See the Technical Notes for further information on the field classifications used. This publication focuses on degrees in science and engineering fields, and, where appropriate, the data have been reclassified according to NSF field categories. This report supersedes previous editions, not only because it includes later data, but because fields classified as science and engineering differ slightly, especially in the social sciences at the doctorate level, from those of past editions. It should be noted that data on engineering technology degrees and degrees in the health/medical sciences are not included in the science and engineering totals here. The time series for this report begins in 1966. This report is based on final data from several Federal surveys. Two of them are the U.S. Department of Education's Survey of Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred, and the Completions Survey conducted annually by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) as part of the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), later renamed the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). A third is the Survey of Earned Doctorates, conducted annually for the National Science Foundation (NSF) and four other Federal agencies by the National Research Council. In addition, population data on various age groups for tables 56-58 were obtained from Current Population Surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. Each source is described in more detail in the following sections. Data from the Survey of Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred and from the Completions Survey were used to report the number of bachelor's and master's degrees. The data on doctoral degrees in this report were derived from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, which surveyed all individuals earning research doctorates, rather than from the Completions Survey, which surveyed the institutions awarding the doctorates. The Earned Doctorate data were preferred because the data provided by individuals are more specific with respect to the field of specialization and are less prone to errors in data reporting and data entry than are the data provided by institutions. Furthermore, doctorate data provide 100 percent coverage for data by field and sex of individual recipients, whereas institutional data are subject to imputation for nonresponse. For a comparison of reporting on doctoral degrees in the Completions Survey and the Survey of Earned Doctorates, see National Science Foundation, Science and Engineering Doctorates: 1960-91, NSF 93-301, Detailed Statistical Tables (Washington, DC, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "BACHELOR'S AND MASTER'S DEGREE DATA", "text": "In the Survey of Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred and in the Completions Survey, data are collected on all degrees conferred between July 1 and June 30 from the universe of accredited institutions of higher education in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories and Outlying Areas. The survey forms are filled out by institution administrative personnel. The data are collected according to sex of recipient and field of study. In 1994, the final universe of institutions granting bachelor's or higher level degrees was 2,703. Each year between 1966 and 1994, institutional responses to these surveys exceeded 85 percent. Imputations for nonresponse were based on the previous year's response for an institution, if available. Because the data in this report include those for institutions in the U.S. territories, they may differ from numbers published by NCES that relate only to the 50 States and the District of Columbia and their field groupings. Data on degrees by field of study were collected according to the Classification of Instructional Programs, developed by NCES. Four field classification systems were used during the 1966-94 period. (See \"Current Classification Schemes.\") DOCTORAL DEGREE DATA In the. Survey of Earned Doctorates, information is collected during the period of July 1 of one year to June 30 of the next from all persons who have fulfilled the requirements for a research doctorate. The survey is funded jointly by NSF and four other agencies: the U.S. Department of Education, the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Research Council sends the survey forms to all accredited doctorate-granting institutions for distribution by the graduate deans to all research doctorate recipients as they complete degree requirements. Information collected in the survey comprises demographic data, such as the student's sex, citizenship, and racial/ethnic group; education history, including field of degrees; sources of graduate student support; employment status during the year preceding receipt of the doctorate; postgraduation plans; and background on parents' education. Approximately 95 percent of the doctorate recipients complete and return the survey forms. For nonrespondents, commencement programs constituted a source of skeletal information that was added to the file. These variables were sex, field of study, institution, year of doctorate, and educational background. Consequently, for the variables used in this report, there is complete coverage. Data are updated annually from completed survey forms submitted belatedly by previous nonrespondents; therefore, data on doctorates are subject to revision and may differ very slightly from reports published earlier. decennial censuses. The completeness of coverage is estimated to be 97.3 percent for 22-year-olds, 97.8 percent for 24-year-olds, and 99.8 percent for 30-yearolds."}, {"section_title": "FIELD CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES", "text": "It is difficult to establish a completely consistent series of degree data over a long period of time, given changes in field classifications and evolving fields of study. Data for the earlier years are presented as consistently as possible with the current classification schemes of fields of study, which show the Completions and the Earned Doctorates Surveys field codes used in this report. The first listing, (beginning on page 5), compares the current classification schemes for both the Completions and the Earned Doctorates Surveys. The second listing (page 12) shows historical changes in the Department of Education's previous classification systems for the Earned Degrees and the Completions Surveys as they affect the taxonomy for bachelor's-degree and master's-degree data used in this report. Note that the data in this report have been grouped into the science and engineering categories used by NSF. Therefore, data in this report may differ from those in reports published by the U.S. Department of Education.  1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year  1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCES: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from Department of Education/National Center for  1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 "}, {"section_title": "Social sciences", "text": "Math/computer Physical sciences 1966Physical sciences 1968Physical sciences 1970Physical sciences 1972Physical sciences 1974Physical sciences 1976Physical sciences 1978Physical sciences 1980Physical sciences 1982Physical sciences 1984Physical sciences 1986Physical sciences 1988Physical sciences 1990Physical sciences 1992Physical sciences 1994 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCES: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from Department of Education  1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCE: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from the NSF/SRS Survey of Earned Doctorates  1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCE: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from the NSF/SRS Survey of Earned Doctorates  1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCE: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from the NSF/SRS Survey of Earned Doctorates  1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year  1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCES: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from Department of Education/National Center for  1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 Year SOURCES: Chart by National Science Foundation/SRS; data from the NSF/SRS Survey of Earned Doctorates, and Bureau of the Census SECTION C.
