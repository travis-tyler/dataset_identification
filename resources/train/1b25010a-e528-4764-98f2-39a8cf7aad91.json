UMAN diploid fibroblasts have been extensively employed as a model cell culture system for examining cellular aging (1) . Support for the use of these cells in aging studies has come from studies that indicate an inverse relationship between the total number of cell population doublings (\"in vitro life span\") and the age of the cell culture donor (2) (3) (4) . This relationship has led to the use of cells from young and old human volunteers in numerous cellular aging studies (4) . In the process of establishing a national resource of skin fibroblast cell cultures from 552 volunteer members of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (IMR), we had the opportunity to examine these cultures for their in vitro life-span potential. We have previously demonstrated that the in vitro life-span potential or number of cell population doublings (CPDs) can be estimated with accuracy by measuring the colony size distribution (CSD) of these cultures (5) (6) (7) (8) . Therefore, we examined both CPD and CSD in a number of these cell cultures, and then, after confirmation of the excellent relationship of these two parameters, we measured CSD on the cultures donated to the IMR repository.\nIn this article, we report the results of experiments designed to ask the following questions. First, is the relationship between donor age and estimated in vitro life span linear across the age span or is it specific to an age group? Second, is the estimated in vitro life span related to the subsequent longevity of the biopsy donor? Third, could we detect a decline in the estimate of in vitro life span in fibroblasts derived by repeated skin biopsies of the same individuals over time? Fourth, does glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, or cancer incidence of the subjects affect the estimated in vitro life span of their cultured cells?"}, {"section_title": "M ETHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Human Skin Fibroblast Cultures", "text": "Skin biopsies were taken from BLSA volunteers, who come to the Gerontology Research Center of the National Institute on Aging approximately every 2 years for a comprehensive series of physiologic and psychological tests.

In general, studies that compared the proliferation potential of cells from young donors and older donors have shown a significant decline in proliferation potential in cultures derived from older donors (reviewed in 1). However, another recent study involving cell lines from the members of the BLSA found no significant decline in in vitro life span with donor age (10) . Several studies based on relatively small sample sizes and employing cells other than human fibroblasts have shown a strong steady decline throughout the ages studied (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . In this regard, it appears that there is a more severe decline in proliferation potential of certain cell types such as vascular endothelial cells (11, 12) , and vascular smooth muscle cells The change in estimated in vitro life span in relationship to the time between biopsies. Subjects have an initial value at time zero, and values at each time that they subsequently had a biopsy. The regression line represents the fixed effects (i.e., average for the entire sample) part of the repeated measure mixed-effects model (i.e., the average longitudinal time course for these subjects). B, The longitudinal changes are shown by age decade at which subjects were first evaluated. The length of the line represents the average time of follow-up for these subjects.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-abstract/57/6/B239/564318 by guest on 16 January 2019 (14) , for example, than of fibroblast like cells of the skin. This may reflect the lower inherent proliferation potential of these cells compared with skin fibroblasts or alternatively a higher rate of cell turnover in vivo for certain types of cells. The current study extends, on a greater scale, the previous observations that cell cultures derived from young adults aged 20 to 29 years have significantly longer in vitro life spans than those derived from older adults (aged 65 years or older) (2-4). However, we did not find a significant trend after age 29 in men, and only a modest (but significant) decrease in the in vitro life span of cultures derived from aging women. In a study of in vitro life spans of cultures derived from donors spanning the human life span by Martin and colleagues (3), the largest differences in in vitro life span were between those cultures derived from fetal material and the youngest age groups and those derived from individuals over the age of 29 years. Our previous report, which showed a relationship between in vitro life span and donor age involved only the two ends of the age spectrum-a young group, ages 21 to 35 years, and an older group, ages 65 years and older (4) .\nThe proliferative potential of cell cultures established from female donors showed a significant decline as a function of donor age. It is unknown why the fibroblasts derived from female donors showed an age-related decline in proliferation whereas those derived from male donors did not. However, it should be noted that the proliferative potential of cells derived from female donors in their third decade of life was substantially higher than that derived from male donors. Furthermore, cells derived from women in their ninth decade of life had a lower proliferation potential than those derived from men. This finding suggests that the initial doubling potential of cells from women is higher than that for men but declines more rapidly with age. One possible reason for this more rapid decline is that women tend to have more sun exposure on their upper arms than men (16) .\nWhen taken altogether, the data showed no significant decline in doubling potential in subjects over the age of 30 years. A plausible explanation for this is that, during development, growth, and maturation, individuals experience a significantly higher cell turnover rate than they do in later life. A similar relative decline is observed in the Syrian hamster fibroblast in vitro life span after early adulthood (17) . Physiological studies of aging (18) also indicate that peak performance for many parameters starts declining during the fourth decade of life (30-39 years) and might be a result of an earlier decline in proliferation potential. In fact, certain physiologic functions that feature declines in cellular proliferation function may peak at ages 11 to 19 years and start declining in the 20s (18) .\nOur observed lack of correlation between in vitro proliferative capacity and longevity is not surprising because life expectancy is clearly defined by a myriad of factors; although proliferative capabilities may play an important role, it is unlikely that they alone would determine mortality.\nOur studies of cell cultures derived from individuals with diabetes is at variance with a previous report that demonstrated decreased in vitro life spans in these cultures (19, 20) . The reason for this discrepancy is not known. However, it is possible that differences in biopsy technique, cell culture conditions, or both may be responsible.\nInterestingly, we found that fibroblasts from donors who had had skin cancer before biopsies were taken had a significantly lower doubling potential than those taken from donors who had not been diagnosed with skin cancer. Even though the biopsies were taken from the inner aspect of the upper arm, it is possible that a subset of individuals had such high sun exposure that even this usually protected area suffered actinic damage. This observation is consistent with the findings of Gilchrest (16) , who found that sun exposure (significantly correlated with skin cancer) resulted in a decreased in vitro life span. Finally, our comparison of cell cultures from survivors and deceased BLSA members sug- gests no relationship between life expectancy and proliferation potential. The lack of a significant trend in in vitro life spans in cultures from adults over the age of 29 years might suggest that these cultures may not be good models for studying aging. However, the enormous variation observed between cultures derived from different human volunteers reflects the difficulty of studying a genetically diverse population of human volunteers.\nIn an effort to address the genetic heterogeneity issue, we estimated the cell proliferative life span of biopsies taken from the same donor at different ages. The maximum time between biopsies was 9 years. The moderate, but not yet significant, decrease in proliferative capabilities of cell cultures derived from the same individuals from repeated biopsies is intriguing and suggests that increasing the time of this longitudinal study might result in a highly significant correlation. A number of studies comparing fibroblasts from young and old donors and human fetal fibroblasts at early and late passage have shown much more consistent differences in the latter experimental paradigm (1, 4) . However, the consistent difference observed between cell cultures derived from individuals in their 20s and those in later decades does provide a reasonable in vitro model system for studying cellular aging. There have been numerous reports demonstrating a significant difference between cell cultures derived from these young (aged 20-29 years) and old adults (aged 65\u03e9 years). However, investigators should be cautious when comparing all cultures in the intermediate decades.\nThe techniques used may also influence the results. In one large study that combined samples from living donors with those from cadavers, a significant negative correlation of doubling potential with donor age was seen (3). However, when the data were disaggregated, separating the live donors from the cultures established from cadavers, there was no correlation in the data from the living donors but the correlation remained for the cultures from cadavers. One explanation for this result is that larger biopsies were taken from the cadavers, perhaps decreasing the sample to sample variation (G. Martin, oral communication, July 1999). The studies discussed herein measured or estimated total proliferation potential of the cultures in population doublings. Population doublings are a very crude measure of proliferative ability. For example, a change of 10 population doublings in the proliferation potential of two biopsies might mean that all the cells in one biopsy were capable of exactly 10 fewer doublings than those of the other. At the other extreme, it could be that the proliferation potential of the cells is not changed but that only 1 out of 1000 cells is capable of being stimulated to divide at all. The actual case is undoubtedly somewhere in between the two extremes. However, it is easy to see that a change of only 10 population doublings could have very profound effects on the ability of a tissue to respond to insult.\nA more sensitive way to measure changes in proliferative ability is to measure the proportion of cells in a biopsy that can form colonies of a given size when the cells are plated at clonal density directly upon dissociation of the tissue. A loss of clonal growth ability in human bone marrow cells has been demonstrated by using this technique (21, 22) . In addition, this method has been used to show that dietary restriction decreases the rate of loss of proliferative ability in mouse skin cells and other cell types (23) . Other investigators were unable to detect the protective effects of caloric restriction (24) when they used the more crude population doubling method."}]
