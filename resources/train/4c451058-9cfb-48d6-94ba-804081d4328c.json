[{"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Regional concentrations of farms raising livestock and poultry in confinement and their potential adverse effects on water quality and public health have prompted Federal regulations and guidelines on animal waste management. The primary emphasis of recent policies is to limit the application of manure to land at rates no greater than those at which crops can extract specified nutrients from the manure. Limiting the rate of manure application will limit potential nutrient runoff to surface water. However, many confined animal operations have insufficient land on the farm to land-apply all the manure produced without exceeding nutrient requirements of the crops grown. Some of the manure, therefore, must be moved off the farm to be spread on other land in the area. In regions with many confined animals, manure-hauling distances (and the resultant costs) are determined largely by the spatial distribution of land area available for manure application relative to the location of animal operations requiring additional land."}, {"section_title": "What Is the Issue?", "text": "An accurate assessment of the costs of manure hauling and land application argues for a regional perspective that accounts for the acreage needed (in addition to land on the animal farm itself) and that considers spatial interactions across animal operations and agricultural land resources.

As part of a broader ERS assessment of the costs of manure management, a regional modeling framework was developed to evaluate the effect of Federal guidelines for farmland application of manure on hauling and spreading costs.

The modeling system is centered on a nonlinear mathematical programming model of animal manure-nutrient production and distribution. The regional model allocates manure nutrients produced within the Chesapeake Bay basin to agricultural land for crop use to minimize hauling and land application costs incurred by the regional animal sector, given land availability and nutrient management policies. The model was defined at a watershed spatial scale that includes portions of six States (Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia) to account for the regional distribution of crop and pasture land as well as the animal operations competing for available land resources.

The integration of Census and GIS data enables the regional model to capture important spatial interactions between animal concentrations and land available for manure spreading. With a large proportion of animal producers dependent on land off the farm for manure spreading, competition for available land resources is an important consideration in the costs of managing manure. Competition for land and the resultant hauling requirements and costs of manure management will depend, in turn, on the (policy-determined) manure application rate, quantities of manure that can be used for industrial purposes, and landowners' willingness to accept manure on farmland. During the initial application of the model, a number of potential model improvements and extensions were identified. Several priority extensions of the model are under development for future model applications, as outlined"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents a discussion of the Chesapeake Bay Regional Manure Management Model, developed for use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS) project on \"Manure Management for Improved Water Quality.\" The report is intended to document the modeling framework, addressing model purpose and scope, model structure, parameter assumptions, data sources, and output generation. The model is designed to capture the spatial relationship between manurenutrient production and land available for manure spreading, and implications for manure-hauling costs under Federal guidelines for animal waste management. The discussion highlights the use of farm-level survey data and cropland coverages from national databases within a regional optimization framework. Discussion of the modeling framework draws on empirical findings and visual presentations from the ERS analysis of costs of manurenutrient management (Ribaudo et al., 2003). In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and USDA issued joint guidelines for regulatory and voluntary measures to protect water quality and public health from animal-waste pollution. In 2003, EPA published new regulations affecting an estimated 15,500 concentrated animal-feeding operations (CAFOs) (U.S. EPA, 2003). Meanwhile, USDA has a stated goal that all animal-feeding operations (AFOs) develop and implement comprehensive nutrient management plans (CNMPs) to minimize potential pollutant loadings from confined animal facilities and manure land application (USDA, NRCS, 2000). Nutrient standards that cap total applied nutrients-including manure nutrients-based on crop need (cropbased rates) provide the basis for manure application rates under both the USDA policies and EPA regulations. Implementation of nutrient standards will likely impose additional manure-hauling requirements in regions with concentrations of confined animal production. With limits on applied manure per acre, more land is required for manure spreading than is often available on animal-feeding operations and nearby farms, resulting in increased competition for available acreage and greater hauling distances. As part of the Manure Management for Improved Water Quality Project at ERS, a regional modeling framework was developed to evaluate the effect of crop-based nutrient application rates (reflected in Federal guidelines and regulations) on costs of manure hauling and land application. Information developed by USDA indicates that many confined animal operations have insufficient land on the farm to spread all of their manure at crop-based rates (Kellogg et al., 2000). The effect of nutrient standards for land application will require that much of the manure be moved off the confined animal farms. Where animal production is concentrated, manure-handling costs faced by producers are determined largely by the spatial distribution of land area available for manure application and the level of competition among animal farms for available land; those two factors together determine the hauling distance required to access available land. An accurate assessment of the costs of manure hauling and land application argued for a regional perspective that considers spatial interactions across animal operations and agricultural land resources, and the effect of limited land resources in areas where confined animal production is concentrated. The modeling framework was applied to the Chesapeake Bay watershed ( fig. 1). The Chesapeake Bay is among the largest and most biologically rich estuaries in the world. However, excessive nutrient loads from various sources-including wastewater treatment plants, urban runoff, fertilizer applications, animal waste, and atmospheric deposition-have resulted in eutrophication and related ecological shifts that adversely affect wildlife and aquatic resources (Preston and Brakebill, 1999). The declining health of the Bay ecosystem in recent decades has prompted a major Federal/State initiative to reduce excessive nutrient loading to the Bay and tributary streams. Animal agriculture is potentially a major source of nitrogen and phosphorus loadings due to concentrations of large confined animal feeding operations in some areas of the watershed. The Chesapeake Bay watershed encompasses several multi-county areas where the volume of manure-nutrient production from confined animal operations exceeds the capacity of area cropland when manure nutrients are applied at crop-based rates (Gollehon et al., 2001). Federal guidelines and regulations using crop-based nutrient rates are likely to have significant cost effects in areas of the Chesapeake Bay watershed where competition exists for land on which to apply manure."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Modeling Framework", "text": "At the heart of the regional analysis conducted for the Manure Management for Improved Water Quality Project is a nonlinear mathematical programming model of animal manure-nutrient production and distribution developed for the Chesapeake Bay watershed ( fig. 2). The Chesapeake Bay regional model was developed with GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) version 20.7, using the MINOS solver for large non-linear applications. 1 The model is designed to assess regional costs of manure management, transport, and land application in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, given the existing structure of the animal industry and manure-storage technologies currently in use. Manure production is allocated to crop and pasture land within the basin to minimize costs to the regional animal sector, subject to land availability, nutrient uptake capacity, and nutrient management policies in effect. The model is used to evaluate the cost and feasibility of land application for manure disposal, and the effect of key policy provisions and manure use assumptions on costs to the animal sector. A defining feature of the modeling system involves the integration, within an optimization framework, of cropland coverages from the Geographic Information System (GIS) and farm-level data from the Agricultural Census, aggregated to the county level.

The following may help to clarify the reach of the modeling framework presented here: The regional modeling framework provides a unique and valuable perspective on the effect of Federal regulations and guidelines for manure management, both on and off the manure-producing farm. As a large portion of manure transport costs are determined by conditions off the farm, the regional model captures important spatial interactions in animal concentrations and land available for manure spreading. The effect of spatial considerations on sector costs are not as readily addressed in farm-level or national-sector analyses. Reliance on national data series for key model parameters ensures consistency of data across States in the watershed. County-level specification permits important subregional differentiation in such cost determinants as animal production by species, nutrient uptake, waste technologies, and regulatory conditions across county and State boundaries. However, representative costs in the model may not accurately reflect costs faced by all animal operations in a region. The model assesses, in particular, the cost and feasibility of manure land application in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. While manure land application is an important element of EPA regulations and USDA nutrient management policies, the model is not designed to assess the full cost effect of a specific Federal regulation or program. The model focuses on those costs specific to manure hauling and land application. Cost categories not considered in the model include manurestorage infrastructure and processing. Moreover, additional capital, labor, and equipment costs not captured in the model may be needed to achieve the extent of manure land application addressed in the ERS study. A recent Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) assessment suggests that these costs may be substantial (USDA, 2003). The model provides a static, single-year assessment of sector costs given prevailing production conditions in the latter 1990s. The model does not endogenously capture adjustments in animal concentrations, crop mix, and manure-handling systems in response to manure management policies and potential attendant changes in base estimates of manure-nutrient excess and nutrient assimilative capacity of cropland. Measures of manure-nutrient excess are computed from farm-level survey information, based on reported manure production and agronomic rates of land application. Applied manure in the model reflects calculated rates under a nitrogen or phosphorus standard, as actual rates and patterns of manure land application are unavailable. Thus, the model can be used to assess costs under alternative nutrient standard specifications. However, since we do not have data on actual application rates in the 1997 census base year, we cannot compare costs before and after the imposition of standards. As a cost-minimization model, the framework provides a partial analysis of the least-cost means of manure land disposal, based on management alternatives specified under a given scenario. The model does not assess changes in the profitability of animal production, since output prices and substitution possibilities are not considered. While land application of manure at agronomic rates is motivated by water policy concerns, the model is not designed to assess water quality per se. The model allocates manure across the basin, consistent with land-based nutrient standards, but does not currently track potential nutrient loadings to water bodies. An assessment of water-quality implications would require integration with other modeling tools that consider nutrient fate and transport and resulting water-quality effects."}, {"section_title": "Model Spatial Scale", "text": "The modeling analysis is defined at a watershed spatial scale. The county serves as the primary modeling unit for the regional model. The county-level specification provides consistency with Census of Agriculture data and other data available at a county level. At the same time, the county scale permits differentiation in animal production, nutrient uptake, and waste technologies across county and State boundaries within the watershed. Subregional variation in regulatory conditions may also be incorporated, where regulations are specified at a State or county level. The full basin model includes 160 non-municipality counties with farmland in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, each potentially representing a source and a destination county. Manure is produced in a source county and landapplied (or otherwise disposed of) in a destination county. Sink counties, or destination counties with cropland wholly outside the basin area, serve as potential receiving areas for manure exported from the watershed. The full watershed model also includes 55 sink counties that are non-municipality counties within 60 kilometers (37 miles) of cropland in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, measured from the edge of the source county's cropland base. Of the 160 basin counties in the model, 52 are edge counties containing a share of cropland acreage outside the watershed. In edge counties, manurenutrient use is apportioned by share of cropland within the basin to more accurately account for effects at a watershed scale. 3 Appendix 1 provides a list of basin and sink counties included in the model. 2 The user specifies the set of States and/or counties to be included in a given model run. 3 The share of cropland within the Chesapeake Bay watershed was calculated within the Geographic Information System, using an overlay of the watershed boundary over the U.S. Geological Survey National Land Cover Dataset. Counties are further disaggregated according to a 12-square kilometer grid system. The sub-county grids are used to spatially assign land available for manure application within a given county (hereafter termed \"spreadable\" land) to match observed cropland and pasture land coverages. The subcounty grids are also used to assign location of animal operations (discussed under \"Model Data: Distance Functions for Manure Hauling\"). While manure flows are aggregated at the county level, transport costs are calculated based on manure quantities and hauling distance from a specific county grid point. There are 1,857 sub-county grid areas with animal farms included in the Chesapeake Bay regional model."}, {"section_title": "Model Variables and Activities", "text": "Key decision variables in the model include the quantity of manure transported by system type, the hauling distance of manure moved off the farm, and acres used for manure spreading in receiving counties. The model allocates manure across the basin to minimize the regional cost of manure hauling and land application. The direction and magnitude of manure transfers are shaped by the nutrient and moisture content of the source manure, the nutrient uptake capacity of receiving lands, and per-unit costs of manure hauling and land application. In addition, policy provisions for nutrient standards, as well as assumptions on manure use for industrial purposes and landowner willingness to accept manure on cropland, have an important bearing on regional manure allocations and sector costs. (See Appendix 2 for a listing of model variables.) Off-farm manure transfers, including within-county and out-of-county destinations, represent the primary activities in the model. Potential county-tocounty transfers were developed based on an assumed maximum radial distance of 60 kilometers (km), or 37 miles, measured from the outer edge of the source county's cropland base. For the 10 percent of modeled counties with the largest manure surplus to available land base, a maximum radial distance of 150 km (93 miles) was assumed. This combination of distances provided the model with a 150-km distance in the cases where spreadable land area is most limiting and long-distance transport might be needed, while avoiding unneeded transfer possibilities in most counties where 60 km is adequate. Even with adjustments in maximum transport distance by county to reduce transfer options, there are still 4,060 countylevel transfer possibilities in the full watershed model, including withincounty and out-of-county transfer combinations. County-level manure flows represent off-farm manure transfers from all confined animal farms. Manure transfers are disaggregated by sub-county source grid, manure system type, and distance interval to more accurately assess manure-hauling costs. The full model includes over 300,000 transfer alternatives. 4 The maximum set of potential county-grid transfer alternatives generated through the automated GIS procedure was filtered to exclude county combinations with little or no probability of occurrence. 5 The filtering process slightly reduced the dimensionality of the model, which helped to reduce model convergence time. 4 There are roughly 372,000 variables and 288,000 equations in the full model specification. 5 Filtering criteria for manure transfers excluded: (1) source counties with zero manure surplus countywide, (2) destination sink counties with zero excess land capacity (after accounting for within-county manure surplus), and (3) county-to-county combinations involving source counties with extremely low manure surplus per cropland area within-county (<0.01 ton/ac) and more than a limited hauling distance (>5 linear km) to access out-of-county lands; source counties with very low manure surplus per cropland area (>0.01 and <0.1 ton/ac) and long hauling distances (>20 km); destinations counties with extremely high manure surplus per cropland area (>0.4 ton/ac) and very long hauling distances (>60 km); destination counties with high manure surplus per cropland area (>0.25 ton/ac) and extremely long hauling distances (>120 km), and destination counties with limited cropland area (< 15,000 acres) and extremely long hauling distances (>120 km). Source-county grid transfers were limited to those grids with AFOs. Maximum hauling distances were also applied on lagoon and slurry manure with high moisture content (10 and 50 miles, respectively), limiting potential county-tocounty options for these systems."}, {"section_title": "Model Data", "text": "The two primary data sources for the model include the 1997 Census of Agriculture and the 1994 National Land Cover Dataset. The 1997 Census of Agriculture was administered by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), USDA. Primary data processing for this analysis was conducted by the Economic Research Service (ERS), USDA, and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA. The resulting database provided base model data on animal farms, numbers of animals (used to estimate manure production), and cropped area and production (used to estimate the land assimilative capacity of manure nutrients). The 1994 National Land Cover Dataset, developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), was used to establish the spatial pattern of land available for manure spreading. The resulting land coverage was used as a basis for developing distance functions for manure hauling and simulating the spatial distribution of animal operations. In addition to the two primary data sources, technology and cost coefficients applicable to the Chesapeake Bay watershed were obtained from various sources, including the Costs Associated with Development and Implementation of Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans prepared by NRCS (USDA, NRCS, 2003), the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data developed by NASS and ERS (USDA, 2002 and2000), and additional data obtained from published literature and subject matter specialists within the Government and universities."}, {"section_title": "Manure-Nutrient Production and Use", "text": "Farm-level data collected for the 1997 Census of Agriculture were used to estimate county-level measures of animal operations and animal-units, total manure production, surplus recoverable manure (in excess of source-farm crop need), manure-nutrient content, and potential assimilative capacity of the land for applied manure nutrients (USDA, NASS, 1999). Farm-level measures were computed from the Agricultural Census and other technical data. Results from the farm-level calculations were then aggregated to the county level and combined with data from various other sources for analytic and modeling purposes. 6 Census data coefficients are computed following procedures in Gollehon et al. (2001) and Kellogg et al. (2000). Animal operations. The analysis focuses on confined animal species since they represent the primary source of excess manure nutrients produced on farms with confined animals. Animal species types considered in the analysis include: feedlot beef, dairy, swine, and poultry (chicken and turkey). Numbers of confined animals and numbers of farms with confined animals-or Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs)-were obtained by county from the Census of Agriculture. This subset of animal farms does not represent the total production of manure nutrients, but rather the nutrient production for those operations for which State and Federal animal-waste disposal policies are most relevant. Manure-nutrient production. Production of primary manure nutrientsnitrogen and phosphorus-is estimated based on census-derived animal numbers and coefficients of manure production by animal type. Computation of manure nutrients followed a three-step process. First, animal numbers were converted to an average number of annual animal-units 7 (AU) from reported end-of-year inventory and annual sales data. Second, quantities of manure were computed using coefficients of manure production by animal type and the number of AU. Data development on manure production was geared primarily to AFOs operating above a minimum scale to reflect commercial operations. 8 Third, the recoverable portion of the manure nutrients per ton of manure was computed by animal type after adjusting for losses during collection, transfer, and storage. Recoverable manure nutrients represent that portion of manure that can be collected and applied to land net of storage and handling losses at the source site. Nutrient content of recoverable manure reflects a composite nutrient composition of manure produced by county, based on county-level distributions of animal species from the Census of Agriculture. (See Kellogg et al. 2000for details of the estimation process for manure-nutrient production and loss coefficients.) 9 Nutrient assimilative capacity. Farmland assimilative capacity for nutrients is estimated across farm types (i.e., non-animal farms, confined animal farms, and non-confined animal farms) based on acreage and reported yields for major field crops and pasture, aggregated to the county level. Farmland acreage available for manure spreading is calculated based on acreage in 24 major field crops and permanent pasture from the Census of Agriculture. 10 Crop and pasture land acreage in out-of-basin sink counties is assumed available for manure from the watershed, after adjusting for application of locally produced manure within the sink county. See Kellogg et al. 2000for details of the estimation process for manure-nutrient uptake coefficients. Manure-nutrient excess. Manure-nutrient excess refers to the quantity of manure that cannot be spread at crop-based agronomic rates on the source animal farm and thus must be hauled off the farm for land application. Manure-nutrient excess is computed under both a nitrogen-based (N) standard and a phosphorus (P) standard. These standards differ by the nutrient that determines the per-acre crop application rate, with a P standard generally allowing less manure per acre. Onfarm manure-nutrient excess is estimated by applying farm-level census measures of manure-nutrient production relative to the farm's potential to use nutrients for crop production. Excess recoverable manure nutrients are calculated as those that exceed the onfarm assimilative capacity of confined feeding operations, based on the amount of land controlled by farms with confined animals. 11 County surplus manure to be hauled off-farm is calculated for each nutrient standard based on an aggregation of farm-level manure-nutrient excess across animal farms. Land base for surplus manure. The farmland base potentially available for surplus manure is defined to include all cropland and pasture land in 24 major crops on non-animal farms and some portion of acreage in those crops on both confined and nonconfined animal operations. Acreage in nonconfined operations was adjusted for nonrecoverable manure-N available on the farm. Acreage in confined animal operations is from farms with surplus capacity to absorb off-farm manure nutrients, accounting for their own crop nutrient needs. 7 Annual animal-units reflect a biologically based definition of an AU of 1,000 pounds of live animal weight for feedlot beef, dairy, swine, and poultry, using average animal weights. 8 Operations were included if: (1) animals generated more than $2,000 in sales on the farm, or (2) at least three AU were reported on the farm. Confined animals and their minimum scales were: feedlot beef (15 head), dairy (20 head), swine (50 head for slaughter), and poultry (100 head of broilers or 50 head of layers or turkeys). Of particular note, these data do not include estimates of the recoverable portion of manure from cattle, other than fattened cattle and milk cows (bulls, beef cows, dairy and beef replacement heifers, calves less than 500 pounds, and calves greater than 500 pounds not in a feedlot). If cattle other than fattened cattle and milk cows were included in the analysis, farm numbers would double, the number of AU would increase by only 6 percent, and recoverable manure nitrogen would increase by about 5 percent. 9 Adjustments in base manure-nutrient composition measures to reflect changes in animal mix, feed mix, genetic stock, and nutrient losses may be incorporated into the model through a series of factor adjustments for nitrogen and phosphorus. 10 Adjustments in the composite uptake rate by county to reflect changes in crop mix and/or crop yield may be incorporated into the model through a series of factor adjustments applied by farm type for crop and pasture land. 11 We recognize this calculation process has the potential to overstate excess manure nutrients since some manure is moved off many production farms. However, total excess nutrients on confined livestock farms were more likely to be understated since neither commercial fertilizer applications nor atmospheric deposition of nutrients were considered in this analysis. Most crop farms without animals, and many farms with animals, use chemical fertilizers because they are less bulky, easier to apply, and have a more predictable nutrient content than manure. The model assumes that all acreage on confined animal operations is available for manure spreading. In the case of non-animal farms and nonconfined animal farms, a given percentage of total farmland base is assumed available for spreading, reflecting assumptions on the willingness of landowners to accept manure. Landowners may be reluctant to accept manure for various reasons. These factors include uncertainty about manurenutrient content and availability, high transportation and handling costs relative to commercial fertilizer, soil compaction from spreading equipment, dispersion of weed seeds, concerns for added regulatory oversight, and public perception regarding odor and pathogen issues (Risse et al., 2001). While little data exist on levels of landowner willingness to accept manure on their fields, findings from this empirical study suggest that this is an important determinant of costs facing animal producers. Adjustments to reflect willingness to accept manure, specified separately for cropland and pasture land, are used to reduce the model land base effectively available for manure spreading. 12 Manure application rates. Application rates for manure applied off-farm are computed for each within-county and out-of-county transfer based on average nutrient content of manure from the source county and average peracre nutrient uptake on farmland in the destination county, adjusted for nutrient standard requirements and field losses. Average manure-nutrient composition by county is derived from animal mix data from the Agricultural Census and coefficients on nutrient production per AU (Kellogg et al., 2000). Average per-acre nutrient uptake rate by county is derived from cropping pattern and yield data from the Agricultural Census. Application rates and total quantity of manure that can be applied are tallied separately for confined animal farms to reflect the cropping patterns and yields specific to farms with confined animals. 13 Manure application rates in the model vary with the nutrient standard in effect. Under an N standard, manure is applied based on crop nitrogen needs over the growing season; under a P standard, manure applications are based on crop phosphorus needs. Manure applied according to a P standard is generally applied at a lower per-acre rate than under an N standard, implying more land is needed for a given quantity of manure. 14 Reduced application rates under a P standard reflect the ratio of N and P requirements of most crops relative to the N and P ratio typical of most manure. The model user may specify the share of acres required to meet a given nutrient standard if values are known, with variable shares permitted across county subregions and crop and pasture land categories. 15 Manure application rates are further adjusted to reflect the level of application loss. An estimated 30 percent of manure-N applied is not available to the crop due to unavoidable losses of nitrogen, primarily from volatization of ammonia. Applied manure under the N standard allows for sufficient manure-N to meet both full crop needs for nitrogen, plus the 30-percent field loss (Kellogg et al., 2000). An additional loss adjustment factor reflects the extent of manure incorporation-the base N loss factor is adjusted downward by 5 percent for fields with soil incorporation and 30 percent for fields without incorporation (Fleming et al., 1998). 12 In order to bound potential cost estimates, the ERS study fixed levels of willingness to accept manure over a range from 10 percent to 100 percent of crop and pasture land on non-animal farms and nonconfined animal farms (Ribaudo et al., 2003). 13 Manure application rates are automatically modified to reflect adjustments in manure nutrient content (due to changes in feed supplements or animal mix) and nutrient uptake rates (due to changes in cropping patterns or yields). 14 Under a multi-year P standard, applied manure per acre is equivalent to that under an N standard, with treated acres rotated over a multi-year sequence to fully use excess stored manure-P, thus minimizing application costs. 15 Since reliable data on the share of land requiring the more stringent phosphorus standard are not available at a watershed scale, separate model scenarios were specified in the ERS study as if all acres would apply manure according to either an annual N or P standard, thus bracketing the full range of possible cost effects."}, {"section_title": "Technology Use and Input Costs", "text": "Technology use and input cost data supplemented available production data from the Agricultural Census in assessing costs of production adjustments within the animal sector. Data categories involve nutrient management plans; manure storage and handling systems; commercial fertilizer offsets; industrial uses of manure; and feed supplements. Costs associated with training and certification for manure application and calibration of the manure spreader were assumed to be incorporated within reported application costs per ton of manure hauled. Manure storage and handling systems. Manure production levels from the Agricultural Census were apportioned by manure storage and handling systems by county (table 1). Three representative manure system categories were defined in the study-lagoon systems (open, uncovered storage), slurry systems, and dry systems (primarily poultry litter in the Chesapeake Bay watershed). Allocation of manure production by storage/handling system was necessary to capture important cost differences across manurehauling modes, hauling weight, and application. Allocation of manure production by manure-storage system category was computed based on AUs by species as a share of total confined AUs, system shares by animal species, and manure generation per AU. Animal-units by species as a share of total confined AUs were obtained from the information developed from the Agricultural Census. Information on manure system shares for hog and dairy operations was obtained from Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data (USDA, ERS, 2000). Manure shares for lagoon, slurry, and dry systems by animal species were based on animal operations with a single system. Hog values were based on reported values for Virginia, the sole State in the Chesapeake Bay watershed represented in the 1998 ARMS hog survey. Dairy values were reported for Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania in the 2000 ARMS dairy survey, with estimates for Delaware and Maryland based on Pennsylvania. Beef cattle estimates were assumed equivalent to dairy estimates by State. Poultry production is assumed to use dry litter systems. Manure-hauling weights are based on wet tons of manure, which contain moisture and bedding content that vary by manure system and species type (USDA, NRCS, 1999;and Barker et al., 2001 et al., 2001;and Fleming et al., 1998), supplemented with data from NRCS (USDA, NRCS, 2003). Charges reflect a base rate per wet ton (manure loading/unloading and application) and cost per ton-mile (manure hauling). Charges are specified by storage/hauling mode and distance interval to reflect substantial differences in per-unit costs. (Application costs, expressed on a per-ton basis, are separated out for reporting purposes). Maximum hauling distances for lagoon and slurry waste were fixed at 10 and 50 road miles, respectively; hauling distance for dry litter system waste was bounded by maximum transport distances in the model. Hauling costs were based on a round trip distance, with no backhauling. All manure-hauling costs are applied to the source county, although the model provides flexibility in assigning a share of costs across source and destination counties.  estimated 40 percent of acres using incorporation based on information from the ARMS hog and dairy surveys. Commercial fertilizer. The calculation of savings from fertilizer offsets assumes that organic nutrients from manure replaces chemical fertilizer on a 1:1 basis. Calculation further assumes that only the manure nutrients beneficially used in crop production are valued. Thus, excess P applied under a nitrogen standard is not considered in calculation of fertilizer savings, i.e., no benefit was given for manure nutrients in excess of crop needs. Moreover, savings do not consider the additional benefits of manure as a soil amendment (organic matter and soil tilth). Chemical fertilizer cost savings are based on reported 1997 prices by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), based on representative fertilizer products for the Northeastern U.S. (USDA, NASS, 2001). Nitrogen price reflects the U.S. average price ($160/ton) for a nitrogen solution of 30 percent N, or a price per active ingredient of $0.27/lb. N. (The 30-percent nitrogen solution is selected as a representative form of N because it was the lowest priced form of N with adequate use for NASS to record prices for both regions-Northeast and Southeast-encompassing area within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.) Phosphorus price reflects the price per ton of triple superphosphate (45 percent P), averaged across the Northeast and Southeast ($267/ton), or an active ingredient price of $0.30/lb. P. Cost-savings for reduced fertilizer application costs (under an N standard) of $5/acre were from Fleming (1998). Industrial uses of manure. Primary industrial uses of manure include use as an input source for power generation and as a direct ingredient in composted fertilizer products, primarily for specialty uses (i.e., residential, nursery, and golf courses). Industrial uses of manure lessen the aggregate cost of manure land application in the basin through reductions in both the amount of manure requiring application on crop and pasture land and the need for long distance hauls in areas where animal production is concentrated. Information on manure use in existing applications was obtained by processing facility via personal contact with extension agents and industry representatives. Manure used in industrial uses is represented in the model as an exogenous reduction in the total supply of poultry litter manure to be land-applied. Manure tonnage in industrial uses, expressed in wet tons (with bedding and moisture included), is converted to dry-ton equivalents for consistency with modeling units for manure nutrients. Reductions in dry manure tonnage requiring land application are then apportioned across counties in the vicinity of a given processing facility, based on the relative proximity and volume of manure surplus by county. Two alternative industrial use scenarios were developed for the recent ERS study, representing a near-term (2002-04) and mid-term (within 5-year) time frame (table 2). An estimated 200,000 tons of poultry litter would be diverted to industrial alternatives in the near-term, increasing to 376,000 tons within 5 years. Estimates represent approximately 0.30 and 0.65 percent of the total manure produced in the region, respectively. Near-term estimates include existing composting facilities and two new large-scale plants. Future estimates reflect projected growth in composting operations, full use of existing plants' capacity, and the completion of industrial uses currently in the planning or construction stage. (For more information on industrial use scenarios, see Ribaudo et al., 2003.) Feed supplements. Phytase has been used as a feed supplement for swine and poultry to increase phosphorus use in feed rations and thus reduce phosphorus content of excreted manure. The model assumes a 30-percent reduction in phosphorus content per ton of dry manure with use of phytase as a feed supplement (Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, 2002). Use of phytase is thus represented as an adjustment in the phosphorus content of the county-composite manure, based on manure-P generated by species type, the mix of AUs in the county, and the share of AUs by species receiving phytase feed supplements. The baseline model condition assumes that phytase was not used (consistent with production conditions in the 1997 Agricultural Census survey year); additional model runs were generated to reflect full phytase adoption on hog and poultry operations."}, {"section_title": "Distance Functions for Manure Hauling", "text": "Hauling distances for off-farm manure spreading are assessed based on area-to-distance functions derived from county land use patterns. These functions are a central component of the optimization model-linking the area needed for manure spreading in a destination county with average transport distance required to access the area from a given source county. By incorporating spatial relationships involving animal operations and spreadable land area, area-to-distance functions are intended to capture the inherent competition for land that exists among producers required to move surplus manure off the farm. Figure 3 shows a stylized area-to-distance relationship for manure hauling. Competition for spreadable land is, in part, a function of the spatial pattern of spreadable area. Where farmland is scattered, a higher slope of the area- to-distance relationship reflects relatively long average hauls within the destination county to access a given acreage. Where farmland distribution is more dense, a reduced slope reflects comparatively shorter hauls to access a given acreage. The degree of competition also depends on the number, size, and proximity of confined animal operations, both within and out-of-county. Where land is limited, greater concentrations of animal production will increase competition for spreadable acreage, resulting in longer hauling distances to access available land and greater potential for out-of-county manure exports. GIS estimation of area-to-distance functions involved a series of procedures. First, the spatial coverage for spreadable land was developed for the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) study area. Second, the location of animal feeding operations was assigned within CBW basin counties. Third, area-todistance relationships were calculated for within-county transfers. Fourth, distant intercepts and area-to-distance relationships were calculated for outof-county transfers. Fifth, the slope of linearized area-to-distance functions were estimated for direct use in the model. Finally, area-to-distance relationships were adjusted to reflect adjustments in landowner willingness to accept manure."}, {"section_title": "Spreadable land coverage. The modeling system uses the National Land", "text": "Cover Dataset (NLCD) developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (Homer et al., 2000;and USGS, 2004) to assess the spatial pattern of land available for manure application. This dataset is based on 1992 Landsat thematic mapper imagery at 30-meter resolution, classified into 21 land use categories. By combining the crop and pasture land categories, we can assemble a spatial data set of potentially spreadable land in all counties of the study region, both within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and adjacent counties within a 60-km reach of the watershed boundary. Figure 4 shows the spatial distribution of crop and pasture land in a portion of northwestern Virginia. Location of animal operations. The degree of competition for spreadable land is influenced by the number, location, and size of confined animal operations. While the number and average size of animal feeding operations can be obtained from the census at a county level, the specific locations of operations within a county were unavailable. (The census does not collect precise locational information, and the data are not generally available at a regional scale from other sources.) Therefore, animal operations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed had to be locationally assigned by county within the GIS. For purposes of this analysis, animal operations were randomly assigned within crop and pasture land portions of each county, using a 30meter grid overlay of the county. Manure production and manure by system shares are applied uniformly across animal farms by grid location in the model. Figure 5 shows the assignment of farm operations with confined animals over cropland areas in northwestern Virginia. The random assignment of animal operations in the GIS may yield somewhat conservative estimates of actual hauling distances. While the majority of animal operations tend to be located in proximity to crop and pasture land, some operations may be separated from arable land suitable for manure spreading since production is not as sensitive to soil conditions. Moreover, the spatial concentrations of manure production within a county-reflecting the presence of larger CAFO operations and observed clustering of animal operations-will tend to increase competition for adja-Regional Manure Management Model for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed / TB-1913 Economic Research Service/USDA cent land resources. Nonetheless, the random assignment procedure was regarded as reasonable at a watershed scale, given limitations of the data."}, {"section_title": "Within-county area-to-distance relationships.", "text": "We then used the GIS to compute area-to-distance relationships for within-county manure transfers for each within-basin county in the model. Area-to-distance functions for incounty manure transfers represent the average hauling distance from animal farms in a given county to spreadable land within the same county. With limited amounts of surplus manure, spreadable land is relatively accessible and hauling distances are generally short. As manure-spreading requirements increase, animal operations must compete increasingly for the same acreage-reducing accessibility and increasing the average hauling distance needed to access available acreage. 17 Area-to-distance relationships for within-county transfers were computed for each basin county in the model by incrementally increasing, through a series of expanding 30-meter concentric bands, the search for farmland in the same source county around each of the assigned animal operations. The change in aggregate spreadable area-excluding non-farmland and farmland previously claimed by a competing operation in closer proximity-is measured for each additional distance increment. Thus, the area-to-distance relationship reflects the average distance that must be traveled across all confined animal operations to access a given level of spreadable acreage, accounting for competition among animal producers within the county. The relationship between the spreadable acreage requirement and average distance hauled is upward sloping and fairly linear along much of the observed range (computed line in figure 6). Regional Manure Management Model for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed / TB-1913 Economic Research Service/USDA "}, {"section_title": "Assignment of animal operations", "text": "Note: 1 dot = 1 animal feeding operation. This map illustrates the spatial assignment of animal feeding operations within crop and pasture land area, by county and grid. Out-of-county area-to-distance relationships. Out-of-county relationships represent manure-hauling distances from confined animal operations within a source county to spreadable acreage in other destination counties. Unique out-of-county relationships were generated for all county-to-county combinations within an assumed 60-km linear transport radius. The transport radius for the 16 counties (10 percent of all basin counties) with the highest concentrations of surplus manure relative to spreadable land was expanded to 150 km (93 linear miles), reflecting the greater hauling distances that are likely to be required from areas where animal production is concentrated. A three-stage process was used to generate the area-to-distance relationships for out-of-county transfers (nonlinear curve shown in figure 7). First, to reduce the number of possible source-county grid alternatives, animal farms were aggregated (binned) using a 12-km grid overlay across the entire area. Although the binning procedure reduces the precision of travel distances for out-of-county functions, the procedure was necessary to ensure tractability for model optimization. Second, for each 12 km grid with animal operations, distance was measured from the grid centroid to the closest edge of spreadable area in the destination county; this distance represents the intercept term of the functional relationship. Third, the area-to-distance relationship within the destination county was computed in a fashion similar to that for in-county transfers. Thus, the area-to-distance relationship represents average hauling distance to access a given spreadable area within the destination county but measured from the direction of the source county. Estimating linearized area-to-distance functions. For use in the regional model, area-to-distance relationships estimated from the GIS were linearized by truncating the upper and lower tails of the distribution (10 percent of acreage, respectively) and fitting a linear function to the midrange observations (80 percent) (linear portions of figures 6 and 7). The use of linear representations reflects the significantly reduced computer memory requirements relative to non-linear functions for the area-to-distance relationship, and the fact that observed relationships are very nearly linear over   the relevant mid range. Regression coefficients for the linearized area-todistance functions were incorporated as parameters in the regional model. These include a unique set of slope coefficients for each within-county and out-of-county function, as well as individual distance intercept terms by source-county grid for each out-of-county function. The developed slope and distance intercept terms are then applied to the spreadable acres obtained from the 1997 Census of Agriculture. The slope represents the average transport distance to use all the spreadable crop and pasture land, accounting for competition from neighboring farms that also require land to spread manure. For example, let Amax represent the maximum spreadable area in figure 6. If the area needed for manure land application by producers in the county for a given nutrient standard is A, then distance D would be the average distance traveled to access A acres. (In figure 6, acreage includes both on-farm acres and off-farm acres.) Figure  7 has a similar interpretation, except that a distance intercept accounts for the transport distance from the manure source to the edge of potentially spreadable land in receiving counties. Thus, the total distance to access land area A in figure 7 is represented by distance from the origin to D 2 , with the origin to D 1 , representing the distance to a receiving county and D 1 to D 2 the distance within the receiving county. Adjustment for landowner willingness to accept manure. Area-to-distance functions derived from the GIS assume full acceptance of manure on all of the spreadable land base. Restrictions on availability of spreadable land due to the unwillingness of some landowners to accept manure is captured in the model through automated adjustments in both: (1) the quantity of spreadable acreage, and (2) the slope of area-to-distance functions, or hauling distance required to access a given spreadable area. Figure 8 shows the effect of a stylized reduction in available spreadable area on manure-hauling distance. Regional Manure Management Model for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed / TB-1913 Economic Research Service/USDA As spreadable area is reduced (to 60 percent of the maximum land base), producers must haul a greater distance on average (D 3 to D 4 ) to access the same amount of spreadable area A."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regional Manure Management Model for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed / TB-1913", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA "}, {"section_title": "Amax: WTAM=100%", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model Equation System", "text": "The following section presents a review of the modeling equation system, with model variables defined by equation. Model equations include: (1) an objection function that minimizes sector costs relating to manure hauling and land application, (2) balance equations that track stocks and flows of manure and manure nutrients, (3) constraints on land availability, distribution of confined animal farms (manure sources), and manure-nutrient application, and (4) cost accounting equations. Appendix 3 provides a listing of equation variables used below, with the names of corresponding GAMS model variables (Appendix 2) and model report variables (Appendix 4). The regional optimization model minimizes the net cost of applying manure in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, subject to total manure produced, crop and pasture land available for manure spreading (onfarm and off-farm), and share of manure diverted to non-land-based uses. Net costs are defined as costs associated with manure land application, plus a penalty cost for manure that cannot be land-applied within the basin, less savings on reduced commercial fertilizer. The model allocates manure production in basin counties (ct) to spreadable land in destination counties (ct2), both within and outside the source county, to minimize the objective function expression (OBJ): Costs include manure-hauling and application costs (HAC), manure-incorporation costs (INC), and nutrient management plan charges for source (NM1) and destination (NM2) counties (see equations 17 and 18 for cost items included). A penalty cost applied to manure levels' exceeding land application capacity in the basin (ELA) ensures that all manure is landapplied subject to available land (see equation 8 for calculation of surplus manure). However, the penalty cost is removed from the actual total cost value reported in the model solution report. Aggregate costs are further adjusted to reflect savings from reduced purchase and application costs for chemical fertilizers (FS). Net cost reported in the model solution is defined as total cost, net of savings from chemical fertilizer use. In general, wet manure quantities are used to assess manure hauling and application costs, while manure-nutrient content and uptake determine the volume and direction of manure flows. (where N* represents a nitrogen standard and P* represents a phosphorus standard, gr is county grid location, sy is manure system (lagoon, slurry, and dry), and ds is hauling distance interval in miles. Onfarm hauling distance is fixed based on average onfarm distance by county computed from the Census. Off-farm hauling distance is an endogenously derived, continuous variable falling within one of three distance intervals (0.5-2 miles, 2-10 miles, and more than 10 miles), with per-unit hauling cost dependent on the distance interval. Manure transfers (M_TRAN) refer to manure hauled off the source farm and land-applied within or outside the county. In equation 2, dry manure tons by manure transfer is defined as the product of manure application rate (M_AP) by manure transfer-weighted by acreage shares under an N standard (SH_N) and P standard (1-SH_N)-and receiving acres (AC_SPR) in the destination county. Adjustments in applied manure per acre provide the link between restrictions on manure-nutrient use and manure transfers in the model. Equation 3 restricts applied manure from all potential source counties to total spreadable acreage (Amax) in the destination county, adjusted for assumptions on land operator willingness to accept manure (WTAM). Equation 4 sets aggregate county-level manure transfers (M_TRAN) equal to the sum of manure transfers by source-county grid location (gr), system type (sy), and distance interval (ds). Equation 5 restricts source-county manure transfers by grid (gr) and system type (sy), based on the share (SH_M) of total manure production (M_PRD) across system type and grid, based on assignment procedures followed in the GIS. Equations 6 through 8 balance manure production, onfarm surplus manure, manure transferred off-farm, and quantity of manure exceeding land application capacity in the basin. Equation 6 sets county surplus manure to be moved off the farm (M_SRP) equal to manure production (M_PROD) less that used onfarm (M_ONFRM) in the source county. Equation 7 fixes manure use (M_USE) as onfarm manure use plus that quantity obtained from all off-farm sources (M_TRAN) in the destination county. Equation 8 sets the manure that exceeds land application capacity (M_ELA) within the assumed transport radius of a source county equal to the manure surplus in the source county less the sum of industrial uses (M_IND) and the sum of manure transfers out-of-county. Quantities of M_ELA manure are minimized in the model through the use of a penalty cost parameter that assigns a high cost to manure not land-applied in the basin. In equation 9, average hauling distance (DS) from source county (ct) and grid (gr) is calculated as a function of spreadable acres in the destination county (ct2). Off-farm hauling distance by manure transfer is computed based on acreage using manure from the source county (AC_SPR)-above a fixed acreage for onfarm manure use on confined animal farms (AC_ONF)-in the destination county. Intercept \u03b1 and slope coefficient are \u03b2 estimated from the GIS-derived linear regressions for within-county and out-of-county transfers. 18 The intercept term, representing linear hauling distance from the source farm for out-of-county transfers, is adjusted (\u03b4 1 ) for selected county-to-county transfers to reflect significant natural barriers (e.g., large bodies of water). In addition, a circuity parameter (\u03b4 2 ) is used to convert linear distance to road miles. 19 Thus, equation 9 establishes the key linkage in the model involving: (1) acreage accessed for manure spreading and (2) average hauling distance within and between counties, with values of each derived endogenously across county-transfer combinations. In equation 10, average hauling distance (DS) from source-county grid to a given destination county represents a weighted average of hauling distances (DST) by manure-system type (sy) and distance interval (ds). This equation effectively integrates per-unit manure-hauling costs within area-to-distance relationships from the GIS, linking: (1) average hauling distance by county transfer with (2) individual hauls from source-county grid points. Minimum (D_MN) and maximum (D_MX) distance is specified by distance interval in equation 11, used in assessing per-unit costs. Stocks and flows of manure nutrients (np)-nitrogen n or phosphorus pare tied to manure quantities as follows: Total excess manure nutrients (NP_EXC) are obtained from farm-level census data on manure production and onfarm assimilative capacity, aggregated to the county level. Equation 12 calculates manure surplus (M_SRP) based on pounds of excess N or P (np), depending on the nutrient standard in effect (N* or P*), and county-average nutrient content in lbs. per dry ton of manure (NP_M). In equation 13, onfarm manure nutrients (NP_ONF) reflect the quantity (M_ONFRM) and composition (NP_M) of manure produced and used on confined animal feeding operations. In equation 14, manure-nutrient flows (NP_TRN) are tied to manure transfers off the farm. 18 For in-county manure transfers, the intercept term of the area-to-distance relationship is set to zero. In equation 15, manure-hauling and application costs (HAC) are computed for onfarm and off-farm transfers. Costs reflect loading, unloading, and application costs per ton hauled (C1), hauling cost per ton-mile (C2), distance hauled (DST), and dry tons of manure hauled (M_TRN), adjusted for moisture content (MS) and bedding (BED). Hauling and application costs vary across animal-waste systems due to differences in manure moisture content and equipment use. The model simulates a stepwise cost function for manure-hauling/application cost, with cost coefficients defined by system type (lagoon, slurry, and dry) and distance interval hauled. Costs of manure incorporation into the soil (INC) are computed in equation 16 based on per-acre charge (C3), total onfarm and off-farm acres using manure, share of acres in cropland (SH_C) (as manure is not generally incorporated on pasture land), and share of manured cropland using incorporation (SH_I). Selected nutrient management plan costs related to land application are identified for manure source farms and receiving farms. Equation 17 computes source-county costs (NM1), based on representative costs for manure testing (M_TST) and plan development costs (C_NMP), summed across confined animal-feeding operations (AFOs) in the source county. Equation 18 computes destination county costs (NM2) for soil testing, based on representative costs (S_TST) per acre of land receiving manure. Calculation procedures for fertilizer cost savings vary, depending on the nutrient standard in effect. In equation 19, savings calculated under an N standard (FS_N) include reduced chemical fertilizer purchases and reduced chemical application costs. Savings from reduced fertilizer purchases are computed based on the price (PR) of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and the quantity of manure nutrients used by crops. Nitrogen savings reflects the full application of manure-N, both onfarm (N_ONF) and off-farm (N_TRN), as all manure-N is assumed to be beneficially used in crop production since producers are assumed to meet nutrient management guidelines. Phosphorus savings reflects use of manure-P onfarm (P_ONF) and off-farm (P_TRN)-adjusted to capture that portion of P (P_PCT) that is beneficially used by the crop (or the ratio of applied manure at an annual P standard to applied manure under an N standard In equation 20, savings calculated under an annual P standard (FS_P) reflect the value of only the manure-nutrient offset. There are no savings in chemical application costs (chemical fertilizer application is still required), as manure-N is insufficient to meet full crop needs. In contrast to the N standard where some portion of applied manure-P cannot be used by the crop, all applied manure nutrients are beneficially used under a P standard. 21 Equation 21 computes an acreage-weighted fertilizer cost savings (FS), based on the share of acres under an N standard and the more stringent (annual or multi-year) P standard. 20 It is assumed that chemical nutrients are applied at crop-based rates, that manure nutrients directly offset nutrients obtained from chemical fertilizers, and that per acre field application costs are fixed regardless of the level of applied chemical fertilizer. 21 The model can be easily modified to consider a multiple-year application of manure-P, in cases where soil-P levels allow for heavier manure applications. Under a multiyear P application, manure treatments are rotated over the farm acreage. Producers are permitted to apply multiple years' manure quantities at one time (up to the N standard level) on a given field where nutrients can be used in subsequent years of the multiyear rotation. Savings reflect the full value of the manure nutrients, as all applied manure nutrients are fully used by the crop. Savings also reflect a partial reduction in chemical field application costs, based on the share of acres treated annually within the multiyear rotation (equivalent to P_PCT). For the multiyear P case, equation 20 would be modified to include the additional cost savings: "}, {"section_title": "Output Generation", "text": "For a given model solution, the optimization model generates a series of output variables in a standard GAMS output file. Customized computer programs are used to extract and organize selected output variables and associated values for display and analysis.

Report variables include those endogenously derived within the model, plus additional variables computed from the solution results. Report variables are organized under costs, acres, manure quantities, manure nutrients, and hauling distance. Model reporting variables are reported at various spatial scales-county grid, county aggregate, and full basin levels. Model solution values for edge counties, or those that straddle the watershed boundary, are apportioned by share of farmland within the watershed to more accurately account for manure disposition at the basin level. Consequently, aggregate values may be reported only for the full modeled area and watershed area (without sinks).

Figure 10 presents a multi-sequence map set that captures the effect of alternative levels of landowner willingness to accept manure on county-level exports and imports under an N standard. Figure 10 shows that as the willingness to accept manure declines, the model transports manure increasingly longer distances and that more counties become net manure importers to access adequate land at the basin level to meet an N standard. Maps may also be used to isolate key information for a single county. Figure  11 shows manure transfers from a single source county (Rockingham County, VA) to destination counties across the basin under a P standard. As manure transfers are estimated simultaneously across all counties, the direction and volume of manure flows that minimize aggregate costs to the basin necessarily reflect the effect of competing manure sources in neighboring counties.

Indeed, findings from application of the model suggest that spatial factors underlying competition for spreadable land in the Chesapeake Bay watershed are an important consideration in accurately assessing the feasibility and costs of new manure management guidelines to the animal sector. The modeling framework is also notable for its integration of farm-level survey data from the Agricultural Census, aggregated to the county level, with geo-specific data from the National Land Cover Dataset. The resulting database-developed from public secondary data sources-captures important intra-regional variation in key cost determinants for animal waste management. Moreover, the reliance on national data series ensures data consistency across a watershed scale, while facilitating data update and model transferability to other watersheds. Results from an initial application of the modeling system are featured in a recent ERS publication (Ribaudo et al., 2003). While the Chesapeake Bay regional modeling system was successfully applied as a part of the ERS's water quality analysis, the developers noted potential model improvements and extensions as limitations were revealed during the initial application. Many of these improvements and extensions are being incorporated for subsequent applications of the regional modeling framework. Areas of model development (not in priority order) currently identified include: Inclusion of air emissions by manure-handling technology; Developing a procedure to respecify the spatial grid sizes used for aggregating (binning) of animal operations to achieve more efficient and rapid model convergence; Incorporating model differentiation in manure-nutrient production and related management requirements across CAFOs and non-CAFO animal farms; Developing the data and model capacity to adjust the available land base for manure spreading to reflect stream buffer guidelines, use of municipal sewage byproducts, and agricultural land conversion; Developing consistent regional data on public cost-sharing for manurehauling and other manure management options, the use of backhauling, and local manure-pricing practices. These factors can adjust the effective hauling costs faced by animal producers as well as the distributional pattern of manure management costs; Incorporating onfarm drying technologies as a manure management alternative; Developing a process to estimate within the model the cost of reducing the stock of animals as a means of addressing manure that cannot be land-applied within the basin; Developing a process to integrate our model findings on the spatial distribution of land-applied manure with other models designed to address nutrient transport and water quality. Implementation of improvements and extensions to the Chesapeake Bay regional model will depend on research priorities, resources allocated to the project, and availability of supporting data. Cooperation with regional subjectarea experts remains an important consideration, as many of these data items are local in nature and not readily available through national data series. "}]
