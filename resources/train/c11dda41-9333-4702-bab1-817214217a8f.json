This study investigated the accuracy with which SMC can separate mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD from cognitive normal (CN), and explored whether the discrimination ability is similar to or better than that of the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).\nThis study recruited 175 CN subjects, 52 with MCI, and 66 with probable AD aged 60 years or older. To test the independent contributions of SMC and MMSE scores to the classification of cognitive status (CN vs MCI or early AD), logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusting for the following potential confounding variables: age, gender, Frontal Assessment Battery score, modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale score, and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine the discrimination accuracy of SMC and MMSE scores, and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was also calculated. Results: In the highly educated ($7 years), nondepressed (Geriatric Depression Scale #15) subgroup, SMC showed good accuracy in discriminating cognitively impaired subjects from CN after adjusting for potential confounding variables (the AUROC of the adjusted SMC was 0.841 for MCI discrimination, and it was 0.858 for MCI plus early AD discrimination).

To evaluate SMCs, some studies used one question, 5, 12, 18 whereas others used two or more questions. 18, 19 Studies can be categorized according to the baseline cognitive status of the subjects (CN, 5, 12 MCI, 12 and non-dementia) 12, 18, 19 or their final disease status (AD, 5, 12 dementia). 18, 19 Many studies have also identified the confounding factors of SMCs including depression, 5, 12 age, 5, 12 gender, 5, 12 level of education, 5, 12, 20 vascular burden, 10 ApoE \u03b54 status, 12, 21, 22 and executive dysfunction. 7 The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 23 has become a widely used objective cognitive screening test for AD dementia in both clinical and research settings. Indeed, the MMSE has many uses, ranging from examining cutoff scores for identifying AD 24 to examining the prediction of incident AD dementia in non-demented individuals. 25 However, the MMSE has poor sensitivity in MCI screening, 26 and little is known about differences in the accuracy of SMCs and MMSE scores for screening for MCI.\nTherefore, although SMCs and the MMSE scores contribute independently to screening for predicting AD, it remains unclear whether SMCs are equal to or superior to MMSE scores in terms of their screening accuracy for MCI and early AD. Therefore, this study investigated the discrimination accuracy of SMC for separating MCI and early AD from CN, and explored whether the discrimination ability is similar to or better than that of the MMSE."}, {"section_title": "Methods subjects", "text": "The study subjects were recruited from individuals registered in a program for the early detection and management of dementia at four centers in Seoul, Republic of Korea (two public health centers, one senior citizens' welfare center, and one dementia clinic) from September 2005 to March 2014. The study included 175 CN individuals, 52 with MCI, and 66 with AD living in the community. All subjects were aged 60 years or older.\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows. 1) Early AD subjects were diagnosed according to the probable AD criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) 27 and the dementia criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), 28 MMSE scores between 20 and 26, and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale 29 score of 0.5 or 1.0. 2) MCI subjects were diagnosed according to current consensus criteria 15 and the criteria for MCI introduced by the German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in primary care patients (AgeCoDe) 30 and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI):\n31 a) memory complaint corroborated by an informant; b) an objective memory impairment as evidenced by a performance score on a delayed recall task 1.5 SD below the respective age-, education-, and gender-specific normative mean; 32 c) essentially preserved general cognitive function; d) largely intact functional activities; and e) absence of dementia, MMSE scores between 24 and 30, and a CDR of 0.5. 3) CN subjects were diagnosed if they did not show MCI or dementia and has MMSE scores between 24 and 30 and a CDR of 0.\nThe exclusion criteria for all subjects were as follows: 1) any serious medical, psychiatric, and neurologic disorders other than MCI or AD that could affect mental functioning; 2) evidence of focal brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including lacunes and white matter hyperintensity lesions of grade 2 or more by the Fazekas scale; 33 3) the presence of severe behavioral or communication problems that would make a clinical examination difficult; 4) the absence of a reliable informant; and 5) inability to read Korean (ie, inability to read ten words on the Word List Memory from the CERAD neuropsychological battery). [34] [35] [36] All Individuals with minor physical abnormalities (eg, diabetes with no serious complications, essential hypertension, mild hearing loss, or others) were included.\nThe Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital, Republic of Korea, approved the study, and subjects or their legal representatives gave written informed consent.\nclinical assessments SMC was assessed with one question: \"Do you think that your memory is poorer than that of other people of a 19 and responses were restricted to either \"Yes\" or \"No\"; which enhanced the feasibility and inter-rater reliability of this question for elderly populations.\nAll subjects were examined according to the CERAD protocol by psychiatrists with advanced training in dementia research. The CERAD clinical assessment battery included the CDR, the Blessed Dementia Scale-Activities of Daily Living (BDS-ADL), a general medical examination, neurological examination, laboratory tests, and brain MRI or computed tomography. The CERAD neuropsychological battery, administered by experienced clinical psychologists, included verbal fluency test, 15-item Boston Naming Test, the MMSE in the Korean version of the CERAD assessment packet (MMSE-KC), 37 the Word List Memory (ten-item word list, three presentations), the Word List Recall test (verbal delayed recall after 10 minutes), and the Word List Recognition and Constructional Recall test. The standard administration of the CERAD battery has been described in detail. Reliable informants were interviewed to acquire accurate information regarding the cognitive, emotional, and functional changes and the medical history of the subjects.\nThe Korean version of the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), a short bedside test to assess the presence and severity of dysexecutive syndrome affecting both cognitive and motor behavior, was also administered by experienced clinical psychologists or nurses. The FAB consists of six subtests: conceptualization, mental flexibility, motor programming, sensitivity to interference, inhibitory control, and environmental autonomy. Global performance on these six subtests yields a composite score summarizing the severity of executive dysfunction.\nThe revised Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a reliable, valid questionnaire for screening for major (MDD) and minor (MnDD) depressive disorders in late life, was administered to all subjects. Its optimal cutoff score was 15/16 for both MDD and MnDD. 38 The modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (mHIS), a tool widely used to identify vascular burdens in individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia, was administered. This scoring system comprises eight items, stepwise deterioration, somatic complaint, emotional incontinence, history of hypertension, history of strokes, abrupt onset, focal neurologic symptoms, and focal neurological signs. The last four items earn two points and the others earn one point, resulting in a total score of 12.\nBecause the ApoE \u03b54 allele, the major genetic risk factor for AD, 39 is also known to be correlated with SMCs, 21, 22 ApoE genotyping was performed according to methods described previously. 40 A panel consisting of four psychiatrists with expertise in dementia research made the clinical decisions including diagnosis and CDR after reviewing all of the available raw data."}, {"section_title": "statistical analysis", "text": "Differences in the subjects' characteristics were examined according to diagnosis using ANOVA with post hoc contrasts using the Tukey method. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. The characteristics of the SMC-positive and -negative groups were compared using Student's t-test or the chi-squared test. To test the independent contribution of SMC and MMSE scores to the classification of cognitive status (CN vs MCI or early AD), logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusting for potential confounding variables including age, gender, FAB score, mHIS score, and ApoE \u03b54 status. A series of multiple logistic regression models for MCI and early AD discrimination were used to obtain new SMC and MMSE scores after adjusting for the same confounding variables. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to determine how well the new SMC and MMSE scores discriminated between individuals with MCI or early AD and CN. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was compared using the method of Hanley and McNeil. 41 The level of statistical significance was set as a twotailed P,0.05. ROC curve analyses were performed using MedCalc for Windows, ver 12.1 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). All the other analyses, except ROC curve analysis, were performed using SPSS, ver 24 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Table 1 summarizes the subjects' demographic and clinical characteristics. There were no significant differences in gender, education, or GDS scores among the CN, MCI, and early AD groups. Significant group differences were found in age, word list delayed recall (WLR) scores, MMSE scores, CDR scores, CDR sum of box (SOB) scores, BDS-ADL scores, FAB scores, mHIS scores, ApoE \u03b54 carrier status, and the presence of SMC. Table 2 presents the subjects' characteristics according to SMC status. In the CN group, the SMC-positive group had significantly less education and higher GDS scores than the SMC-negative group.

Furthermore, in the highly educated and nondepressed subgroups, SMC significantly contributed to differentiating between CN subjects and those with MCI after adjusting for the same covariates, whereas the MMSE did not. According to our results, the SMC score is a sensitive, useful tool for detecting early AD.\nWe chose a representative item from the SMCQ for our study: \"Do you think that your memory is poorer than that of other people of a similar age?\" The selection process was as follows. Four items of the SMCQ were designed to assess global memory function, and the other ten items were designed to assess specific everyday functions. First, we assumed that the subjective metacognition of global memory function would be a better reflection of the early pathological process associated with AD than the items addressing everyday dysfunction. Among the four SMCQ items, the first item, \"Do you think that you have a memory problem?\" was excluded because it is ambiguous, and the second item, \"Do you think that your memory is worse than 10 years ago?\", was dropped due to the possibility of false positives due to confusion with the normal aging process. We also excluded the fourth item, \"Do you feel that your everyday life is difficult due to memory decline?\" because of its association with the impairment in the activities of daily living (ADLs) in AD. Finally, we concluded that the item we selected was the best item in terms of a low probability of false positives and a low likelihood of reflecting of impaired ADLs.\nTo clarify the usefulness of SMC for the detection of early AD, we applied very strict inclusion criteria for pure AD. First, we applied the definition of MCI used by the Word List Recall (delayed recall) task as introduced by AgeCoDe 30 and ADNI 31 instead of other episodic memory tests, including the Word List Memory, Word List Recognition, and Constructional Recall. There are several pieces of evidence indicating that delayed recall, compared with other episodic memory tests, is a more AD-specific test that distinguishes subjects with AD pathology from those without AD pathology. 42, 43 Second, we applied a strict definition of AD, including both the probable AD criteria of the NINCDS-ADRDA and the dementia criteria of the DSM-IV to improve diagnostic accuracy. Finally, as suggested by ADNI, 31 we included more highly functioning CN, MCI (those presenting with MMSE scores $24), and AD (those with MMSE scores $20) subjects, because SMCs may be more vulnerable to other confounding variables in the case of a lower MMSE score.\nThere is increasing evidence that SMCs are a reliable indicator of earlier cognitive decline in AD pathology. 1, 5, 9, 12, 44 Several neuroimaging studies have suggested that the mediotemporal regions in elderly subjects with SMCs show some indication of a degenerative process that mimics that of AD. Studies of subjects with SMCs described neuroanatomical features similar to those seen in AD subjects, such as a gray matter atrophy pattern, 45 volume loss in the hippocampal/para-hippocampal area, and evidence of amyloid burden. 46 Additionally, SMCs were accompanied by compensatory neuronal activity that preserved performance on objective cognitive tests. 17 In the context of detecting AD, however, the validity of SMCs is subject to considerable debate because it may also be strongly associated with potential confounding variables, including depression. 47, 48 To clarify the relationship between SMCs and AD pathology, we also tried to reduce the influence of potential confounding variables. The analysis was performed with elderly subjects only after adjusting for confounding variables, including age, gender, vascular burden, ApoE \u03b54 status, and executive dysfunction. To detect the independent effect of SMC on AD pathology, we also targeted relatively educated elderly subjects with neither minor nor major depressive disorder after adjusting for the confounding variables.\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, we should be cautious when interpreting the relationship between SMC and AD pathology given our cross-sectional design. Longitudinal studies are needed to demonstrate causality. Second, the relatively small sample size might make it difficult to perform analyses in the depression subgroup of the group with early AD. Finally, we did not directly adjust the main confounding factor, anosognosia (poor awareness of illness), which is known to have a negative association with SMCs. 49 Instead, the FAB, a simple tool for assessing frontal lobe functions, was used to control for anosognosia. Our analysis was based on the evidence that anosognosia is closely associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. 50 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our findings support the usefulness of SMC, which was comparable or even superior to that of MMSE scores, for detecting MCI or early AD.
