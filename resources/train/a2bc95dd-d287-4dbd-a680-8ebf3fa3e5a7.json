[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "As the demand for cancer care increases, equitable access to oncology services is critical to improving cancer mortality and optimizing outcomes. Though evidence indicates that prostate cancer mortality has been improving in recent years, the benefit from modern cancer treatment may not be uniform throughout the United States. 1, 2 Furthermore, given the aging US population, the incidence of prostate cancer is expected to increase dramatically over the next 20 years. Whether the current physician workforce is adequately and equitably distributed, to meet and optimize the growing demand for cancer care, is an important area of ongoing study. 3--6 Several types of providers are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Primary care providers and urologists are typically involved in initial diagnosis, whereas urologists, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists could all potentially be involved in the primary treatment of prostate cancer. It is well known that access to primary care is an important predictor of cancer-specific mortality. 7 Therefore, some argue that increasing the number of primary care physicians, rather than specialists, is the most efficient way to improve health outcomes for the entire US population. 8 However, growing evidence suggests that for prostate cancer, specialist density does impact outcomes. 5 As radiation oncologists also serve as primary treatment providers for prostate cancer, the association between the availability of radiation oncologists and prostate cancer mortality merits exploration. Furthermore, the relative impact of the distribution of radiation oncologists, urologists and primary care providers on prostate cancer mortality is unknown.\nIt is likely that the geographic distribution of radiation oncologists is important to the receipt of cancer treatment, particularly for those patients who are not candidates for surgery. Alternatively, patients who are surgical candidates, but refuse surgery, may choose radiation therapy as an alternative curative treatment if a radiation oncologist is geographically accessible. External beam radiotherapy, the dominant form of radiation treatment in the United States, typically requires multiple daily radiation treatments for 6--9 weeks, making the geographic distribution of radiation oncologists more important, particularly for patients with limited mobility and resources for travel. Recent evidence has found a geographic maldistribution of the radiation oncology workforce throughout the United States, with radiation oncologists clustering in metropolitan locations. 6 As it is known that travel time to the nearest cancer center varies significantly throughout the country, inequities in geographic access may be associated with variations in cancer mortality. 9 We initiated this study to elucidate whether the density of radiation oncologists within in a county was related to variations in prostate cancer mortality."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sources", "text": "The geographic units of analysis in this study were the 3141 counties in the United States as defined by the 2000 Census. Similar to previous studies investigating the impact of physician density on cancer-related mortality, rural counties were excluded from the analysis because only 0.4% of the 669 rural counties in the United States possessed radiation oncologists and many of them lacked complete mortality data. 4, 10 Following exclusion of rural counties, 2472 non-rural counties composing B78.7% of the United States possessed complete mortality data and were available for analysis. Counties were classified as rural based on 2003 Department of Agriculture Rural/Urban Continuum Codes. Physician data were obtained using the 2008 Area Resource File. 11 Published by the Health Resources and Services Administration of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the ARF is a collection of data from over 50 sources, including the American Medical Association, American Hospitalization Association, US Census, and National Center for US Health Statistics. The ARF aggregates information concerning healthcare professionals, healthcare facilities and population for each county in the United States, and includes the number of specialists within each county based on data from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. In addition to physician data, geographic, health system and demographic data for each county were collected from the ARF in effort to account for ecological characteristics that could potentially influence cancer outcomes. Prostate cancer mortality and incidence data were obtained from a merged data set from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, National Program for Cancer Registries and United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System. 12 "}, {"section_title": "Construction of variables", "text": "In addition to radiation oncologist densities, primary care physician and urologist densities were also obtained because of their previously described influence on prostate cancer screening and treatment outcomes. 4, 13 Primary care physicians were defined as those trained in general practice, family practice and general internal medicine. In an effort to assess for reductions in prostate cancer mortality related non-specific specialist density, a non-oncology specialty, Allergy-Immunology, was chosen as a control variable to test whether changes in cancer mortality were more specifically attributed to radiation oncologist density. Allergists--immunologists were chosen a priori as an ideal comparison specialist, because they have no known associations to prostate cancer management and possess a workforce size and geographic distribution similar to that of radiation oncology. Physician densities were calculated as 5-year means (2002--2006) of physicians per 100 000 people using annual Census county population estimates.\nMortality and incidence data were reported as age-adjusted average rates per 100 000 people from the years 2002 to 2006. Cancer incidences and mortalities were assigned to counties based on each patient's residence at the time of diagnosis and death, respectively. As socioeconomic and demographic factors have been shown to be associated with cancer outcomes, population data from each county were also collected. 14, 15 Population data from the ARF consisted of, percent population Caucasian, percent population aged 65 years or older based on the Census County "}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "A model was built with prostate cancer mortality per 100 000 people as the primary outcome variable. In an effort to better examine if incremental changes in physician density accompany changes in prostate cancer mortality, radiation oncologist and urologist densities were categorized (0, 0.1--1.0, 1.1--2, 2.1--4.0, 44.0 per 100 000 people). Different radiation oncologist density categories were mapped using the mapping software ArcGIS version 9.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). Univariate associations between physician workforce, health system and socioeconomic predictor variables and cancer mortality were calculated using t-tests for categorical variables and linear regression for continuous variables. Multivariate regression models were built using backward stepwise selection with a univariate Po0.15 for inclusion into the models. Allergist--immunologist density was manually inserted into the final model to control for changes in cancer mortality that could potentially be attributed to a high overall specialist density. Statistically insignificant allergist--immunologist density in the final model would suggest changes in cancer mortality were likely unattributed to high overall specialist density. To account for potential geographic variations in prostate cancer screening, prostate cancer incidence among counties in the United States was also included in the model. Statistical significance for the final models was determined at Po0.05. Variance inflation factors were used to control for excessive collinearity amongst variables. Percent changes in mortality were calculated for each density category using the cancer mortality of a reference group. The reference group in all three models was a county with no radiation oncologists, urologists or allergists. To evaluate incremental benefits derived from increasing radiation oncologist density beyond the reference group, linear combination estimates were calculated comparing radiation oncologists among different density categories. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 9.2 (Stata, College Station, TX, USA)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Radiation oncologist density was heterogeneously distributed throughout the United States, with 1616 (65.3%) counties lacking the presence of a radiation oncologist. (Figures 1 and 2 ) Of the 2472 counties studied 1205 (48.7%) were without the presence of both a radiation oncologist and urologist. The mean radiation oncology and urologist densities among counties were 0.65 and 2.00 per 100 000, respectively. The baseline prostate cancer mortality in a county without the presence of a radiation oncologist, urologist or allergist was 38.68 deaths per 100 000 people (95% confidence interval (CI): 33.94--43.42). The presence of a radiation oncologist was associated with a statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality, despite adjusting for variations in urologist and allergist/immunologist density, as well as socioeconomic, demographic and health system characteristics ( Table 1) . Compared with counties without radiation oncologists, having 40--1, 1--2 or 2--4 radiation oncologists per 100 000 people, significantly reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) by \u00c03.65% (95% CI: 5.54--1.76% reduction, P \u00bc 0.031), 5.74% (95% CI: 7.87--3.61% reduction, Po0.001) and 1.48% (95% CI: 2.73--0.23% reduction, P \u00bc 0.045), respectively. The PCSM of patients residing in a county with four or more radiation oncologists per 100 000 people was not significantly different from counties where there were no radiation oncologists (P \u00bc 0.769). The confidence intervals of this group were wide, given the small number of counties with four or more radiation oncologists per 100 000 residents (Figure 3 ). Linear combination estimates found increasing radiation oncologist density beyond 1.0 per 100 000 provided no statistically significant incremental reductions in prostate cancer mortality compared with having 0.1--1.0 radiation oncologists per 100 000 (Table 2) .\nConsistent with previous studies, increasing density of urologists also was associated with a reduction in prostate cancer mortality. Allergist/immunologist density was not related to prostate cancer mortality (P \u00bc 0.340). Residing in a more affluent county with a younger and more educated population was correlated with reduced prostate cancer mortality (Table 1) . Moreover, racial makeup of counties was found to be associated with variations in prostate cancer mortality. Counties with higher percentages of Caucasians were associated with reduction in prostate cancer mortality (Po0.001). Percent population insured, and health system characteristics such as hospital bed density and hospitals with radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy or general oncology services either did not meet the univariate Po0.15 inclusion criteria or were not significant in the multivariate model. Univariate analysis is included as Supplementary Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The geographic distribution of the radiation oncology workforce is associated with differences in prostate cancer mortality. The presence of a single radiation oncologist in a county was associated with a statistically significant reduction in PCSM. The improvement in prostate cancer mortality persisted even when adjusting for geographic variations in prostate cancer incidence, other primary and specialist physician densities, socioeconomic factors and health system resources. Interestingly, incremental increases of radiation oncologists in a county did not yield incremental benefits in outcomes, suggesting a 'plateau effect' when a region becomes saturated with radiation oncologists. These results corroborate with similar studies that found diminishing returns with increases in physician supply. 5, 16 Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatments for prostate cancer. Although our study does not directly test the clinical implications of radiation therapy and prostate treatment, it does highlight a potential association between the availability of radiation therapy and improved prostate cancer outcomes. Radiation oncologist density may be a surrogate for specialized oncology care, specifically the presence of large cancer centers with multidisciplinary tumor boards and a variety of non-radiation prostate cancer specialists. Although improved outcomes cannot definitively be attributed to the presence of a radiation oncologist, our findings of improved prostate cancer mortality, despite adjustment for urologist and allergist/immunologist density, speak to the robustness of the specific association between radiation oncologist density and prostate cancer mortality. Another possible explanation for our findings is that radiation oncologists are a proxy for other general oncology indicators that could not be fully adjusted for in our multivariate model. For example, the presence of a large cancer center with access to more advanced treatment technologies and multidisciplinary tumor boards to better coordinate prostate cancer care between urologists and radiation oncologists. Our study also highlighted previously cited racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes. Counties with larger proportions of Caucasians were associated with increased prostate cancer mortality reduction. This is likely because minorities have been shown to present with more advanced prostate cancer, which carries a worse prognosis. 17 Furthermore, when adjusting for other factors known to influence cancer outcomes, such as socioeconomic factors (median household income, population education level) and health system resources (hospital bed density, radiation therapy-equipped hospitals, intensity-modulated radiation therapy-equipped hospitals and general oncologyequipped hospitals) the presence of radiation oncologists was associated with prostate cancer mortality, highlighting the relative uniqueness of radiation oncologist to prostate cancer management.\nOur analysis found increasing urologist density to have a more profound effect on PCSM compared with radiation oncologist density. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial. As urologists are involved in the screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer in addition to surgical treatment, increased density of urologists may be associated with increased likelihood to be diagnosed at an earlier stage with a more favorable prognosis. Conversely, radiation oncologists serve only a curative role in prostate cancer treatment and require another clinical provider, typically an urologist or primary care physician, to refer a prostate cancer patient to them. In counties with poor primary care and urologist presence, radiation oncologists may be faced the challenge of treating higher stage prostate cancers that were not screened and thus diagnosed later.\nWe confirmed a previously described geographic maldistribution of radiation oncologists across the United States. 6 Large segments of the population live in counties without a radiation oncologist, and this in turn is associated with increased prostate cancer mortality. To complicate the problem, creating an equitable distribution of radiation oncology services remains difficult. Unlike many other medical specialties, radiation oncologists require significant equipment to provide treatment, making radiation therapy relatively insular to increasingly popular Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. *Note: Primary care physician density, HSPA service area status, metropolitan county status, hospital bed density, radiation therapy equipped hospital density, general oncology services equipped hospital density, IMRT hospital equipped density, percent population insured and unemployment rate either did not meet univariate inclusion criteria or were not statistically significant in multivariate model.

Additionally, the large investment required to start a radiation oncology practice may contribute to apprehension of radiation oncologists entering the field to establish a practice in an underserved area. The mechanism by which radiation oncologist density is related to prostate cancer mortality is difficult to pinpoint. Prior work has shown that radiation oncologist and urologist density was not predictive of whether patients receive any curative therapy. Rather, individual patient characteristics, such as marital status, are predictive of receipt curative treatment. 18 However, subsequent analysis suggests radiation oncologist and urologist density are predictive of whether patients initially choose radiation therapy or surgery as the treatment modality for prostate cancer. 19 It is plausible that regional physician density is related to aspects of management about which patients are less informed, such as nuanced treatment modalities, but decisions related to larger questions of whether to receive curative treatment are ultimately personal ones. Furthermore, as geographic differences in prostate cancer mortality have mainly been attributed to differences in disease stage related to time of diagnosis, an aspect of care with which radiation oncologists are not typically involved, the density of radiation oncologists may be of less utility. 2 Perhaps it is the radiation oncologist's role in providing truly multidisciplinary cancer care that most influences mortality. Where previous investigators found an association between urologist density and prostate cancer mortality, we found a similar association for radiation oncologists, even when adjusting for the presence of urologists and variations in prostate cancer incidence. 5 Therefore, our two studies in combination highlight the importance of multidisciplinary care in the management of patients with prostate cancer.\nWe found that the improvement in prostate cancer mortality did plateau beyond a radiation oncologist density of 1.0 per 100 000. Reasons for this diminishing return may be because incremental improvement in prostate cancer mortality when comparing higher density categories was small relative to the large improvement in mortality from the addition of the first radiation oncologist to a county. This plateau effect has been seen in other studies of the physician workforce. 10, 16, 20 Moreover, prostate cancer can be relatively indolent, in contrast to cervical cancer or head and neck cancers. Patients residing in areas with an oversubscribed radiation oncologist can potentially wait until prostate cancer treatment is available, perhaps mitigating the need for additional radiation oncologists to improve time between diagnosis and treatment.\nOur study was limited for several reasons. As the American Medical Association Masterfile records only the primary location of a radiation oncologist, we did not capture the availability of physician services at secondary 'satellite' locations. This limitation is somewhat attenuated in our analysis given the decreased prevalence of satellite radiation oncology centers because of large required investment to establish satellite practices. We were unable to assess the impact of the availability of various radiation treatment modalities (EBRT, brachytherapy, SBRT), as no information was recorded as to the type of treatment available at each practice location. Another limitation of our study is the exclusion of rural counties within the United States for which much of the prostate cancer mortality data were unavailable. Nevertheless even if that data were available, the paucity and relative maldistribution of radiation oncologists and urologists among rural counties would make it difficult to establish any reliable relationship between physician density and prostate cancer outcomes. What remains clear, however, is the variation in prostate cancer outcomes in resource poor and resource rich regions. Further studies focused on rural counties will be needed to better generalize the results of our analysis to rural areas. Additionally, patient-specific characteristics were unattainable using the merged State Cancer Profiles data. Additionally, our analysis is subject to a theoretical lead-time bias associated with patients in underserved areas potentially being diagnosed later and with more advanced disease. This is due to a lack of available county-level stage and grade data. This limitation is present in studies of this nature 4, 10 and was somewhat mitigated by adjusting for geographic variations in prostate cancer incidence. Finally, given the relative slow growth of prostate cancer, current mortality is likely related to treatment options available upwards of 10-year prior. A multivariate model replacing current physician densities with physician densities from 1995 yielded similar results (Supplementary Table 1 ). This is likely because the geographic maldistribution of the radiation oncology and urology workforces have remained relatively unchanged within the last 15 years. 5, 6 The relationship between historical health system resources and long-term outcomes of a population in the years following is an interesting topic for future studies. Nevertheless, previously published studies of our similar nature, 4 our study is fundamentally an analysis of the current variations in healthcare systems across the United States. Using current physician densities as a proxy for current general oncology infrastructure and allows the study the relative robustness of current healthcare systems. Our analysis ultimately comments less on the well-established curative relationship between urologists and radiation oncologists for prostate cancer, rather more on the relationship between resource rich/poor regional healthcare systems and overall prostate cancer outcomes. In spite of these limitations, our analysis provides a first step in understanding the relationship between variations in the radiation oncologist workforce and prostate cancer mortality and serves as an impetus for further study of the effect of regional radiation oncologist therapy resources in the management of prostate cancer."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Radiation oncologist density is related to geographic variations in prostate cancer mortality among counties in the United States. The lack of radiation oncologists among less populated areas is associated with increased rates of prostate cancer mortality. Conversely, saturation of radiation oncologists within a region provides diminishing reduction to prostate cancer mortality. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between variations in the radiation oncology workforce and prostate cancer management. Policy attempting to decrease both prostate cancer mortality and optimize the radiation oncology workforce must be geographically aware in order to prevent further disparities in outcomes."}]
