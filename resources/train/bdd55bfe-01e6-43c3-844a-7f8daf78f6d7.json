There was no pretense that these occurred in a random sample.\n2 About 10,000 students had taken the test as part of a talent search for a program at Johns Hopkins University. The Science article resulted in headlines such as \"Do Males Have a Math Gene?\" (Newsweek ) or \"The Gender Factor in Math\" (Time), (see Figure 1 on the next page).\nThree years later, talent search statistics were again featured in Science [5] . Between 1980 and 1983, about 64,000 students had participated. Two hundred and eighty of them scored 700 or above on the SAT-M -about 13 boys to every 1 girl.\nDuring the next two decades, the talent searches continued at Johns Hopkins and were initiated at other universities, but -vampire-like -the 13 So, what's the problem with reporting, years later, a solitary statistic from 1983? Nothing -if you are interested in discussing only what was known in 1983. However, to report this statistic without related later statistics is to suggest that nothing has since changed or more recent information does not exist. But, in Johns Hopkins talent search statistics collected between 1984 and 1991, the average 700-or-above boy to girl ratio was 5.7. The sample size was 243,428, considerably larger than the earlier samples. Talent searches conducted by Duke University between 1981 and 1992 produced an average 700-and-over ratio of 5.6 . The sample size was 308,397. These findings were reported in conference proceedings rather than a high-circulation science magazine. They did not make headlines. In 2005, Hopkins researchers reported in High Ability Studies, a journal on giftedness, that the 700-andover ratio had dropped to 3 [12] . New ratios were also reported in a letter to the editor of the Johns Hopkins Magazine in 1997 [53] , and an interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2005 [41] .\nIn 2006, these statistics were brought to more general attention in background material for a petition from the Association for Women in Mathematics. (Disclosure: I was then the president elect and helped to compile this material. For details, see my article \"Perceptions and Research: Mathematics, Gender, and the SAT\" in the Mathematical Association of America's newsletter FOCUS [29] .) Table 1 : Talent Search sample sizes with 700-and-over ratios reported before 2006. Table  is reproduced from [29] . Numbers are derived from data in (a). [3, p. 472] ; (b). [11, p. 206] ; (c).

Since 1980, the work of Benbow and her colleagues has received attention in the Newsweek, 1980; \"Academy of P.C. Sciences,\" New York Times, 2006) entitled \"Sex Differences in Mathreported large gender differences in \"mathematical reasoning ability.\" Their evidence was scores on the mathematics SAT taken by seventh and eighth graders as part of a talent search for a program at Johns Hopkins University. In a sample of about 10,000, collected between 1972 differed greatly from the distribution of and 675 girls scored above 500. In their conclusion, Benbow and Stanley explicitly favored (their word) \"the hypothesis that sex differences in achievement in and attitude towards mathematics result from superior male mathematical abilof a combination of both endogenous and exogenous variables,\" thus including the possibility of social and environmental factors. Benbow and Stanley had not found differences in formal education for students in a 1976 talent search, but and eighth graders.\nAt the time, their article was criticized for the way in which the sample was collected, its measure of \"mathematical reasoning ability\" (the SAT), and the way in which the results were interpreted. Susan Chipman, then at the National Institute of Education, wrote, \"The most serious problem with the report by Benbow and Stanley is the underlying presumption that the concept of mathematical ability defensible.\" The mathematicians Alice Schafer and Mary Gray also questioned the use of the SAT as a measure of mathematical ability, and moreover, noted that environmental and cultural factors could not be lightly set aside. This is the case for some, but not all, chapters of The Science on Women and Science, \"a collection of articles by distinguished scholars,\" published in 2009 [51] . It was edited by Christina Hoff Sommers, whose claim begins this article. I tabulate the talent search ratios cited in [51] in Table 2 .\nIn March 2010, Sommers wrote in Forbes Magazine [52] that efforts to encourage women in science \"should take into account the true state of the research on gender and science -not just the assertions of impassioned activists.\"\nIt may be more difficult that Sommers thinks to agree on the \"true state 7 Chapter author Ratio cited and description of population Simon Baron-Cohen, p. 13 13 to 1 \"among individuals who score above 700 (out of a possible 800) points, the sex ratio is thirteen to one (men to women).\" BaronCohen cites Geary's 1996 article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences which gives the source, \"The ratio of boys to girls at the lower end of SAT-M scores is a rather modest 1.5:1, but increases to 13:1 for those scoring > 700 "}, {"section_title": "Bad Statistics", "text": "of the research on gender and science,\" but researchers can, at least, endeavor to cite current statistics accurately and to interpret them with care. Citing current talent search statistics has now become easier. In June 2010, statistics from the Duke talent searches between 1981 and 2010 were published in an academic journal [57] and the drop in the 13 to 1 ratio was publicized in the New York Times [54] . Whether the statistics from the Duke samples have been interpreted with care is another matter [30] .\nAfter two decades, the 13 to 1 ratio has stopped being solitary, but this change coincided with the creation of two new vampire statistics."}, {"section_title": "The Fabricated Statistic", "text": "In August of 2006, a new book called The Female Brain appeared, written by a psychologist at the University of California [10] . It publicized the \"finding\" that \"Women use 20,000 words per day, while men use 7,000.\" \"Women talk almost three times as much as men, study finds,\" said headlines that spread from nation to nation across the World Wide Web. The book became a bestseller.\nWord use was part of the evidence that \"the female brain\" is a \"lean, mean communicating machine\" which compels its owner(s) to connect and communicate. According to The Female Brain, opportunities to connect and communicate are not part of science and engineering, thus women tend to avoid these careers.\nComments on the Web said the \"finding\" that women talked more than men was so obvious that it didn't need a study. But at least one linguist thought it was very strange. Mark Liberman noted that studies of conversations had found that, on average, that men talk slightly more than women or there was no gender difference. And, where were the studies of daily word use? In his posts on Language Log, Liberman discussed the available evidence at length [35] and summarized it in a 2006 Boston Globe article [34] . His conclusion: Although The Female Brain lists numerous scientific articles in its bibliography, the ultimate source for this claim was apparently a self-help book -not scientific studies.\nThe next year, a scientific study of daily word use was published [39] . Its abstract says:\nWomen are generally assumed to be more talkative than men. Data were analyzed from 396 participants who wore a voice recorder that sampled ambient sounds for several days. Participants' daily word use was extrapolated from the number of recorded words. Women and men both spoke about 16,000 words per day.\nOne such study is not conclusive evidence -but it certainly doesn't support \"women talk three times more than men.\"\nLater editions of The Female Brain do not say, \"Women use 20,000 words per day, while men use 7,000.\" But, as Liberman notes, they do say, \"[W]omen, on average, talk and listen a lot more than men. The numbers vary, but on average girls speak two to three times more words per day than boys\" (p. 36). No reference is given.\nAnd -harder to kill than a vampire -\"Women talk almost three times as much as men\" remains on the Web."}, {"section_title": "The Garbled Statistic", "text": "Like The Female Brain, \"The Science of Sex Differences in Science and Mathematics,\" published in Psychological Science in the Public Interest in 2007, discusses the idea that women, more than men, avoid careers in academic science [26] . Although it reports old and new talent search ratios on pages 12 and 13, as I read page 14, I noticed other statistics that seemed outdated -or just plain wrong. These were in a table labeled \"Representation of Women Among Tenure-Track Faculty in Elite Universities in Physical Science, Mathematics, and Engineering.\" In particular, women were supposedly 8.3% of tenure-track faculty at \"elite\" mathematics departments. The cited source was old (1997) and unlikely -an article on intelligence rather than a survey.\nOf course, the 8.3% could have been correct, depending on what \"elite\" meant. After all, I knew of one elite mathematics department that hadn't hired any tenure-track women during a ten-year period. With the right choice of departments, one could probably produce 8.3%. However, a 2002 survey listed in the bibliography and cited near the statistics seemed like a good candidate for the source -and, in fact, the numbers suggest that it was; see Table 3 .\nThe Psychological Science numbers matched those from the survey, but the categories didn't. In the survey, these numbers indicated the percentages of women in all tenured or tenure-track positions at the top 50 departments -not the percentages of women in tenure-track positions as stated in the In 2007, the survey of the top 50 STEM departments was repeated. Again, it did not collect information about correlation between tenure status and rank. As occurs often in recent surveys of STEM faculty demographics, the percentages of women in most categories had increased. In mathematics, women were 28% of assistant professors at the \"top 50\" departments rather than 19% that they were five years earlier; see Table 4 .\nIn 2008, a magazine called The American published an article about women in science called \"Why Can't a Woman be More like a Man?\" [49] . It said:\nWomen comprise just 19 percent of tenure-track professors in 6 math, 11 percent in physics, 10 percent in computer science, and 10 percent in electrical engineering.\nThis time I couldn't guess the source of the numbers -but readers of this article will. These numbers were not only rounded in an unusual way and relabeled (\"assistant professor\" was replaced by \"tenure-track\"), but out of date. Most importantly, this information was not identified as pertaining to the \"top 50 departments\" or even \"elite\" departments. It appeared to refer to departments at all colleges and universities. There is no reason to assume that the situation for elite universities is the same as that for all academic institutions. In many surveys of faculty demographics, the percentage of female tenured or tenure-track faculty is inversely proportional to the prestige of the institution. [51] , but again neglected to mention that these referred to assistant professors at the \"top 50\" universities, not universities in general.)\nHarder to kill than a vampire -the two sets of published \"statistics\" on the percentage of female tenure-track professors in science and engineering remain on the Web.\nBut, surely no one would use those. Not only were they obviously wrong (at least to the cognoscenti), but readers might easily guess that they came from secondary sources and look for the primary sources.\nSo, imagine my surprise, when I read in August of 2009:\nNearly half of all physicians and biologists are females, as are the majority of new psychologists, veterinarians, and dentists, suggesting that women have achieved equality with men in the workforce. But the ranks of professionals in math-intensive careers remain lopsidedly male; up to 93% of tenure-track academic positions in some of the most mathematically-oriented fields are held by men.\nThus begins the advertising copy for a book called The Mathematics of Sex [16] . Where does the 93% come from? I have not found a reference for it in the book, but I think that I can guess its origins.\nIn 2008, one of the authors of The Mathematics of Sex gave a talk at the Templeton Foundation. His slides, posted on the Web, 7 reproduce the Psychological Science percentages. These are followed 55 slides later by percentages which appear to be derived from The American, although a source is not given.\nThe smallest percentage in the Psychological Science list is 7% when rounded. Subtract the 7% from 100%. Drop the \"elite\" and you get 93% of tenure-track professors in some subfields of engineering are men.\nBut, some readers will be screaming, even if the statistics were correct, you can't drop the \"elite\"! Doesn't everyone in academe know that statistics about elite universities do not necessarily describe all universities? (Does anyone think the average university has an endowment the size of Harvard's? Does anyone think the average university has salaries like Princeton's?) Doesn't everyone in academe know that without other modifiers \"tenure-track positions\" is likely to be interpreted as referring to academic institutions in general?\nApparently someone involved in the production of the book did not think of these things. Maybe it was a research assistant, or an author, or a copy editor -or some unhappy concatenation of the three.\nI arrived at this conjecture, after much puzzlement, with the aid of Joel Best's books on statistics [8, 9] . In any event, two rather different groups of 7 Ceci, http://www.templetonfellows.org/program/SteveCeci.pdf, accessed July 19, 2011; see slides 12 and 67. Departing from the focus on \"tenure track\" or perhaps taking \"tenure track\" as a synonym for \"assistant professor,\" Ceci, Williams, & Barnett stated in 2009 [15] : \"The picture is the same across many science fields: Women are not being hired as assistant professors at the rate that they are earning PhD degrees.\" In the 2007 diversity survey, this was particularly noticeable for psychology. However, in most \"math-intensive\" fields, including mathematics, percentages of female assistant professors at the top 100 departments were close to or exceeded percentages of female recent PhDs. See Kessel & Nelson, 2011 [32] .\nAnywhere from 64% to 93% of the professors on tenure track in these [ "}, {"section_title": "I wrote to authors of The Mathematics of Sex in August 2009", "text": ", 35 expressing my concern that their statistics had serious flaws and contrasting these statistics with others from primary sources (including the diversity survey).

However, they did contact the principal investigator for the diversity surveys."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "They published a somewhat more accurate version of the diversity survey statistics in October 2010 [17] :\nIn the top 100 U.S. universities, only 9% to 16% of tenure-track positions in math-intensive fields are occupied by women (Nelson & Brammer, 2010 This acknowledges the source of the percentages (an updated report from the diversity survey, which -again -did not collect information on correlation between tenure status and rank) and notes that they concern the top 100 universities. But, it replaces \"all ranks\" by \"tenure-track.\"\n10 A similar statement is given in February 2011 [18] :\nAmong the top 100 US universities, only 8.8-15.8% of tenuretrack positions in many math-intensive fields (combined across ranks) are held by women. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 108, no. 8, p. 3157) \"All ranks\" has again been replaced by \"tenure track.\" This statement is followed by a reference to supplemental material which says:\nPercentages of women hired on tenure track were as follows: chemistry, 21.2%; mathematics, 26.8%; computer science, 20.0%; physics, 16.8%; chemical engineering, 24.2%; civil engineering, 24.7%; electrical engineering, 15.5%; and mechanical engineering, 18.0%.\nReaders may, perhaps, be able to correctly conclude from the context that these percentages refer to the top 100 universities. However, they are unlikely to know that \"assistant professor\" has been replaced by \"tenure track.\" And, they may wonder at the apparent inconsistency between the percentages of women holding tenure-track positions and hired on tenure track.\nAnother oddity in the Current Directions [17] and PNAS [18] articles is their descriptions of the increase in proportions of female PhDs in scientific fields. For example, the PNAS article states \"Forty years ago, women's presence in most [scientific] fields was several orders of magnitude less; e.g., in 1970 only 13% of PhDs in life sciences went to women\" (emphasis added) and mentions that in 2006 women earned 52% of PhDs in life sciences. It says: \"In the most math-intensive fields, however, women's growth has been less pronounced.\" But, it does not mention that, during the same period, women's share of PhDs increased 5-fold in mathematics to 30%, 6-fold in physical sciences to 29%, and 40-fold in engineering to 20%, but only 3-fold in psychology and almost 4-fold in the life sciences [32] . In terms of orders of magnitude, whether computed in base 10 (as is customary) or in base 2 (which gives non-zero increase in order of magnitude for each case), women's share of PhDs in \"math-intensive\" fields grew more, not less, than in other scientific fields.\nThe diversity survey statistics are quoted more accurately in March 2011 [55] This article cites the PNAS article and is co-authored by one of its authors. It is accompanied by a commentary written by Donna Nelson (principal investigator for the diversity survey) and myself [32] ."}, {"section_title": "Avoiding Bad Statistics", "text": "After reading Joel Best's Damned Lies and Statistics [8] and Stat-spotting [9] , I suspect that factors contributing to bad statistics include ignorance of how statistics are produced, innumeracy, and selection of the most dramatic statistics.\nThese factors may explain why The American didn't post a correction or a source -apparently no one thought there was a mistake and no one thought a source should be cited. (This is rather sad. The American is published by the American Enterprise Institute which claims to pursue its ideals \"through independent thinking, open debate, reasoned argument, and the highest standards of research and exposition.\"\n12 ) The garbling and the absence of a source for the statistics in The Mathematics of Sex may have occurred for similar reasons, exacerbated by hurried production. (That garbled statistics and various typographical errors went unnoticed is also rather sad. The Mathematics of Sex was published by the venerable Oxford University Press which has as its mission \"to publish works that further Oxford University's objectives, including its objectives of excellence in research, scholarship, and education.\" 13 ) Academic readers will have their own explanations for the lack of corrections published by academic journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nAlthough noticing mistakes may require numerical sophistication or knowledge of particular fields, accurate reporting of names, dates, and sources of statistics does not take much skill. At the very least, authors and research assistants can copy categories and sources as well as numbers. Editors can (and should) ask for sources.\nSources can be indicated in a variety of ways. As the Chicago Manual of Style puts it, \"Whichever system is chosen, the primary criterion is sufficient information to lead readers to the sources used\" [19, p. 594] . In scholarly work, citations in the text indicate the sources that provide evidence for claims and the sources themselves are listed in the bibliography. Journals in psychology often require that authors follow very specific guidelines from the American Psychological Association [48] . In popular books, sources are often given in endnotes. Newspaper articles frequently give the source for information that is presented graphically, but tend not to give citations in articles. However, they often include enough information to allow readers to find sources from a Web search.\nAbsence of any documentation for statistics suggests authors and editors do not consider it very important. That may be the case in some instances. However, publications such as The Mathematics of Sex and The Science on Women and Science begin with the premise that there are few women in some fields of science. It seems very strange to make the effort to write about a phenomenon without accurately documenting its existence.\nFor readers who notice, the absence of documentation or the presence of statistical and mathematical peculiarities suggest that more subtle errors are lurking.\n14 For those who do not -beware! Bad statistics may not suck your blood, but they can keep you in the dark. According to the NSF statistics from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients 15 (see Table 5 ), at four-year institutions, the percentages of women in tenure-track positions range from 19.1% (engineering) and 22.6% (computer science), to 29.4% (mathematics and statistics) and 33.7% (biological and related sciences), to 70.4% (health). According to the CBMS 2005 Survey, women are 50% of the full-time permanent mathematics faculty at two-year colleges. 16 "}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "This is a complicated story which can be viewed from different perspectives. Over the years, several themes have surfaced periodically in my mind with respect to the events that I've described. Writing, editing, and citation practices have already been mentioned, along with ignorance of statistics. Another is misunderstanding of mathematics, which in this context is included with misunderstanding of statistics under the label of \"quantitative illiteracy.\"\nIn 1983, the talent search ratios -findings from a small non-random sample -may have gained currency due to interest in gender differences, but lack of knowledge or concern about sampling methods or sample size may also have been a contributing factor. Similarly, in 2006 few seemed to 14 For a detailed discussion of errors and weaknesses in the PNAS article, see [33] . 15 have wondered about how the fabricated statistic (\"Women talk almost three times as much as men\") could have been generated in a scientific study. Do you count words (and does that include \"uh\"s and \"um\"s) or do you count length of time? Does that include every social context? How do you record every word that's been uttered? Along with issues of sampling, the garbling of the diversity survey statistics seems to have mathematical aspects. These statistics are percentages, which can be viewed as averages or part-whole relationships. Misunderstanding of either concept may have contributed to the mislabeled percentages. One misunderstanding of averages (think of global warming!) is to construe the average of a set of measurements as equal to the value of each measurement. For part-whole relationships, there can be slips in understanding which set is meant to be the whole or whether it matters. In misuse of terms such as \"exponential\" or \"order of magnitude,\" mathematical misunderstanding seems to be the primary factor.\nAnd, then there is bias . . . As some researchers see it, there is a \"perseverative search for gender differences,\" which \"are far too sexy a topic.\" \"It is clear that many people do not want to believe that girls and women can be good at mathematics\" says Susan Chipman. Researchers execute \"backflips in experimental design and interpretation of data in order to produce sex differences in math performance\" say Jeremy and Paula Caplan. Consistent with this perspective, as the 13 to 1 talent search ratio lost currency, the garbled statistics about STEM faculty came to prominence. As the garbled statistics became more accurate, a new inaccuracy was introduced: the change in percentages of women earning PhDs in scientific fields became \"exponential growth,\" increase in \"orders of magnitude,\" or \"meteoric\" with -supposedly -the exception of \"math-intensive\" fields.\nWhatever their origins, statistics which are mislabeled, misinterpreted, fictitious, or otherwise defective remain in circulation because they are accepted by editors, readers, and referees. Ultimately, quantitative illiteracy may be the life-blood of these vampires. Donna Nelson replied to multiple inquiries about the diversity survey, confirming multiple times that it did not collect information on correlations of rank and tenure status. Discussions with AWM members, in and out of the Executive Committee, have sharpened my thinking over the years. Although this article has been shaped by these contributions, its opinions should be attributed only to its author."}]
