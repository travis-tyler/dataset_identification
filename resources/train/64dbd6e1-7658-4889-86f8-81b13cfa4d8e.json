[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A\u03b2, tau, and P-tau have been widely accepted as reliable markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The crosstalk between these markers forms a complex network. AD may induce the integral variation and disruption of the network. The aim of this study was to develop a novel mathematic model based on a simplified crosstalk network to evaluate the disease progression of AD. The integral variation of the network is measured by three integral disruption parameters. The robustness of network is evaluated by network disruption probability. Presented results show that network disruption probability has a good linear relationship with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The proposed model combined with Support vector machine (SVM) achieves a relative high 10-fold cross-validated performance in classification of AD vs. normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. normal (95% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, 95% specificity for AD vs. normal; 90% accuracy, 94% sensitivity, 83% specificity for MCI vs. normal). This research evaluates the progression of AD and facilitates AD early diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by a decline in cognitive ability (Ewers et al., 2012; Farah, 2014) . Current estimates suggest that 36 million people worldwide have AD and the number is expected to almost triple in the next few decades (Grammas and Martinez, 2014) . Since the symptomatic drugs currently on the market for AD have limited efficacy and only provides symptomatic relief without long-term cure, an important area to understand the disease progression and identify the potential vital pathological biomarkers for the progression has recently received increasing attention (Zhou et al., 2013; Salem et al., 2014) .\nNeuropsychological tests such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) are widely used in the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected dementia (Powell et al., 2006) . However, neuropsychological tests alone are inadequate to diagnose AD at the early stages (Zamrini et al., 2004) . The biomarker-based assessment of AD has been proposed to enhance the clinical detection of AD in early prodromal stages of the disease (Dubois et al., 2007) . The use of biomarkers in clinical diagnostics may help us to determine whether some mild cognitive impairment (MCI) symptoms are due to AD (Ewers et al., 2012) . \u2020 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf Several researches have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based biomarkers are high precision risk factors in the disease process (Blennow and Hampel, 2003; Brys et al., 2009 ).\nAD has two major pathological hallmarks in CSF including senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (Kimura et al., 2014) . NFTs make up from intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (P-tau) and senile plaques consist mainly of amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) (Small, 2008; Kimura et al., 2014) . Previous researches have shown the interaction of tau, P-tau, and A\u03b2 (Figure 1) . On one hand, P-tau can increase activity of acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE). Then the increased AChE activity can elevate A\u03b2 production by modulating the levels of the \u03b3-secretase catalytic subunit presenilin-1 (PS1) (Garc\u00eda-Ayll\u00f3n et al., 2011) . On the other hand, A\u03b2 may affect the level of P-tau through two pathways. Firstly, A\u03b2 can raise the activity of AChE which can activate the tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) inducing tau hyperphosphorylation (Garc\u00eda-Ayll\u00f3n et al., 2011) . Secondly, A\u03b2 can activate the voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels (VVCD) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors which results in the release of intracellular Ca 2+ (Shen et al., 2006; Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008) . Then the increased levels of intracellular Ca 2+ might initiate a signal transduction pathway to activate Ca 2+ -sensitive protein kinases which are responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau (Shen et al., 2006) . Furthermore, previous researches have expounded the role of A\u03b2 and tau pathology. On one hand, A\u03b2 plays a vital role in progression of AD which may lead in turn to a series of downstream events ranging from synapse loss to plaque deposition to inflammation to the triggering of tau hyperphosphorylation to the death of susceptible neurons FIGURE 1 | The interaction of A\u03b2, tau, and P-tau. (Herrup, 2010) . On the other hand, tau pathology plays a complicated role in the progression of AD. Tau pathology may affect DNA repair, neuronal activity, and inter-neuronal signaling (Hanger et al., 2014) . Though the mechanism and roles of tau pathology are not yet fully elucidated, a consensus that the tau pathology can enhance cognitive decline and cause dementia is widely accepted (Salminen et al., 2011) .\nIn this study, a cross-talk network is established by integrating the interactions among CSF biomarkers. As a complex biology system, cross-talk network has two properties. The first is smallworldness which means that most pairs of nodes can be linked to each other by relatively short chains (Maslov and Ispolatov, 2007; Zhao et al., 2010) . Secondly, robustness is the capacity of keeping homeostasis under a range of condition which may be disrupted by disease (He et al., 2013; Nijhout and Reed, 2014) .\nThe aim of this research is to provide novel insight into the progression from the perspective of crosstalk network disruption. Nevertheless, cross-talk network is a large complicated system, evaluating the entire network robustness is less practical. To address this issue, a simplified cross-talk network termed as mini network is established. The widely accepted key markers are selected to form the skeleton of the mini network. The crosstalk among key markers is modeled by transit compartments model. Robustness and the integral variation of the mini network are proposed to be used as a good proxy for complex disease progression. In our model, three mini network integral disruption parameters U, K, and \u03d5 are introduced to evaluate integral variation of the network and mini network disruption probability is employed to measure the robustness of mini network."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

For the recognition of potential vital biomarkers, the first step of Monte Carlo simulation needs a minor modification. When evaluating the contribution of the ith marker, it needs to be disturbed and the other markers remain invariant. The joint contribution of multi-marker can be estimated in the same way: disturb the group of the markers to be evaluated and keep the other markers constant."}, {"section_title": "Model Performance Evaluation", "text": "In this study, we evaluate model performance in two ways.

According to Equations (1-3), with the mini network variation gets smaller, the K-value gets closer to 1 whereas the values of U and \u03d5 get closer to 0.\nThe simulation experiment result is presented in the Table 2 . The results of single marker changing simulation indicate that the parameters U and \u03d5 are related to the variation of single marker. The results of multi-marker changing simulation 1 suggest that parameter K is related to the consistency multimarker changing and U is sensitive to the great consistency variation of multi-marker. The results of multi-marker changing simulation 2 indicate that parameters U and \u03d5 are related to the multi-marker inconsistency variation. We summarize physiological significance of U, K, and \u03d5 with the simulation experiment evidence. U is responses to both consistency variation and inconsistency variation comprehensively. K responds to multi-marker consistency variation. \u03d5 is response to the multi-marker inconsistency variation. (B) Longitudinal mini network balance maps for the three groups. In normal state, the shape of mini network balance map is equilateral triangle. With the shape deformation, the mini network imbalance gets serious.\nThe boxplot of mini network disruption parameters ( Figure 7A) shows that these three parameters in both AD and MCI groups are significantly greater than those in normal group (P < 0.01, based on One-way ANOVA, Table 3 ) which suggests that if mini network disruption parameters U, K, and \u03d5 are higher than the upper whisker of normal group, the patient may have high disease risk. Moreover, the trajectory figure ( Figure 7B) shows that the variation of parameter U is similar to the disease progression.\nThe contribution of the mini network integral disruption parameters are shown in the Figure 8 . The SVM based on all three parameters has the best classification performance compared with the other SVMs. The SVM without parameter U has the poorest performance which is same as the SVM based on CSF markers."}, {"section_title": "Contribution of Biomarkers to Mini Network Disruption", "text": "The biomarker contribution to the mini network disruption is given in the Figure 9 . For the single marker, P-tau is the major contributor to the mini network in the disease progression in both AD and MCI. However, effects of other two markers A\u03b2 and tau on aggravating mini network disruption cannot be neglected at the end stage (at 48 month). The joint contribution of P-tau and A\u03b2 may play a more important role in the deterioration of the disease."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we propose a disease progression model termed as mini network balance model. The mini network balance model evaluates the disease progression in three ways. Firstly, the mini network balance map describes mini network imbalance visually. Secondly, the robustness of mini network is measured by mini network disruption probability which is a proxy for the disease progression. Thirdly, the integral variation of mini network is evaluated by the mini network disruption parameters U, K, and \u03d5. The variation of mini network is usually complex. These three parameters decompose the complicated variation into simple variation. Firstly, parameter K is response to the consistency variation of biomarkers in mini network. Secondly, parameter \u03d5 represents the inconsistency variation of biomarkers in mini network. Parameter U is response to the total variation. With value of mini network integral parameters greater, the disease risk gets higher. The clinical relevance of mini network integral disruption parameters is that they can help enhance the accuracy and specificity of AD and MCI diagnosis. Especially, parameter U has the greatest contribution to the accuracy and specificity of the classification.\nCompared to several previous researches based on CSF markers list in Table 4 , the mini network balance model achieves relatively high performance on the classification of AD vs. normal and MCI vs. normal. Furthermore, the comparison to researches based on imaging markers shows that CSF markers and imaging markers may play similar roles in classification of AD vs. normal. Because, AD may cause atrophy in multiple region in brain and CSF markers reflect these change (Reiman and Jagust, 2012; Rosenmann, 2012) . However, these two different types may play different roles in classification of MCI vs. normal. On one hand, imaging methods are often recommended to help rule out potentially reversible brain abnormalities like tumors or subdural hematomas in patients with MCI (Reiman and Jagust, The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. **P < 0.01 vs. Normal.\n2012). On the other hand, CSF markers have better accuracy and specificity in classification of MCI vs. normal and they can be employed to identify the prodromal AD (Blennow and Zetterberg, 2015) . The amyloid cascade hypothesis has been widely accepted as AD etiology. However, our model shows that A\u03b2 accumulation may not be the sole factor in AD etiology. Joint contribution of P-tau and A\u03b2 may be another potential major contributor to the AD progression. Consistent with Prior studies, A\u03b2 toxicity is P-tau dependent (Kayed, 2010; Desikan et al., 2012) . In other word, A\u03b2 in the absence of P-tau is not necessarily associated with loss of cognitive function. Previous researches have proposed a possible mechanism for the interaction of P-tau and A\u03b2. On one hand, P-tau can increase the activity of AChE which can elevate the level of PS-1 and then accelerate the A\u03b2 deposition (Garc\u00eda-Ayll\u00f3n et al., 2011; Silveyra et al., 2012) . On the other hand, A\u03b2 can activate tau hyperphosphorylation pathways (Garc\u00eda-Ayll\u00f3n Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.orgFIGURE 9 | The percentage contribution to mini network disruption of the markers. Color-coded scale is used to present the percentage contribution to mini network disruption of the markers in this plot. The joint contribution of tau and P-tau as well as P-tau and A\u03b2 both are potential vital factors of disease.\net al., 2011). The crosstalk between A\u03b2 and P-tau forms a vicious cycle in which they elevate each other and trigger cognitive decline. Furthermore, more and more evidences in clinical trials suggest the multifactorial nature of AD. For example, Anti-bodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab targeted at A\u03b2 have failed to meet their primary endpoints in the high-profile phase 3 clinical trials (Castello et al., 2014) . Doody et al. attribute the failure to administering the therapy at late stages and propose that it should be instituted in early stages (Doody et al., 2014) . However, the proposed model suggests that even at early stage the therapies targeted at A\u03b2 only may have limited effect on AD. The presented results suggest that P-tau may also play a vital role in AD progression. Several prior studies have proved that immunotherapies targeted at P-tau can reduce cognitive impairment in animal model (Boutajangout et al., 2010; Kayed, 2010; Lim et al., 2013) . In addition, our results suggested that single marker might play a limited role in disease progression and joint contribution of P-tau and A\u03b2 might be the potential vital factors in the disease progression. Therefore, the single-target immunotherapies may have limited effects on AD. According to our results, combination therapy of reducing both P-tau and A\u03b2 may be an effective strategy for AD treatment."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper provides a novel method for modeling the complex disease progression.
