[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. The primary objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the rate of total brain atrophy (TBA) with serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using the Brain Boundary Shift Integral (BBSI), in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the course of 52 weeks of treatment with memantine or placebo. This was a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose 1-year study. Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to treatment with placebo or memantine. Patients randomized to memantine were up-titrated to the target dose of 20 mg/day over 4 weeks. MRI scans were collected at screening and at Weeks 4, 42, and 52. Secondary efficacy assessments included several cognitive and behavioral scales. 518 patients were screened, 278 patients were randomized, and 217 patients completed the study. In the primary efficacy analysis, the differences in TBA rates between memantine (15.2 mL/year) and placebo (15.3 mL/year) were not statistically significant (\u22120.04 mL/year [(95% CI: \u22122.60, 2.52), p = 0.98]). There was a statistically significant correlation between change in TBA and change in most cognitive and behavioral scale scores. Patients who were not treated with acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) showed a significantly lower TBA rate than patients treated with AChEIs. Memantine had a placebo-level incidence of adverse events. There were no statistically significant differences between memantine and placebo in total brain or hippocampal atrophy rates in patients with probable AD treated for 1 year. The biological relevance of cerebral atrophy was supported by a significant correlation between rate of atrophy and decline in cognitive and behavioral outcomes."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Two small pilot studies have shown effects of memantine on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters [1, 2] . This exploratory study was designed to evaluate the effect of memantine on the rate of total brain atrophy. Part of the rationale was to test the utility of a biomarker (MRI) as a primary outcome in a randomized controlled trial, as calculations suggested that an adequate power to detect change could be achieved on a much smaller sample size than would traditionally be required using clinical endpoints.\nThis exploratory study employed a novel design in a selected patient population, with an adequate period of observation (1 year) involving four MRI scans with appropriate scan intervals to enhance the precision in estimating the rate of brain atrophy [3] . Patients were chosen on the basis of being likely to tolerate MRI scans over the course of 1 year and likely to complete the study. Patients were included that were with or without treatment with an acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) (donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine), thereby conforming to the current standard of care.\nThe primary objective of this study was to explore the potential effects of memantine compared to placebo, on the rate of total brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) over 1 year using a validated serial MRI registration technique [4] . Treatment effects were stratified according to the AChEI status of the patients. Secondary objectives were to assess the effects of memantine on other MRI measures, that is, hippocampal volume change (atrophy). Other pre-defined secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of memantine on cognitive and behavioral outcomes over 1 year, the potential associations between cognitive changes and MRI findings, and to assess the safety and tolerability of memantine over 1 year."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "This multi-national, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT008629 40) included 31 centers from 4 countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).

Results indicated no effect of memantine on the rate of total brain atrophy. We found that both total brain atrophy rate and the MMSE decline were lower than previously reported. In the placebo group, the total brain atrophy rate was lower (1.6% per year) than seen in some other studies (2.2% per year) [3, 24] , as was the MMSE decline (0.7 points versus 2.2 points per year) [25] . Interestingly, the rates of atrophy in this study were similar to those recently reported from the ADNI [26] .\nA great deal of effort was put into standardization of MRI scan acquisition, diagnoses and analyses to control variability associated with MRI data and to achieve precision in estimating rates of MRI change over time. Use of multiple time points improved precision in estimating rates of atrophy: the SDs of the annualized total brain atrophy rates were similar to that used to calculate sample size (0.98%) based on single center MRI scans. Also, the MRI schedule allowed, in the event of a significant difference between groups, assessment of short term effects (0-4 weeks) to distinguish immediate drug presence effects from sustained effects on rates of atrophy.\nStandardization of diagnoses was also seen as important with a unique patient selection of an \"enriched\" population of patients. This was done to improve the specificity of the clinical diagnosis of AD, to control for the heterogeneity in the patient population, and it was assumed it would increase the likelihood of seeing change over time in whole brain and hippocampal volume. This assumption was proved to be incorrect, but this study did show that this kind of standardization was achievable in this multi-center setting to the extent that the variability was in line with that demonstrated for single-site studies.\nMore than the usual caution should be exercised when interpreting the efficacy results of this study and in making generalizations to a broader AD population, as this obviously constitutes quite a selected sample. The patient population was different from previous trials [1, 27] , chosen for the very reason that they would be stable (able to tolerate MRI scanning for a whole year) and homogenous (we used specific MRI criteria and enrichment) and this clearly may have implications for our results.\nIt is noteworthy that pre-selection of patients with evidence of MTA and minimal vascular changes did not select a group of patients who showed the typically expected radiological or clinical decline over one year, in contrast to the Henneman study [28] . The dissociation between MTA and the clinical decline in this study may suggest a dissonance between this biomarker and clinical progression.\nThat such a traditional hallmark of the disease may not relate to the clinical syndrome or progression as clearly as was thought, may mean we need something more than MTA or indeed MMSE score to identify those patients likely to progress and who would be most helpful to enroll into clinical trials. Furthermore, it could be that not excluding patients with small vessel disease may have influenced the overall decline, but this was not the case in the Henneman data [28] .\nAn interesting finding was the difference between AChEI subgroups for total brain atrophy and MMSE decline. In fact 30% of the patients in this study, despite it being a year long and in moderate AD, were not treated with AChEIs and yet showed a significantly lower total brain atrophy rate than patients treated with AChEIs. Furthermore, it was observed that the total brain atrophy rate in patients not treated with AChEIs was not typical of the overall patient population either.\nAdded to the fact that a lower rate of cognitive decline was seen in those patients who were not being treated with an AChEI, this may have implications for selection of patients for future trials in AD. This was a difficult study to recruit to and those recruited who were not on an AChEI were probably a rather abnormal group of stable patients, albeit with demonstrable memory complaints. Those on an AChEI were probably more typical of the AD patients we see clinically and it seems that these patients should form the basis of future trials with AD therapies. Those on AChEI may have also contained a higher proportion of patients with an APOE4 allele but unfortunately this was not measured in the study and represents another limitation of the study. If untreated AD patients are included, then the reasons they are not being treated need to be clearly recorded, as these reasons may influence their progression, making them unsuitable for inclusion in treatment trials."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this study, we have shown that the enrichment of subjects did not increase the number of patients showing atrophy or clinical decline, perhaps suggesting that the presence of MTA itself was not a good indicator of future cognitive decline. The enriched population in this study suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting these results and in generalizing findings to a broader AD population. There was a statistically significant correlation between change in total brain atrophy over 1 year and change in all cognitive and behavioral scale scores (except SIT-I).\nThese findings are in line with reports of good correlation between global measures of atrophy and cognition versus regional measures [3, 25] . An MRI marker may have limitations due to cost, as clinical measures are easier and cheaper to perform, but it adds an objective correlation with a link to the pathology that adds credence to any clinical study results. In addition, a number of AD patients, particularly when more severely affected, may not tolerate MRI scans. Although we could not show statistically significant effects on reducing brain atrophy with treatment in this study, we have shown that such a multi-center study can be undertaken with good accuracy, which has implications for future research. Memantine had a low incidence of adverse events."}]
