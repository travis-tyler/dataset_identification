They begin as small low pressure disturbances in the tropics, where warm water and humid air provide the necessary fuel for their creation. As warm air rises, it begins to cool, allowing water vapor to condense. Condensation releases latent heat, or energy, that warms the surrounding atmosphere and causes more air to rise and expand. Ultimately, the cycle of condensation and latent-heat release creates an area of low pressure. As this process continues, the low pressure cell intensifies creating a steep pressure gradient. In the Northern Hemisphere, the resulting pressure gradient generates cyclonic winds that blow in towards and around the low pressure center, creating a counter-clockwise center of circulation. When the maximum sustained wind speed reaches 119 km/hr (74 mph), the storm is classified as a Category 1 hurricane, according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. A major hurricane, defined as a Category 3 storm or greater, has wind speeds in excess of 178 km/hr (111 mph). The landfall of one of these major storms generates not only heavy winds, but also large waves and storm surge. Storm surge, the elevated water level at the coast due to the wind field and low atmospheric pressure associated with the hurricane, will likely exceed 3 m during a Category 3 storm. The combination of storm surge and waves create a highly destructive force that erode beaches and sand dunes and, ultimately, threaten the structures they serve to protect. Major hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Basin has been shown to follow a somewhat regular, multi-decadal cycle [Goldenberg, 2001]. Interannual variability in both the number and intensity of hurricanes is constrained by large-scale atmospheric factors [Webster et al., 2005]. For example, during El Ni\u00f1o years, there are fewer Atlantic and Gulf hurricanes due to increased wind shear associated with abnormally warm waters. From 1970 -1994, only ten major hurricanes (Category 3-5) made landfall in the United States, a relatively low number compared to 19 landfalls in the prior 25 years [Center, 2006]. As evidenced by the record-breaking 2005 hurricane season, where there were more named storms (27) in the Atlantic in a single year since official recordkeeping began in 1944, tropical cyclonic activity is currently in an active phase [Goldenberg, 2001]. In the eleven-year period from 1995-2005, ten major hurricanes have made landfall in the United States [National Climate Data Center, 2006]. It is likely that this present high level of hurricane activity will last for a total of 25-40 years [Goldenberg, 2001]. In order to better prepare coastal communities for future hurricane landfalls, it is critical to assess the vulnerability of our coastline to extreme coastal change during these storms. This begins with a better understanding of the nature and magnitude of the large-scale response of barrier island morphology to hurricanes"}, {"section_title": "Spatially-Variable Storm Response", "text": "Observations of the large-scale response of beaches to storms have shown that significant spatial variability is superimposed upon a general mean response ]. Within the storm-impact zone, some areas may experience severe dune erosion and overwash, while adjacent areas remain virtually unaffected. For example, coastal change within Onslow Bay, North Carolina was significantly longshore-variable following the landfall of Hurricane Bonnie in 1998 ( Figure 1.1). Mean shoreline change, defined as the horizontal movement of the mean high water contour was -8.36 m along a 70-km stretch of beach between Carolina Beach and New River Inlets; yet, the standard deviation about this mean was of the same order of magnitude, 9.02 m. The spatialvariability of shoreline change persisted after the landfall of Hurricane Floyd, which occurred one year later. Large variations in the magnitude of shoreline and beach erosion were observed both along a single island and between islands. On Masonboro Island, shoreline and beach erosion appeared to be cumulative and longshore-variability of the signal increased after each storm. Alternatively, on Topsail Island the magnitude and spatial variability of shoreline change were similar following each storm [Stockdon et al., 2003]. In order to accurately predict the large-scale coastal response to hurricanes, an understanding of the processes responsible for these observed patterns is required. Negative values indicate erosion and positive values indicate accretion. The largest signal was observed near inlets or at renourished beaches. The mean shoreline change outside of these areas was -8.36 m (standard deviation = 9.02 m)."}, {"section_title": "Predicting Coastal Vulnerability to Hurricanes", "text": "The main goals of this research are to implement and quantitatively test a model for scaling hurricane-induced coastal change and to investigate the observed patterns of shoreline and beach volume change. More specifically, this study explores the extent to which the observed longshore variability of coastal change can be attributed to the relationship between longshore changes in coastal morphology and extreme water levels that accompany the storm. We begin with the hypothesis that areas with low-lying dunes are more prone to overwash than beaches backed by a continuous, high dune. Additionally, longshore variations in wave height (and the resulting wave runup) exist due to refraction of waves over local bathymetry causing wave energy to focus and defocus. These two ideas are combined through a simple scaling model that uses the relative elevations of sand dunes (or berms) and extreme water levels (defined as the sum of storm surge, wave runup, and astronomical tides) to delineate four unique stormimpact regimes on barrier islands [Sallenger, 2000]. The swash regime, the lowest impact level, occurs when the surge and runup are confined to the beach face and the dominant sediment transport gradients are directed offshore. When water levels reach the base of the dune, the system falls within the collision regime, marked by the beginning of significant erosion of the dune face. The overwash regime is defined when maximum runup levels exceed the crest of the dune or berm, often causing the landward transport of sand. The final and most extreme regime, inundation, occurs when total water levels continuously exceed the maximum elevation of the beach and dunes, completely submerging the island and allowing for cross-island flows. In the following chapters, we investigate the accuracy with which the model can be used to predict the impact of an approaching hurricane and the extent to which these four storm-impact regimes may be used to scale the magnitudes of hurricane-induced coastal change. The model has been applied to three beaches in Onslow Bay, North Carolina in order to hindcast the vulnerability of the area to extreme coastal change during Hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd, which made successive landfalls near Cape Fear, North Carolina, in the late summers of 1998 and 1999, respectively. These hindcasts were compared to objective determinations of the observed hurricane impact regime in order to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model. Additionally, magnitudes of shoreline and beach volume change were quantified within each regime to examine whether processes unique to each regime are responsible for a longshore-variable response. Critical to this work is the collection of detailed, large-scale (O(10 km)) measurements of coastal morphology and change. The advent of airborne laser mapping systems has made possible the rapid collection of high-resolution topographic datasets over large areas. NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), initially developed to detect changes in the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet [Krabill et al., 1995], has more recently been applied to mapping beach morphology for the assessment of storm impacts [Krabill et al., 2000;Sallenger et al., 1999a]. Comparisons of lidar surveys collected before and after hurricane landfall provide an unprecedented, three-dimensional view of coastal change in response to the storm. The first goal of this work was to extract specific measures of coastal change from the full lidar data set that will be used to quantify the longshore-variable response to each hurricane (Chapter 2). We present a technique for calculating the horizontal position and movement of the shoreline, which has been used historically as a proxy for large-scale morphology and a direct measure of accretion and erosion. Lidar data are also used to quantify storm-induced coastal change and to objectively classify the observed storm-impact regime. We use the lidar data to extract additional beach morphology parameters, such as beach slopes and dune elevations, that provide the basis for hindcasting the potential storm-impact regime. To use the storm scaling model in a predictive mode, estimates of runup (including swash and setup) during hurricane conditions are needed. The behavior of runup from monochromatic waves on a planar beach is well defined. However, natural beaches introduce complications of random waves and complex beach morphology. With knowledge of complete boundary conditions and wave spectra, it is possible to numerically model swash and runup [Raubenheimer and Guza, 1996;. However, this approach is not practical for the large-scale prediction of hurricane-induced wave runup because details of the model input and boundary conditions are not known. Therefore, we investigate the degree to which an empirical parameterization is useful for calculating extreme runup based on local beach slope and offshore wave conditions (Chapter 3). The most-often used parameterization for extreme runup [Holman, 1986] shows a dependence on foreshore beach slope, wave height and wave period. This equation was developed using data from a single experiment and is not necessarily applicable over a wide range of conditions. Therefore, we expand the work of Holman (1986) to water-level data collected during ten field experiments, representing different beach morphologies and wave climates. Unique to this work is the separate parameterization of wave setup and swash, the two physically different processes that comprise runup. The final equation, presented in Chapter 3, can be used to parameterize the 2% exceedence value of runup on a wide range of natural beaches. Combining modeled estimates of storm-induced runup and setup elevations (Chapter 3) and measurements of coastal morphology and change (Chapter 2), we examine the large-scale, longshore-variable impacts of Hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd within the framework of the storm-impact scaling model (Chapter 4). First, we calculate the expected impact regime along a 70-km stretch of coast using topographic surveys of prestorm beach morphology and a hindcast estimate of total water levels for each storm. Topographic surveys collected immediately after hurricane landfall allow objective determination of the observed hurricane-impact regime and a quantitative analysis of the predictive capabilities of the scaling model. Additionally, the longshore-variable response of the coast to these storms is examined by calculating hurricane-induced shoreline and beach volume change. The magnitudes of change within different impact regimes are used to determine to what extent the scaling model, and the processes delineated within the model, contribute to the longshore-variable coastal response. Introduction A recent focus in nearshore research has been large-scale coastal behavior [LSCB, Thornton et al., 2000], changes in nearshore bathymetry and beach topography with spatial scales of order kilometers and temporal scales of order years. It is at these scales that decisions are made in coastal zone management and at these scales that improvement to our scientific understanding is needed. In order to accurately quantify the variability of large-scale coastal changes and to obtain a clearer understanding of the processes driving these changes, detailed measurement of large-scale morphology over regional scales is required. While change occurs over the entire active profile, the horizontal location and movement of the shoreline are two of the most commonly chosen variables of large-scale beach morphology and serve as direct indicators of erosion and accretion. Topographic maps (USGS Quadrangles and NOS Topographic Sheets), rectified aerial photographs, and traditional beach profiles have been the most common source for long-term, large-scale measures of shoreline position [Dolan et al., 1980]. These historical shoreline locations are often compared to present shoreline locations to calculate rates of long-term shoreline change. Because of their long record length, maps and aerial photographs are invaluable in quantifying long-term shoreline change."}, {"section_title": "Traditional Shoreline Proxies", "text": "Quantification of shoreline location, the interface between the land and the water, usually involves a number of assumptions. Therefore, all estimates will have error associated with both the technique for measuring shoreline position and the assumptions made regarding the definition of the shoreline. Traditional methods using aerial photographs for shoreline measurement often involved non-stereo photography that has no vertical information. In this case, relationships must be assumed between some identifiable horizontal feature and its assumed vertical elevation. For coastal change applications, the location of the high water line (HWL), defined as the landward extent of the last high tide [Anders and Byrnes, 1991;Crowell et al., 1991;Dolan et al., 1980;Stafford, 1971], is commonly used to mark the position of the shoreline. Often the HWL may be difficult to identify or may appear as a gradational zone of change. Here, other physical features, such as the wet/dry line [Crowell et al., 1991], vegetation line, drift line, or dune line [Morton, 1991] are used as a proxy for shoreline location. This leaves the determination of the location of this feature up to the judgment of the operator [Anders and Byrnes, 1991], and it may often be confused with the latest swash excursion, a debris line, an erosional scarp, or changes in sediment type or color [Crowell et al., 1991]. Since the relationship of these proxies and an actual tidal datum may vary depending on wave height, beach slope, storm surge, and sediment size [Dolan et al., 1980], errors can potentially be large and cannot easily be quantified."}, {"section_title": "Techniques for Identifying Shorelines", "text": "The earliest historical shorelines for the coast of the United States are available from maps dating back to the late 1800's [Anders and Byrnes, 1991]. Topographic maps are most useful for examining long-term trends in shoreline change since the maps are produced infrequently, limiting the amount of detail that can be obtained concerning the short-term physical processes. Errors in shoreline location derived from maps may be attributed to surveyor error in identifying the shoreline feature, distortion of source maps (folding, tearing, shrinkage), and changes in the reference datum [Anders and Byrnes, 1991]. Since the 1920's, aerial photographs have been used to document shoreline position and change [Anders and Byrnes, 1991]. Aerial photographs are first transformed to map coordinates using ground control points and then a proxy for shoreline is digitized [Crowell et al., 1991]. Aerial photographs were generally collected more frequently than maps were made, and therefore, may be used to develop a more detailed understanding of short-term shoreline variability. For unrectified aerial photographs, accuracy within or between images is limited by scale differences (caused by aircraft altitude changes), by camera geometry, by ground relief [Crowell et al., 1991;Dolan et al., 1980;Hapke and Richmond, 2000], and by the precision of the digitizing equipment and of the operator in following the trace of the HWL [Anders and Byrnes, 1991]. Since the errors in measuring a shoreline from aerial photographs are not independent, cumulative errors can be large. Crowell et al. [1991] estimate the total (operational) combined error for 1:10,000 scale, non-tidal coordinated, aerial photography to be ~ 7.6 m, not including errors associated with inaccurate interpretation of the location of the HWL. Many of the errors associated with aerial photographs can be eliminated or reduced before features are identified within the image by using recent techniques involving softcopy photogrammetry where digital stereo images are used to georeference the image and remove distortion [Hapke and Richmond, 2000]. Elevation contours are generated on the photograph through the creation of a digital terrain model and shoreline position, or a specified contour, can be measured from the stereo pair [Overton and Fisher, 1996]. The accuracy of the extracted features depends on the known camera parameters, flight elevation, accuracy of ground control points, and the resolution of the image [Hapke and Richmond, 2000]. While the use of accurate digital images eliminates much of the error associated with aerial photographs, the process of identifying a shoreline and then extracting it from an image is very labor intensive and makes the analysis of large areas more difficult. Shorelines have also been measured from ground-based surveys of cross-shore profiles of beach elevations. Since these surveys are relatively inexpensive to perform, closely spaced profiles can be collected frequently and used for detailed studies of shortterm variations in shoreline position over a limited region [Morton, 1991]. While ground-based profiling techniques may yield an accurate measure of shoreline location, the measurements are spatially limited due to the intensive labor requirement of profiling. More recently, shoreline position has been measured using vehicle-mounted, groundbased GPS (global positioning system) surveys. All-terrain vehicles equipped with GPS antennae can quickly survey shore-parallel and shore-normal profiles [Morton et al., 1993], a single transect along the length of the beach (100 km or more in length) [List et al., 2000], or a complete, detailed mapping of beach topography (4 km or more in length) [Plant et al., 1996;Ruggiero et al., 1999;Ruggiero and Voigt, 2000]. Horizontal accuracy of shoreline positions measured using these techniques depends on, among other things, GPS accuracy, proximity of survey lines to the exact location of the shoreline, and beach slope. For example, using the vehicle-based mapping systems on a beach with a 1:50 slope, the horizontal error in position is approximately 2.5 to 5.0 m [Ruggiero et al., 1999]. While the spatial coverage of the vehicle-based GPS ground surveys can be very extensive, it is still somewhat limited compared to the capabilities of an airborne system. Recent developments in GPS and scanning airborne laser capabilities have made available extensive data sets of fully three-dimensional beach topography. These highly accurate and spatially dense surveys allow the possibility of making an objective and detailed determination of regional-scale shoreline position. Using laser data to quantify shoreline position and change over regional scales will contribute to an improved understanding of large-scale coastal behavior on both long-term and short-term (storm) scales. Our objective is to develop a technique for measuring shoreline position from laser altimetry data. First, we describe the details of the lidar ATM system and the lidar shoreline extraction technique. We then discuss the results of the ground truth test in the Outer Banks of North Carolina in September 1997. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of lidar data as a measure of large-scale shoreline position are illustrated through examination of three data sets of shoreline position collected at Assateague Island, Maryland/Virginia. Finally, we examine the statistics and longshore variability of the response of the island to the northeaster storm season of 1997-1998 using lidarderived shorelines and beach slopes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "\n\nTo test the validity of the Sallenger [2000] model for predicting storm responses and scaling magnitudes of coastal change, the storm-impact regime was predicted every 20 m along the coast using measurements of pre-storm dune elevation and estimates of hurricane-induced, expected water levels. Estimated water levels were calculated using modeled surge and wave conditions and an empirical parameterization for wave setup and runup. Dune elevations were extracted from detailed laser-altimetry surveys of beach topography. These surveys were also used to calculate the observed impact on beaches and dunes following each storm and the magnitudes of change within each regime. Details of the storm-impact scaling model, the topographic surveys, coastal change measures, and wave and surge modeling are presented below."}, {"section_title": "Airborne Topographic Mapper", "text": "NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) is a scanning laser altimeter originally developed to study climate change by mapping changes in the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet [Krabill et al., 1995]. Since the late 1990's the ATM has been mounted in a Twin Otter aircraft and used for mapping coastal change and assessing storm impacts on subaerial beaches [Krabill et al., 2000;Sallenger et al., 1999b]. The ATM surveys elevation with a blue-green laser reflected towards the beach using a rotating mirror that produces an elliptical scan pattern. The ATM only records the first reflection of the laser so returns are also obtained from the surface of the water. GPS determines aircraft position and an inertial navigation system (INS) measures the aircraft's pitch, roll, and heading [Krabill et al., 1995]. The process of deriving elevation measurements from the ATM system is explained in Sallenger et al. [2003]. Elevation data can be obtained at a rate of 50 -70 km/hr (based on an aircraft speed of 110 -150 knots and multi-pass coverage). In a five-hour flight mission, the ATM can completely cover 250 -350 km of coast with four overlapping passes, yielding a typical combined swath width of 600 -700 m. Partially overlapping passes are flown to fully cover the region of interest, to eliminate gaps in the data, and to increase data density. The footprint, and subsequent horizontal resolution, of the laser is approximately one meter in diameter and an individual laser shot is collected every 2 m 2 . The ATM beach surveys provide a dense data set of subaerial beach topography with both large spatial coverage and high spatial resolution. Extensive tests of the vertical accuracy of the ATM instrument were conducted during the SandyDuck Nearshore Processes Experiment (SandyDuck) at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC from September to October 1997. Several GPS ground-based surveys of the beach were compared to ATM surveys of the same area. The root-mean-square (rms) vertical error attributed to the ATM was 15 cm [Sallenger et al., 2003]. This represents a total error estimate that includes the many potential sources of error and bias for the lidar system. Based on this error estimate and a typical beach slope of 0.1, we can expect to obtain horizontal shoreline accuracy of \u00b11.5 m, an order of magnitude better than typical accuracies associated with shorelines from non-stereo aerial photographs. Therefore, the lidar data may offer an alternative to the traditional techniques for measuring shorelines by easily providing objective estimates that are spatially extensive, synoptic, and of sufficient accuracy to resolve a wide range of beach variability (horizontal changes in shoreline position > 3 m)."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Extraction from Lidar Profiles", "text": "The technique for extracting shoreline position, x s , from ATM data is straightforward. For any particular longshore location, y\u2032, a cross-shore profile is extracted from the irregularly spaced full data set. Data from a 2 m wide band around the profile location (y\u2032 \u00b11 m) are included in the individual profile. The cross-shore profiles are extracted at any constant longshore spacing, dy, (dy = 20 m and 10 m for this work) chosen to resolve a particular scale of longshore variability. These profiles also allow determination of other important beach parameters such as beach slope and the location and elevation of the berm, dune base, and dune crest. After the profiles have been created, any elevation datum, z s , or elevation-based definition of shoreline, can be extracted. Lidar data contaminated by waves and runup are first removed from each profile by removing all of the data points that lie seaward of the intersection of the water (identified by the noisy laser returns, see Figure 2.1a) and beach. Along each lidar profile, the data are limited to a vertical range (typically \u00b1 0.5m) around the specified elevation datum (Figure 2.1a). The range around the datum may be site specific and should be selected to minimize errors due to laser data in the foreshore area that still may be somewhat contaminated by returns from wave runup. A linear regression is then fit through these data with beach elevation, z b , as the independent variable (Figure 2.1b). Finally, the function is evaluated at z s to identify the horizontal position of the shoreline, x s ( Figure 2.1b, asterisk). The slope of the foreshore region, \u03b2, is also directly measured on each profile as the slope of the regression through the data around z s . This procedure is repeated in the longshore for each profile to create a map of shoreline location. represent the scatter present in the data and account for the random error (noise) of the system. There may also be biases, unaccounted for in these error bars, which may include, but are not limited to: bias in the range walk correction of the instrument, bias in the INS data, instrument mounting bias, or a low-frequency drift of the GPS systems (see below, as well as Sallenger et al. [2003] for details)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\nFor the initial analysis of bulk runup statistics, the complications of longshore variability were avoided by selecting a single cross-shore transect from each experiment. Limiting the data to one runup line per experiment also helped to minimize the bias  The assumption that the 2% exceedence level for runup approximately equals <\u03b7> + S/2 (equation 3.6) was first tested. S is calculated as four times the square root of the swash variance (4\u03c3) and, for a Gaussian process, would encompass 95.4% of the values. The remaining 4.6% defines the extreme high and low values and is split evenly between the tails of the distribution. Accordingly, the actual value of the extreme low value of runup (the 98% exceedence value) would be defined as the mean (setup) minus half of the spread (2\u03c3 , or S/2), and the extreme high value of runup (the 2% exceedence value) would be defined as the mean (setup) plus half of the spread. The squared-correlation between the measured values of <\u03b7> + S/2 and R 2 , is 0.94, which is significant at the 99% confidence level (Figure 3.4). The slope of the regression is 1.1, which reflects the slightly non-Gaussian nature of natural swash. To test whether the observed swash was Gaussian, the skewness and kurtosis of each swash distribution were calculated for all experiments, except Duck82, and compared to values defining Gaussian distributions (skewness = 0, kurtosis = 3). The mean kurtosis for all data was 2.9 (\u03c3 = 0.80). The mean skewness for all swash distributions was 0.19 (\u03c3 = 0.38) indicating that natural swash is slightly skewed. To account for this skewness, the slope of the regression in Figure 3.4 is included in equation 3.6, resulting in a more complete definition of runup, (3.9) The empirical models described in the following sections will be presented in dimensional space and based on regressions forced through the origin. Synthetic tests based on samples with known statistical characteristics indicate a danger in carrying out the least-squares analysis in non-dimensional space, as has been common in the literature. In a regression between non-dimensional R 2 (normalized by H 0 ) and \u03be 0 , it is found that small errors in data from small wave cases will map to large errors in \u03be 0 and can introduce large errors in regression statistics. Thus, in order to avoid undue influence of these errors and to better weigh storm events, the dimensional parameterization is preferable to its non-dimensional counterpart. Regressions through the origin are used, rather than allowing least squares intercepts, in order to avoid non-physical results in setup and swash models. For example, a significant intercept in a relationship between wave height normalized swash and \u03be 0 would results in a value of swash when H 0 = 0. In most models presented here, the computed intercept was not significantly different than zero, supporting the selection of regression through the origin methodology. To evaluate each empirical model, the squared-correlation, \u03c1 2 , referred to hereafter simply as correlation, and the 95% significance level, \u03c1 2 sig , are presented as a measure of the linear relationship between the two parameters. The goodness of fit of the empirical model is measured using an rms error, rmse.\n"}, {"section_title": "Ground Truth Testing", "text": "The shoreline extraction technique was tested using laser altimetry data collected on   The longshore distribution of shoreline position differences between the two systems, \u2206x s, and their combined error bars are shown in Figure 2.4a. In the northern part of the study region, the differences between the two techniques are not statistically significant because the 95% confidence interval for the differences lies around zero. In the southern part of the study region, where the lidar shoreline tends to fall seaward of the SWASH shoreline, there are more significant differences between the two systems. This may be partially due to lidar data points included in the polynomial fit that are actually returns from the wave runup rather than the actual beach surface. While most of the returns from the water's surface are removed from the profile prior to shoreline extraction, a few contaminated returns sometimes remain within the range of z s and may serve to flatten out the regression, pulling x s_atm (y') seaward. Another reason for the seaward bias may be due to extrapolation errors within the SWASH data caused by the larger distance between the MHW contour and the track driven the ATV on this particular day. Estimating the location of the MHW line by extrapolating along a steep slope that may tend to flatten lower in the profile will cause the location of the shoreline to fall more landward than it truly is. The beach slopes used in the SWASH system for the extrapolations were compared to foreshore slopes measured directly around the shoreline vertical datum using the lidar data. In locations where the slope used by SWASH was steeper than that measured around z s by the ATM, the largest discrepancies between the two systems occur with SWASH estimates falling more landward of the ATM shoreline.  \u03b4 , for x s_atm was \u00b1 1.4 m. These error bars represent the random noise of the system and robustness of the data used in the regression. For the lidar-derived shorelines, the largest error bars occur on profiles where only three data points were used in the regression and the R 2 value of the regression was low. This occurred in areas of low data density where there were an insufficient number of lidar data points to clearly define the foreshore. The mean error bar for x s_swash , based on assumptions of the typical variations in \u03b2, was \u00b1 1.7 m [List et al., 2000]. For the SWASH system, error bars are calculated directly from slope and distance from the datum; hence, the error bars are larger on flatter beaches and in locations where the vehicle drove farther away from the datum. Extensive comparisons of individual, raw ATM and SWASH data points reveal a mean vertical difference, b z \u2206 , between the two of 8.7 cm [Sallenger et al., 2003]. This vertical difference is thought to be primarily due to a low frequency drift inherent in both the ATM and SWASH GPS systems. This low-frequency drift is specific to GPS  [Sallenger et al., 2003]. Based on this estimate, we feel the \u00b11 m horizontal drift error is a conservative estimate and may be smaller in some locations. The total vertical accuracy of the ATM system (15 cm) is a bulk estimate representing all potential error sources, including this GPS drift [Sallenger et al., 2003]. Details of the comparisons between the raw data points and of the GPS drift can be found in Sallenger et al. [2003] and Krabill et al.[2002]. The vertical offset between the raw ATM and SWASH data contains a trend that decreases to the north. In the southern region of the study area \u2206z b = 12 cm while in the northern region \u2206z b = 2 cm. In order to examine the robustness of the technique and the ideal, expected error in the absence of GPS low frequency drift, the longshore trend in vertical differences due to the drift was removed from the lidar elevation data.

Two months later on April 3, 1998 (2200 -2300 GMT), a third survey was conducted that documented the initial recovery stage for the island.  1997, (b) February 9, 1998, and (c) April 3, 1998. Total runup elevation of February 9, 1998 was much higher than during the other two flights, making the extraction of the MHW contour (z = 0.31 m) very difficult on this day. The solid horizontal bar in each panel indicates the time during which the lidar data were collected. The tide level and wave conditions during the February 9, 1998 ATM flight were much higher than conditions during the other two surveys (Figure 2.5). In order to quantitatively assess whether the MHW contour was seriously contaminated by wave runup on the February 9, 1998 profiles, the total water level (the tide level, \u03b7, plus the runup due to waves) was calculated for each survey date. on April 3, 1998). The total water elevation on February 9, 1998 during the lidar flight was 3.04 m, well above the elevation of MHW, 0.31 m NAVD88 (Figure 2.5b). Since the MHW datum was obscured in the February 9, 1998 data by elevated tide levels and large wave runup, z s extracted for the Assateague data set was 0.81 m (0.5 m above MHW), which still lies on the active foreshore of the beach. Shorelines were calculated from all three data sets along the 60 km stretch of beach at profiles spaced 10 m in the longshore. (The 10 m spacing was selected for a different application of the data in which smaller scale shoreline features were studied.) Figure 2.6 illustrates two example profiles from September 1997 and February 1998. The large scatter seaward of x = 550 m is due to the reflection of the laser off of the water's surface. Since data passes are combined, the surface appears more like noise than actual waves. Along this profile, a well-defined berm was completely eroded and the shoreline recessed  The shoreline position calculated from the April 1998 data set shows that the poststorm beach had started to recover to the pre-storm conditions ( Figure 2.7, gray line). The mean shoreline change during this two-month recovery period was approximately 13.5 \u00b1 0.02 m of accretion (\u03c3(\u2206x s ) = 11.0 m). Both storm and recovery curves of shoreline change show the same order of longshore variability and the same general pattern. This is shown by a negative correlation between the two shoreline change curves with an R 2 value of 0.27, which is significant for the 95% confidence interval (N = 5170, R 2 sig = 0.001). This spatial pattern of erosion and accretion was not documented until recently along the Outer Banks, North Carolina and Cape Cod, Massachusetts by List and Farris [1999]. The advent of the lidar system makes it possible to reveal this type of behavior over large areas and provides a mean to study the longshore variability of coastal change.  .8. Probability density functions of Assateague beach slope measured using lidar data from (a) September 15, 1997, (b) February 9, 1998, and (c) April 3, 1998. The normally distributed pre-winter beach slopes (a) are shown to significantly flatten out after the winter storms (b). The beach recovery can be seen in the increasing beach steepness measured in April (c). Another measure of beach morphology that can be easily obtained from the laser altimetry data is beach slope, \u03b2, calculated from the regression in the shoreline extraction technique. The spatially-dense data allow the measure the spatial variation of beach slope over large areas. Figure 2.8 presents three probability density functions of beach slope calculated along Assateague Island from lidar data. The pre-winter beach slopes ( Figure   2.8a) are normally distributed with a mean value, \u03b2 , of 0.13 (standard deviation of \u03b2, \u03c3(\u03b2), = 0.034). After the winter's northeaster storms, the slopes were reduced significantly, \u03b2 = 0.054 (\u03c3(\u03b2) = 0.029), as the beach responded to large wave events (Figure 2.8b). The April 1998 slope distribution reveals that the beach is slowly recovering as indicated by the steepening slopes, \u03b2 = 0.08 (\u03c3(\u03b2) = 0.032), and the increasingly Gaussian distribution (Figure 2.8c). While these observations are not unexpected, the collection of such an extensive set of slope and shoreline data at such high accuracy is unprecedented."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "There are many research and practical management applications for lidar-derived shoreline positions. As previously discussed, lidar shorelines can be used to study the large-scale impacts of storms on beaches. Accurate measures of large-scale, storminduced beach change, with confidence intervals, can be determined using lidar surveys collected before and after storm events (i.e. Figure 2.7). Beach recovery can also be examined using lidar data collected some period after the passage of the storm. Profiles that are very closely spaced in the longshore will make full use of the dense threedimensional lidar data and can be used to resolve smaller scale details of beach topography and morphologic change. Multiple lidar shorelines from one location can also be used to determine the natural variability of the shoreline position. Studies of long-term, large-scale shoreline change are another possible use for the lidar shorelines. Accurate rates of shoreline change are of great interest today to coastal scientists, engineers, and planners. A set of profiles extracted from lidar data collected during calm weather conditions can be used to quickly and accurately determine the location of the shoreline. The shoreline can be compared to historical shoreline positions as measured from photographs or maps to calculate rates of shoreline change. When considering the different uses for lidar-derived shorelines, the proper selection of the vertical datum becomes important. One of the major advances of the technique discussed in this paper is that subjectivity is removed from shoreline determination since the exact location of any vertical datum for the shoreline (MHW, MHHW, etc.) can be easily and accurately found. The specific datum selected depends on the ultimate use of the lidar-derived shorelines. If the lidar shorelines will be compared to historical shorelines measured as wet/dry lines from aerial photographs or maps, then a vertical datum that may serve as a proxy for the digitized wet/dry line should be selected. However, such a vertical datum is not clearly defined making it difficult to quantify the precise elevation of wet/dry line (see previous discussion). If lidar shorelines are to be used in conjunction with contour-based shorelines measured from ortho-rectified photographs or ground surveys, then the same shoreline datum should also be used to define a lidar shoreline. With this technique any relevant datum can be extracted from the data and used to study coastal change. In order to obtain the most accurate estimate of the horizontal location of the shoreline datum, it is important to have dense sampling of the foreshore region. The largest error bars on shoreline location occur along profiles with sparse data due to poor lidar returns. This problem could be improved by creating wider cross-shore profiles using a larger swath region, perhaps \u00b1 2 m. For this technique to produce accurate estimates, it is essential that the data be collected during low tide and times of low wave energy. High tides, large waves, storm surge, and run-up may obscure the location of the vertical datum, z s , particularly if the datum is very low on the beach face (i.e. MHW). If z s lies beneath the water surface or the effect of waves and run-up, it may be necessary to look at changes occurring at a datum higher on the beach face. However, if a specific shoreline datum, such as MHW, is required, it may be possible to extrapolate to identify the cross-shore location of the shoreline, x s , using methods similar to List et al. [2000]. Future work includes expanding this technique to allow for extrapolation to the location of the shoreline datum. We recognize that reducing the lidar data set to profiles to find shorelines is not the only way to extract the shoreline position from the data. Other research groups [e.g. Revell et al., 2002] locate the position of the shoreline by extracting a contour from previously gridded data. While shorelines from these traditional gridding techniques are commonly used and accepted, they do not readily allow for confidence intervals to be placed on the estimates of position. This will ultimately limit the applicability of the shoreline data and subsequent measures of shoreline change. Future work will examine alternate gridding techniques, such as the quadratic loess smoother, which produce error surfaces in addition to the gridded field [Schlax and Chelton, 1992]. The error surface can then be used to place confidence intervals on measures of shoreline and beach volume change derived from these grids.\nThe proper choice of wave height in the parameterization of total swash, S, was explored as a part of this study. The most rigorous comparison between H s (a locally measured significant wave height), H 0 (deep-water equivalent wave height), and H b (breaking wave height) could be completed for the Duck experiments because accurate, daily bathymetry data were available for shoaling the waves and determining an approximate break point. At this site, the dimensional Iribarren-based parameterization for S calculated using H b (\u03c1 2 = 0.46, rmse = 57.9 cm) showed no improvement over the similar swash parameterization calculated using H 0 (\u03c1 2 = 0.46, rmse = 56.4 cm). On the dissipative beaches, where daily offshore bathymetry data were not available, an approximation of H b was made by shoaling H s over the single offshore profile available for each site. On these beaches, H b was found to improve the performance of the regression: the correlation was higher, \u03c1 2 = 0.80 (\u03c1 2 sig = 0.22) than that for the swash parameterization based on H 0 (\u03c1 2 = 0.67). However, because daily profiles were not measured at these sites and the values of H b are approximate, the exact relationship between H b and S cannot be clearly defined here. While H b was not shown to offer a significant improvement over H 0 (at Duck), the question of which measure of wave height is most appropriate for practical use in runup parameterizations remains a relevant one. Because of refraction, frictional dissipation across the shelf [Herbers et al., 2000], and white-capping, the wave height measured at a buoy located in deep water may be significantly higher than that which actually reaches the nearshore, so runup predictions using deep-water buoy measurements may be anomalously high. Analysis at Duck, where wave height measurements are available in deep water, 18 m water depth, and 8 m water depth, shows a somewhat stronger relationship between runup and waves measured at 8 m. While H 0 was used in this analysis as an equal measure of wave height between different sites, in practical applications, it may be preferable to use local wave measurement, reverse shoaled to an equivalent deep-water value. Some researchers have suggested that the slope of the surf zone (\u03b2 sz ) might be more directly related to swash height than \u03b2 f ; therefore, its use in the empirical parameterization would likely improve runup estimates [Holman and Sallenger, 1985;Nielsen and Hanslow, 1991]. To test this idea, \u03b2 sz was substituted in the dimensional, Iribarren-based parameterization for total S. When the entire dataset was used, the correlation of the model (\u03c1 2 = 0.03, \u03c1 2 sig = 0.01) decreased significantly from the similar model calculated using \u03b2 f (\u03c1 2 = 0.68, \u03c1 2 sig = 0.01). The data from Delilah, Duck94, and SandyDuck were examined separately because the detailed, daily bathymetric surveys provided more accurate estimates of \u03b2 sz . Here, the correlation for the model for S using \u03b2 sz was not significantly different than zero showing that, on these beaches, the foreshore slope has more of an influence on swash processes than the surf-zone slope. When dissipative beaches were isolated from the entire dataset and examined separately, the use of estimated \u03b2 sz showed similar predictive capabilities (\u03c1 2 = 0.71, rmse = 20.1 cm) as calculations based on \u03b2 f (\u03c1 2 = 0.67, rmse = 21.3 cm). However, the correlation of the model for swash on dissipative beaches is highest when slope is completely removed from the parameterization (S \u03b1 H 0 L 0 ( ) 1/ 2 , \u03c1 2 = 0.78). In order to explore the effects of \u03b2 SZ on runup more directly, the variations in S were studied as the tide rose and fell over a barred profile at Duck. Since \u03b2 sz is defined between the shoreline and the break point , a significant change in \u03b2 sz is observed under certain wave conditions where breaking occurs on the bar at low tide (gentle \u03b2 sz ) and near the shoreline at high tide (steep \u03b2 sz ). Data runs where these conditions were met were isolated from the larger data set. This While the goal of this work was to present a parameterization for extreme runup that is useful and accurate on a broad spectrum of beaches, it is important to address the errors that occur during dissipative conditions (\u03be 0 < 0.3) when R 2 is estimated using the bulk parameterization (equations 3.10-3.12). Under these extreme end-member conditions, increased dissipation likely becomes a significant term in momentum balances and the parameterization from steeper conditions no longer works. When the dissipative beaches are isolated from the whole data set, the correlation of the parameterization of setup improves (\u03c1 2 = 0.67). Interestingly, when \u03b2 f is removed from the parameterization of setup for dissipative conditions, there is no decrease in the correlation of the model. This suggests that the inclusion of \u03b2 f in this parameterization is not necessary, supporting earlier work which found that shoreline setup on dissipative beaches was not linearly dependent on beach slope [Hanslow and Nielsen, 1993]. The suggested parameterization for setup on dissipative sites, <\u03b7> d (Figure 3.8a), is (\u03c1 2 = 0.68, \u03c1 2 sig = 0.22, rmse = 11.9 cm). On dissipative beaches, frictional dissipation of large waves over extremely wide, low-sloping surf zones begins to play a larger role in shoreline processes. For a given H 0 (and T 0 ), the values of <\u03b7> on a dissipative beach Figure 3.8. Parameterization of (a) setup (\u03c1 = 0.68, rmse = 11.9 cm) and (b) swash (\u03c1 = 0.78, rmse = 15.7 cm) during dissipative conditions only (\u03be < 0.3) using (H L ) . 1/2 For both models, the correlations are equal or higher than when the bulk parameterizations are used for the dissipative conditions subset. will be lower than on a reflective or intermediate beach. (This is seen in Figure 3.5a where the values of <\u03b7> for Terschelling and Agate Beach fall below the below the data cluster and the best-fit line.) Earlier work on setup has shown that <\u03b7> decreases for lower values of \u03b3 [Bowen et al., 1968] and that \u03b3 values are lower on dissipative sites [Bowen et al., 1968] and, particularly, on lower sloping beaches [Sallenger and Holman, 1985]. The behavior of swash under extremely dissipative conditions is also different than during reflective and intermediate conditions. On low-sloping, high-energy beaches, energy in the incident band is saturated and increases in H 0 contribute only to increases in the infragravity band [Guza and Thornton, 1982;Holman and Sallenger, 1985;Ruessink et al., 1998]. This was clearly observed in the swash data when dissipative beaches (\u03be Dissipative beaches (\u03be \u03bf < 0.3) are dominated by infragravity energy (\u03c5 < 1) for 90% of the data. The energy on intermediate beaches is closely split between incident-and infragravity-dominated conditions (47% incident energy). On the reflective beaches (\u03be \u03bf > 1.25), the swash is dominated by incident energy (\u03c5 > 1) for 90% of the data. This shows that shoreline motions on reflective beaches are dominated by energy in the incident band while shoreline motions on dissipative beaches are dominated by energy in the infragravity band, again supporting what has been observed and explained using data collected from single sites [Guza and Thornton, 1982;Holman and Sallenger, 1985]. Because total swash on dissipative beaches, S d , is composed mostly of energy within the infragravity band, it is best parameterized using a form similar to the bulk model describing swash in the infragravity band (equation 3.12). Modeling both the incident and infragravity bands together, (3.17) (Figure 3.8b). The correlation for this dissipative-specific parameterization (\u03c1 2 = 0.78, \u03c1 2 sig = 0.22) is significantly higher than that for the parameterization of S on dissipative beaches which includes \u03b2 f (\u03c1 2 = 0.67). Additionally, the rms error is reduced from 21.3 cm to 15.7 cm when \u03b2 f is removed from the expression. Using a small subset of data from infragravity-dominated Agate Beach, Ruggiero et al [2004] found a slope  [Ruessink et al., 1998;Ruggiero et al., 2001] that swash on highly dissipative beaches should be scaled using wave height alone; however, the correlation for this model is only 0.37 and the rms error is larger (29.5 cm). The model using H 0 L 0 ( ) 1/ 2 has a significantly higher correlation and lower rms error, suggesting that the inclusion of wave period allows for improved predictive capabilities. Based on these dissipative-specific parameterizations and substituting into equation 3.9, runup on sites where \u03be 0 < 0.3 may be calculated as The improved performance of this model is given in Table 3.5. The setup bias for dissipative sites was reduced from -16 cm to 3 cm. The bias and noise for swash for individual dissipative sites were also significantly reduced. The bias decreased from 29 cm to 13 cm while the decreased from 34 cm to 16 cm. The evaluation of the rms S \u2206 estimators across all sites, using the dissipative-specific parameterizations when \u03be 0 < 0.3, is also presented in Table 3.5. The final, general expression for runup on all beaches, based on the entire data set and substituting equations 3.10-3.12 into equation 3.9, is and may be used over the full range of beach conditions. Given the dissipative-specific formulations, it may seem logical for intermediate-and reflective-specific parameterizations as well. However, when conditions where \u03be 0 > 0.3 are considered separately, the coefficients of the setup and incident swash parameterization change less than 0.5% and the coefficient of the infragravity parameterization changes ~2.8%. On reflective beaches (\u03be 0 > 1.25), where swash is dominated by incident energy, the complete expression for runup 2% exceedence elevations (equation 3.19), can be simplified by assuming that the infragravity contribution (the 0.004 term) to total runup is negligible. Here, incident swash and setup have the same parametric dependencies and can be combined, . (3.20) Mean observed values of setup, swash, and runup are presented in the last two rows in order to examine mean error magnitudes relative to observed values. While this simplified form is more convenient for practical applications, the rms error under reflective conditions is 47 cm, larger than that for the full expression (equation 3.19, rmse = 32 cm). Therefore, our final recommendation is the broad use of the full expression (equation 3.19), with an exception (equation 3.18) for extremely dissipative conditions.\nAccuracy assessment of Sallenger's storm-impact scaling model shows that it may be used to reasonably predict the coastal response to hurricanes and to explain part of the spatial variability observed in the magnitudes of shoreline and beach-volume change. However, before practical application of this model for forecasting the likely coastal impact of an approaching hurricane, it is important to address potential reasons for: (1) discrepancies between the predicted and observed storm-impact regime; and (2) the portion of the longshore-variability response not explained by the scaling model. for Floyd may be questionable due to the passage of Bonnie one year prior, particularly in areas of significant dune erosion or overwash. However, the spatially-averaged elevation change of D high and D low showed only 8-cm and 10-cm decreases, respectively, after Bonnie. Additionally, given the sensitivity of runup to beach slope, the use of the 1997 survey for measuring the pre-Floyd slope for input into the runup parameterization may also have produced errors if there were lasting changes to slope following Bonnie. However, within the swash regime there were minimal changes to mean beach slope following Bonnie. At overwash locations the mean beach slope was observed to recover one year following Floyd, as the profile began to readjust to its pre-storm shape despite an overall inland migration of the island (Table 4.4). Therefore, the 1997 topography survey proved to be appropriate for determining both the relevant mean beach slope and dune elevations for both hurricanes. Errors in the prediction may also be caused by incorrect measures of the storminduced, extreme water levels, R high . Accurate predictions of impact regime depend on how well the magnitudes and full spatial-variability of R high can be resolved for each storm. First errors in R high may arise from modeled waves and storm surge, which are required for using the storm-scaling model in a predictive mode. The size of the model grid spacing and inaccuracies of model input, including wind fields and offshore bathymetry, limit the ability to resolve the full spatial variability of R high . Incorporating observations into the estimates of the total, hurricane-induced water level may provide predictions that are more representative of the actual storm conditions. Additionally, errors in the predicted regime may be due to the use of the extremevalue runup statistic, R 2 , to represent the wave-driven processes and to define the threshold between regimes. This statistic represents the elevation exceeded by wave runup 2% of the time (for 10-second wave, this would equate to seven waves per hour), which may be too infrequent to cause measurable dune erosion or overwash. Consequently, the use of this statistic may result in the overprediction of the impact regime. Further research is needed to determine precisely which statistic of runup (i.e. mean, significant, etc.) serves as the best proxy for measurable dune erosion and/or landward sediment transport. A final reason for potential errors in the prediction of storm-impact regime is that a time-dependent process (profile evolution during a storm) is examined using a non-timedependent model (R high /D high ). Timestacks of storm-induced water levels and the predicted impact regime show that most areas of the coast entered the collision regime hours before the storms' landfalls (Figure 4.6). Dune erosion in the early stages of the storm, and subsequent dune collapse, may lower dune elevation in some locations making them more prone to overwash. This type of error was less likely in this study because vertical dune changes after Bonnie were small (O(cm), see above). Alternatively, changes in the mean beach slope (flattening or steepening) throughout the course of the storm (Table 4.4) will have a corresponding effect on R 2 , decreasing or increasing the modeled elevation, respectively (equation 3), thereby changing this area's vulnerability to dune erosion or overwash. The scaling model presented here provides a bulk estimate of the potential coastal response to hurricanes, identifying areas that may be more vulnerable to large magnitudes of shoreline and volume change. To fully capture the evolution of the profile throughout the duration of the storm, detailed modeling of the profile's timedependent response to increasing waves and surge is required [Fauver, 2005]. In addition to understanding the nature of prediction errors, it is also important to address the observed spatial patterns in hurricane-induced shoreline and beach-volume change that were not explained within the framework of the storm-impact scaling model. For example, the overwash regime was shown to have greater magnitudes of change than the other regimes; however, significant shoreline-change variability was present within this single impact regime. On Masonboro Island, where the entire length of the island overwashed, the standard deviation of \u03b4x sl was 5.7 m after Bonnie and 10.0 m after Floyd (Figure 4.8). Based on the observation that the magnitude of shoreline change was larger within the overwash regime, it was hypothesized that the amount of change within this regime might then scale with the height of R high above the berm crest (R high -D high ). The correlation, \u03c1, between \u03b4x sl and (R high -D high ) was 0.41 for Bonnie and 0.38 for Floyd (95% significance level, \u03c1 sig , = 0.12). Since the elevation of D high did not change significantly along the length of the island (D high = 2.17 \u00b1 0.29 m, see Figure 4.5), the relationship can be simplified to a correlation between \u03b4x sl and R high . Because wave height was also relatively constant along this island, the variability in the predicted R high signal was dominated by spatial patterns in mean beach slope (Table 4.4). Therefore, the correlation was ultimately reduced to show a relationship between \u03b4x sl and \u03b2 m (Bonnie, \u03c1 = 0.32; Floyd, \u03c1 = 0.38). The positive correlation indicates that more shoreline change was observed in locations where beach slopes were steeper and the corresponding runup elevation was higher. Much of the spatial variability of shoreline change can be tied to the large-scale trend in beach slope along the island (\u00b5\u03b2 m = 0.062, \u03c3\u03b2 m = 0.02). At the southern end of Masonboro Island, beach slopes were steeper, predicted runup was higher, and more coastal change was observed. Variance partitioning of the slope and shoreline change signals into 100-m bins revealed that the majority of the variance was contained in the alongshore trend: 20.7% of the total \u03b2 m variance and 18.3% and 41.7% of the total \u03b4x sl variance, for Bonnie and Floyd respectively. Wavenumber analysis of \u03b4x sl revealed a minor peak at L = 755m; however significant correlations with \u03b2 m , beach width, or R high were not identified to help explain observed periodicity at this scale. A peak at L = 755 m was present in the spectra for the 1997, 1998, and 1999 shoreline positions indicating that part of the variance of the shoreline change signal was related to the pre-existing shape of the shoreline position. Unexplained variance within the overwash regime may also be related to time evolution of the profile and transition to the inundation regime. During Bonnie, R high was greater than the elevation of D high along Masonboro Island for seven hours, from four hours before the maximum predicted water levels until the end of the model run. During Floyd, the modeled elevation of R high was higher than the berm for least 15 hours prior to landfall. At the time of maximum R high during Bonnie and Floyd, water levels were predicted to be 1.7 m and 2.0 m above the elevation of the berm. It is likely that at some point during these storms, portions of the Masonboro Island were completely submerged. Within the inundation regime, processes of sediment transport are different than transport due to swash processes. Under these extreme conditions, cross-island flows (both winddriven and due to pressure gradients related to storm surge) dominate the fluid processes, and parameters defining swash processes are no longer expected to scale with resulting coastal change. In order to quantify the amount of coastal change associated with the inundation regime, it is first necessary to determine objective criteria for identifying this regime using post-storm topography surveys. Then, change specific to locations where the island is completely subaqueous may be isolated from that within the overwash regime. Finally, because the storm-impact scaling model assumes that cross-shore processes are dominant, unexplained spatial patterns in shoreline and beach-volume change may be the result of longshore fluid processes. The relative importance of longshore processes during Hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd was considered by calculating longshore sediment transport due to oblique wave approach using the energy flux model [Komar, 1998]. Immersed weight transport was calculated for all time steps of the modeled wave climates and then integrated over the duration of the storm to determine the bulk transport for each hurricane. Gradients in transport were converted to horizontal change in shoreline position using the sediment continuity equation, dx/dt = -(dQ/dy)/d, where d is the depth of the active profile [Rosati et al., 2003]. The correlation between observed shoreline change and that due to gradients in longshore transport was not significant for either hurricane, indicating that longshore transport gradients, as predicted with this simple modeling approach, were not a major contributor to the observed hurricaneinduced coastal change during Bonnie and Floyd."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "An objective technique has been developed for the extraction of accurate and detailed shoreline position from ATM laser data. The data from one ATM flight can provide estimates of shoreline position spaced as closely as several meters in the longshore and over large expanses (hundreds of kilometers) of coastline. While the extensive record length of historic topographic maps and aerial photographs provides a rich data set for measuring long term shoreline change, the precision and accuracy of the lidar shorelines allow for more reliable measurement of shoreline change over shorter time periods. Lidar shorelines can be also used to establish more accurate shoreline positions for future monitoring of long-term shoreline trends. Lidar profiles are extracted from the full three dimensional data set and a linear regression is fit to the data points within a specified range about the vertical shoreline elevation. The function is evaluated at the vertical datum to determine the cross-shore location of shoreline position. Foreshore beach slope is measured directly from the linear fit. Error bars on shoreline position represent the 95% confidence interval on each estimate based on the Student's t distribution of the errors of the regression. The accuracy of the lidar-derived shoreline was tested by comparing it to a shoreline measured using ground-based GPS techniques. The ground-based SWASH method and air-based ATM method agree closely with an rms difference of 2.9 m (1.49 m excluding a GPS drift). The longshore-averaged horizontal error bar for shorelines extracted from lidar data was \u00b1 1.4 m for the Outer Banks and \u00b1 1.1 m for Assateague Island. To illustrate the power of this technique, lidar-derived shorelines were used to assess large-scale coastal change after the winter's northeaster storms along Assateague Island. After the storms, the mean shoreline change along the 60 km stretch was -28.6 \u00b1 0.02 m with a large degree of alongshore variability, \u03c3(\u2206x s ) , = 16.2 m. Shorelines measured from a survey collected after a two-month recovery period reveal 13.5 \u00b1 0.02 m of accretion (\u03c3(\u2206x s ) = 11.0 m). The longshore variability and distribution of beach slopes are also revealed in the lidar data. The technique showed that the mean beach slope decreased from 0.13 to 0.054 over the study area. The beach was shown to start recovering from the winter's storms as the distribution of beach slope became increasingly Gaussian and the mean value increased from 0.054 to 0.08. Using the lidarderived shorelines, the longshore variability in the large-scale response of the coastline to storms can be accurately quantified which may lead to a more complete understanding of large-scale coastal processes.\nThe longshore-variable coastal response to Hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd was examined within the framework of a storm-impact scaling model, which defines four levels of coastal response based on the relative elevations of storm-induced water levels and those of the dune or berm. Because fluid observations were not available along the coast, the hurricane wave field and storm surge at the shoreline were modeled using observed wind grids for each storm. R high , the hurricane-induced total water level, was defined along the coast using longshore-variable tide, surge, and empirically-defined wave runup. Storm surge and runup each accounted for ~48% (averaged over both storms) of the R high signal, indicating that, in these storms, wave-driven processes may be equally as important as surge to the maximum, total water level attained during hurricanes. The elevation of the dune or berm was measured from lidar topographic surveys. The impact regime for both hurricanes was hindcast every 20 m along a 50-km stretch of coast. The coastal response to each storm was objectively defined along the coast as swash, collision, or overwash based on quantitative measures of coastal change. Comparisons of the estimated and observed storm response indicate that Sallenger's model is a reasonable predictor of hurricane-impact regime, based on an accuracy of 55.4%, which is a significant improvement over the accuracy associated with random chance (33.3%). The accuracy, as defined by model sensitivity, varied widely between regimes. In the overwash regime, the combined accuracy for both storms was 87.0%. The mean accuracy for the collision and swash regimes, averaged over both Bonnie and Floyd, was 55.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Errors in the predictions were overwhelmingly due to overestimates of storm response. Discrepancies between the expected and observed regime may be due to misclassification of the observed regime, an inaccurate representation of the water levels defining the threshold between regimes (due to either errors in the modeling of hurricane waves and surge or in the statistical representation of the runup elevation relevant to dune erosion and overwash), or the timeevolution of the beach profile during the storm. The magnitude of shoreline and beach-volume change varied between impact regimes leading to a spatially-variable storm response on stretches of coast where a mix of regimes was observed. The magnitudes of shoreline and volume change in the overwash regime were twice as large as that measured in the swash regime for Hurricane Bonnie. The differences were even more pronounced after Hurricane Floyd when the magnitudes of change were four times greater within the overwash regime. Not only was the magnitude of beach-volume change larger within the overwash regime, the change was also observed to be more permanent. Beach volume change calculated between the prestorm survey and one collected a year after Floyd made landfall showed no recovery. In this regime, mean beach volume change was -39.8 m 3 /m; however, overwash deposit volumes were nearly the same. This resulted in a net volume change near zero indicating that sand was transported across the island and deposited inland, making it unavailable to calm weather waves that typically bring sand back to the beach. The inland transport of sand also tended to flatten the mean beach slope within the overwash regime, while beaches in the swash regime were observed to steepen. Additional longshore-variability of coastal change within the overwash regime was shown to be related to large-scale variability in beach slope along a single island. Areas with steeper slopes had correspondingly higher runup elevations and experienced more shoreline change during the hurricanes. Gradients in longshore transport, integrated over the duration of each storm, did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed patterns of hurricaneinduced shoreline change. 4.8"}, {"section_title": "2.7", "text": "thank A.

Runup, the height of discrete water-level maxima, depends on two dynamically different processes; time-averaged wave setup and total swash excursion, each of which is parameterized separately. Setup at the shoreline was best parameterized using a dimensional form of the more common Iribarren-based setup expression that includes foreshore beach slope, offshore wave height, and deep-water wavelength. Significant swash can be decomposed into the incident and infragravity frequency bands. Incident swash is also best parameterized using a dimensional form of the Iribarren-based expression. Infragravity swash is best modeled dimensionally using offshore wave height and wavelength and shows no statistically significant linear dependence on either foreshore or surf-zone slope. On infragravity-dominated dissipative beaches, the magnitudes of both setup and swash, modeling both incident and infragravity frequency components together, are dependent only on the offshore wave height and wavelength. Statistics of predicted runup averaged over all sites indicate a -17 cm bias and an rms error of 38 cm; the mean observed runup elevation for all experiments was 144 cm. On intermediate and reflective beaches with complex foreshore topography, the use of an alongshore-averaged beach slope in practical applications of the runup parameterization may result in a relative runup error equal to 51% of the fractional variability between the measured and the averaged slope.\nThe vulnerability of a beach to extreme coastal change during a hurricane can be The model not only allows for prediction of the general coastal response to storms, but also provides a framework for examining the longshore-variable magnitudes of observed coastal change. For Hurricane Bonnie, shoreline and beach-volume changes within locations that experienced overwash or dune erosion were two times greater than locations where wave runup was confined to the foreshore. During Hurricane Floyd, this pattern became more pronounced as magnitudes of change were four times greater within the overwash regime. Comparisons of pre-storm topography to a calm weather survey collected one year after Hurricane Floyd's landfall show long-term beach volume loss at overwash locations. Here, the volume of sand eroded from the beach was balanced by the volume of overwash deposits, indicating that the majority of the sand removed from the beach was transported landward across the island rather than being transported offshore. In overwash locations, sand was removed from the nearshore system and unavailable for later beach recovery, resulting in a more permanent response than observed within the other regimes. These results support the predictive capabilities of the storm scaling model and illustrate that the impact regimes provide a framework for explaining the longshore-variable coastal response to hurricanes."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "When ocean waves approach a coast, the majority of wave energy is dissipated across the surf zone by wave breaking. However, a portion of that energy is converted to potential energy in the form of runup on the foreshore of the beach [Hunt, 1959]. This wave runup is important because it deliver much of the energy responsible for dune and beach erosion [Ruggiero et al., 2001;Sallenger, 2000]. Thus, understanding the magnitude and longshore variability of extreme runup is critical to accurate prediction of the impacts on protective dunes and adjacent properties. The goal of this work is to devise a simple parameterization for maximum runup elevation, improving upon an earlier empirical formula for wave runup by Holman [1986]. These elevations, in turn, can be used as input into a storm-impact model [Sallenger, 2000]. In the discussion below, it will be apparent that wave height, H, deep-water wave length, L 0 , wave period, T, and beach steepness, \u03b2, form a commonly-accepted environmental parameter set. Of these, deep-water wavelength and period are assumed to be interdependent, linked by the linear dispersion relationship, The three independent parameters may provide a first-order description of a beach environment and are often expressed in terms of a non-dimensional surf similarity parameter, the Iribarren Number [Battjes, 1974], The Iribarren Number can be interpreted as a dynamic beach steepness, comparing the beach slope to the square root of deep-water wave steepness. In early laboratory experiments of monochromatic waves on planar beaches, all quantities were well defined. However, application of this scaling to natural beaches introduces several complications. For random waves, both wave period and wave height become statistical measures, often described by the peak period, T p , and the root mean square (rms) or significant wave height, H rms or H s , (defined as 2.8 and 4 times the standard deviation of the time series of sea-surface elevation, respectively). Additionally, wave-height measures can be expressed in deep water (H 0 ), at the break point (H b ), or locally. Definition of a single beach slope becomes difficult on natural beaches with typically concave profiles and is further complicated by the common presence of offshore sandbars. Estimation of runup statistics under these complicated conditions may be handled by appropriate numerical models along with knowledge of boundary conditions [Raubenheimer and Guza, 1996;Raubenheimer et al., 1995] such as the directional wave spectra and bottom bathymetry. However, such an approach is incompatible with most applications because the details of the offshore profile and incident spectra are not always available. Therefore, we will investigate the degree to which simple parameterizations provide useful predictions of extreme runup on natural beaches.\nExtreme storms and hurricanes play a dominant role in shaping the beaches of the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States. Superimposed upon the general large-scale mean response of the coast to hurricanes is significant spatial variability; within the storm-impact zone, some areas may experience severe dune erosion and overwash while adjacent areas may appear unaffected. Understanding how the coast responds to storms is critical to safe and responsible coastal planning and management. In order to accurately predict the coastal response to large storms, quantification and characterization of the impact of these storms on barrier islands is required. This includes determining the scales of variability in coastal change, the magnitude of change at these scales, and the processes responsible for the observed variability. Previous studies have suggested a number of possible reasons for a longshorevariable storm response. In some areas, framework geology plays a role in controlling sediment availability thereby limiting a beach's recovery after large wave events [Cleary et al., 1999;Riggs et al., 1995;Thieler et al., 1995]. Some researchers suggest that some variations in erosion rates may be due to non-linear feedback between highly oblique incident waves and the orientation of the shoreline [Ashton et al., 2003]. There is also evidence that erosional hotspots may be associated with the presence or absence of offshore sand bars. Initial results show a correlation between the presence of an erosional hotspot and the lack of multiple sand bars; however, a causative relationship has not yet been established [Kannan et al., 2003]. On some beaches the longshore variations in erosion during storms have been shown to relate to the presence of rip current channels and embayments that allow storm waves to propagate closer to shore before breaking [Komar, 1983;Komar and Rea, 1976]. Another possible explanation for the variance observed in a beach's response to storms may be due to the combined effects of longshore-variable morphology of the beach and dune relative to the intensity of the ocean's forcing. These two ideas are merged through a simple model that defines four storm-impact regimes based on the relative relationship between the elevation of a sand dune or beach berm and that of storm-induced water levels, defined as the sum of astronomical tide, storm surge and wave runup [Sallenger, 2000]. During storms increased water levels shift runup and the location of wave attack higher on the profile, making berms and dunes more vulnerable to erosion and over-topping. In this storm-impact scaling model, the borders between the impact regimes represent thresholds across which the magnitudes and processes of coastal change are substantially different [Sallenger, 2000]. determine to what extent the processes specific to each regime contribute to the total longshore variability of coastal change. Finally we discuss reasons for prediction errors as well as possible reasons for spatial variability that were not accounted for using Sallenger's model (2000)."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Runup, R(y, t i ), is defined here as the set of discrete water-level elevation maxima Setup, the super-elevation of the mean water level, is driven by the cross-shore gradient in radiation stress that results from wave breaking [Longuet-Higgins and Stewart, 1963;Longuet-Higgins and Stewart, 1964]. The relationships between setup and environmental conditions, and resulting expressions for setup at the shoreline, have been the topic of many research studies. Bowen et al. [1968] derived a simplified expression for setup by assuming normally incident shallow-water waves whose heights within the surf zone were limited to a constant fraction of the local water depth, \u03b3 = H/h."}, {"section_title": "The resulting expression is", "text": "where H b is the breaking wave height. Measured setup values were found to be greater than that predicted by theory due to the asymptotic approach of setup to the beach surface [Bowen et al., 1968]. Examining data from gently sloping beaches of southern California, Guza and Thornton [1981] found <\u03b7> to be proportional to the significant wave height (10-m depth), H s , with a constant of proportionality equal to 0.17. In contrast, analysis of data from the steeper beach in Duck, NC [Holman and Sallenger, 1985] showed that a direct correlation between setup and wave height was highly scattered and that non-dimensional setup (normalized by offshore wave height) scaled better with the Iribarren number, \u03be 0 . The Guza and Thornton [1981] data were found to be consistent with the Holman and Sallenger [1985] relationship at low Iribarren numbers. While the Holman and Sallenger [1985] relationship between \u03be 0 and <\u03b7> significantly reduced the scatter in the data, there remained a tidal dependence. The relationship failed during the lowest tides when waves significantly dissipated over an offshore sandbar. Using observations of setup on beaches in Australia, Hanslow and Nielsen [1993] found that the maximum setup on dissipative beaches showed no dependence on beach slope and, therefore, could not be scaled with \u03be 0 . Swash, S, is generally defined as the time-varying location of the intersection between the ocean and the beach. According to Miche [1951], monochromatic waves are composed of two parts: a progressive component whose energy is dissipated during wave breaking and a standing, reflected component that has its maximum at the shoreline. Swash represents this standing component whose amplitude cannot exceed some critical value that is dependent on both \u03b2 and T 0 . Early studies on swash and runup were conducted in laboratories in order to determine the impacts of waves on structures. Based on Miche's ideas, Hunt [1959] stated that there is a critical wave steepness below which wave energy will be totally reflected by a beach with a planar slope. Under surging wave conditions there is little dissipation of wave energy across the beach slope, and the majority of the energy is reflected on the steep beach slope [Hunt, 1959]. For the more common situation of breaking waves, energy is dissipated across the surf zone. Using a critical value based on wave steepness and \u03b2 [Iribarren and Nogales, 1949], which defines a threshold between breaking and non-breaking conditions, Hunt [1959] proposed an empirical formulation for vertical wave up-rush, R, that can be re-written in terms of \u03be, where Hunt assumes that H \u2248 H 0, and K is a constant. Using field data collected from Duck, NC, Holman [1986] found a clear relationship between 2% exceedence value of runup, R 2 , normalized by H s (in 18-m depth) and \u03be 0 , which includes a linear dependence on the foreshore beach slope, \u03b2 f . For experiments on natural beaches, wave breaking over offshore sandbars can significantly attenuate offshore waves. Thus, coefficients from data gathered during a single experiment (such as in equation 3.5) may vary with sand-bar configuration and profile shape, introducing significant noise into empirical relationships. Baldock and Holmes [1999] found in numerical simulations that incident band swash saturation was related to bore-driven swash, which also scales with wave period and beach slope. The relationship between \u03be 0 and the distribution of runup was examined on a wider range of Iribarren space by Nielsen & Hanslow [1991]. They found that the vertical scaling for runup distributions was proportional to \u03be 0 for steep beaches, further supporting the original formulation of Hunt [1959], equation 3.4, and the empirical formulation of Holman [1986], equation 3.5. However, for beaches with \u03b2 < 0.1, they suggest that the dimensional vertical scaling of runup distributions may be independent of beach slope and proportional to (H 0 L 0 ) 1/2 [Nielsen and Hanslow, 1991]. The behavior of swash on a highly dissipative beach (\u03be 0 < 0.25, \u03b2 < 0.02) was studied by Ruessink et al. [1998] who found that the swash signal was dominated by energy in the infragravity band (frequencies, f, < 0.05 Hz) and scaled with H 0 . Ruggiero et al. [2001] also studied runup under highly dissipative conditions and found that the elevation of R 2 scaled best with H 0 and with \u03b2 1/2 , rather than \u03b2 as implied by relationships between runup and \u03be 0 . Several studies have examined the relative roles of infragravity and incident (f > 0.05 Hz) band swash (S IG and S inc , respectively) for particular field sites. Guza and Thornton [1982] showed that infragravity swash height increases linearly with offshore significant wave height, while energy in the incident band becomes saturated due to dissipation across the surf zone. This linear dependence of S IG on H 0 has been confirmed by several other studies [Holman and Bowen, 1984;Howd et al., 1991;Raubenheimer and Guza, 1996]; however, the constants of proportionality were found to vary between sites and with the wave and beach conditions present during each experiment. Howd et al. [1991] examined the relationship between infragravity motions at the shoreline and offshore wave height at a number of field sites and found their ratio to be dependent on \u03be 0 : larger constants of proportionality between infragravity motions and wave heights were observed on beaches with larger \u03be 0 values. Ruessink et al. [1998] noted that the literature presents a wide range of constants of proportionality for the ratio S IG /H 0 , particularly between dissipative and reflective beaches, also suggesting that the ratio may depend on Based on the previous studies described above, we propose the following general relationship for the elevation of extreme (2%) runup, R 2 , for any data run: , and (3.7) where T 0 is the deep-water wave period. The specific goal of this work is to improve the predictive equation for runup on natural beaches by extending Holman's original analysis [1986] to data sets from 10 experiments representing a wide variety of beach and wave conditions and by separately parameterizing the individual runup processes: setup and swash. In the next section we describe our methods including details of the runup and swash statistics, the environmental parameters measured at each site, and the specific field experiments. Next, we present the results of our analysis, showing the parameterization of setup, incident swash, and infragravity swash, and evaluate the performance of the empirical parameterizations. The consequences of a longshore variable-topography on the parameterizations are also examined. In the discussion section, the use of breaking wave height and surf zone slope in the model, as alternatives to H 0 and \u03b2 f , is evaluated. Finally, improved parameterizations for setup and swash under dissipative conditions are presented."}, {"section_title": "Runup Measurement Technique and Statistics", "text": "All runup data in this study were collected using optical techniques developed in the Coastal Imaging Lab at Oregon State University and previously tested extensively against in-situ runup instruments [Holland et al., 1995;Holman and Guza, 1984]. Holman and Sallenger [1985] discussed the difficulties with digitizing faint downwash, particularly on very low-sloping beaches. While variations in digitization can introduce noise in swash and setup statistics, Holman and Sallenger showed that they did so in a way that cancelled when runup peak elevations were found; slight lows in swash height were balanced by highs in set-up, and visa-versa. Other errors associated with video runup measurements are discussed in detail by Holman and Guza [1984] and Holland et al [1995]. The video pixel resolution, dependent on the field of view of the camera, the height of the camera, and the distance to the observed ground location [Holland et al., 1997], was typically 5 -15 cm in the vertical with corresponding horizontal resolutions of 20 -80 cm. Cross-shore transects of pixel intensity (example from Duck, NC, Figure 3.2a) were sampled at 1 or 2 Hz over 17-to 120-min record lengths, depending on the site. This created timestacks of pixel intensity on which runup and rundown can be seen as a white edge moving back and forth in the swash zone ( Figure 3.2b). The leading edge of runup was digitized from cross-shore timestacks of pixel intensity and then, using published photogrammetric relationships [Holland et al., 1997] The cross-shore transect in (a) indicates the location of a single runup array. In the 120-second timestack of pixel intensity (b), each horizontal slice is the spatial variability of intensity at a single time step. The leading edge of swash is digitized through time (heavy, white line) and then converted into a time series of water-level elevations. similar to the calculation of significant wave height [Guza and Thornton, 1980]. The significant swash in the incident (distinction based on wave frequency, f > 0.05 Hz, and not on direction of propagation) and infragravity (f < 0.05 Hz) bands were calculated by summing only over frequencies within the specified limits. Runup statistics, R, were defined as the elevation of individual water-level maxima above the still-water level (Figure 3.1a), merging contributions from setup and swash (equation 3.6). The 2% exceedence value for runup, R 2 , was calculated from the cumulative probability density function of runup elevations (Figure 3.1c). This statistic, which represents the value of R that will be exceeded 2% of the time, is often used in engineering applications [Holman, 1986] and may be important for use in scaling the impacts of severe storms on beaches [Ruggiero et al., 2001]."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Parameters", "text": "To make comparisons between sites where wave heights were measured in water depths varying between 7 and 20 m, an effective deep-water significant wave height, H 0 , was calculated. To estimate H 0 during each water-level time series, measurements of significant wave height from local buoys and instrument arrays, H s , were reverse shoaled to deep water using linear wave theory assuming a shore-normal approach. While this procedure neglects local generation, friction, white-capping, refraction, and diffraction, it allows for inter-comparisons of deep-water equivalent wave heights between different field sites. Breaking wave height, H b , was calculated by shoaling H s over local bathymetry using Thornton and Guza's [1983] wave transformation model, with the limiting ratio \u03b3 = H rms /h equal to 0.42 [Thornton and Guza, 1982] and the bore dissipation coefficient, B, equal to 1.0. While B was not tuned due to lack of appropriate field observations at each site, model error has been shown to be less than 10% when B is within 25% of its optimal value [Thornton and Guza, 1983]. H b was defined as the wave height occurring at the onset of wave breaking, identified as the seaward-most location where dissipation exceeded 20 W/m 2 . Alternatively, the cross-shore location of breaking and H b may be defined by the percent of waves breaking. For each water-level time series, \u03b2 f was defined as the average slope over a region \u00b12\u03c3 around <\u03b7>, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the continuous water level record, \u03b7(t). Surf zone slope, \u03b2 sz , is also considered here and was defined for each timestack as the slope between the mean shoreline (the cross-shore position of <\u03b7>), x sl , and the cross-shore location of wave breaking, x b . On barred profiles, the magnitude of \u03b2 sz may change significantly over the course of a day as the break point shifts from the sandbar at low tide toward the shoreline at high tide. These cases will be of special interest when trying to isolate the relative importance of foreshore and surf-zone slope."}, {"section_title": "Field Experiments", "text": "Swash and runup data from 10 field experiments were compiled for this study: Duck, North Carolina, USA (1982,1990,1994,1997); Scripps Beach, California, USA (1989); San Onofre, California, USA (1993); Terschelling, the Netherlands (1994,1994); Gleneden, Oregon, USA (1994); and Agate Beach, Oregon, USA (1996). Table 3 Wright and Short [1983], 0.3 < \u03be 0 < 4.0). The typical profile at Duck is characterized by an offshore sandbar and a mean foreshore slope of 0.1. H s and T 0 were recorded hourly with a Waverider buoy located in ~18 m of water. Tide level was measured every 6 min at a NOAA tide gauge mounted at the end of the FRF pier. Bathymetry was sampled roughly daily during the Duck experiments in 1990, 1994, and  [Birkemeier and Mason, 1984]. Additional high-resolution foreshore topographic surveys were usually collected daily during all experiments. During Duck82 (1982), runup was digitized from 35-min time-lapse photography along selected longshore locations [Holman, 1986] following methods outlined in Holman and Guza [1984], resulting in 149 estimates of runup and swash statistics. The runup array during the Delilah experiment (1990) consisted of 26 longshore lines with a longshore spacing, dy, of 10 m, sampled at 2 Hz [Holland and Holman, 1993]. During the Duck94 experiment (1994), 120-min runup timestacks were collected at up to 48 equally spaced (dy = 5 m) cross-shore lines [Holland and Holman, 1996]. The runup array from SandyDuck (1997) consisted of five cross-shore transects from which approximately 500 17-min swash timestacks were collected.   [Holland et al., 1995]. Offshore bathymetry was not measured on a daily basis and was approximated offshore of the 1-m depth contour using an offshore slope of 0.01 [Holland et al., 1995]. Wave height and period were measured every 6 hours in 7 m water depth, a few hundred meters offshore, as a part of the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) [Seymour et al., 1985]. Six 8-Hz data runs were collected over the course of the experiment [Holland et al., 1995]. A more reflective data set was collected during a October 1993 experiment in San Onofre, CA. The offshore slope was measured to be 0.013 from a cross-shore profile, surveyed early in the experiment (October 10, 1993)  Data from two beaches dominated by dissipative conditions (\u03be 0 < 0.3) are also included in the data set, providing a small (5.3% of the total data) but important extension into highly dissipative domains. Two data sets were collected from Terschelling, the Netherlands, in April and October 1994 by Ruessink et al. [1998]. Terschelling features multiple offshore sandbars with offshore slopes generally 0.005 or less, as measured from a single offshore bathymetry profile. Daily beach surveys were conducted and an alongshore-averaged foreshore slope was calculated for the analysis of runup statistics at seven cross-shore transects [Ruessink et al., 1998]. H s , as measured by an offshore buoy located approximately 5 km offshore in 15 m water depth, ranged from 0.5 m to almost 4 m. 45-minute runup timestacks were collected at 2 Hz along nine cross-shore lines once a day. Because the only beach slope available for this site was an alongshore-averaged foreshore slope, the runup and swash statistics computed at each cross-shore line were alongshore averaged before being compared in bulk to the other sites. (Runup statistics were fairly longshore uniform during each data run. Over the duration of the experiment, the mean and standard deviation, \u00b5\u00b1\u03c3, of longshore-variable swash and setup were 69\u00b18 cm and 16\u00b15 cm, respectively.) The second dissipative site is Agate Beach, OR, a multiple-barred, low-sloping beach where runup data were collected in February 1996 as a part of a larger experiment on the nearshore dynamics of high-energy beaches [Ruggiero et al., 2001]. Foreshore slopes were measured daily using GPS topographic surveys. Offshore survey data were not available for this experiment; however, a typical offshore slope was measured from surveys collected in 1998 to be ~0.01. Wave height and period were obtained from a CDIP buoy located approximately 170 km to the southwest in 64 m water depth. Measured tides were taken from a NOAA gauge located at Yaquina Bay, OR, approximately 8 km from Agate Beach. 120-min runup timestacks were collected at 1 Hz at five cross-shore transects."}, {"section_title": "Setup", "text": "No single constant of proportionality between <\u03b7> and H 0 was found (\u03c1 2 = 0.30, rmse = 25.3 cm; Figure 3.5a).

For the mid-and high-tide values, the correlation remained high, \u03c1 2 = 0.52 ( Figure   3.6b). It was suggested by Holman and Sallenger [1985] that offshore morphology and surf-zone slope play a larger role in <\u03b7> at low tide, with breaking patterns over barred topographies producing more complex patterns in radiation stress gradients [Raubenheimer et al., 2001].

Extreme runup is defined as the sum of setup and half of the total swash excursion (equations 3.6 and 3.9). Empirical formulations for each of the components have been developed using carefully defined water-level, wave, and topography statistics from 10 field experiments spanning a wide range of environmental conditions. This data set represents a major expansion on the range of conditions for which empirical relationships have been tested.

Dimensional incident swash scales with foreshore beach slope, offshore wave height, and offshore wavelength (equation 3.11, \u03c1 2 = 0.44, rmse = 46.9 cm). Dimensional infragravity swash also scaled well with \u03b2(H 0 L 0 ) 1/2 ; however, when foreshore slope was removed from the equation, the correlation of the model improved (equation 3.12, \u03c1 2 = 0.65, rmse = 25.7 cm). Additionally, the use of the surf-zone slope, defined as the average slope from the break point to the mean swash location, in the parameterization offered no significant improvements, even on days when wave breaking was occurring on the sandbar. The above relationships for setup and swash show large biases under the extreme dissipative conditions of two of the field sites, perhaps reflecting the increasing role of bottom friction on very wide surf zones in the dynamic balances. For Iribarren numbers less than 0.3, setup was best parameterized using only offshore wave conditions (equation 3.16, \u03c1 2 = 0.68, rmse = 11.9 cm). Similarly, the total swash, merging both frequency bands, was best parameterized using only offshore wave height and wavelength (equation 3.17, \u03c1 2 = 0.78, rmse = 15.7 cm).

The longshore variability of runup was examined during the Delilah, Duck94, and SandyDuck experiments where runup data were collected over extensive longshore arrays. On days when foreshore slope was longshore variable, runup, in particular incident band swash, was also spatially variable. Differences between longshore observed runup and runup predictions made using a single longshore-averaged foreshore slope may be as much as 38% when the foreshore topography is highly three-dimensional (for example, within a megacusp field).

The storm exceeded a maximum surface wind speed of 51 m/s (100 knots) for 72 hours prior to landfall [Avila, 1998] [Pasch et al., 1999]. Approximately 1.5 hrs after landfall, NOAA station FPSN7 recorded a maximum significant wave height of 9.21 m (T 0 = 14.3 s). Floyd was a fast moving storm as it neared the coast; therefore, significant wave heights exceeded 6 m for only 17 hrs prior to landfall. The focus of this research is on the impacts of these two hurricanes along a 50-km stretch of barrier islands in Onslow Bay, North Carolina, from Masonboro Island to Topsail Island (Figure 4.1). Onslow Bay, located between Capes Fear and Lookout, is a wave-dominated environment (mean tide range = 1 m) with a broad and shallow continental shelf [Thieler et al., 1995]. The shoreline orientation of these islands changes dramatically in this region, trending approximately 24\u00b0 (clockwise from north) along Masonboro Island and becoming more NE-SW oriented along Topsail Island (~56\u00b0). Major wave events in this area are associated with northeaster storms during the winter months and hurricanes in the summer. A net southerly longshore drift has resulted in accretionary spits located on the southern end of many of the islands [Thieler et al., 1995]. Both developed and undeveloped beaches are present along this stretch of coast. Wrightsville Beach is maintained by regular nourishment projects while other beaches are supplemented with sand from local dredging projects [Rogers, 2000]. Areas that had been impacted by nourishment projects during the study period (Wrightsville Beach, Figure Eight Island, and the northern portion of Masonboro Island) were eliminated from analysis as the measured, hurricane-induced coastal change signal was likely contaminated by the addition of sand at these locations. Inlets, both natural and engineered, play a large role in the morphodynamics of this area [Cleary et al., 2003]. Dramatic coastal change occurring in close proximity to the inlets (~1 km) was not considered in this study because the frequency of beach morphology surveys was not sufficient to differentiate hurricane-induced coastal changes from those due to inlet dynamics. Results are limited to continuous stretches of beach along Masonboro, Hutaff, and Topsail Islands (Figure 4.1).

R low , an approximate storm-induced mean water level, is defined as the sum of storm surge, astronomical tide, and wave setup, the super-elevation of the still water level due to the presence of waves (Figure 4.2). This is a slightly different formulation than that of Sallenger [2000], which defined R low using the elevation of the seaward limit of swash. R high represents the highest elevation of the landward margin of swash relative to a fixed vertical datum. This measure includes the combined effects of astronomical tides, storm surge, and the 2% exceedence level for vertical wave runup, including both setup and swash [Ruggiero et al., 2001;Sallenger, 2000]. D high is the elevation of a beach's first line of defense against storm waves, either the elevation of the dune crest or, in the absence of a dune, the beach berm (Figure 4.2). D low is the elevation of the toe of the dune. By considering how R high and R low vary with respect to D high and D low , four impact regimes are defined [Sallenger, 2000]. Within the swash regime wave runup is confined to the foreshore region (R high < D low ), and sand that is eroded during storms is generally moved offshore until it is returned to the beach during more quiescent periods. The collision regime occurs when the maximum water level exceeds the base of the dune, Here, runup collides with the dune causing erosion that may be more long-lasting than foreshore erosion as dunes are typically rebuilt through slower aeolian processes. As R high increases, overwash will occur when R high > D high . Within this regime, Modified from Sallenger, 2000) sand is transported landward and not readily returned to the seaward side of the island. The final and most extreme regime, inundation, occurs when R low > D high , and the beach and dunes are completely and continually subaqueous. Measurements (or estimates) of R high , R low , D high , and D low are allowed to vary in the longshore direction creating spatial variability of the impact regime and, presumably, of the observed response due to different processes at work within each regime."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Morphology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Lidar Topographic Surveys", "text": "Surveys of beach and dune topography were collected using NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), a scanning laser altimeter (lidar) that is used for mapping coastal change and assessing storm impacts on subaerial beaches [Brock et al., 1999;Krabill et al., 2000]. The ATM beach surveys provide a dense data set of subaerial beach topography with both large spatial coverage and high spatial resolution. For each survey over 100 km of coast were sampled with one laser shot collected every ~2 m 2 . The rootmean-square (rms) vertical error of the ATM has been estimated as 15 cm . The lidar data allow objective estimates of coastal change, such as shoreline and beach volume change, that are spatially extensive, synoptic, and of sufficient accuracy to resolve a wide range of beach variability. A baseline topography survey was conducted on September 20, 1997, defining the pre-storm beach state for both hurricanes. This survey was collected after a long period of fair weather and is assumed to define the characteristic, calm-weather profile shape for these beaches based on typical summer wave conditions as well as sediment type and availability. Hurricane-induced coastal change is quantified by comparing the calmweather 1997 lidar topographic survey to data collected after each hurricane came ashore. The impact of Hurricane Bonnie (hereinafter referred to only as Bonnie) was documented by a lidar survey on September 5, 1998, nine days following landfall. Portions of the coast are expected to have recovered somewhat in those nine days; however, a large wave event (H s ~ 5 m) that occurred one day before the lidar survey likely prevented significant post-storm accretion from having significantly altered the record of hurricane-induced change. A third lidar survey on September 18, 1999 was used to calculate coastal change resulting from Hurricane Floyd (hereinafter referred to only as Floyd) that came ashore two days earlier.

The position of the dune crest was coarsely digitized on 1-m gridded DEMs, every 2 m along the coast [Elko et al., 2002]. In areas where no dune was present, the berm crest was digitized as the highest point on the beach. The precise crossshore location and elevation (relative to NAVD88) of the dune or berm crest (x dc , z dc; see Figure 4.3) were then automatically identified as the highest elevation within a 6-m wide swath centered on the digitized line. Where a dune was present, the horizontal position and elevation of its toe (x dt , z dt; see Figure 4.3) were calculated as the location of maximum slope change within a region around a coarsely digitized line. The vertical rms accuracy of this technique, based on a repeatability analysis of multiple digitizers, is 37 cm [Elko et al., 2002]. These selections of dune and berm positions were visually verified to insure that a consistent or similar feature was selected at all sites and that structures and vegetation were not mistakenly selected as dunes. Additional measures of beach morphology were quantified from cross-shore profiles of lidar data evenly spaced in the longshore direction (dy = 20 m). The horizontal position of the mean high water (MHW, z sl = 0.36 m, NAVD88) shoreline, x sl (y), was calculated along each lidar profile from a linear regression fit to data located in a window around z sl [Stockdon et al., 2002]. Based on the accuracy of the lidar system, we expect to obtain a horizontal shoreline accuracy of \u00b11.5 m on beaches with a typical foreshore slope of 0.1. Comparisons between lidar-derived and ground-measured shorelines in North Carolina revealed a rms difference of 2.9 m [Stockdon et al., 2002]. The width of the beach, X b (y), was defined as the horizontal distance between the shoreline and the base of the dune or, in the absence of a dune, the crest of the berm, (x sl -x dt ).

Vertical dashed lines indicate the horizontal extent over which inland volume change, \u03b4V i , is calculated between the 1999 and 1997 surveys. Shoreline change, \u03b4x sl (y), was calculated as where the post-storm shoreline position is given by x sl2 (y), and the 1997 calm-weather shoreline position, x sl1 (y), is taken as the reference from which change is calculated. While the horizontal change of the MHW contour over a one year period also includes the beach's response to seasonal changes in wave climate, the magnitude of the storminduced signal is expected to exceed that related to inter-annual variability. Beach volume change, \u03b4V b (y), is used to document more extreme changes that are likely to be attributed to the hurricanes. Beach volume change at each profile was defined between x sl1 (y) and the 1997 horizontal position of the dune or berm, x dc1 (y), as where dx, the cross-shore spacing between interpolated lidar survey data, is 0.5 m.

The merged data set was gridded at 500-m resolution in a 162-km by 186.5-km domain, which included both Capes Fear and Lookout (Figure 4.4a). Ten tidal constituents, derived from the TPX06.2 global inverse tide model [Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002], were specified along the open boundaries of the model domain. The accuracy of Delft3D-modeled tide in this region was validated by comparing the modeled tides for the month of January 2005 to tides measured at a NBDC gauge in Wilmington Beach, NC, approximately 10 km south of Masonboro Island. After the model stabilized, the rms difference between the modeled and measured values was -1.3 cm indicating that the astronomical tides were correctly represented. Wind grids from the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) program were used as input when the hurricanes were located outside of the model domain. When the storm track was within the study area, the input wind fields for Bonnie and Floyd were defined using data from NOAA's Hurricane Research Division (HRD). These gridded data consist of observations of maximum sustained wind speed and direction collected every three hours from a variety of sources (e.g. ships, buoys, reconnaissance aircraft, etc.), post-processed to conform to a standard 1-min averaging period measured 10-m above the surface [NOAA, 2005]. The blended NARR and HRD data set was gridded on a 177-km by 204-km domain with a 6-km resolution that encompassed the bathymetry grid. The radial distribution of surface pressure associated with each hurricane was then calculated from the merged HRD/NARR gridded wind field using the formulation given by Holland [1980]. The computational time step for the model was 15 minutes, and model results were output every 30 minutes. Water levels for Bonnie were modeled from August 24, 1998, 0000 GMT through landfall, ending on August 27, 1998, 2100 GMT. Water levels for Floyd were modeled from September 14, 1999, 0000 GMT through September 17, 1999, 0800 GMT. Modeled water-level elevation time series, \u03b7(t,y), representing both the astronomical tide and storm surge, were extracted along the shoreline at each lidar profile longshore location. The maximum, open-coast storm surge level during Bonnie was 1.7 m along Topsail and Hutaff Islands, approximately 10.5 hours before landfall. (It is not uncommon for water levels to peak before or after landfall of a storm's geographic eye, which may differ from landfall of the center of wind circulation and the location of maximum surge-producing wind stress.) Maximum surge levels decreased gradually along the coast to 1.5 m approaching Masonboro Island. Storm surge for Floyd first peaked along Masonboro Island (\u03b7 = 2.1 m) on September 16, 1999, 0530 GMT, one hour prior to landfall. As the storm continued to move onshore, surge levels continued to rise along Hutaff (\u03b7 = 2.2 m) and Topsail Island (\u03b7 = 2.1 m), peaking during landfall. The model results could not be confirmed with measured water levels because no open coast gauges were operational during the storms. The National Hurricane Center's (NHC) final reports on Bonnie and Floyd provide only limited observations of storm tides (astronomical tides plus storm surge). For Masonboro Island the reported storm tide was ~1 m above the Delft3D-modeled values [Avila, 1998;Pasch et al., 1999]. However, values could not be confirmed as open-coast since details of the location of the measurement were not provided in the reports and data sources were not given. Observed water levels on Wrightsville Beach, located within the study area between Masonboro and Hutaff Islands, during Bonnie were reported to be 2.1 -2.2 m [Avila, 1998], similar to the modeled values for this area (\u03b7 = 2.0 m)."}, {"section_title": "Wave Modeling", "text": "The nearshore wave field for each hurricane was modeled using Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) [Booij et al., 1999], a third-generation wave model used to estimate the wave conditions in nearshore coastal waters. The model solves the spectral action balance equation in which the rate of change and the propagation of wave action are balanced by source terms including wind generation, dissipation (bottom friction and white-capping), and nonlinear wave-wave interactions [Booij et al., 1999]. The bathymetry grid used for storm surge modeling was used to define the SWAN model domain (Figure 4.4a). Two nested grids with 100-m resolution were included to better characterize the spatial variability of wave height within the specific study area ( Figure   4.4b and 4.4c). The HRD wind field data, originally gridded at 5.58-km resolution for Bonnie and 2.79 km for Floyd, were spatially interpolated to the 500-m resolution bathymetry grid and used as input in the SWAN model. The maximum gridded HRD wind speed for both storms was approximately 45 m/s, slightly under-representing observed maxima. Both storms entered the model domain from the southwest resulting in east-southeast winds blowing almost directly onshore. Initial offshore wave conditions were not specified as model input because observations of sufficient resolution for modeling the spatial variability of hurricane wave conditions were not available. Comparisons between non-stationary model runs using only HRD wind input and runs using both HRD winds and modeled, gridded wave heights (WaveWatch III) as input show a mean difference of less than 15 cm at the 10-m isobath during the peak of storm, indicating that the strong winds are the dominant forcing. Observations of wave conditions at buoys located outside of Onslow Bay show that no significant wave energy not forced by the hurricanes was entering the model domain at the time of these storms, indicating that local wave conditions could be sufficiently modeled using only wind input. A number of sensitivity tests evaluating the performance of the SWAN model in hurricane conditions confirmed that the default values provided the most accurate results, as defined by comparison to observations at NOAA station FPSN-7. The model was run in a non-stationary mode for both hurricanes over the time period for which HRD wind data were available. The computation time step was 10 minutes and results were output every 30 minutes. For Bonnie, the model was run for nine hours (August 26, 1998, 1030-1930, ending approximately eight hours before the official landfall of the eye. The wave field for Floyd was modeled for 20.5 hours starting on September 15, 1999, 1030 GMT and continuing through landfall the next day at 0630 GMT. Local wave height, defined by that observed at the 10-m isobath, was extracted from each 30-minute output interval, t, of the model run. These data were then interpolated to the longshore locations of lidar profiles to provide H s (t,y) for estimating wave runup and setup. The accuracy of the model results were tested by comparing computed H s to that measured at NOAA station FPSN7 located on Frying Pan Shoals (water depth = 19.5 m). The gauge at FPSN7 did not operate throughout the duration of either storm and no observations were made at landfall; however, a 5-and 16-hour time series of observed H s during Bonnie and Floyd, respectively, were available for comparison with a subset of the modeled H s time series. SWAN-modeled H s on Frying Pan Shoals during Bonnie compares reasonably well to observed values. The time-averaged (5-hr) mean difference, \u2206H s , was = 1.18 m (positive differences indicate that observations were larger than modeled values) and the rms difference was 1.29 m. At the time of maximum observed H s , 13 hours prior to landfall, \u2206H s = 0.92 m (12.0% error). Modeled H s for Floyd was consistently less than the observed values; over the 16-hr comparison, \u2206H s = 2.52 m and the rms difference was 2.7 m. However, errors were smaller during the 6 hours immediately prior to storm landfall when the HRD wind grids were available and within the model domain, and the hurricane wind field was more accurately represented. During this time period, \u2206H s = 1.18 m and the rms difference was 1.19 m. At the time of maximum observed H s , 3.5 hrs prior to landfall, \u2206H s = 1.61 m (19.5% error). Because FPSN7 is located on the dynamic shoals offshore of Cape Fear, differences between observed and modeled wave height may be due to inaccuracies in the input bathymetry and the resulting errors in modeling wave shoaling, breaking, and refraction. However, the sensitivities of the model nearshore (h \u2264 10 m) are expected to be low.

The elevation of the 2% exceedence level for runup, R 2 , can be calculated using the empirical parameterization which includes both wave-induced setup and swash, where L 0 is the deep-water wavelength, defined as gT 0 2 /2\u03c0 [Stockdon et al., 2006]. The full expression for runup is used because conditions for both hurricanes were intermediate to reflective (Iribarren Number, \u03be  Foreshore beach slope used in equations 4.3 is defined over the area of significant swash activity [Stockdon et al., 2006]. However, for application of these equations to hurricane-induced runup where large waves will likely move the swash zone higher on the profile, the mean beach slope, \u03b2 m (y), between the dune (or berm) and the MHW shoreline, was defined as the relevant slope measure (Figure 4.3). Additionally, the mean beach slope was thought to provide a more stable measure of profile slope that was less sensitive to daily changes in wave energy. Because topography surveys were not collected immediately prior to the hurricanes and pre-storm \u03b2 f could not be measured, the mean beach slope is likely more representative of slopes typical for this site. It is also expected that any berm located within the swash zone will likely erode with the arrival of the storm waves, quickly reducing the foreshore slope to that of the mean profile. H 0 specific to equation 4.3 is defined as a local measure of significant wave height, H s , that has been reverse shoaled to deep water [Stockdon et al., 2006]. SWAN-modeled H s (t,y) represents the local (h = 10m), spatially-variable wave height within the study area that has dissipated across the shelf and refracted over local bathymetry. To obtain H 0 (t,y) for use in the runup parameterization, H s (t,y) was reverse shoaled to deep water using linear theory. R 2 (t,y) was then estimated every 20 m along the each island using H 0 (t,y) and lidar-derived, pre-storm \u03b2 m (y). Based on equation 4.3, variability in H 0 (y) and \u03b2 m (y) result in a corresponding spatial pattern in runup."}, {"section_title": "Estimated Storm-Impact Regime", "text": "For estimation of the likely hurricane-impact regime, D high and D low were defined as the 1997 elevations of the dune (or berm) crest, z dc , and toe, z dt .

The validity of this assumption is addressed within the Discussion section. Both quantities were extracted at each lidar profile location to collocate morphology measurement with water-level estimates (Figure 4 Table 4.1. R high (t,y) was calculated as R 2 (t,y) + \u03b7(t,y) , the sum of parameterized runup and modeled water level (tide plus surge). The variability of R high , as well as its components R 2 (t,y) and \u03b7(t,y), are illustrated in timestacks which show temporal variations at each profile location associated with hurricane approach (  Over the whole region the mean magnitude of R high was 22 cm greater during Floyd, despite somewhat smaller wave heights and runup. Storm surge accompanying Floyd was 38 cm higher than that for Bonnie (see Table 4.2). During both storms the spatial variability of R high (\u03c3R high \u2248 41 cm) was approximately four times larger than that of H s and surge (\u03c3H, \u03c3\u03b7 = O(10cm), Table 4.2). The relative change in H s across the study area was 2.5%, significantly less than the relative change in slope (36%); therefore, most of the longshore variability of R high (y), particularly along a single island, was due to variations in \u03b2 m and subsequent spatial patterns in R 2 .

The profiles were spatially averaged in the longshore direction using a sliding 40 m window (the average of three cross-shore profiles), reducing noise in the data and allowing patterns of coastal change to be more easily identified. The swash regime was designated as the minimum level of impact at each profile location. The occurrence of higher-impact levels was determined and Hutaff Islands where overwash was predicted to be the dominant response to the storms, the objective and subjective designations agreed for 92.6% of the profile locations. On Topsail Island, where a mix of regimes was expected, the subjective and objective determinations agreed on 66.8% of the profiles. Some of the discrepancies were due to the presence of houses masking the overwash signal in the objective determination. Areas where houses were a significant problem and produced differences in the observed regime over a continuous area were manually edited (3.8 % of the profiles). The impact of both hurricanes along this stretch of coast was severe: 44.6% of the alongshore locations experienced overwash. Impacts during Floyd were more severe, with 17% of the profiles experiencing a higher impact regime than they had as a result of Bonnie. During Floyd, 34% of the area experienced dune erosion compared to 19% during Bonnie. It is possible that during the storms some locations along the coast were in the collision or overwash regime but were not classified as such because significant coastal change was not measured, either because it was below detectable levels or because no change occurred. This may lead to discrepancies between the predicted and observed regimes that are not necessarily related to inaccuracies of the storm scaling model."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Storm-Impact Scaling Model", "text": "The observed impact regime was compared to the predicted regime to evaluate the accuracy of the storm-impact scaling model in predicting the mode of coastal change during a hurricane. The overall accuracy of the storm-impact scaling model for correctly predicting one of three observed impact regimes was 51.6% for Bonnie (N= 1424) and 59.1% for Floyd (N = 1307), which show significant improvements over the accuracy associated with random chance (33.3%). Prediction errors were generally the result of an overestimate of the impact regime (or, perhaps, an under-detection of the storm-induced coastal change): the predicted regime was more severe than observed along 40.7% and 36.2% of the longshore locations for Bonnie and Floyd, respectively. The accuracy of predictions within a single regime varies markedly and was evaluated using a presence/absence (or binary decision) model in which the presence of each regime is predicted. The performance of these types of models can be summarized in a confusion matrix that presents the number of observations and predictions of both the presence and absence of a particular regime [Fielding and Bell, 1997]. In the presence/absence model the total number of correct predictions, N c , can be viewed with respect to either the number of observations of a particular regime, N o , or the number of predictions of that particular regime, N p . The sensitivity, s, of the model is the probability that a particular regime was classified correctly and is calculated as N c /N o . Positive predictive power, P, is a measure of the predictive capabilities of the model. P, calculated as N c /N p , defines the probability that a particular regime will occur if predicted by the storm scaling model.  Table 4.3 for each hurricane. For both storms, P for the swash regime was relatively high (P B = 63.6% and P F = 44.4%, the subscripts B and F refer to Hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd, respectively) indicating that swash would occur where predicted an average of 54% of the time. However, these high values of P may be somewhat misleading in this case since the swash regime was predicted to occur over only 8% of the profiles. Sensitivity within the swash regime was much lower (s B = 1.5% and s F = 1.4%) indicating that the model did a poor job of classifying the observed locations of swash. The low sensitivity values for swash are overwhelmingly due to the prediction of dune erosion (collision regime) in Table 4.3.

Errors within this regime were due to the overprediction of overwash at locations where dune erosion was observed."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Response within Each Regime", "text": "The hurricane-induced coastal response, as measured by shoreline change, \u03b4x sl , and  Part of the longshore variability in the observed hurricane response can be attributed to differences in the nature and magnitude of coastal change within each observed regime. In the swash regime (based on the objective, post-storm classification), where runup is confined to the beach seaward of the dune, magnitudes of \u03b4x sl and \u03b4V b were smaller than within the other regimes (Figure 4.7). The means and standard deviations for shoreline and volume change during both storms were on the order of 10 m and 10 m 3 /m, respectively. (Regime-specific measures of \u03b4x sl and \u03b4V b for each storm are presented in Table 4.4.) While the foreshore slope flattened in these areas in response to storm waves, the mean beach slope was observed to steepen slightly, particularly after Floyd, as a direct result of shoreline retreat. Within the collision regime, the magnitude and variability of shoreline change were similar to that observed in the swash regime, O(10 m); however, beach-volume change was twice as high (Figure 4.7): \u00b5\u03b4V b = -27.8 m 3 /m for Bonnie and \u00b5\u03b4V b = -26.3 m 3 /m for Floyd. While the magnitude of mean \u03b4x sl was similar to that observed in the swash regime, \u00b5\u03b4\u03b2 m was insignificant due to an accompanying retreat of the base of the dune (-5.2 m and -6.7 m following Bonnie and Floyd, respectively). In these areas, the loss of beach sand was accompanied by the loss of an additional 8.25 m 3 /m of mean dune erosion (average for both storms). Within the overwash regime, the magnitude of coastal change was observed to be cumulative with successive storm impacts. After Bonnie, mean shoreline and volume change were similar to those observed in the collision regime (\u03b4x sl = -10.9 \u00b1 9.5 m, \u03b4V b = -26.0 \u00b1 15.0 m 3 /m). After Floyd made landfall one year later, the shoreline change in overwash locations doubled and volume change increased by 50% ( Figure 4.7, Table   4.4). The observed response of the mean beach slope was also different than that observed within other regimes. Here the beach tended to flatten during the storms due to the rapid retreat of the berm crest (-22.68 m after Bonnie, -40.51 m after Floyd) relative to a slower shoreline retreat (\u00b5\u03b4x sl = -10.9 m after Bonnie and \u00b5\u03b4x sl = -19.4 m after Floyd). Mean slope change following Floyd (\u00b5\u03b4\u03b2 m = -0.028) was greater than that following Bonnie (\u00b5\u03b4\u03b2 m = -0.017). Comparison between the 1997 and 2000 surveys showed little permanent change in mean beach slopes over the three-year period indicating that slopes steepened again after Floyd. (Note: Coastal change during Floyd that was calculated using the 1998 post-Bonnie survey as the pre-storm conditions shows the same relationship to observed impact regime even though the magnitudes of change are smaller than that calculated using the 1997 data.) While the profile shape in overwash locations returned to the pre-storm slope, the horizontal position of the berm did not recover. Cumulative volume change, as calculated between the two calm weather lidar surveys from 1997 and 2000, showed no Table 4.4. Mean (and standard deviation) post-storm and cumulative shoreline, beach volume, and slope change within each hurricane-impact regime. all regimes swash collision overwash post-Bonnie (1997 -1998) \u03b4x sl (m) -9.11 (8.47) -6.1 (6.6) -9.8 (7.1) -10.9 (9. Again, this shows that in the overwash locations sand was transported to the sound side of the island and, consequently, lost from the nearshore system, making it unavailable to calm weather waves which typically bring sand back to the beach after a storm. This is in contrast to the swash and collision regimes where no overwash was observed and the net volume change across the profile was approximately equal to the volume of sand eroded from the beach face. In these locations, sand was transported offshore where it potentially was available to be transported back to the beach between storms, as evidenced by the similarity of shoreline and volume change magnitudes for the two storms. Further evidence of the cumulative nature of net landward migration of the overwash sites was found on Masonboro Island, where overwash was the dominant response to both storms. Here, lidar surveys covered the entire width of the island allowing for the calculation of the center of mass at each longshore location. The horizontal location of the center of mass was observed to retreat 15.9 m landward after Bonnie and an additional 6.1 m following Floyd. One year after Floyd, no significant seaward recovery of the center of mass was observed, resulting in a 21.8 m landward retreat of the island. This retreat was also observed in the horizontal movement of the berm (D high ) despite pronounced changes in the overall profile shape. After each storm's landfall, the mean beach slope flattened and D high retreated landward. Then, in the year following Floyd the profile began to recover as the berm moved slightly seaward and began to regain its steeper, pre-storm shape (Table 4. of barrier islands via overwash deposits has been documented extensively [Doughty et al., 2004;Hosier and Cleary, 1977;Leatherman, 1979;Leatherman, 1981]. The landward migration of overwashed Masonboro Island supports the observation that coastal change in overwash locations is larger in magnitude and more permanent than changes within the other two impact regimes, because of sand loss across the island. Masonboro and Hutaff Islands, which were dominated by overwash, showed continued shoreline retreat and beach erosion after the passage of two hurricanes. Shoreline and beach volume change over the three-year period (\u00b5\u03b4x sl = -30.1 m , \u00b5\u03b4V b = -47.0 m 3 /m) was slightly larger than that measured after Floyd (\u00b5\u03b4x sl = -24.1 m , \u00b5\u03b4V b = -43.3 m 3 /m) as the islands migrate landward. Over the whole study area, islands characterized by different response regimes showed more permanent large-scale, longshore variability resulting from the hurricanes."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The large-scale impacts of hurricanes on barrier islands have been observed to be highly longshore variable. Observations of shoreline and beach volume change resulting from these storms show that the standard deviation of change may be of the same order of magnitude as the mean response. This has serious implications for future attempts at predicting the vulnerability of a stretch of coast to an approaching storm. One area may experience significant dune erosion or overwash, while an adjacent area may be virtually unaffected. An accurate prediction of the large-scale response of barrier islands to hurricanes requires an understanding of both the magnitudes of change and the processes driving the observed patterns. The longshore-variable signal of coastal change may be examined using a stormimpact scaling model that compares the elevations of dune morphology and hurricaneinduced water levels to define four impact regimes. When water levels are confined to the active beach face (swash regime), sand eroded from the beach is transported offshore and generally returns to the beach during more quiescent periods. If water levels reach or exceed the base of the dune (collision regime), storm waves may begin to erode the dune face. In the overwash regime, runup levels exceed the elevation of the dune crest, often resulting in the landward transport of sediment. When total water levels continuously exceed the elevation of the dune, the system has reached the inundation regime and cross-island flows dominate the fluid forcings. Within each of these regimes, the processes and magnitudes of sediment transport are unique. In order to begin to characterize the nature and magnitude of hurricane-induced coastal change, techniques were developed to extract accurate and synoptic measures of coastal morphology from high-resolution laser altimetry topographic surveys. An objective method for extracting contour-based, horizontal shoreline position and change, as well as the associated 95% confidence interval, was shown to have an accuracy of 1.5 m (rms difference error) as compared to ground-based surveys. Measures of morphology such as beach slope, dune height, and beach volume were also extracted from the lidar topography to allow for detailed quantification of the large-scale coastal response. Additionally, lidar-derived measures of pre-storm beach morphology were used as input for the storm-impact scaling model to make predictions of the hurricane-impact regimes. The maximum total water level at the shoreline expected during a hurricane was modeled as the sum of astronomical tide, storm surge, and wave runup. Since a complete hydrodynamic model of wave runup is impractical in this case because of the expected lack of data on the input wave spectra and boundary conditions, an empirical parameterization was used to approximate the 2% exceedence value for wave runup. The elevation of runup was parameterized as the sum of two dynamically different processes, setup and swash, using water-level data collected at 10 field experiments representing a wide range of beach and wave conditions. Dimensional setup and incident-band (f 0 > 0.05 Hz) swash were best parameterized using the offshore wave height, wave period, and foreshore beach slope, estimated over the region of significant swash activity. The magnitude of infragravity-band (f 0 < 0.05 Hz) swash scaled similarly; however, the model improved significantly when slope was removed from the parameterization. Special relationships for swash and setup exist under highly dissipative conditions where bottom friction likely plays a larger role in the dissipation across very wide surf and swash zones. For Iribarren numbers less than 0.3, setup and total swash (modeling both frequency bands together) are each parameterized using only offshore wave height and period. The inclusion of foreshore or surf zone slope does not offer any improvement to the empirical formulation for dissipative conditions. Using the suggested formulations for setup, incident swash, and infragravity swash, the final empirical formulation for the Comparisons of runup estimates made using these composite parameterizations to 491 observations of runup revealed a mean difference of -17 cm, indicating a slight underestimate of runup, and an rms difference of 38 cm. On intermediate and reflective beaches with highly three-dimensional topography, the dependence of setup and incident swash on foreshore beach slope will force corresponding longshore-variability in runup. The storm-impact scaling model was used to examine the long-shore variable coastal response to Hurricanes Bonnie (1998) and Floyd (1999), which made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina. Because high-resolution observations of the fluid forcing were not available during each storm, the hurricane-induced total water level was hindcast along the coast using modeled surge and wave conditions. Storm surge and wave runup each accounted for ~48% of the total signal (astronomical tides contributed the remaining 4%), indicating that wave-driven process are a significant contributor to hurricane-induced water levels. Spatially-varying water levels were compared to measurements of dune morphology, D high and D low , extracted every 20 along 50-km of coast to predict three storm-impact regimes: swash, collision, and overwash. (The occurrence of the inundation regime was not predicted because of difficulties in using the lidar surveys to determine locations where the islands were submerged during the storm.) Comparisons to the observed regime, quantified using measures of hurricane-induced dune erosion and overwash volumes, reveal an overall accuracy of 55.4%, an improvement over the 33.3% accuracy associated with random chance. Model sensitivity, the ratio of the number of correct predictions of a regime to the number of occurrences of that regime, varied widely and was highest within the overwash regime (86.9%). Accuracy within the collision and swash regimes was 55.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Low accuracy in the swash regime is because very few instances of swash were predicted (9) relative to the number observed (473, averaged between both storms). Errors in prediction were commonly overestimates of the storm response, possibly due to regime responses that were below measurable thresholds (under-measurement), inappropriateness of the 2% exceedence level as the runup elevation to trigger significant response, and inappropriateness of mean beach slope as a proxy for the time-varying slope for regime predictions. The magnitudes of shoreline and beach volume change were observed to vary within each storm-impact regime, leading to a spatially variable storm response over the 50-km stretch of coast. Magnitudes of hurricane-induced beach volume change were more than twice as large in the overwash regime as they were in the swash regime. The amount of recovery after the hurricanes also differed between the impact regimes. Cumulative shoreline and beach volume change calculated over a three-year period showed that coastal change within the hurricane overwash regimes was almost three times that observed in the swash regimes. Islands dominated by overwash experienced a net landward retreat of over 20 m, as measured one year after the storms, and were shown to experience a more permanent loss of sand from the beach. Here, the volume of sand eroded from the beach face was balanced by the volume of overwash deposits, indicating that sand was transported across the island, deposited inland, and removed from the nearshore system making it unavailable to calm-weather waves that tend to bring sand back to the beach. Additional longshore-variability of measured shoreline change within the overwash regime was related to a large-scale trend in beach slope. Areas with steeper slopes, and correspondingly higher runup, experienced more erosion during each hurricane."}]
