[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a single stranded-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus with a 29,903 nucleotides-long genome [1] . It was first identified in January 2020 in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly causing an ongoing worldwide pandemic. The Republic of the Niger is the largest country in West Africa, landlocked by Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Algeria. It has a population of about 22 million, living mostly in clusters in the far south and west of the country. Niger faces serious development challenges due to its desert terrain and overpopulation, but also due to attacks by \"Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb\", its use as a transit country for migrants, and the spillover of Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency into southeastern Niger. French, American, and Belgian armed forces are currently assisting Niger in countering jihadist groups present in the Sahel [2] . Since the end of August 2019, Belgian military personnel have been deployed in the Maradi region nearby the southern border with Nigeria in the context of Operation New Nero (ONN). The Belgian military are based on the outskirts of the city of Maradi, the second-or third-largest city in the country. In 2012, it had about 267,000 inhabitants and it is one of Niger's most economically prosperous cities and the major transport, trade, and agricultural hub of South-Central Niger.\nA group of 70 Belgian soldiers was sent in two waves, one on 12 December 2019 and the other on 1 February 2020, to the Maradi camp. They formed the \"Mobile Education and Training Team\" (METT), which brings together 12 military trainers, members of the Special Forces group, around forty members of the 3rd Battalion Para and a \"Special Operations Surgical Team\". They trained a special intervention company made up of 150 Nigerien soldiers.\nThe first case of COVID-19 in Belgium was confirmed on 3 February 2020 [3] . On 19 March, the first case of COVID-19 in Niger was reported in the Nigerien capital, Niamey: a 36-year-old Nigerien or Nigerien national (depending on the report), a storekeeper in a land transport company, who had travelled along the Lom\u00e9 (Togo)-Accra (Ghana)-Abidjan (Ivory Coast)-Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) axis [4] . After that, two other COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Niamey: a Brazilian woman, who returned to Niger on 16 March 2020, coming from Switzerland, and a 51-year-old Italian man, who returned to Niger on 28 February 2020, from his home country of Italy [3] . On 24 March, the first death from the new coronavirus in Niger was recorded: a 62-year-old male, Brazilian national, who entered Niger from Senegal on 27 February [4] . Niger declared a national state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 27 March. Gatherings of more than 50 people were banned, places of worship closed, and obligatory epidemiological safety measures were instituted, including the wear of facemasks and social distancing in public places and public transport. On 2 April, the first two COVID-19 cases outside Niamey were confirmed in two residents of Maradi.\nAt the beginning of May 2020, a handful of Belgian military service men developed COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. The METT returned to Belgium in two waves, on 13 May and 19 May 2020. Immediately upon their arrival in Brussels, nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected from all soldiers, symptomatic, and asymptomatic alike, for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. The returning military personnel were placed in quarantine nearby the military airport, awaiting test results and medical consultation later in the day. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads of the nasopharyngeal samples were determined using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), while two immunoassays were used to assess their antibody response to the virus. A rapid COVID-19 antibody test was used for first line screening, and a more widely available and evaluated double antigen sandwich assay was performed later on frozen serum samples. Two weeks later, all individuals were re-tested. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in RT-qPCR positive nasopharyngeal samples were sequenced. Viral genomes were evaluated and a retrospective epidemiological study was conducted to identify possible origins and routes of spread and to discuss measures to prevent or control future COVID-19 outbreaks, which pose a threat to the readiness of military forces and their ability to fulfill missions [5] ."}, {"section_title": "Samples for COVID-19 Diagnosis", "text": "Nasopharyngeal sample collection kits (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA), consisting of a flexible minitip flocked swab in a tube filled with 1 mL Universal Transport Medium (UTM), were used for COVID-19 sample collection in all 70 returning service members, immediately upon arrival in Belgium (D0) and two weeks later (D14). Blood samples were collected, using VACUETTE serum gel tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Vilvoorde, Belgium), for COVID-19 antibody testing in all returning personnel on D0 and D14. Blood was allowed to clot for a minimum of 30 min in a vertical position and then centrifuged at room temperature in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 1500 g. Serum samples were tested immediately and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C \u00b1 5 \u2022 C for possible re-testing."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR", "text": "RT-qPCR was performed on the nasopharyngeal swabs using the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Kit and Sample Release Reagent (both Sansure Biotech Inc., Changsha, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with some adaptations for the LightCycler 2.0 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Belgium, Machelen, Belgium). The assay targets the ORF1ab and N genes, coding for a well-conserved replicase polyprotein and the nucleocapsid protein, respectively. Each test also contains an RNA internal control (RNAse P genes), which detects RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition. Swab samples were first inactivated at 56 \u2022 C for 30 min in a bead bath. Two hundred microliters of swab medium were pipetted into a 1.5 mL tube, which was centrifuged at 13,500 g for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and 500 \u00b5L of sterile saline were added. The tubes were vortexed and again centrifuged at 13,500 g for 3 min, and after discarding the supernatant, about 20-40 \u00b5L of the liquid were retained. Thirty microliters of Sample Release Reagent (denatures proteins and frees SARS-CoV-2 RNA) were added and mixed by pipetting up and down. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Eight microliters of the sample supernatants, of the negative control (physiological saline), and of the positive control (in vitro transcriptional RNA of target genes ORF1ab and N) were subsequently pipetted into the corresponding capillaries, which were preloaded with 12 \u00b5L PCR Master Mix. The program cycle parameters were as follows: a reverse transcription step at 50 \u2022 C for 30 min, followed by a cDNA pre-denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 1 min and then 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 15 s, and annealing, extension and fluorescence collection at 60 \u2022 C for 30 s. There was no need to apply color compensation files."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassays", "text": "Two SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were performed on the serum samples. The Multi-G COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test (MULTI-G, Antwerpen, Belgium), a lateral flow chromatographic membrane-based immunoassay, was used for the in vitro qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to 2019-nCoV in serum specimens. In this assay, the samples first react with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated particles and then migrate to react with anti-human IgG and/or IgM antibodies. According to the package insert, the relative specificity of the test is 98.0% for IgG and 96.0% for IgM. The relative sensitivity is 100% for IgG and 85.0% for IgM. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay on the Cobas e 601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Belgium, Machelen, Belgium) was used for the in vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples. This double antigen sandwich assay uses a mix of biotinylated and ruthenylated recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen of SARS-CoV-2 for determination of antibodies. A signal threshold \u22651 was defined as positive. A specificity of 99.81% and a sensitivity of 100% (\u226514 days post PCR confirmation) were reported in the package insert. All immunoassays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing", "text": "D0 nasopharyngeal samples with positive RT-qPCR results were selected for sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore MinION device using R9.4 flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), based on a protocol from Quick et al., 2017 [6] . Briefly, RNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5L UTM transport medium and eluted in 80 \u00b5L water using a Maxwell RSC Instrument. 7 \u00b5L RNA was then converted to cDNA using random hexamers and the ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). Subsequently, a strain-specific multiplex PCR was performed in six reactions using an 800 bp SARS-CoV-2 primer scheme (Table S1 ) and Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Cycling conditions were 30 s at 98 \u2022 C, followed by 25-30 cycles at 98 \u2022 C for 10 s, 65 \u2022 C for 1.5 min, 72 \u2022 C for 2 min, and a final elongation step at 72 \u2022 C for 2 min. The resulting 800 bp PCR products were pooled and cleaned up using AmpureXP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay on a Qubit 3.0 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were then barcoded using the Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs) and the native barcoding kits NBD104 and NBD114 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), cleaned up with magnetic beads and pooled at equimolar ratios prior to ligation of the AMII adapters with blunt/TA ligase master mix (New England Biolabs). Sequencing libraries were loaded onto the R9.4 flow cell using the ligation sequencing kit LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and sequencing data were collected overnight. Sequence reads were base called in high accuracy mode and demultiplexed using the Guppy algorithm v3.6 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Consensus genome sequences were produced by comparing two distinct bioinformatics pipelines. First, an in-house customized pipeline, which aligns reads to a SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank MN908947.3) using Minimap2, was applied. After removal of primer sequences using a custom Python script, a majority rule consensus was produced for positions with \u2265100x genome coverage, while regions with lower coverage, were masked with N characters [7] . In parallel, the Artic network's bioinformatics pipeline [8] was run, which incorporates base quality data as well as the nanopolish algorithm [9] to improve consensus sequence for a draft genome assembly."}, {"section_title": "Genomic Epidemiology", "text": "Whole Genome sequences were compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan genome (NC_045512.2) and to all SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) repository (https://www.gisaid.org) [10] (July 24 status) and to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). BLOSUM62 substitution scores were calculated to assess amino acid changes and their potential to alter or change the functionality of the involved protein [11] . Negative scores are predicted to be \"bad\" in terms of substitution, i.e., they are not frequently observed in Nature. After submission of the obtained SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to GISAID (Accession IDs: EPI_ISL_487433 to EPI_ISL_487436) they were automatically included into Nextstrain [12] , an open-source project providing a continually updated phylogenetic analysis and visualization of the evolutionary relationships of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. This analysis includes subsampling, alignment, maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference, temporal dating of ancestral nodes, and discrete trait geographic reconstruction. Nextstrain phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan.

Information on the duration of COVID-19 compatible signs and symptoms was not systematically recorded. Possible contacts between the Belgian soldiers and externs were traced. Background COVID-19 related epidemiological data were retrieved from online local media and from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases)."}, {"section_title": "Ethics Statement", "text": "Clinical samples were routinely processed in view of diagnosis. Results were analyzed in the context of retrospective epidemiological analysis and were not deemed prospective research."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Seventy Belgian male soldiers returned from a mission in Maradi in two waves, one on 13 May and another on 19 May 2020. They had arrived in the Maradi military education and training center on 12 December 2019 and 1 February 2020, a few days before the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Belgium, in a 54-year-old man, who was repatriated from Wuhan City on 3 February 2020 [3] . Mild symptoms indicative of COVID-19 were recorded in 22 (31.4%, 22/70) of these soldiers in the 3 week period (30 April to 19 May) preceding their return to Belgium (Tables 1 and 2 ). During that same period, approximately one sixth of the 150 Nigerien military trainees ran a fever. The Belgian soldiers were immediately tested (RT-qPCR and two immunoassays), nearby the military airport, upon their return to Belgium (D0) and again two weeks later (D14). Nine Belgian soldiers (12.9%, 9/70) had at least one positive COVID-19 diagnostic test result ( Table 2 ). Five of them (55.6%, 5/9) were trainers. The total number of trainers involved in the training mission was 12 (17.1%, 12/70). Trainers were thus disproportionately represented in the COVID-19 positive diagnosis population. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected in the D0 nasopharyngeal samples of four (5.7%, 4/70) soldiers (M4-M7), which persisted at D14 in three of them ( Table 2 ). The four RT-qPCR positive soldiers remained in isolation for two weeks. In these four D0 RT-qPCR positive soldiers, antibodies were not observed at D0, but all had seroconverted on D14 (Table 2 ). This indicates that these soldiers were recently infected and that the Maradi outbreak was still ongoing. The remaining five soldiers with negative RT-qPCR results, showed positive immunoassays at D0, which highlights the importance of serological testing to achieve more accurate estimates of the extent of a COVID-19 outbreak. However, for two individuals (M8 and M9), only the rapid antibody tests were positive, making it uncertain whether they actually had the disease ( Table 2) . Seroconversion is usually, and depending on the applied method, observed after a median of approximately two weeks after symptom onset for both IgM and IgG [14] and in contrast to IgG, the positive rate of IgM drops after 5 weeks [15] . Although seroconversion as well as the loss of IgM can clearly be observed in our antibody data, the timings do not always correspond. For example, in some patients IgMs disappeared more rapidly (e.g., M2 and M3) or were not detected at all (e.g., M7), but this was somewhat expected given person-related variations as well as the sensitivity of the different tests used ( Table 2) .\nOf interest, four (M6-M9) of the nine COVID-19 positive soldiers (including soldiers M8 and M9 with doubtful diagnosis) were asymptomatic ( Table 2 ). In two of them, SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected by RT-qPCR (Table 2 ). These infected asymptomatic soldiers (one of them a trainer) would have continued to work while shedding the virus. In addition, for two soldiers (M4 and M5), the onset of COVID-19 symptoms occurred on May 15 and 16, respectively, a few days before their return to Belgium. Hence, it is very likely that the timely return to Belgium prevented this becoming worse.\nFor comparison, a COVID-19 outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt was characterized by widespread transmission with mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection (20%) among a similar population of mostly young healthy adults living in a congregate environment [16] . Of note, just like with the Belgian soldiers, anosmia and ageusia were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, followed by fever [16] . Some scientists suggested that onset of anosmia should be considered SARS-CoV-2 related until proven otherwise and recommended immediate isolation and confirmatory testing [17] .\nTo analyze possible patterns of spread across local and global epidemiological scales, we further determined the whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the four D0 RT-qPCR positive Belgian soldiers (sequencing statistic are given in Table S2 ). The genome sequences were submitted to GISAID under accession IDs EPI_ISL_487433-6, and were re-named C2181, C2182, C2183, and C2185 in Nextstrain (Table 3) . No other SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from patients with documented history of exposure or residence in Niger were present in the GISAID and NCBI databases. The four genome sequences were compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan genome (NC_045512.2) and with all SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to the GISAID and NCBI repositories. Genomes C2181 and C2185 are identical and were found in soldiers M4 and M7, both trainers (Table 3) . Genomic sequences of samples collected from COVID-19 cases within one infection cluster are often identical or highly similar, especially within household pairs [18] . However, due to the relatively limited mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to know if both trainers were infected by the same source, by different sources, or passed it on to each other. Genome C2183 has one additional difference in comparison to genomes C2181 and C2185, i.e., mutation G20477T corresponding to a glycine (G) to valine (V) amino acid change in protein ORF1ab. Genome C2182 has two differences in comparison to genomes C2181 and C2185: mutations A8095C and C19164T, both in ORF1ab and both silent (Table 3) . Table 3 .

In three reported outbreaks where 12, 17, and 35 individuals had contracted the virus within one institution, up to two SNPs were detected [18] .\nTo date, five major clades of SARS-CoV-2 were defined (i.e., GR, G, GH, L, O, S, and V), based on characteristic mutational events observed in the genomes submitted to GISAID (https: //www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/) (Figure 1 ) [19] . Phylogenetic examination using Nextstrain (accessed 11 August 2020) showed that all four Maradi genomes belonged to cluster 19B of GISAID's clade S (Figure 2 ). The S clade was first observed among travelers from Wuhan in the early days of the outbreak [20] and was prevalent in North America and in Europe [19] [20] [21] , but has now declined worldwide in favor of the G clades ( Figure 1B) . All four Maradi genomes bear the two signature mutations of clade S: the silent mutation C8782T and mutation T28144C, which causes a leucine (L) to serine (S) (hence the clade's name) change in the ORF8 protein [18] . In addition, our cluster shared 7 other mutations when compared to the reference NC_045512.2, four of which were previously reported and determine the tree topology (G28878A, G22468T, A361G, and G29742A), as indicated by the arrows in Figures 2 and 3 . Mutation G26152A, which causes a glycine (G) to arginine (R) amino acid change in ORF3a, and the silent mutation C3589T were previously observed in other SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The C18959T mutation, however, is unique to the Maradi genomes and results in an alanine (A) to valine (V) amino acid change in ORF1ab. Other infrequent variations, which are present in less than 10 reported genomes, are shown in Table 4 . The rare silent mutation A361G, present in all four Maradi genomes, was recently observed in Benin, Nigeria, and Mali (Table 4) , three neighboring countries of Niger, and places our genomes in a cluster of recent African descent (92% confidence), with its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) estimated between 28 February and 15 March 2020 (Figure 3 ). This is compatible with the suspected first COVID-19 case in Niger (reported on 19 March 2020), who had travelled to Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso [3] . The dates on which the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in these countries, according to ECDC, were 7 (1 case), 13 (2 cases), 12 (1 case), and 11 March 2020 (2 cases), respectively. The rare silent mutation A361G, present in all four Maradi genomes, was recently observed in Benin, Nigeria, and Mali (Table 4) , three neighboring countries of Niger, and places our genomes in a cluster of recent African descent (92% confidence), with its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) estimated between 28 February and 15 March 2020 (Figure 3 ). This is compatible with the suspected first COVID-19 case in Niger (reported on 19 March 2020), who had travelled to Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso [3] . The dates on which the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in these countries, according to ECDC, were 7 (1 case), 13 (2 cases), 12 (1 case), and 11 March 2020 (2 cases), respectively.\nThree amino acid changes, resulting from the individual mutation G20477T, the shared mutation G26152A, and the S clade signature mutation T28144C are predicted to result in significant alterations of the functionality of the involved proteins (negative BLOSUM62 scores) ( Table 3 ) [10] . The mutation predicted to have the most significant impact (exhibiting a BLOSUM score of \u22123), was G20477T, but has only been observed once so far, in March 2020, in isolate nCoV-19/France/10063BI/2020 (Table 4 ). It was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence diversity could be associated with virus pathogenicity and/or transmission. In Europe, several countries were associated with specific virus clades or mutations while the frequency in clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients also varied between these countries. It was therefore suggested that genome and patient symptom data should be combined to better understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and help develop adapted treatments [20] .\nA military camp is a semi-enclosed environment with a high population density and contained spaces (e.g., dining halls and recreational spaces) in which many soldiers (e.g., trainers and trainees) and a number of civilians interact. Communal living and training environments are renowned for person-to-person transmission of disease agents, a frequent problem for militaries worldwide [4]. During their entire stay at the Maradi training facility, the 70 Belgian military service men had sporadic contacts with Nigerien civilians (in the camp and in the city of Maradi), but especially the trainers had frequent contacts with 150 Nigerien military trainees (Table 5 ). Other non-Nigerien contacts occurred at least two weeks before the date on which the first COVID-19 cases were presumed to have appeared in Maradi (2 April) and more than six weeks before the onset of COVID-19-like symptoms in the Belgian military service men (30 April-16 May) (Tables 1 and 2). Considering that the incubation period for COVID-19 is currently estimated to be between one and 14 days [22] , it is unlikely that the Belgian soldiers contracted COVID-19 from these non-Nigerien contacts. In fact, the possible window of COVID-19 infection of the Belgian soldiers occurred short after high daily growth increases of COVID-19 cases in Niger (more than doubling for some days) (Figure 4) , as derived from data reported by the ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/ geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases).\nOverall, the data produced by this combined conventional (i.e., contact tracing) and genomic (i.e., African MRCA) epidemiological analysis, suggest that the Belgian soldiers were infected via direct contacts with locals and subsequently among themselves.
