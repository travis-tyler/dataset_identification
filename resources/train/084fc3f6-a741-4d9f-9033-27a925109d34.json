We selected 22 HLA-A2-positive healthy older adults who have relatively short or long telomere lengths to compare their antibody response against the influenza vaccine, and their CD8 + T-cell response against an influenza antigen.\nResults. B cells from individuals with a robust antibody response to the influenza vaccine had significantly longer telomeres than those with a poor antibody response. Monocyte-derived antigen-presenting cells of both short and long telomere groups induced similar expansions of influenza M1-specific CD8 + T cells. Vaccination did not increase M1-specific CD8 + T cells in blood, but M1-specific CD8 + T cells from the long telomere group exhibited significantly greater expansion in vitro than those from the short telomere group. Finally, M1-specific CD8 + T cells that underwent more expansions had significantly longer telomeres than cells with fewer divisions.\nConclusions. Telomere length is positively associated with a robust lymphocyte response, and telomere attrition may contribute to the age-associated decline of adaptive immunity."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The decline in immune function with age is characterized by an increased susceptibility to infectious disease and decreased vaccine efficacy [1, 2] . Studies on the efficacy of the seasonal influenza vaccine show a decline of both humoral and cellular immune responses in older adults [3, 4] . At the cellular level, aging is associated with a decline in the thymic output of naive T cells, in B-cell generation [5] , and in an expansion of incompetent memory T cells [6] . The accumulation of T cells with a reduced proliferative capacity in response to an antigenic challenge is one hallmark of an aging immune system [7, 8] and has been shown in reduced immune response to the influenza vaccine in the elderly [9] [10] [11] . Some explanations have been suggested in regulating T-cell proliferation in aging [12] but the molecular mechanisms underlying the age-associated deficiency of lymphocyte proliferation and function are not fully understood.\nTelomeres are the tips of linear chromosomes composed of tandem TTAGGG repeats and telomere binding proteins [13] [14] [15] . Because conventional DNA polymerase cannot replicate the very ends of chromosomes, each cell division results in a loss of small portions of telomeric DNA. The shortening of telomeres is observed in lymphocytes with cumulative cell divisions [16, 17] , and in advancing age [18, 19] . A substantial telomere loss results in critically shortened telomeres in the cell and is associated with the cessation of cell division or apoptosis in vitro [20] . Because an effective adaptive immune response relies on the clonal expansion to produce large numbers of effector lymphocytes, the role of telomeres in regulating lymphocyte proliferation has become a topic of great interest [21, 22] .\nStudies of altered telomere length and its relationship with telomerase, an enzyme that synthesizes telomeres, in lymphocytes have revealed novel insights. Germinal center B cells derived from the activation of naive B cells express higher levels of telomerase activity and have longer telomere lengths than naive B cells [23, 24] . Telomere attrition occurs in actively dividing and long-term cultured T cells, and shortened telomeres limit the proliferative capacity of cultured T cells [25, 26] . Furthermore, patients infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus have more differentiated T cells in the blood; these T cells have shorter telomeres compared with the healthy controls [27, 28] . Finally, genetic disorders negatively affect telomerase, resulting in short telomeres and defects in the replication of hematopoietic stem cells in vivo [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Collectively, these findings point to the critical role of telomere length in lymphocyte function. However, it remains to be elucidated whether age-associated telomere shortening actually contributes to the decline of the immune response in the elderly.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are commonly used to assess telomere length in humans. Lymphocytes, part of PBMCs, are a heterogeneous population of cells including B and T cells. Furthermore, the lymphocytes that respond to a specific pathogen during an immune response are only a small fraction of lymphocytes. Although the telomere lengths of different types of tissues in an individual seem to be correlated [34] [35] [36] , it is uncertain whether telomere lengths of PBMCs are the same as those of the antigen-specific lymphocytes. Owing to the paucity of antigen-specific lymphocytes in the blood of healthy adults, the impact of telomere length on the antigen-specific lymphocyte response has not been adequately assessed. This is of particular importance, because the decline of a specific immune response to a vaccine or pathogen resulting from the short telomeres of antigen-specific lymphocytes could be one of the earliest signs of overall immune functional decline during aging.\nWe conducted a comparative study of immune response to the influenza vaccine in healthy older adults with either relatively long or short telomeres. Our aim was to determine whether telomere length in older persons indicates their immune competency to respond to influenza. We hypothesized that the telomere length of antigen-specific lymphocytes is a determining factor for the robustness of lymphocyte proliferation and function."}, {"section_title": "PARTICIPANTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Subjects", "text": "This study protocol was approved by the National Institute on Aging Institutional Review Board.

All of them were aged >70 years and HLA-A2 positive and had no obvious chronic illness. The general demographic information for these subjects is summarized in Table 1 . All subjects were given the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Blood samples were obtained before and 21 and 84 days after vaccination; all measurements were conducted in an observer-blind manner.\nWe first compared the influenza-specific antibody response between short and long telomere groups. Influenza-specific antibodies were measured from the serum samples of subjects at each visit using World Health Organization HAI test kits (years 2010 and 2011).

Monocytes were isolated from the blood of the participants and differentiated into APCs in vitro. APCs were then pulsed with an influenza-specific antigen (matrix peptide, M1-61-65) and incubated with the control CD8 + T cells from a healthy HLA-A2-positive participant for 7 days. The induced CD8 + T-cell responses were measured by their expansion using flow cytometry and cell counts. We found no significant difference in the expansion of M1-specific CD8 + T cells between the short and the long telomere groups before or after vaccination (Figure 2) . Monocytes are terminally differentiated cells, and their differentiation to APCs does not require cell division; thus, it is not surprising that the function of monocyte-APC function is comparable between the short and long telomere subjects. in the presence of interleukin 2 for 3 days. Proliferation was measured by the live cell count before and after in vitro stimulation. We observed a similar proliferative response of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in short and long telomere groups ( Figure 3C ), and no obvious differences in cell death between these groups, as judged by the percentage of live cells at harvest ( Figure 3D ). To assess influenza-specific (M1)-CD8 + T cells after vaccination, we analyzed the M1-specific CD8 + T cells in the blood and found that the percentages of M1-specific CD8 + T cells were similar before and 21 day after vaccination in both telomere groups. A slight increase in the percentage of M1-specific T cells was found at day 84 in the long telomere but not the short telomere group (Figure 4A and 4B). When 2 postvaccine time points were combined, the frequency of M1-specific CD8 + T cells did not differ significantly between telomere groups.\nTo determine whether the proliferative capacity of M1-specific CD8 + T cells was related to the telomere length, we applied the APCs/M1 peptide system (APCs were derived from monocytes of a healthy HLA-A2-positive subject, irradiated, ad then pulsed with the M1 peptide) to stimulate isolated CD8 + T cells from participants at each visit. M1-specific CD8 + T cells were analyzed with flow cytometry at day 7, and the percentages of live cells after stimulation were comparable in the long and short telomere groups ( Figure 5A ).

We found that (1) the antibody titer against the influenza vaccine is significantly higher in subjects whose B cells had longer telomeres; (2) there was no differences in monocyte-derived APC function or in the frequency of M1-specific CD8 + T cells in the blood before or 21 days after vaccination between short and long telomere groups; (3) M1-specific CD8 + T cells from long telomere subjects had a mean of 1.6 more PDs than those from the short telomere subjects; and (4) robustly expanded M1-specific CD8 + T cells had significantly longer telomeres than little-expanded M1-specific CD8 + T cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that telomere length is positively associated with B-and T-cell responses to the influenza vaccine/antigen in older subjects and suggest that telomere attrition with age may contribute to the age-associated decline of adaptive immune functions.\nOld humans display a great heterogeneity in immune competency against various infections. Characterizing the immune phenotype of aging will be valuable for improving the efficacy of vaccination and predicting the potential outcome of the immune response to infection. Studies of elderly individuals with a reduced antibody response to influenza vaccine show an association with increased CD28 \u2212 CD8 + T cells and expanded CMV reactive CD8 + T cells in blood [9] [10] [11] . In the current study, we did not find such changes between the long and the short telomere groups. Instead, we observed that the titers of anti-influenza antibody after vaccination were positively correlated with the telomere length of B cells. Although there was no significant difference in frequency of M1-specific CD8 + T cells in blood after vaccination between the long and the short telomere groups, we observed that the expansion of CD8 + T cells specific to influenza M1 antigen in vitro was also positively correlated with the telomere length of these CD8 + T cells. Because CD28 Telomere lengths in lymphocytes differ between B and T cells [19] and among different T-cell subsets [25, 42, 45] . Although the telomere length of PBMCs is useful for identifying general telomere lengths in an individual, determining telomere length in defined cell populations enables a close assessment of the role of telomere length in the proliferative response of that lymphocyte population. It is interesting to note that the correlation of telomere length between PBMCs and lymphocytes (B cells or M1-specific CD8 + T cells) was weaker than the that between B cells and M1-specific CD8 + T cells (data not shown). This highlights the importance of directly measuring telomere length for the defined type of cells when a specific lymphocyte response is under study. Difficulty in measuring telomere length in low-frequency antigen-specific lymphocytes has been a major barrier for assessing the role of telomeres in the age-associated decline of adaptive immune functions. Here we showed that the telomere length in B cells and in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells is indicative of the competency of the B-and T-cell response. However, it remains to be determined whether B cells or plasma cells that produce antibodies against the influenza virus/vaccine have longer telomeres and how various lengths of telomeres of influenza-specific T cells affect their response during a real influenza infection. Such information should reveal a more detailed portrait of T-cell response to different pathogens and could provide a framework for choosing different clinical interventions as a basis for personalized medicine."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Data", "text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org).
