Although this report cannot fully address this question, a descriptive look at this subgroup helps determine whether and how these students behaved differently from their full-time counterparts and other part-time peers in postsecondary education and what factors were related to degree completion.

The remaining 16 percent changed their enrollment status during the year. According to these enrollment patterns, this report classified students into three groups: exclusively full-time Executive Summary iv students, exclusively part-time students, and students with mixed enrollment intensity (regardless of whether they started as part-time students and subsequently changed to full-time students or vice versa). Exclusively part-time students differed from their full-time peers in many respects. Compared with exclusively full-time students, exclusively part-time students tended to be older, female, Hispanic, financially independent, and firstgeneration students (i.e., their parents did not attend college) (figure A). 1 They also tended to 1 All comparisons made in the report were tested using Student's t statistic.

Students with mixed enrollment intensity typically fell in between these two groups, with some characteristics similar to those of exclusively full-time students (e.g., type of high school diploma and educational expectations) and others similar to those of exclusively part-time students (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, and remedial coursetaking). Part-time students who looked like full-time students appeared to be relatively advantaged when compared with other part-time students: they were more likely to be White, have welleducated parents, come from high-income families (for dependent students only), and expect to earn an advanced degree in the future, and they were less likely to be Black and have taken remedial courses (figure B). In addition, part-time students who looked like full-time students were more likely than other part-time students to be male. Comparing part-time students who looked like full-time students to their full-time counterparts revealed both similarities and differences: they were slightly more likely than exclusively full-time students to be Hispanic, but less likely to be Black, and were more likely to come from families where parents held bachelor's or higher degrees and to have taken remedial courses after high school. The two groups could not be distinguished in terms of their gender distribution, family income (for dependent students only), and educational expectations."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Characteristics", "text": "Several enrollment characteristics distinguished exclusively part-time students from their full-time peers. For example, a majority of exclusively part-time students (64 percent) attended public 2-year institutions, compared with 25 percent of exclusively fulltime students (figure C). On the other hand, exclusively full-time students were more likely than exclusively part-time students to attend public or private 4-year doctoral institutions (33 vs. 11 percent). Consistent with their high concentrations in public 2-year institutions, exclusively part-time students were more likely than full-time students to be enrolled in an associate's degree program or not be in any degree/certificate program and much less likely to be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program. In addition, 31 percent of exclusively part-time students did not have a major field of study, compared with 16 percent of exclusively full-time students. Although they somewhat resembled full-time students with respect to their demographics, family backgrounds, and educational expectations, part-time students who looked like full-time students retained many enrollment characteristics associated with part-time attendance, such as the tendency to attend 2-year colleges, enroll in subbaccalaureate or nondegree/certificate programs, and not have a Executive Summary vi major field of study (figure D). These enrollment characteristics are generally associated with lower persistence and attainment rates in postsecondary education (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Combining Work and School", "text": "Another important factor that distinguished part-time students from their full-time peers was employment. In 2003-04, 83 percent of exclusively part-time undergraduates worked while enrolled, more than one-half (53 percent) of them worked full time, and 47 percent considered themselves primarily employees (figure E). Although a majority of full-time students worked while enrolled (73 percent), just under one-fourth (23 percent) worked full time and 14 percent considered themselves primarily employees. Compared with exclusively part-time students, working intensity tended to be lower for part-time students who looked like full-time students: 21 percent held a full-time job while enrolled (not significantly different from the 23 percent of full-time students who did so); 11 percent considered themselves primarily employees (lower than the 14 percent of fulltime students); and 69 percent considered themselves primarily students (higher than the 59 percent of full-time students). These patterns Executive Summary vii suggest that many students in this subgroup placed more importance on study than work. Why did students work? Among students who worked but considered themselves primarily students, financial concerns appeared to be the dominant reason for working: 63 percent worked to help pay their tuition, fees, and living expenses, and 24 percent worked to earn some spending money. Less than 1 in 10 (7 percent) reported that they worked to gain job experience. Exclusively part-time students were especially concerned about their financial situations: 72 percent cited paying tuition, fees, or living expenses as the most important reason for working, compared with 59 percent of fulltime students. However, part-time students who looked like full-time students were less likely than full-time students to cite this reason (55 vs. 60 percent). Although 35 percent of those who considered themselves primarily students thought that working helped them with career preparation, fewer (14 percent) said that it helped them with coursework. On the other hand, between 31 and 48 percent said that working restricted their academic choices including class schedule, number of classes taken, and access to school facilities, and 41 percent reported that it had a negative effect on their grades. Exclusively parttime students were more likely than full-time students to report these problems. Part-time students who looked like full-time students were  Exclusively full-time students Part-time students who looked like full-time students Other part-time students Executive Summary ix persistence. Looking at 1995-96 beginning students who attended school exclusively part time for the duration of their enrollment through 2000-01, 15 percent had completed a degree or certificate by 2001; none had earned a bachelor's degree; 27 percent persisted (either had earned a degree or were still enrolled); a total of 73 percent had left without earning a degree; and 46 percent had left during the first year (figure F). In contrast, 64 percent of exclusively full-time students had completed a degree or certificate, 44 percent had earned a bachelor's degree, 72 percent persisted, 28 percent had left without a degree, and 12 percent had left during the first year. Although part-time students who looked like full-time students appeared to be more successful than other parttime students with respect to these same outcomes, they lagged behind their full-time counterparts in overall degree attainment (45 vs. 64 percent) and bachelor's degree completion (25 vs. 44 percent). Part-time enrollment was negatively associated with students' postsecondary outcomes even after controlling for a wide range of related factors, including students' demographic and family backgrounds, academic preparation, and enrollment and employment characteristics. Regardless of whether they Executive Summary x looked like full-time students, exclusively parttime students lagged far behind their full-time peers in terms of overall degree completion, bachelor's degree completion, and persistence toward a degree after controlling for many related factors. Mixed enrollment students also lagged behind their full-time peers with respect to bachelor's degree completion, although significant differences in their rates for overall degree attainment and persistence could not be detected after controlling for related factors. Were factors related to degree attainment and persistence consistent across student groups? To address this question, separate commonality analyses were conducted for full-time students, part-time students who looked like full-time students, and other part-time students. The results of these analyses reveal both similarities and differences among these groups of students. First, across all three groups, some factors consistently had a negative association with students' postsecondary outcomes. These factors reflect poor academic preparation (i.e., remedial coursetaking and low scores on college entrance examinations), low commitment to postsecondary education (i.e., taking breaks in enrollment, low expectations for postsecondary education), concentrations in subbaccalaureate degree programs, and priority given to work  xi over study (i.e., students always considering themselves as employees or changing their primary role from students to employees). It is noteworthy that although students who took breaks in their enrollment had lower rates of degree attainment across all three groups, these students consistently had higher rates of persistence. Not all factors were consistently related to students' postsecondary outcomes across all three groups of students. For example, gender was a significant factor (favoring females) for full-time students, but not for the two subgroups of part-time students. Full-time students who initially attended private doctoral institutions had better postsecondary outcomes than their peers who entered public doctoral institutions; however, for the two subgroups of part-time students, those initially attending private 4-year nondoctoral institutions had better outcomes than those who entered public doctoral institutions. Full-time students without degree goals had lower rates of degree attainment than those with bachelor's degree expectations; but this pattern was not observed among the two subgroups of part-time students (i.e., nondegree and bachelor's degree seekers both had relatively low rates of degree completion). In summary, while some factors had consistent relationships with postsecondary outcomes across all three groups, others did not. This information may be useful to postsecondary administrators in assisting them to design programs to help various groups of students persist in their postsecondary studies and attain a degree."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Part-time undergraduates, especially exclusively part-time students, were at a distinct disadvantage relative to those who were enrolled full time: they came from minority and lowincome family backgrounds; they were not as well-prepared for college as their full-time peers; they were highly concentrated in 2-year colleges and nondegree/certificate programs; and many of them worked full time while enrolled, placed a priority on work over study, and did not enroll continuously. In addition, the report found that part-time enrollment was negatively associated with longterm persistence and degree attainment even after controlling for a wide range of factors related to these outcomes. This was the case even for the group of students with characteristics that fit the typical profile of a full-time student (i.e., age 23 or younger, financially dependent on parents, graduated from high school with a regular diploma, and received financial help from parents to pay for postsecondary education); regardless of whether they resembled full-time students, part-time students (especially exclusively part-time students) lagged behind their full-time peers in terms of their postsecondary outcomes even after controlling for a variety of related factors. xii"}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report uses data from the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2004) to provide a profile of part-time undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions in 2003-04. The NPSAS survey, which is carried out every 4 years, targets the population of all students in Title IV institutions in the United States and Puerto Rico between July 1 and June 30 in a given academic year. It provides detailed information about undergraduate and graduate/first-professional students in terms of their demographic characteristics, postsecondary experiences, and financial aid. This report uses data collected from about 80,000 undergraduates who were enrolled in postsecondary education at any time between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004. In addition to data from NPSAS:2004, the report also uses longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample in the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) to examine associations between part-time enrollment and education outcomes (i.e., persistence and degree completion) 6 years after beginning postsecondary education. The BPS:96/01 focuses on students identified in NPSAS:96 as first-time beginning students in postsecondary education in 1995-96 and covers their experiences over 6 academic years. The survey provides rich information about the rates at which these students attained degrees, transferred to other institutions, and left postsecondary education without attaining any degree. This report used a sample of about 9,000 BPS students who participated in the initial survey in 1996 and the last survey in 2001.

In fall 2004, approximately 5.5 million undergraduate students were enrolled part time, making up 37 percent of the undergraduate enrollment in all degree-granting postsecondary institutions (U.S. Department of Education 2006). The part-time enrollment rates are much higher if one looks at students' enrollment data over a longer period of time. For instance, an examination of enrollment intensity over the entire 1999\u22122000 academic year reveals that 51 percent of undergraduates were enrolled part time for some or all of that year (Horn, Peter, and Rooney 2002). In addition, an examination of enrollment data of beginning postsecondary students who began in 1995-96 and who were subsequently followed up 6 years later (in 2000-01) indicates that 53 percent of these students had attended school part time at least once over this 6-year period (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002). The sizeable part-time population has drawn much attention in recent policy discussions on postsecondary education, and students' enrollment status has been used as a standard variable in predicting outcomes by the research community (Adelman 1999;Borden 2004;Davies 1999;Pascarella and Terenzini 1998). Although many undergraduates attend part time at some time during their college enrollment, those who attend part time rather than full time share some distinctive characteristics. Earlier research showed that part-time students are more likely than full-time students to be older, Hispanic, married, and financially independent (McCormick, Geis, and Vergun 1995;Hearn 1992). Part-time students were also found to be more likely than full-time students to attend less-than-4-year colleges, enroll in lower degree programs, and work full time while enrolled, and they were less likely to receive financial aid. Partly reflecting these conditions, part-time students were more likely than full-time students to interrupt their enrollment, prolong their time to a degree, or terminate their studies prematurely without earning any degree (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002;Carroll 1989;O'Toole, Stratton, and Wetzel 2003). Because persisting in college and completing a degree are one of the important goals of college education, the lower rates of persistence and degree attainment among part-time students are of serious concern to postsecondary institutions, state and federal policymakers, and researchers. postsecondary institutions in the 2003-04 academic year. 1 It also uses longitudinal data from the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) to examine the persistence and degree attainment of students 6 years after they initially enrolled in college. While providing an overall picture of part-time students, this report also takes a closer look at a subgroup of part-time students with characteristics similar to the profile of a typical full-time student-that is, who were of traditional college age (i.e., age 23 or younger when beginning college), financially dependent on their parents, graduated from high school with a regular diploma, and received help from their parents to pay for higher education. This analysis is intended to examine whether and how this subgroup behaved differently from their full-time and other part-time peers with respect to enrollment, employment, and subsequent persistence and attainment. The findings of this report provide a further understanding of part-time students and certain conditions that promote or hinder their success in postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The reminder of this report is divided into four main sections. The first section provides an overview of the demographic characteristics, family backgrounds, and academic preparation of part-time students. Following this initial overview, this section introduces the subgroup of parttime students who \"looked like\" full-time students. The next section examines enrollment-related characteristics of part-time students, including the type of institution attended, degree program, major field of study, and enrollment duration. The third section focuses on how part-time students combined school and work and how these concurrent activities were associated with their postsecondary experiences. The last section of the report provides an analysis of the rates of persistence and degree attainment of part-time students and concludes with multivariate commonality analyses of these outcomes after taking various interrelated factors into account. aid received, and the net price of attendance after aid. This report uses data collected from about 80,000 undergraduates who were enrolled at any time between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004 in about 1,300 postsecondary institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These students represent about 19 million undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the 2003-04 academic year. More information about NPSAS:2004 can be found in appendix B. In addition to data from NPSAS:2004, this study uses longitudinal data from the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) to provide information on the persistence and degree attainment of a nationally representative sample of students who began their postsecondary education in 1995\u221296. Approximately 12,000 students (representing about 3 million first-time beginning students) were first interviewed in 1996 when they initially enrolled in college. These students were interviewed again in 1998, 3 years after they had started postsecondary education; and interviewed for the last time in 2001, 6 years after their initial college entry. BPS:96/01, which covers the experiences of first-time beginning students over 6 academic years, provides rich information about the rates at which these students attained degrees, transferred to other institutions, and left postsecondary education without attaining any degree. To determine persistence and attainment rates over this 6-year period, this report selects a sample of about 9,000 students who participated in the initial survey in 1996 and the last survey in 2001. More information about BPS:96/01 can be found in appendix B. This report focuses on the comparisons between students with different enrollment patterns. All comparisons made in the report were tested using Student's t statistic. All differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level. In addition, this report uses multiple linear regressions (referred to as \"commonality analysis\") to explore the unique relationship between one particular independent variable (e.g., enrollment intensity) and outcome variable (e.g., degree completion) after controlling for all other factors or independent variables. Appendix B provides more information about these methods. Standard errors for all estimates are available at http://nces.ed.gov/das/library/reports.asp. Results of this study should be interpreted with caution because this report is descriptive in nature and was not designed to test an underlying theoretical model. For example, many comparisons revealed significant differences between two or more subgroups of students. However, these comparisons do not account for complex interrelationships among variables and significant differences may disappear after controlling for other factors. Even though this report uses the commonality analysis to take into account the interrelations among the variables when looking for unique associations between particular dependent and independent variables, causality cannot be inferred. Furthermore, some independent variables are measured at a particular time and do not reflect possible changes in these variables that may affect whether or not a student can and does persist toward degree completion (e.g., dependent students may become independent or vice versa; work intensity may change). Finally, many variables included in the analysis are self-reported and more accurate measures might reveal associations that are not evident in the current report."}, {"section_title": "Part-Time Undergraduates in Postsecondary Education", "text": "Part-time students are typically identified by their enrollment intensity at a single point in time in a given academic year. For example, as reported in The Condition of Education 2006, 37 percent of undergraduates in degree-granting 2-and 4-year postsecondary institutions were parttime students in fall 2004 (U.S. Department of Education 2006). Some researchers have argued that the estimate for a single point in time tends to understate the prevalence of part-time enrollment because it does not take into account the fact that many students change their enrollment status during the course of their studies (Adelman 1999). Using a time frame of 1 academic year in 1989-90, McCormick, Geis, and Vergun (1995) found that 14 percent of undergraduates changed their enrollment status at least once during the year. They also found that students who made this change did not entirely resemble those who always kept the same enrollment status. In order to examine the population of part-time students and their postsecondary experience in detail, this report uses the pattern of students' enrollment over a full year to identify part-time students. Based on students' reports of their enrollment status from July 2003 through June 2004, students can be classified into three groups: exclusively full time (i.e., enrolled full time only during the entire enrollment duration 2 ), exclusively part time (i.e., enrolled part time only during the entire enrollment duration), and mixed (indicating a change in enrollment status during the academic year). Using this approach, 49 percent of undergraduates were identified as exclusively full-time students in 2003-04, 35 percent were identified as exclusively part-time students, and 16 percent were identified as students with mixed full-time and part-time enrollment 3 (figure 1)."}, {"section_title": "Demographic and Academic Characteristics", "text": "Many findings from this study of part-time undergraduates in 2003-04 were consistent with an earlier report that profiled part-time undergraduates in 1989-90 (McCormick, Geis, and Vergun 1995).

Consistent with their age differences, exclusively part-time students were also more likely than exclusively fulltime students to be financially independent (75 vs. 35 percent), married (36 vs. 17 percent), and have one or more dependents (39 vs. 27 percent). Among independent students, exclusively part-time students were more likely than their full-time counterparts to have earnings in the top 25 percent of the income distribution (32 vs. 15 percent), reflecting in part their differences related to employment (see the section, \"Combining School and Work\"). Among dependent students, however, exclusively part-time students were more likely than their full-time counterparts to come from low-income families (28 vs. 24 percent) (table 1), and correspondingly they were less likely to receive financial help from their parents to pay for such costs as tuition and fees, education expenses, housing, and other living expenses (figure 2).

Students with mixed enrollment intensity tended to fall in between the two groups of exclusively full-time and part-time students.

For students who attended less-than-4-year institutions or were not enrolled in any degree or certificate program, it is informative to examine the reasons why they pursued postsecondary education. As shown in table 6, the reasons most frequently cited by these students included pursuing personal interest or enrichment (47 percent), learning job skills (42 percent), completing an associate's degree (38 percent), and transferring to a 4-year institution (34 percent). Both exclusively part-time and full-time students were more likely than mixed enrollment students to indicate that they were enrolled in college for personal interest or enrichment or to learn job skills, whereas the latter group was more likely to cite the reason of earning an associate's degree or transferring to a 4-year institution.

Among part-time students who looked like full-time students, the percentage of those with no major field of study remained high (22 percent overall and 31 percent for those who were exclusively part time).

This reflects the fact that students must have attended two terms for a change in enrollment status, while those who attended for only one term are necessarily assigned to one of the exclusive categories. Exclusively full-time students were enrolled for 9 months, equivalent to one academic year. 6 Exclusively part-time students were enrolled for fewer months than the other two groups, averaging 7 months. This pattern held among part-time students who looked like full-time students as well as other part-time students. Exclusively full-time students Part-time students who looked like full-time students Other part-time students Short enrollment duration may indicate three possible outcomes: early degree completion, late entry, stopout or dropout behavior, or nondegree enrollment in which students finish their program in a single term or semester (McCormick, Geis, and Vergun 1995). By focusing attention on first-and second-year students who began in the fall and were enrolled in a degree program, shorter enrollment likely indicates stopout or dropout behavior. The differences in enrollment duration described above remained after these sample restrictions (table 8), suggesting that exclusively part-time students may have been more likely than full-time students or those with mixed enrollment intensity to stop out or drop out.

For example, younger and dependent students (particularly those from high-income families) were less likely than older and independent students to work full time. Previous studies have indicated that some students report that working while enrolled helps them with their coursework and preparation for their future careers, but other students reported that working compromises the quality of their college experience and represents a barrier to advancing academically (Horn 1994;Hudson and Hurst 2002;King and Bannon 2002).

Although a majority of exclusively full-time students (73 percent) worked while enrolled, just under one-fourth (23 percent) worked full time and 14 percent considered themselves primarily employees. For students with mixed enrollment intensity, their employment rate, work intensity, and perceived primary roles were more like those of exclusively full-time students than those of exclusively part-time students. Working intensity was significantly reduced among part-time students who looked like full-time students: 21 percent had a full-time job while enrolled (not measurably different from the 23 percent of full-time students); the number of hours they worked per week was 26 hours, on average (not significantly different from full-time students); 11 percent considered themselves primarily employees (lower than 14 percent of full-time students); and 69 percent considered themselves primarily students (higher than the 59 percent of full-time students). These results suggest that many of these students may have placed more emphasis on study than work. Unlike part-time students who looked like full-time students, other part-time students had a heavy work load: 83 percent worked while enrolled, 53 percent of them worked full time, and their average work week was 35 hours. In addition, more of them considered themselves primarily employees than students (47 vs. 36 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Reasons for and Effects of Working While Enrolled", "text": "Why did students work? This question was asked of those who worked but considered themselves primarily students. According to their responses, financial concerns appeared to be the dominant reason for working: 63 percent worked to help pay tuition, fees, and living expenses, and 24 percent worked to earn some spending money (table 10). Less than 1 in 10 (7 percent) cited that they worked to gain job experience. Exclusively part-time students were more likely than exclusively full-time students to cite paying tuition, fees, or living expenses as a reason for working (72 vs. 59 percent), whereas exclusively full-time students were more likely to cite earning spending money (29 vs. 15 percent). However, among students who looked like full-time students, the percentage who cited paying college-related expenses as a reason for working was reduced: 55 percent cited this reason, compared with 59 percent of exclusively full-time students and 76 percent of other parttime students. Students who worked while enrolled but considered themselves primarily students were also asked about the impact of employment on their study. Overall, their responses indicated more limitations than benefits. Although some students reported that working helped them with career preparation (35 percent), a smaller percentage (14 percent) thought that it helped them with coursework (table 11). On the other hand, between 31 and 48 percent thought that employment limited their class schedule (48 percent), reduced the number of classes they could take (40 percent), restricted their choice of classes (34 percent), and limited their access to the facility (31 percent). In addition, 41 percent reported that working had a negative effect on their grades. Students who attended part time for all or some of their enrollment in 2003\u221204 were more likely than their full-time peers to report each of these limitations of working. Part-time students who looked like full-time students were also more likely than exclusively full-time students to report various limits imposed by their employment. In addition, the likelihood of reporting each problem was highest among other part-time students, which was not a surprising result given the amount of time they worked each week (table 9).

This section examines these two outcomes. Unlike earlier research that typically treated part-time students as one group (McCormick, Geis, and Vergun 1995;O'Toole, Stratton, and Wetzel 2003), this analysis divides part-time students into various subgroups and compares their persistence and degree attainment among themselves and with those of full-time students. The findings of this analysis provide useful information about the experiences of part-time students that may be related to their outcomes in postsecondary education. Persistence and degree attainment are best studied using longitudinal data. For this purpose, data from the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) are used here to examine the rates of persistence and degree attainment of students 6 years after they entered postsecondary education. Since BPS:96/01 covers a longer interval of enrollment data than the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2004), one would expect to see more mixed enrollment students (indicating a change in enrollment status) in the BPS cohort than in the NPSAS:2004. As shown in figure 6, some 41 percent of BPS:96/01 students were identified as mixed enrollment students over 6 years, higher than the 16 percent of NPSAS:2004 students. Overall, 59 percent of BPS:96/01 students maintained the same enrollment status for the duration of their enrollment from 1995-96 through 2000-01: 47 percent were enrolled exclusively full time, and 12 percent were enrolled exclusively part time. Like part-time students in NPSAS:2004, part-time students in BPS:96/01 were distinguished from full-time students based on age, dependency status, type of high school diploma obtained, and whether they received financial help from their parents at the time of their initial enrollment. Because BPS:96/01 includes only students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96, it contains a higher proportion of young and dependent students 8 and, therefore, a higher proportion of part-time students who looked like full-time students than the NPSAS:2004 population discussed above. As shown in figure 7, among 1995\u221296 beginning students who had attended school part time at least once over 6 years, 47 percent were classified as part-time students who looked like full-time students, a higher proportion than the 25 percent of part-time students in NPSAS:2004. Students with mixed enrollment intensity were more likely than exclusively part-time students to be classified as parttime students who looked like full-time students (56 vs. 15 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Degree Attainment and Persistence After 6 Years", "text": "Consistent with earlier research (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002;Carroll 1989;O'Toole, Stratton, and Wetzel 2003), part-time enrollment was negatively associated with long-term degree attainment and persistence.

In contrast, 64 percent of exclusively full-time students had earned a degree or certificate, 44 percent had earned a bachelor's degree, and 28 percent had left without a degree.

Part-time students who looked like full-time students appeared to be more successful than other part-time students with respect to these outcomes: 45 versus 34 percent completed a degree, 25 versus 7 percent earned a bachelor's degree, 24 versus 18 percent were still enrolled, and 31 versus 49 percent left without a degree (table 12).

About 27 percent of exclusively part-time students 9 Persistence is measured by the sum of the percentage who had attained a degree or certificate by 2001 and the percentage who were still enrolled by 2001. Thus, the persistence rate is 72 percent (64+6+2) for exclusively full-time students and 69 percent (46+14+9) for part-time students who looked like full-time students. persisted (i.e., still enrolled or had attained a degree) 6 years after their initial entry, a proportion that was substantially lower than the 72 percent for their full-time peers. Looking at the pattern of annual attrition rates reveals that the first year was the most common time for students to leave postsecondary education. Nearly half of exclusively part-time students (46 percent) left college during their first year, compared with 12 percent of exclusively full-time students. Only 3 percent of students with mixed enrollment intensity left in the first year, which was the lowest rate among the three groups. However, mixed enrollment students had somewhat higher attrition rates than full-time students starting in the third year. As a group, part-time students who looked like full-time students had lower first-year attrition rates than other part-time students and exclusively full-time students (4 vs. 20 and 12 percent, respectively). However, considerable differences existed among part-time students who looked like full-time students: a total of 62 percent of those who attended school exclusively on a part-time basis left during their first 3 years, a rate that was much higher than that among those with mixed enrollment intensity (13 percent). For both groups, attrition rates peaked in the third year and declined subsequently. Factors Related to Degree Attainment and Persistence The tabular analyses described above show that part-time enrollment was associated with many demographic, academic, enrollment, and employment characteristics as well as long-term persistence and degree attainment. Although these relationships are informative, they are bivariate and may reflect more complex relationships among multiple factors. For example, the data in table 12 indicate that exclusively part-time students were less likely than exclusively fulltime students to attain a degree. This may be due to the fact that the latter group had family and academic backgrounds that were relatively advantaged, which may have had positive effects on their long-term persistence and degree completion. Because the independent variables included  1995-1996-1997-1998-1999-2000- in this study are interrelated, it may be useful to examine the unique relationships between each independent variable and each dependent variable (i.e., persistence and degree completion) after controlling for the shared, or common, variability among the independent variables included in the analysis. This approach is sometimes referred to as \"commonality analysis,\" in which a multiple linear regression is used to look at the relationship between an independent variable and an outcome variable while adjusting for the common variation among a group of independent variables. It should be noted that commonality analyses conducted in this study are descriptive in nature and are not designed to test an underlying theoretical model. A significant coefficient for a particular independent variable only indicates the unique relationship between this independent variable and the dependent variable when other independent variables are controlled. It does not imply causality. For the purpose of this study, commonality analyses were performed on three outcomes for 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students: overall degree completion rate, bachelor's degree completion rate, and persistence to a degree. Four commonality analyses were performed for each outcome variable, controlling for the common variation among all independent variables included in the analysis. The first analysis used the entire student sample and focused on the independent relationship of students' enrollment intensity to three outcome variables. The results of this analysis reveal persistence and degree attainment rates for each part-time subgroup relative to those of full-time students after controlling for other factors. The next three analyses restricted the sample to exclusively full-time students, part-time students who looked like full-time students, and other part-time students, respectively. 10 The results of these analyses help identify whether the factors related to full-time students' persistence and degree attainment are different from those for the two subgroups of part-time students. The commonality analyses included the following independent variables: demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, dependency status, and family socioeconomic status); 11 academic characteristics (type of high school diploma, remedial coursetaking, SAT composite test scores, and education expectations); enrollment characteristics (type of institution when first enrolled, degree program when first enrolled, major field of study when first enrolled, and enrollment continuity and intensity through 2001); 12 and employment characteristics (employment status when first enrolled and primary role perceived). Table 14 presents the least squares coefficients from the commonality analyses that examined students' likelihood of earning any degree or certificate, earning a bachelor's degree, and persisting toward a degree over a period of 6 years after they had first entered college. These coefficients represent the difference (either higher or lower) in percentage points that might be expected between the analysis group (e.g., female students) and the comparison group (e.g., male students) after controlling for the interrelationships of all other independent variables included in the analysis. Comparison groups are shown in italics. Significant coefficients (indicated by asterisks) mean that the observed differences in the likelihood of achieving an outcome between the comparison groups and the analysis groups remain even after taking into account the covariation of all other independent variables included in the analysis.

In particular, regardless of whether they resembled full-time students, exclusively part-time students significantly lagged behind their full-time peers in terms of overall degree completion, bachelor's degree completion, and persistence toward a degree even after controlling for many factors related to these outcomes. Regardless of their resemblance to full-time students, mixed enrollment students also lagged behind their full-time peers with respect to bachelor's degree completion, but their rates of overall degree attainment and persistence were not significantly different after controlling for other factors. Two implications can be drawn from these results. First, the extent of students' part-time enrollment (i.e., exclusively versus partially) was related to their postsecondary outcomes. Exclusively part-time students fared poorly in comparison with partially part-time students in terms of postsecondary persistence and degree completion. Second, the results indicate that possessing some characteristics common to full-time students did not guarantee that part-time students would be as likely to attain a degree or to persist in college as their full-time peers. Besides enrollment intensity, several other independent variables were also consistently related to postsecondary outcomes. After controlling for other related factors, students who entered college without any degree goal, had ever taken remedial courses after high school, performed poorly on college entrance examinations, worked full time while enrolled in the first year, and always considered themselves primarily employees or changed their primary role from students to employees were less likely than their corresponding comparison groups (shown in italics) to attain a degree or certificate, to earn a bachelor's degree, and to persist toward a degree.

Several independent variables were primarily related to bachelor's degree completion.

The results presented in table 15 led to several conclusions. First, factors that were significant for full-time students were not necessarily significant for part-time students after controlling for all related factors. For example, gender was a significant factor (favoring female students) for full-time students, but not for the two subgroups of part-time students. Among full-time students, those who entered college without any degree goal had lower degree attainment and persistence rates than their peers with a bachelor's degree goal; however, such differences were not replicated for the two subgroups of part-time students (i.e., those without degree goals and those seeking a bachelor's degree had similarly low rates of degree completion). Performance on college entrance examinations were significantly associated with full-time students' overall degree attainment and persistence, but it was a significant factor in bachelor's degree attainment only for the two subgroups of part-time students. In addition, full-time students who initially attended private not-for-profit doctoral institutions had better postsecondary outcomes than their peers who entered public doctoral institutions; however, among the two subgroups of part-time students, those who initially attended private not-for-profit nondoctoral institutions had a higher bachelor's degree completion rate than those who entered public doctoral institutions. There were, however, several conditions that were consistently associated with postsecondary outcomes for all three subgroups. For example, remedial coursetaking was negatively associated with overall degree attainment and persistence for all three subgroups even after controlling for other related factors.

Across all three subgroups, students who took breaks in their enrollment had lower rates of degree attainment after 6 years, but they had higher rates of persistence. Lower degree attainment and persistence rates were also consistently observed among students who always considered themselves primarily employees rather than students. Finally, some relationships were not consistent across the three subgroups of students. For example, Black students were less successful in their postsecondary outcomes than White students among full-time students and part-time students who looked like full-time students; however, this pattern did not hold among other part-time students. Among part-time students who looked like full-time students, highly disadvantaged students were less likely than their more advantaged peers to earn any degree or a bachelor's degree, but such a relationship was not observed among full-time students and other part-time students. Working full time while enrolled had a negative association with the degree attainment and persistence of full-time students and part-time students who looked like full-time students; however, such association was not found among other part-time students. Working part time while enrolled had a negative relationship to degree attainment only for part-time students who looked like full-time students, not for the other two groups. In summary, while some factors-such as remedial coursetaking, type of degree program, enrollment continuity, and perceived primary role-were consistently related to postsecondary outcomes among all three subgroups, other factors showed different results for each subgroup. This finding may be useful to postsecondary administrators in assisting them to design programs to help various groups of students persist in their postsecondary studies and attain a degree."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Many undergraduate students are enrolled part time in postsecondary education. For example, a snapshot of recent college enrollment data indicates that 37 percent of undergraduates were enrolled part time in fall 2004 (U.S. Department of Education 2006). Using enrollment data covering 1 academic year, this report shows that a majority of undergraduates (51 percent) attended school part time for some or all of their enrollment in 2003-04. Thus, it is evident that part-time enrollment figures prominently in undergraduate education and is expected to continue to do so in the future (Hussar 2005). This report uses data from the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2004) and the 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) to provide insight into part-time students' experiences and outcomes in postsecondary education. However, this report is descriptive and was not designed to test an underlying theoretical model. Thus, readers should bear in mind several caveats when interpreting the results of the study. First, the group differences do not account for complex interrelationships among variables and significant differences may change or disappear after controlling for other factors. Second, even though this report uses the commonality analysis to take into account the interrelations among the variables when looking for unique associations between particular dependent and independent variables, causality cannot be inferred because the variables included in the commonality analysis are not exhaustive. Third, some independent variables are measured at a particular time and do not reflect possible changes in these variables that may affect whether or not a student can and does persist toward degree completion; and many variables included in the analysis are self-reported and more accurate measures might reveal associations that are not evident in the current report. With these limitations in mind, the major findings of the study are summarized below. Part-time students, especially exclusively part-time students, differed from their full-time peers in many respects. For example, compared with full-time students, students who attended school on an exclusively part-time basis were more likely than full-time students to be older, female, Hispanic, married, and financially independent. They were relatively disadvantaged in their family and academic backgrounds, were highly concentrated in public 2-year institutions and subbaccalaureate or nondegree programs, frequently worked full time while enrolled, and had a low level of commitment to college education. Students who had mixed enrollment patterns often fell in between the two groups, with some characteristics similar to those of fulltime students and others to those of exclusively part-time students. In order to provide more information about part-time students, this report further divided part-time students into two subgroups-those who resembled full-time students based on age, dependency status, high school diploma, and whether they received financial help from their parents (referred to as \"part-time students who looked like full-time students\" here), and those who did not have these characteristics (referred to as \"other part-time students\"). Overall, parttime students who looked like full-time students were, on average, more advantaged relative to other part-time students in terms of their family backgrounds, academic preparation, educational expectations, enrollment characteristics, and work intensity. Comparing them with full-time students revealed both similarities and differences. Although they resembled full-time students with respect to their demographics, family backgrounds, and educational expectations, part-time students who looked like full-time students possessed many enrollment characteristics associated with part-time attendance, such as being more likely to enroll in public 2-year colleges, enroll in subbaccalaureate or nondegree programs, have no major field, and take breaks in their enrollment. These enrollment characteristics are generally associated with lower persistence and attainment rates in postsecondary education (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002). The findings of this report showed that part-time enrollment was negatively associated with long-term postsecondary outcomes (persistence and degree attainment). This negative relationship remained even after controlling for a wide range of interrelated factors such as students' demographic and family backgrounds, academic preparation, and enrollment and employment characteristics. Furthermore, the results indicate that possessing characteristics common to full-time students did not guarantee that part-time students would be as successful as their full-time peers. In fact, regardless of whether they resembled full-time students, part-time students-especially exclusively part-time students-lagged far behind their full-time peers in persisting toward and completing a postsecondary degree even after controlling for a variety of related factors. Consistent with earlier reports, this finding indicates that part-time students, especially exclusively part-time students, are at relatively greater risk for not persisting in postsecondary education, and for not completing a degree. Some factors consistently showed negative relationships with degree attainment across various subgroups of students. These factors generally reflected poor academic preparation (i.e., remedial coursetaking and low test scores on college entrance examinations); low commitment to postsecondary education (i.e., having low educational expectations); and priority given to work over education (i.e., always considering themselves as primarily employees). One finding regarding enrollment continuity is worthy of further note: although students who took breaks in their enrollment were more likely to have lower rates of degree attainment than those who did not take breaks, they had higher persistence rates, suggesting that those who took time off, but who subsequently resumed their education, may persist in their efforts to obtain a postsecondary degree. The findings reported here also revealed that not all factors showed consistent relationships across student groups. For example, gender was a significant factor for full-time students, but not for the two subgroups of part-time students. Full-time students who initially attended private notfor-profit doctoral institutions had higher overall and bachelor's degree completion rates than their peers who entered public doctoral institutions; however, for the two subgroups of part-time students, those who initially attended private not-for-profit nondoctoral institutions had higher bachelor's degree completion rates than those who initially attended public doctoral institutions. For full-time students, degree attainment was significantly related to their educational goals; however, this was not evident for the two subgroups of part-time students (i.e., those who were not seeking any degree and those who sought a bachelor's degree had low rates of degree completion). In summary, while some factors bear consistent relationships with postsecondary outcomes across subgroups of students, others did not. Information about the factors that are important to each group is useful to college administrators in tailoring programs for specific groups of students and helping them persist in and complete postsecondary education.

There are some hazards in using statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages, but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in using statistical tests is the possibility of a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference between groups measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is actually no difference between these groups in the full population. The significance level, or alpha, of .05 selected for findings discussed as significant in this report indicates that a difference of the magnitude reported would be produced by chance no more than one time out of 20 with samples of the size used in this study when there was no actual difference in the group means in the full population."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Commonality Analysis", "text": "There are many ways for members of the public and other researchers to make use of NCES results.

Other ways include obtaining and analyzing public use and restricted use data files, which allow researchers to carry out and publish their own secondary analyses of NCES data. It is very important when reading NCES reports to remember that they are descriptive in nature. That is, they are limited to describing some aspect of the condition of education. These results are usefully viewed as suggesting various ideas to be examined further in light of other data, including state and local data, and in the context of the extensive research literature elaborating on the many factors predicting and contributing to educational achievement or to other outcome variables of interest. 6 Ibid."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B-Technical Notes and Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B-8", "text": "However, some readers are tempted to make unwarranted causal inferences from simple cross tabulations. It is never the case that a simple cross tabulation of any variable with a measure of educational achievement is conclusive proof that differences in that variable are a cause of differential educational achievement or that differences in that variable explain any other outcome variable. The old adage that \"correlation is not causation\" is a wise precaution to keep in mind when considering the results of NCES reports. Experienced researchers are aware of the design limitations of many NCES data collections. They routinely formulate multiple hypotheses that take these limitations into account, and readers of this volume are encouraged to do likewise. NCES has a responsibility to try to discourage misleading inferences from the data presented and to educate the public on the genuine difficulty of making valid causal inferences in a field as complex as education. Our reports are carefully worded to achieve this end. This focus on description, eschewing causal analysis, extends to multivariate analyses as well as bivariate ones. Some NCES reports go beyond presenting simple cross tabulations and present results from multiple regression equations that include many different independent (\"predictor\") variables. This can be useful to readers, especially those without the time or training to access the data themselves. Because many of the independent variables included in descriptive reports are related to each other and to the outcome they are predicting, a multivariate approach can help users to understand their interrelation. For example, students' enrollment intensity and employment while enrolled are associated with each other and are both predictors of degree attainment. What happens to the relationship between students' enrollment intensity and degree attainment when students' employment differences are accounted for? Such a question cannot be answered using bivariate techniques alone. One way to answer the question is to create three variable tabulations, a method sometimes used in NCES reports. When the number of independent variables increases to four or more, however, the number of cases in individual cells of such a table often becomes too small to find significant differences simply because there are too few cases to achieve statistical significance. To make economical use of the many available independent variables in the same data display, other statistical methods must be used that can take multiple independent variables into account simultaneously. Multiple linear regression is often used for this purpose: to adjust for the common variation among a list of independent variables. 7 This approach is sometimes referred to as \"commonality analysis,\" 8 because it identifies relationships that remain after adjustment for \"common\" variation. This method is used simply to confirm statistically significant associations observed in Table B-2.-Standard errors for table 14: Least squared coefficients for percentage of 1995-96 beginning  Table B-2.-postsecondary students who had earned a degree or certificate by 2001, percentage who had  Table B-2.-earned a bachelor's degree by 2001, and percentage who persisted through 2001 after  Table B Table B-2.-Standard errors for table 14: Least squared coefficients for percentage of 1995-96 beginning  Table B-1.-postsecondary students who had earned a degree or certificate by 2001, percentage who had  Table B-1.-earned a bachelor's degree by 2001, and percentage who persisted through 2001 after  Table B  Perceived primary role through 2001 Always considering themselves primarily as an employee -6.9 * 2.70 -5.7 * 2.57 -10.9 * 2.32 Shifting from primarily a student to primarily an employee -5.2 * 2.70 -8.9 * 2.77 -6.5 * 2.46 Shifting from primarily an employee to primarily a student 3.9 3.46 -1.6 3.37 1.8 3.00 Always considering themselves primarily as a student \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 Not applicable for the reference group. * p < .05. 1 Persistence is measured by the sum of the percentage who had attained a degree or certificate by 2001 and the percentage who were still enrolled by 2001. 2 Least squares coefficients, multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix B). 3 Standard error of least squares coefficient, adjusted for design effect, multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix B). 4 Black includes African American, Hispanic includes Latino, and Asian/Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian.
