[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether white matter microstructure measured by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides independent information about baseline level or change in executive function (EF) or memory (MEM) in older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Longitudinal data was acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study from phases GO and 2 (2009-2015). ADNI participants included were diagnosed as cognitively normal (n = 46), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 48), late MCI (n = 29), and dementia (n = 39) at baseline. We modeled the association between dMRI-based global white matter mean diffusivity (MD) and baseline level and change in EF and MEM composite scores, in models controlling for baseline bilateral hippocampal volume, regional cerebral FDG PET metabolism and global cerebral AV45 PET uptake. EF and MEM composite scores were measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. In the baseline late MCI and dementia groups, greater global MD was associated with lesser baseline EF, but not EF change nor MEM baseline or change. As expected, lesser hippocampal volume and lesser FDG PET metabolism was associated with greater rates of EF and MEM decline. In ADNI-GO/2 participants, white matter integrity provided independent information about current executive function, but was not sensitive to future cognitive change. Since individuals experiencing executive function declines progress to dementia more rapidly than those with only memory impairment, better biomarkers of future executive function decline are needed.\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.

While episodic memory is the primary cognitive domain measured in cognitive aging, impairment in multiple domains, especially executive function, predicts more rapid progression to dementia Knopman et al., 2015) . However, executive function encompasses a broad set of cognitive skills and is determined by a broad set of neural circuitry. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has the potential to capture broad inter-regional white matter connectivity properties that give rise to successful executive function, and thus is a promising candidate predictor of future executive function declines (Madden et al., 2012; Bennett and Madden, 2014) . dMRI-based covariates are modified by aging, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, and cerebral amyloid in older adults (Chao et al., 2013; van Uden et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Marnane et al., 2016) . In turn, dMRI metrics are associated with measures of executive function cross-sectionally in this population (Grieve et al., 2007; Bennett and Madden, 2014) .\nHowever, the relative time courses of white matter integrity decline and executive function change in aging are not well understood-in particular, it is not known whether diminished dMRI measures at a particular point in time are associated with executive function declines over the near term (for example, over a 1 to 2 year period). In addition, it is not clear whether dMRI provides unique information about executive function, or whether the associations are merely recapitulations of established associations between other biomarkers of aging (such as MRI-based hippocampus volume, cerebral glucose metabolism from (18)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, or amyloid PET uptake) (He et al., NeuroImage: Clinical 14 (2017) [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] \u2606 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) . As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

Prior studies have shown that dMRI measures are associated with concurrent executive functioning Madden et al., 2012; Hedden et al., 2016) , and additional studies have suggested that additional MRI markers of the white matter (predominantly white matter lesion burden from FLAIR) are associated with both concurrent executive functioning and declines over time Madden et al., 2012; Hedden et al., 2016) . More common are studies in the memory domain, with the emerging consensus view that markers from structural MRI (cortical thickness, hippocampal volume) and FDG PET (hypometabolism) predict future declines (Mormino et al., 2009; Crane et al., 2012; Gross et al., 2012; Dore et al., 2013; Wirth et al., 2013a, b) . To our knowledge, the unique value of dMRI as a predictor of concurrent executive functioning or executive function changes has not been fully explored in aging populations with memory impairments.\nTherefore we assessed whether global or regional dMRI measures predict executive function declines in older adults across the range of functioning from normal cognition to dementia. Importantly, we simultaneously account for the contributions of other well-established predictors of memory or executive function-MRI structural measures, cerebral glucose metabolism, and amyloid pathology to executive function-to clearly identify any additive value of dMRI. In this study, we model the effects of these variables on annual change in both episodic memory and executive function within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set. Further, we tested the effects of each predictor within diagnostic groups (cognitively normal, early and late mild cognitive impairment, and dementia) to determine whether the combined group effects were driven by a single group. We hypothesized that white matter microstructure parameters, as measured by dMRI, would add predictive value to executive function, after accounting for other age and disease-associated variables."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Variables included in the ridge regression analyses included DTI FA and MD, mean regional FDG-PET, global AV45-PET, CSF measures of A\u03b2 1-42 and t-tau, hippocampal, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, white matter hyperintensities, and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (see eTable 1 in Supplement for a complete list of variables). Demographic information, diagnosis, APOE \u025b4 genotype, and intracranial vault (ICV) were also included in the ridge regression to model their effects in evaluating the contributions of the imaging measures to cognition. However, these measures were also included in all later analyses regardless of whether they were significant in the ridge regression. Imaging variables from the ridge regression that survived either the ADNI-EF or ADNI-MEM models were retained for further analyses.\nNext, for each composite score, step-wise linear mixed models nested by diagnostic group were built to determine whether any of the imaging variables were associated with baseline scores or modified the rate of change in scores. Every model adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE \u025b4 genotype, and ICV and accounted for random effect of subject. Modifiers of change over time (years) were the selected imaging variables from the ridge regression. All independent variables were fixed baseline-associated values.

Secondary analyses substituted by RD or AxD for MD in Model A to test whether either of these components of MD was significantly associated with the composite scores.\nLastly, the specificity of the association between overall white matter MD and composite scores was tested in two steps. First, the association between composite score and each ROI MD were tested in independent linear mixed models (eTable 4-5 in Supplement). Second, a principal components analysis (PCA) was run on baseline ROI MD to determine subsets of correlated tracts independent of composite scores. Four components were estimated and optimized with varimax rotation.

As with global MD, MD in none of the components predicted ADNI-EF change."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this ADNI sample, global white matter integrity, measured by MD, provided additional predictive value to contemporaneous executive function across all diagnoses, especially with more severe cognitive impairment. Though we tested many metrics of dMRI for white matter integrity, we did not find unique strength in any of these to modify the rate of cognitive decline. Therefore, we lack evidence that global diffusion parameters extracted from single-shell HARDI dMRI technology are promising predictors of two to three year executive function change (Kim et al., 2016) . The temporal disconnect may be due to the time course of age-related white matter integrity decrement, which is estimated at 3% per decade over the life-span (Grieve et al., 2007) . White matter microstructural integrity at baseline may not be sufficiently sensitive to the subtle changes in executive function over this short timeframe.\nPredictors of executive function are important because impairment in this domain increases the likelihood of conversion to dementia (Ewers et al., 2014; Cloutier et al., 2015) . We and others have observed a more apparent relationship between white matter integrity and executive function compared to that with memory (Hedden et al., 2012; Nir et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2015) . The first use of the ADNI-EF composite score with the ADNI-1 cohort demonstrated an association with WMH , but this was not reported in the analysis for the ADNI-MEM composite score (Crane et al., 2012) . The ADNI-EF composite is composed of tasks that test working memory, response generation and inhibition, planning and organizing. These tasks are largely dependent on fluid intelligence, which is thought to be more vulnerable to damage to cortical connectivity, in contrast to crystallized intelligence like episodic memory (Madden et al., 2012; Ritchie et al., 2015) . Agerelated decrement in white matter integrity may be a key factor in executive function performance in older adults, especially in those with comorbid memory impairment. The association between white matter microstructure and executive function observed in the combined groups was driven by those with the most severe memory impairments (late MCI and AD). Thus, the effect of white matter microstructure decrement on executive function may only be apparent in older adults that have other pathological processes impairing cognitive function in this sample which is biased towards those with AD pathology. Of the various mechanistic possibilities raised, impaired connectivity is the most plausible explanation for the association between executive function and white matter integrity. Some DTI network analyses find that decreased nodal or global efficiency correlates with executive function or working memory (Fischer et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016) . Further, we found no distinction between AxD and RD associations with cognition, which suggests that neither axonal degeneration nor demyelination can be ruled out as contributors to lower MD in mild cognitive impairment and dementia (Nir et al., 2013) . Typical age-associated white matter integrity loss is linked to changes in myelination without microglia activation or axonal injury-correlated with change in RD alone (Peters, 2002) . In the presence of Alzheimer's-type pathology, axonal injury also compromises white matter integrity as measured by AxD (Peters, 2002; Molinuevo et al., 2014) concurrent with responsive myelin repair processes (Bartzokis, 2011) . This is likely why we observed strong correlations with both RD and AxD in those with evident Alzheimer's disease progression-late MCI and AD. However, this interpretation is limited by our use of mean AxD and RD over multiple ROIs. Wheeler-Kingshott and Cercignani demonstrated that changes in a single component of MD can alter the other in regions with complex underlying structure (Wheeler-Kingshott and Cercignani, 2009 ). Thus we cannot assume that global associations with demyelination or axonal injury extend to individual white matter ROIs.\nWhile overall MD and most tracts were significantly associated with executive function in this sample and in a previous analysis of ADNI (Nir et al., 2013) , other studies have singled out particular white matter tracts. Previous works analyzing diffusion parameters have linked poorer cognitive control, executive function or processing speed to tracts associated with the cingular cortex and frontal lobe (He et al., 2012; Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012; Jacobs et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015; Santiago et al., 2015) . Many of these studies selected white matter ROIs a priori, which obviated correlations with other white matter regions. The few studies that surveyed a range of cortical tracts reported associations between higher MD in associative and commissural fibers throughout the cortex and poorer executive function, but did not formally test whether global dMRI associations with executive function were present (Jacobs et al., 2013; Ciulli et al., 2016) . We have shown that global MD does have a strong association with executive function as well as which tracts have the strongest associations. In agreement with previous studies of older adults with cerebral small vessel disease (Jacobs et al., 2013; Ciulli et al., 2016) , the results of our comprehensive ROI analyses, by individual tracts and by PCA, suggest that poorer white matter microstructure throughout the cortex, not exclusively frontal associated tracts, may serve as an effective indicator of executive function performance. We found that the majority of projection and associative fibers of the cerebral cortex (Components 1 and 2) were associated with contemporaneous ADNI-EF, indicating minimal regional specificity in the relationship between MD and ADNI-EF. Component 1 included primarily large commissural and associative fiber pathways that cover the majority of cortical white matter. While Component 2 pathways were all associated with frontal and cingular cortex either as associative or projection fibers, which would be the expected regions associated with executive function.\nMany of our results are consistent with the previous studies of cognitive correlates in that metabolic changes in the brain and hippocampal atrophy are highly correlated with performance, while amyloid burden is weakly associated temporally. Our findings reinforce the relevance of FDG-PET as an important imaging marker of multi-domain cognitive status (Wirth et al., 2013a, b; Ewers et al., 2014) . These effects were most pronounced in the MCI groups, which were undergoing the greatest change in cognitive performance. Amyloid burden was only weakly associated with cognition after accounting for MRI and PET measures (Wirth et al., 2013a, b; Teipel et al., 2015) . These results support the validity of our data set and analytic approach.\nFuture work in other samples should assess the degree to which associations between WM microstructure and executive function are influenced by cerebrovascular injury. Vascular contributions to WM injury, typically identified on MR imaging through white matter hyperintensities or silent infarction, and acceleration of cognitive decline are well established (Gorelick et al., 2011; Lo et al., 2012; Norden et al., 2012; Bilello et al., 2015; Snyder et al., 2015) . Impaired clearance of amyloid (Rincon and Wright, 2014) , damaged blood brain barrier (Farrall and Wardlaw, 2009; Bell et al., 2012) , and chronic inflammation (Greer, 2002; Jin et al., 2010) are all associated with vascular risk factors such as hypertension (Baumgart et al., 2015) and cerebral small vessel disease . In addition, the microstructural markers we assess here are associated with both vascular risk factors and WMHs (Maillard et al., 2013; Maillard et al., 2014) . The ADNI cohort carries a relatively low burden of vascular risk factors and overt vascular diseases, thus limiting our ability to determine whether associations between diffusion MRI metrics and executive function represent contributions from cerebrovascular injury processes. However, the role that diffusion MRI can play in the study of vascular cognitive impairment is clearly important and worthy of future study. dMRI technologies are evolving quickly. Newer, enhanced dMRI data, such as network analyses or compartmental modeling, could give different results that are sensitive to longitudinal change (Fischer et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Cerebral white matter integrity, as measured by global MD, contemporaneously predicts level of executive function, but not memory, in older adults with cognitive impairment.
