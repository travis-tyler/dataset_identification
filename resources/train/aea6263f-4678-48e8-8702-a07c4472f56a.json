Introduction", "text": "There is a generally held notion that early involvement with marijuana will negatively impair human capital formation and result in poor schooling outcomes because marijuana use impairs memory and attention and thus interferes with learning. Indeed, there is a large literature documenting a significant positive correlation between early involvement with marijuana and high school dropout status as well as other negative schooling outcomes (Bray et al., 2000; Ellickson et al., 1998; Yamada, Kendix and Yamada, 1996; Mensch and Kandel, 1988) . The causality of the relationship between marijuana use and schooling, however, has been brought into question by empirical evidence showing that poor schooling outcomes precede regular and/or heavy marijuana use (Sander, 2000; Fergusson and Horwood, 1997; Hawkins et al, 1992; Newcomb & Bentler, 1988) .\nThe question of causality is further complicated by conflicting findings from clinical studies that examine the impact of persistent and heavy marijuana use on individual cognitive functioning . Although neuroscientists have been able to identify the part of the brain that is affected by marijuana use and have shown that activation of cannabinoid receptor sites in the part of the brain that control memory interrupts normal brain cognitive functioning and memory (Matsuda, Bonner and Lolait 1993; Heyser, Hampson, and Deadwyler 1993) , studies examining the effects of cannabis on cognitive functioning in specific small populations have not consistently shown a negative long term effect of persistent and/or heavy marijuana use . Some studies have shown that heavy and regular marijuana use do impair long and short term cognitive functioning (Block et al, 1990;  Solowij1998), while others show no statistically significant effect (Lekitsos et al, 1999; Mendelson, Rossi and Meyer, 1974; Dornbush et al, 1972) . A number of factors appear to be related to these mixed findings, including the length of time the individual has been using cannabis heavily and measurement of the actual doses taken . Thus, the long-term consequences of regular and heavy use of marijuana on cognitive functioning are still being explored.\nGiven the uncertainty of a long term association between marijuana use and cognitive functioning from the physical sciences, the proper interpretation of a negative association between early marijuana use and subsequent academic achievement identified by the social sciences remains in question. The possibility of an unobserved underlying third factor explaining 100% of the association between poor academic performance and marijuana use behavior cannot be easily refuted.\nIn this paper we revisit the question of whether marijuana use causes cognitive impairment using a large, nationally representative sample of youths from the National Education Longitudinal Survey (NELS:88). Unlike previous analyses examining this association in large populations, we examine the association between marijuana use and students' performance on standardized tests, a more direct measure of the student's cognitive ability and a variable that is less sensitive to other individual psychosocial behaviors. Moreover, studies have shown that standardized test scores are predictive of future earnings lending weight to the argument that test scores are important variables to examine. We begin our examination by presenting cross-sectional models of the effects of marijuana use on standardized test scores in the 10 th grade. We find that marijuana use has a small and statistically significant negative association with composite, math, and reading standardized test scores. However, the statistical significance of these findings goes away when potentially endogenous variables capturing general academic performance, deviant behavior, and school attachment are included as additional regressors in the model. Given that the inclusion of these endogenous variables are likely to bias coefficient estimates from this long form model, we also consider difference-in-differences (DD) analyses, which reduce potential biases associated with time-invariant unobservable characteristics. These difference-in-difference models confirm that the association between marijuana use and test scores is substantially reduced; the negative association between marijuana use and math scores, however, remains.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we discuss the literature examining the relationship between marijuana use and schooling, highlighting the fact that many previous analyses focus on obtuse measures of cognitive function (high school drop out status) and exclude important school-level measures associated with schooling performance. In Section III we present our empirical modeling approach in light of the previous literature. In Section IV we discuss the specific variables being used from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS:88). The results and some additional sensitivity analyses are presented and discussed in Section V and we conclude in Section VI with a summary and policy implications."}, {"section_title": "II. The Literature on Marijuana Use and Schooling", "text": "If marijuana use truly does impact cognitive functioning, then one would expect that heavy marijuana use during adolescence would reduce general performance in school and educational achievement. The empirical relationship between marijuana use and school performance, however, is confounded by a number of other factors, including desire to fit in, reliance on coping mechanisms, natural ability, tastes for deviance, and rates of time preference (Fergusson & Horwood, 1997; Farrell & Fuchs, 1982; Schulenberg, et al 1994; Sanders, 2000) .\nThese confounding factors make it difficult to interpret the true nature of the relationship between marijuana use and schooling.\nThe limited economics literature that has explicitly examined the relationship between marijuana use and educational attainment has generally focused on the impact of marijuana use on high school completion (Yamada, Kendix and Yamada, 1996; Bray et al, 2000; Register et al, 2001 ), presuming the causal relationship is one way. Yamada, Kendix and Yamada (1996) , for example, employ a subsample of 1035 twelfth grade students from the 1982 National\nLongitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to examine the impact of current alcohol and marijuana use on the probability of high school graduation. Although information on current/recent marijuana use was not obtained in the 1982 survey, it could be reconstructed using retrospective data collected in 1984. They estimate various models of high school graduation, entering recent alcohol and marijuana use into different model specifications, and find that marijuana (as well as alcohol) use diminishes the likelihood of graduating from high school. Additional controls in their model include gender, race, family structure, number of siblings, parental income, poverty, and ability (as measured by ASVAB scores). There are a number of significant limitations with this study, however, including the fact that recent alcohol and marijuana use are treated as exogenous variables without explicitly showing tests supporting this assumption. In addition, the sample size is relatively small given the number of individuals in the NLSY who could have been used for this analysis. Finally, the data set precluded them from including information on important school factors that are likely to be related to both high school completion and individual substance use. Mensch and Kandel (1988) use a much larger sample of 12,000 young adults from the 1984 NLSY to estimate the impact of cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drug use on high school dropout status. They estimated models that accounted for parent's education, race, ethnicity, family structure, self-esteem, academic ability and delinquency and found that prior use of cigarettes, marijuana and other illicit drugs each increased the propensity to drop out of school. They did not find a significant relationship between prior alcohol use and dropping out, which they interpreted as evidence of the pervasiveness of alcohol use in American high schools.\nHere again, however, substance use is treated as an exogenous predictor without a test of this assumption and important school characteristics are omitted. Bray et al. (2000) examine the relationship between marijuana initiation and dropping out of high school for a sample of 1392 students who participated in a longitudinal study in a Southeastern U.S. school system. In their analysis, they examine the effects of age of initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illicit drugs on age-specific probabilities of dropping out of high school controlling for a series of sociodemographic variables including race, gender, enrollment in a rural versus an urban school, parents' education, number of parents living in the household, and the youths' self-report of typical grades earned in school. Marijuana initiation prior to the age of dropout has a positive and statistically significant effect on the probability of dropping out at age 16 and at age18 even after you control for age of initiation of cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs. Marijuana initiation only affects dropping out for 17 year olds when other substance use is omitted from the equation; however it remains negative and significant in the model for the combined sample. They conclude from their results that marijuana initiators are 2.3 times more likely to subsequently drop out of high school than nonusers.\nFollowing on work by Mensch and Kandel, Register, Williams & Grimes (2001) differentiate the effects of \"hard drugs\" from \"soft drugs\" in their examination of the impact of early illicit drug use on subsequent educational attainment. Using a sample of young males from "}, {"section_title": "III. The Empirical Model", "text": "One could construct a theoretical framework demonstrating a causal relationship between marijuana use and student achievement by modifying the standard model of human capital formation. Ultimately, however, the relationship between marijuana use and educational achievement is an empirical question. If we assume that marijuana use is exogenous to the process determining student achievement, then we can express the relationship as follows:\n(1)\nwhere Y ijt represents the measure of student achievement (ie. test score) for individual i in school j at time t, X ijt is a vector of individual-level characteristics measured at time t, Z jt is a vector of school-level characteristics measured at time t, MJ ijt represents the use of marijuana by individual i in school j at time t, and \u03b5 ijt is a random error term. The parameter \u03b3 1 measures the effect of marijuana use on student achievement.\nAs discussed in the previous literature, there are at least two problems that could cause standard OLS estimation of \u03b3 1 to generate a biased estimate of marijuana use on student achievement. First, it may be the case that low academic achievement encourages some youth to get involved with marijuana, in which case corr(M ijt , \u03b5 ijt ) \u2260 0. If this is the case than marijuana use is structurally endogenous and the causality could run both ways. We use a simple Hausman test of exogeneity to determine if this problem does indeed exist. Instruments used to perform this test are described in detail in the next section.\nA second sort of bias can result if academic achievement and marijuana use are both associated with a common, but yet unaccounted for, third factor that generates a spurious correlation between these two observed variables. Plausible sources of unobserved heterogeneity include differences in ability, rates of time preference, coping mechanisms, and tastes for deviance. Unlike other measures of academic achievement that are more closely tied to student's behaviors, standardized test scores are expected to be less correlated with some of the unobserved factors that are more behaviorally based. Nonetheless, the potential for an omitted variable bias still remains.\nTo overcome bias that may be caused by an omitted variable problem, we employ two alternative approaches. First, we consider a \"long form specification\" of equation (1) that includes additional individual-level variables capturing observable aspects of the hypothesized source of the unobserved heterogeneity (W it ). The model can be written as follows:\nAlthough the inclusion of these variables may reduce the bias caused by an omitted variable problem, they may also introduce new bias due to the probable endogeneity of these new variables. So while the estimates from the long-form model can be suggestive, they must be interpreted with some caution. An alternative method for addressing the omitted variable problem employs a difference-in-differences (DD) estimation strategy, which takes advantage of the panel nature of the data. The DD model that we estimate can be written as follows:\nwhere \u2206Y ijt is the change in student achievement between time t and t-1, \u2206X ijt is a vector of the changes in individual-level variables over the same time period, \u2206Z jt is a vector of the changes in school-level variables over the same time period, \u2206MJ iit represents the change in marijuana use over the same period, and e ijt is a random error term. The principal advantage of this model is that it will remove the influence of time-persistent unobserved heterogeneity without introducing any new bias to the estimates."}, {"section_title": "IV. The Data", "text": "The data we examine are taken from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (hereafter NELS:88), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. NELS:88 is a two-stage stratified, nationally representative sample of approximately 1,052 schools and 24,500 students who were eighth graders in 1988. The first follow-up included approximately 19,000 students, of which slightly more than one thousand had dropped out. The NELS:88 is designed to collect information regarding the educational experiences, aspirations, and activities of American eighth graders, as well as their immediate transition to high school. Students were resurveyed in 1990, 1992, and 1994 , allowing researchers to track students from 8 th grade through high school, including those who dropout, up through their post-high school experiences. In addition, additional students were surveyed in 1990 and 1992 to enable nationally representative cross sectional analyses of 8 th , 10 th , and 12 th graders.\nIn each of the first three waves, respondents completed a questionnaire and a battery of cognitive tests that were administered by the Educational Testing Service. Standardized tests were given in reading, mathematics, history and science. In this analysis we use performance on these standardized tests as a measure of academic achievement. To consider the possible differential influence marijuana could have on specific cognitive skills, we examine performance in terms of three different scores: their composite score, their math score, and their reading score.\nWhile the primary focus of NELS:88 is on students' school experiences and achievement, there is a good deal of information available on students' substance use. In the 10 th and 12 th grade questionnaire information was collected on the number of times the person used marijuana in the past 30 days, the past 12 months and in their lifetime. We use the responses to these questions to generate two different measures of marijuana use for the contemporaneous (henceforth \"10 th grade\") analyses of test scores and one measure of marijuana use for the DD models. For the 10 th grade analyses, we first construct a simple dichotomous indicator of use in the past 30 days. This is the measure of use most commonly employed in the literature and is therefore used for the purposes of comparing our results to those of the previous literature. A second measure, which we refer to as the marijuana index variable, is constructed so that we can capture both the timing and intensity of marijuana use. The index can take a value from 0 to 4, where 0 represents having never used marijuana, 1 indicates lifetime use, but no use in the past year, 2 indicates use in the past year, but not in the past 30 days; 3 represents use of marijuana one to two times in the past 30 days, and a value of 4 indicates use of marijuana three or more times in the past month. The advantage of using the marijuana index is that it allows us to distinguish between light or infrequent users and heavy users.\nFor the DD models we drop individuals who report ever using marijuana in the 10 th grade and construct a new dichotomous indicator of marijuana initiation that is set equal to 1 if the individual reports using marijuana in the past year or in the past month in getting sent to the office, disrupting class), the number of stressors that a student faced over the 1 Individuals who report in 12 th grade that they used marijuana in their lifetime were coded as non-users in the analyses presented here. The results presented here are not sensitive to how we code these individuals. 2 The SES composite is created by NCES using information from questions on the parent questionnaire in 1988. It includes information on the parents' education level, parents' occupation, and family income. If all information on these items were missing from the parent's response then information from the student questionnaire on these items were used to generate the SES variable. 3 Although we recognize that all of these variables are likely to be endogenous our purpose in including them is to test the sensitivity of the coefficients on the marijuana use indicators to their inclusion to help us understand the reliability of estimates obtained in the short form models. past two years (i.e. parental divorce, death in the family, school change, serious illness), and indicator of whether the student had ever been offered drugs at school, a baseline assessment of the individual's risk of dropout, and an indicator for whether the student had initiated cigarette consumption in the 8 th grade.\nOne of the principal advantages associated with using the NELS data is the wealth of information on the characteristics of the respondent's school, which enable us to develop fairly reasonable proxies for school quality that are known to have a statistical association with student achievement (e.g. Lee and Bryk, 1989; Card and Krueger, 1992) . In all of our analyses we include measures of percent of the student body that is white, the percent of the student body receiving free or reduced-price lunches, the percent of 10 th graders in the 1988-1989 school year that dropped out by 1990, the minimum salary paid to teachers in the school, the type of school (i.e., Catholic, other private, public), and a measure of the urbanicity of the school location.\nFor the purposes of testing the exogeneity of marijuana use, various price and policy variables that have been shown to be important for predicting marijuana use are merged into the NELS based on the county and state fipscodes of the respondent's address. Specific variables used as instruments include the geometric mean price of an ounce of commercial grade marijuana, the maximum fine and minimum jail time statutorily imposed for marijuana possession offences involving 10 grams of marijuana, and state decriminalization status.\nInformation on the price of marijuana is available for 19 cities using various publications of the Drug Enforcement Agency's Office of Intelligence or Intelligence Division. 4 Given that missing data is reported for many regions in specific quarters, regression techniques are used to impute quarterly prices from 1985 through 2000. These imputed prices are then matched to students based on the student's proximity to one of the satellite offices of the 19 division offices. If we simply look at mean test scores by marijuana prevalence in the past thirty days, we again see that marijuana use is associated with lower test scores across all tests, although the differences between users and nonusers are not as large in absolute magnitude as those seen between never users and heavy users in the previous rows. Although the differences in mean test scores are suggestive, there are numerous confounding factors that may be generating these differences. In this next section we consider the extent to which these observed trends remain once confounding factors have been accounted for."}, {"section_title": "V. Results", "text": "We begin our exploration of the relationship between cognitive ability and marijuana use using simple OLS estimation of various forms of equation (1). Table 3 presents results from models examining performance on composite, math, and reading tests using three alternative measures of marijuana use. All models are weighted and adjust for the clustering observations at the school level using the svyreg command in STATA 7.0.\nThe results presented in Panel A of Table 3 do not suffer from a structural endogeneity bias.\nAlthough the inclusion of these marijuana use measures in the test score equations may not generate bias due to structural endogeneity, bias may still exist due to omitted confounding factors. As was described earlier, one way of dealing with this problem is to include observable aspects of potential confounding factors directly in the model. In Panel B of One interpretation of the findings presented in Panel B of Table 3 is that unobserved heterogeneity causes a spurious correlation between marijuana use and measures of cognitive functioning and that no real association exists. This is entirely plausible. However, one must be careful drawing such a conclusion from the evidence presented in Panel B, as the inclusion of these additional endogenous variables in the long form model may cause OLS methods to generate biased estimates. The nature of this bias cannot be precisely determined because of the different dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity that appear to attenuate the relationship.\nWe therefore also explore the robustness of these findings using an alternative approach for dealing with unobserved heterogeneity: difference-in-difference modeling. The primary advantage of this approach is that it enables us to control for unobserved factors without generating biased coefficient estimates. However, it is limited in that it can only account for unobservable factors that do not change over time.\nIn Table 4 we take a preliminary look at the average change in test scores for the combined, math and reading scores by level of marijuana use in the 10 th grade. Although there was a slight negative change on average in the composite test score between 10 th and 12 th grade, the students on average saw an increase in their math and reading scores. When we look at the relative changes in test scores by level of use, we see that individuals who used marijuana monthly or more frequently in the 10 th grade had smaller changes in math scores and larger changes in reading scores on average. These differences in average changes in test scores are not statistically significant from each other in the case of the marijuana use index, but they are in the case of our measure of thirty-day prevalence. This may be due to the fact that we have so few observations in the top two use categories of our marijuana use index and that we get more statistical power by grouping them. If we presume that this is the case, the results in Table 4 suggest that individuals who use marijuana more regularly in 10 th grade do relatively poorer on standardized math tests over time than non-current users, while they do better on reading tests, suggesting that marijuana use may have differential effects on specific cognitive skills. One needs to control for other facts that may be confounding these results, however.\nThere is a problem when you try to look for the impact of changes in marijuana use over time when use is measured as a simple dichotomous indicator. Individuals who do not use in both periods get assigned the same numerical value as individuals who use the substance in both periods because MJ(t) -MJ (t-1) = 0 in both these cases. To avoid problems with interpretation and to make sure we focus on the behavior of interest, we narrow our sample to just individuals who report having never used marijuana in their lifetime in the 10 th grade for the DD models. We then differentiate initiators, or those who reported using marijuana at least once in the past year in the 12 th grade, from non-users, or those who report never using marijuana in the 12 th grade. (DD estimates) for these simple averages, we find that the only statistically significant difference in test scores over time is that for math scores. The other differences in changes in test scores are not statistically significant.\nIn Table 6 we repeat the examination of difference in test scores between initiators and non-users over time, but now we control for other individual and school level factors that are known to change over time. Results are only shown for math and reading scores given that the combined test score is a composite of all tests taken and these two tests have previously shown a potential for a differential relationship with marijuana use. 7 In Model 1 we simply examine the impact of being an initiator on changes in test scores, ignoring the level of the individual's baseline score. We find that individuals who initiate marijuana between 10 th and 12 th grade have significantly lower improvement in standardized math test scores than non-users. In addition we see a negative association between marijuana initiation and changes in reading scores, but this is not statistically significant.\nA problem with the results presented in Model 1 is that they ignore the heterogeneity in individuals' baseline scores and the possibility of regression to the mean in test scores over time.\nSay, for example, that marijuana initiators have higher math test scores to start with. If this is indeed the case, then there is less room for improvement among marijuana users than non-users and that would generate a negative result. The results presented in Row (2) of Table 5 do not actually support this, but to account for the possible confounding effect of regression to the mean, we include in Model 2 two additional variables. The first is the average score of the individual's 10 th and 12 th grade subject-specific test. We use the average test score across the two grades as opposed to the individual's score in 10 th grade score to reduce the negative correlation between change scores and initial values that might exist because of measurement error in the test score variable. The second term is simply the square of the first term, enabling a quadratic relationship between changes in test scores and levels of test scores.\nThe results presented for Model 2 in Table 6 confirm previous findings. Marijuana initiators again are found to have lower changes in math scores than non-users. Although the statistical significance of the effect is reduced slightly in Model 2, the magnitude of the effect remains relatively unchanged and is surprisingly consistent with the simple average differencein-difference results presented in Table 5 . Marijuana initiation between 10 th and 12 th grade is associated with a 0.65 percentage point smaller change in test scores. Given the average change in test scores for the sample is 4.415, this represents a 15% reduction. According to a paper by Murnane et al (1995) this could translate into a reduction in wages six years after high school from anywhere between 0.5 -1.9% for those not going on to college. 8 We find no significant association between marijuana initiation and changes in reading (or composite) test scores."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusions", "text": "The results from all of our models combined suggest that much of the negative association between marijuana use and cognitive ability appears to be attenuated by individual level factors that are often not captured in empirical models, particularly individual differences related to school attachment and general deviance. Results from the long form specification of our model\nshow that the negative association between marijuana use and test scores disappears when these additional measures are included in the model in almost all of the models. However, it is possible that these long form models suffer from endogeneity bias due to the inclusion of the additional variables. An alternative specification of the model that addresses unobserved heterogeneity by differencing it out shows that the negative association between marijuana use and math scores remains. The effect could translate into much as a 2% decline in wages after high school. (Murnane, Willett and Levy, 1995) .\nAs we explained previously, there are strengths and weaknesses with each of the approaches that are employed. The use of a long form method for addressing unobserved heterogeneity introduces new bias due to endogeneity while DD models cannot account for unobserved heterogeneity that changes over time. Neither of these methods are perfect. Nonetheless, they do tell a relatively consistent story in terms of the association between marijuana use and composite and reading test scores. The association between marijuana use and these measures of cognitive functioning appear to be explained by third factors. The association between marijuana use and math scores, however, remains an issue.\nThere are at least two limitations of the current study. First, standardized test scores are used as the only measures of cognitive ability. Test scores may be a weak measure of cognitive ability for a number of reasons, such as school teacher's \"teaching to the test.\" However, we believe that standardized test scores are a substantially better indicator of cognitive ability than high school drop out status and are generally free of many of the problems associated with student grades. Nonetheless, further investigation using alternative measures of schooling performance is probably warranted.\nSecond, the study only considers the short-term effects of teenage marijuana use on cognitive functioning, examining performance on school tests in one grade and then looking at changes over a two-year period. The clinical research suggests that the harmful effects of marijuana use are typically seen in longer-term evaluations. This suggests that the results obtained in this study showing a short-term impact of marijuana use on test scores probably underestimate the true effect of marijuana use on cognitive functioning in the long run.
