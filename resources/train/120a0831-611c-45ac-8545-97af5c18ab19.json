We previously reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for EF resilience. Here, we report gene-and pathway-based analyses of the same resilience phenotype, using an optimal SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT) for gene-based analyses (conservative threshold for genome-wide significance = 0.05/18,123=2.8\u00d710 ) and the gene-set enrichment package GSA-SNP for biological pathway analyses (False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Genebased analyses found a genome-wide significant association between RNASE13 and EF resilience (p =1.33\u00d710\n). Genetic pathways involved with dendritic/neuron spine, presynaptic membrane, postsynaptic density, etc., were enriched with association to EF resilience. Although replication of these results is necessary, our findings indicate the potential value of geneand pathway-based analyses in research on determinants of cognitive resilience."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cognitive impairment and dementia lead to immense personal, family, and economic devastation in the US and worldwide. Structural brain damage from vascular and degenerative diseases is common in community-based elderly and can precipitate cognitive impairment and dementia. Covert brain infarcts (Longstreth et al. 1998; Longstreth et al. 2002; Vermeer et al. 2007 ) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (Ikram et al. 2007; Longstreth et al. 1996; Debette and Markus 2010; National Bioethics Advisory Commission 2007) are also common findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly people without dementia, stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The increasing prevalence of these vascular lesions occurs in parallel with rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease with age (Kukull et al. 2002) . Most elderly people have pathological lesions by the time they die (Sonnen et al. 2007 ).\nImaging and pathology-defined lesions need not cause dementia during life (Sonnen et al. 2011) . Although structural brain changes are common findings on MRI, some people appear to be resilient to cognitive deficits in the presence of these findings. People with essentially similar lesions can have dementia, no symptoms at all, or anything in between.\nAn extensive literature addresses the gap between brain damage and retained cognitive functioning, often referred to as \"cognitive reserve\" (Stern 2002 (Stern , 2003 . Many have focused on identifying modifiable factors that can increase reserve (Scarmeas and Stern 2003) . Although biological substrates of reserve have been investigated (Whalley et al. 2004) , to our knowledge, the only paper on genome-wide variability associated with reserve was our earlier investigation.\nReed and colleagues (Reed et al. 2010 ) introduced the idea of operationalizing reserve as residual cognitive functioning after accounting for MRI-identified brain damage. Cognitive resilience describes people whose cognitive functioning is better than predicted based on their neuroimaging and demographic characteristics. We emphasize our focus on better-than-predicted cognition by using the term \"resilience\" (Negash et al. 2011) . Most importantly, this specific phenotype can be interrogated using modern genetic investigation.\nDisease-based genetic discovery is an important line of investigation that promises to improve our understanding of conditions associated with late-life cognitive losses. These ongoing investigations offer the hope of identifying modifiable biological targets to reduce the burden of specific diseases. Resilience represents a complementary line of investigation that addresses why some people may be able to accumulate neuropathologic changes without expressing clinical dementia. In our previous investigation, we found that resilience was highly heritable (h 2 =0.76 with a standard error of 0.44) ).\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an important first step with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Additional gene-based and pathway-based analyses may further contribute to understanding associations between genetic variants and phenotypes of interest. For example, Peng and colleagues (Peng et al. 2010) reported that genespecific, rather than SNP-specific, analyses identified variants associated with several phenotypes that were not associated at genome-wide significance thresholds with any individual SNP. Genes identified in this fashion in a single cohort were confirmed by meta-analysis of data from multiple cohorts, suggesting that gene-based analyses may further illuminate SNP-based analyses for any given sample size and may also be more replicable than SNP-based analyses (Peng et al. 2010) .\nBeyond gene-based models, there is increasing recognition of the potential contributions of pathway-based analyses, in which variants in groups of genes that operate along a single physiologic or developmental pathway are considered together to predict the phenotype of interest (Ramanan et al. 2012b ). This approach identifies pathways exhibiting an enrichment of genetic associations to the phenotype. Thus, we proposed that a three-component approach-combining SNP-, gene-, and pathway-based analyses of genome-wide SNP data-is likely to best illuminate associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. (Peng et al. 2010 ).\nTo identify additional genetic mechanisms underlying EF resilience, we complemented our previous GWAS with geneand pathway-based analyses of high-density genotype data."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative Data used for this study were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). The ADNI was initiated in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations. The primary goal of ADNI-1 was to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco was the Principal Investigator of this initiative. This $60 million, multiyear public-private partnership involved many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations. More than 800 participants, aged 55 to 90, were recruited from across more than 50 sites in the US and Canada. Longitudinal imaging data, including structural 1.5 T MRI scans, were collected on the full sample. Neuropsychological and clinical assessments were collected at baseline, and at follow-up visits of six-to-twelve month intervals. Other available data used in the present analysis included APOE genotype and genome-wide SNP data obtained in the full ADNI-1 sample, as outlined in (Saykin et al. 2010) . Further information about ADNI can be found in (Weiner et al. 2010 ) and at http://www.adni-info.org. The study was conducted after Institutional Review Board approval at each site. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants, or their authorized representatives."}, {"section_title": "T MRI neuroimaging", "text": "All participants received 1.5 T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The neuroimaging methods utilized by ADNI-1 have been described in detail previously (Jack et al. 2008) utilizing calibration techniques to maintain consistent protocols across scanners and sites. Raw dicom data of T1-weighted MP-RAGE scans acquired from 1.5 T scanners at baseline visits from all participants were obtained via the ADNI-1 database (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). In our analyses we used presence of one or more lacunes, cortical volume (summed across entorhinal cortex, fusiform, pars triangularis, caudal middle frontal, superior frontal, medial orbitofrontal, rostral, middle frontal, and lateral orbitofrontal, controlling for intracranial volume), volume of bilateral hippocampus (controlling for intracranial volume), and the natural log of WMH volume.\nPsychometric composites for memory and executive functioning ADNI-1 participants received an extensive neuropsychological assessment battery at each study visit, including several measures of memory and executive function. We applied modern psychometric theory to item-level data from the ADNI-1 neuropsychological battery to develop composite scores separately for memory (ADNI-Mem) and executive functioning (ADNI-EF). For executive functioning, we found that a bifactor model had the best fit to the data. We extracted factor scores for the general factor defined by all of the items from Mplus v5 (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n 2006) ; this factor score is the ADNI-EF score. For memory, we used a longitudinal single factor model to account for different versions of the ADASCog and of the Rey AVLT. We used parameters from that model to generate scores at each study visit, also using Mplus (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n 2006) .

The genotyping protocol followed the manufacturer's instructions and is explained in detail in (Saykin et al. 2010 ).\nStandard quality control procedures were performed on the ADNI genotype data using PLINK v1.07 (Purcell et al. 2007 ). Samples were excluded based on the following criteria: (1) call rate per individual <95 %, (2) ambiguous sex identification, (3) identity check with PI_HAT >0.125 after exclusion of individuals with no genetic consent. Markers were excluded based on the following criteria: (1) call rate per SNP<95 %, (2) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test in controls <10 \u22126 , (3) minor allele frequency (MAF) <1 %.\nAPOE was genotyped at the time of screening. The two previously established APOE genotype SNPs (rs429358, rs7412) that characterize the \u03b5 2/ \u03b5 3/ \u03b5 4 alleles were not available on the Human610-Quad BeadChip array (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). These SNPs were genotyped by PCR amplification followed by HhaI restriction enzyme digestion and Metaphor Gel and were available in the ADNI database (Potkin et al. 2009 ). They were added to the ADNI-1 genotype data based on the reported APOE \u03b52/ \u03b53/ \u03b54 status before the assessment of sample quality.\nTo limit possible confounding effects of population ancestry, we restricted analyses to non-Hispanic Caucasian participants. To select non-Hispanic Caucasian participants in the ADNI cohort, 988 founders of HapMap (The International HapMap Project 2003) phase 3 samples were used as reference populations which consist of 11 known population and PLINK multi-dimensional scaling analysis was performed on the combined genotype data of the ADNI-1 and the HapMap phase 3 release 2. ADNI participants were selected if they were grouped together with the HapMap CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection) or TSI (Toscani in Italy) participants.

To obtain genotypes for SNPs not characterized on the GWAS array, genome-wide imputation was performed with Mach software (Li et al. 2010 ) using NCBI 1000 Genomes build 37 (UCSC hg19) as the reference panel.

Compared to our previous analysis , this study utilized genotype data with substantially increased genomic coverage due to imputation.\nGene-wide analysis using SKAT-O We mapped SNPs to genes using the b137 annotation file downloaded from the dbSNP website (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/projects/SNP/, accessed on 11/30/2011). We assigned 3,377,248 SNPs to each of 18,123 autosomal genes according to genomic positions on the UCSC Genome Browser hg19 assembly, using the official gene boundaries as delimiters (i.e., no extended gene window was used). The joint effects of variants in each of these gene regions were tested for association with resilience using Sequential Kernel Association test (SKAT).\nBurden tests are commonly used for rare variant analysis, and are more powerful when a large proportion of variants are causal and effects are in the same direction (Lee et al. 2012) . SKAT is more powerful when a small proportion of variants are causal, or the effects have mixed directions (Lee et al. 2012) . SKAT uses a multiple regression model to directly regress the phenotype on genetic variants in a region and on covariates, using a variance component score test to account for rare variants. SKAT is a score test, so type I error rates are protected for any choice of weights.\nBoth scenarios for causality and direction are plausible when the underlying biology is unknown. We used the Optimal Unified Test (SKAT-O), which uses data to adaptively estimate \u03c1 to maximize power and minimize p-values (Lee et al. 2012) where the SKAT-O test statistic is given by:\nwhere SKAT (\u03c1 =0) and Burden (\u03c1 =1) are special cases. This method was developed for rare variant analyses, but can be used for common variants if we specify a \u03b2 1,1 (uniform) weight on each of the SNPs. Similar to the GWAS model, we performed a gene-wide analysis on the executive functioning composite adjusting for the memory composite, demographics, Hachinski score, brain imaging parameters and population substructure."}, {"section_title": "Pathway analysis", "text": "Pathway analysis of the GWAS results was performed to identify functional gene sets with important association with the resilience phenotype. We used the GSA-SNP package (Nam et al. 2010 ) to identify pathways with enrichment of association to EF resilience. This software uses a competitive enrichment algorithm (Goeman and B\u00fchlmann 2007) , where the null hypothesis holds that a pathway-phenotype association is not different from all other pathway-phenotype associations under analysis. Competitive enrichment strategies are robust to the effects of genomic inflation due to population stratification or other confounding factors (Holmans 2010; Fridley and Biernacka 2011) . In GSA-SNP, the significance score for each gene under analysis was calculated as the-log of the k-th best SNP-level p-value in the gene. Corresponding with the authors' recommendation (Nam et al. 2010 ), we selected k=2 to limit the effects of both single, highlysignificant loci and of spurious SNP-level associations on driving pathway enrichment (Ramanan et al. 2012a) .\nWe used the Gene Ontology database to define gene sets representing biological pathways. 1454 gene sets were examined out of which 825 were biological processes, 233 were cellular components and 396 were molecular functions. Each gene set (representing a pathway) was then assessed for phenotype enrichment by the Z-statistic method (Kim and Volsky 2005) , which incorporates the gene-wide significance scores and the number of genes within each set. In addition, since small pathways can exhibit spurious phenotype associations due to large single locus effects (Holmans 2010) , and since large pathways are more likely to exhibit association by chance alone (Elbers et al. 2009 ), we restricted analyses to gene sets containing 5-200 genes. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) to the p-values generated by the enrichment algorithm (Ramanan et al. 2012a) .\nWe identified 111 pathways with enrichment of association to EF resilience (FDR p <0.05). The top 20 pathways in terms of p-value and FDR are presented in Table 3 and a complete list of the 111 enriched pathways are provided in Supplementary  Table 1 . The top pathways were related to dendritic/neuron spine, presynaptic membrane, and postsynaptic density. Some genes associated with late-onset AD such as PTK2B, PICALM, MS4A2, APP were present in the top 10 pathways (See Supplementary Table 1 ). The p-values for SNPs in these genes or for the genes themselves were unremarkable in the GWAS analyses ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SNP association findings", "text": "Of the 692 individuals who passed sample quality control, complete data were available for 681 of them (Table 1) . The genomic inflation factor (\u03bb) with three principal components was 1.0 for the GWAS analysis.

RNASE13 has only two SNPs in the data set, one of which (rs3748348) is observed and the other (rs3748346) is imputed. Replication analyses will be critical to determine the relevance of RNASE13 to this phenotype.\nBeyond RNASE13, gene-based analyses showed partial but not complete overlap with our previously reported SNP results . SNPs in TPPP2 are in close LD with SNPs in RNASE13, as noted in our previous paper . None of the individual SNPs in TPPP2 were closely associated with our phenotype (the smallest pvalue was 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for rs1243459). Our gene-based analyses strengthened our interest in RNASE13 and TPPP2 . The optimized SKAT-O approach accounts for the proportion of variants which may be causal and have mixed directions of the effects of SNPs which map to a gene. This gene-wide approach we used enabled us to summarize SNP heterogeneity (direction of effects) within each gene with a single number. This is biologically-meaningful for a complex trait like EF resilience where true associated genes are likely to have combinations of variants with heterogeneous effect sizes and directions depending on the population being analyzed. Genebased (and pathway-based) analyses can overcome this relative limitation of SNP-based approaches. This reduced the number of statistical tests performed and enabled us to discern signals from combinations of SNPs that were not visible when we focused on only individual SNPs as is usual with SNP-based GWAS. Our identification of reinforcing associations between the executive functioning resilience phenotype and pathways fundamental to production and loss of neurons, fate determination, and pre-and post-synaptic structure and function raises obvious potential links between neuron biology and resilience to neurodegenerative disease. Several of these pathways have previously been implicated in LOAD, in research on the loss and alteration of dendritic spines induced by amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) in adults (Knobloch and Mansuy 2008) , and in aberrations in synapse composition, shape and density induced by A\u03b2 oligomers (Lacor et al. 2007 ). Synaptic proteins found in presynaptic membranes were found to be differentially affected in AD brains compared to controls which suggest differential involvement of synaptic components in AD (Shimohama et al. 1997) . Brains affected with Alzheimer's disease show a reduced number of synapses, and stereological and biochemical analysis has shown that this reduction in synaptic density correlates better with cognitive decline than with the accumulation of plaques (Harel et al. 2008; Harold et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, expression studies indicate that there are differences in expression of genes that regulate neuron differentiation between people with AD and cognitively normal controls (Blalock et al. 2011) . Further studies investigating the significance of these pathways appear warranted given the present results. Caution is certainly warranted when interpreting these results, given that this is a first report based on a relatively small sample. It will also be critical to assess disease associations with genes associated with the cognitive resilience phenotype and AD or other neurodegenerative diseases.\nGene-based and pathway-based analyses afford the opportunity to detect complementary information that would not have been easily observed from SNP-based GWAS alone. Applying these complementary approaches to standard GWAS, we were able to identify additional biological underpinnings of EF resilience. are disseminated by the Laboratory for Neuro Imaging at the University of California, Los Angeles.
