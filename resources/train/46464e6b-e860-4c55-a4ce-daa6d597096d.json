[{"section_title": "", "text": "Foreign Participation in U. S. Academic Science and Engineering: 1991 The proportion of all doctorates earned by non-U.S. citizens was much higher in most engineering fields than in the sciences, with 71 percent of all civil engineering doctorates and 65 percent of those in mechanical engineering awarded to non-U.S. citizens. Only in chemical engineering did the proportion of all doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens decline over the past decade, from 55 percent to 47 percent of the total. Chapter 4. Employment of Non-U.S. Citizens in U.S. Institutions of Higher Education Non-U.S. citizens accounted for almost one-half of the postdoctoral appointees in the science, engineering, and health fields at doctorate-granting institutions in 1991, up from one-third a decade earlier. In engineering, 69 percent of the total were non-U.S. citizens. About 6 percent of the scientists and engineers employed in the United States in 1989 were non-U.S. citizens. The majority of the non U.S. citizens--81 percent-were in this country on permanent visas. After a temporary slowdown in the mid-eighties, the number of foreign students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education resumed the rapid growth that had characterized the earlier part of the decade. At less than 4 percent per year, however, the increases were still significantly below those of the late seventies, when average annual increases fluctuated in the 10-to 20-percent range. Chart 1. Number of foreign students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education Nearly two-thirds of all foreign students in U.S. academic institutions in 1991 were from Asia; in 1955, when the Institute of International Education's Open Doors series began, students from Asia accounted for only two-fifths of the total. During the same period, the proportion from Europe declined from 15 percent to under 8 percent as European universities rebuilt, and then in the eighties began to rise again, to 12 percent. The proportions from South America and the remainder of North America declinedthough the absolute numbers continued to growwhile Loth the proportion and the absolute number from Africa rose steadily until the early eighties and then declined.

Engineering students accounted for about one-fifth to one-sixth of the total in each year, while those in the health fields made up about 4 percent. Over onehalf of all foreign students were enrolled in non-S&E areas, up from about three-eighths in 1955. Chart 5.

The proportion whose major source of support was a foreign government or university also declined, from more than 11 percent to about 6 percent during the same period. The difference was accounted for primarily by an increase in the amount contributed by the host colleges and universities, up from 12 percent to 19 percent. The majority of institutional awards are in the form of tuition remission or teaching assistantships. Throughout the period, the U.S. government was the primary source of support for only about 2 percent of all foreign students in U.S. institutions. 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 1,000"}, {"section_title": "SOURCE: Table A-8, Institute of International Education, Open Doors", "text": "Miami-Dade Community College remained the leading institution in foreign student enrollment, with nearly 6,000 foreign students in 1991; only one other two-year institution--Northern Virginia Community College--appeared among the leading 50 schools.

Non-U.S. Citizens in Graduate Science and Engineering Programs", "text": "The 107,000 non-U.S. citizens (both permanent residents and those on temporary visas) enrolled in graduate programs in the science, engineering, and health fields in academic year 1991 represented 23 percent of all graduate students in those fields, up from 19 percent in 1984 when complete data on citizenship were first collected. The increase in the proportion of non-U.S. citizens over the past decade was most rapid during the middle eighties, primarily because of the slowdown during those years in the increase in U.S. citizens choosing graduate work in preference to immediate employment on receiving the baccalaureate. The overall health of the job market during those years is likely to have been a factor, as is the tightness of the current job market in the more recent increases in the number of U.S. citizens choosing graduate school. Chart 9. Non-U.S. citizens as a percent of total graduate enrollment in the science, engineering, and health fields, by enrollment status  1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 SOURCE: Table A Non-U.S. citizens were more likely to be enrolled in doctorate-granting institutions than in those granting a master's as their highest degree; 94 percent of all non-U.S. citizens in graduate S&E programs were in doctorate-granting institutions. One-fourth of all S&E graduate students in doctorate-granting institutions were non-U.S. citizens, compared with only one-tenth of those in master's-granting institutions. The vast majority of all non-U.S. citizens in graduate science and engineering programs were enrolled on a full-time basis. Non-U.S. citizens accounted for nearly one-third of all full-time graduate students in the surveyed fields, but only about one-tenth of those enrolled part time. For this reason, the analyses of science and engineering fields that follow focus on full-time graduate students rather than on total enrollment. Non-U.S. citizens made up 48 percent of the full-time graduate students in the computer sciences in 1991, up from 35 percent in 1983. This is nearly twice the proportion for the sciences hi general, and significantly higher than the proportion in the mathematical sciences, the field with the second highest proportion of non-U.S. citizens. At the opposite extreme, less than 5 percent of the full-time graduate students in psychology were non-U.S. citizens, a proportion that has been almost unchanged since the beginning of the survey series. Among the major engineering fields, petroleum engineering had the highest proportion of non-U.S. citizens enrolled full time, 68 percent, followed by mining engineering with 58 percent. Both fields showed substantial increases over 1990, when non-U.S. citizens accounted for 59 percent and 55 percent, respectively. It should be noted, however, that as the absolute numbers enrolled in both these fields are small, relatively minor changes in the numbers can result in significant proportional shifts. The 9-percentage point rise in petroleum engineering, for example, resulted from an increase of 30 non-U.S. citizens and a decrease of 52 in the number of U.S. citizens enrolled. Chart 13. Non-U.S. citizens eilrolled full time in engineering n.e.c. = not elsewhere classified SOURCE:  More than 12,000 non-U.S. citizens were enrolled in graduate S&E programs in California in 1991, enabling that State to retain the leading position it has held since the beginning of the survey series. New York ranked second with 10,900 non-U.S. citizens enrolled. Six other States were host to more than 4,000 non-U.S. citizens each, and together these eight States accounted for 54 percent of the non-U.S. citizens in U.S. academic institutions. By contrast, 20 States and Puerto Rico, each with fewer than 1,000 non-U.S. citizens in S&E programs, together accounted for only 7 percent of the total.  1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 SOURCE: Table A-16, National Science Foundation/SRS, Doctorate Records File Although the total number of S&E doctorates awarded has risen steadily over the past decade--from 18,000 in 1980 to 23,700 in 1991--the number awarded to U.S. citizens has remained virtually level. The proportion of S&E doctorates earned by U.S. citizens has therefore declined gradually, from 79 percent to 62 percent. During the same 11year period, the proportion earned by permanent residents who have not yet acquired citizenship has remained level in the 5-to 6-percent range, while the proportion earned by nonresident aliens on temporary visas has more than doubled, from 15 percent to 32 percent. Non-U.S. citizens earned 5,650 of the more than 18,500 doctorate degrees awarded in the sciences in 1991, accounting for 32 percent of the total. In 1981, non-U.S. citizens received 2,600 science doctorates, or 17 percent of the total awarded in that year. Less than 900-5 percent--of the doctorate recipients in 1991 were permanent residents. The proportion of all doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens was highest in the mathematical sciences, 55 percent of the total in 1991. Non-U.S. citizens were also in the majority among those receiving doctorates in the computer and information sciences, 51 percent. In both fields, however, nonresident aliens represented less than one half of the doctorate recipients; only when permanent residents are included were non-U.S. citizens a majority. At the opposite end of the spectrum, only 6 percent of the doctorates in psychology were earned by non-U.S. citizens. Of these, one-third were permanent residents and two-thirds nonresident aliens on temporary visas. Chart 19. Percent of science doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens, by field and visa status Although the proportion of all doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens tended to be higher in engineering than in science--59 percent overall--the increase over the decade of the eighties was not nearly as rapid as that in the science fields In civil engineering, for example, the 1991 proportion was 71 percent, up from 62 percent in 1981. Other ftelds in which significant majorities of the doctorates awarded were earned by non-U.S. citizens were mechanical engineering (65 percent, up from 54 percent a decade earlier) and electrical engineering (59 percent, up from 46 percent). In both civil and mechanical engineering, nonresident aliens alone made up a majority of the doctorate recipients in 1991. Women earned a lower proportion of all doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens in every field than of those awarded to U.S. citizens; however, the proportions for permanent residents closely approached those for U.S. citizens. In all three categories, the highest proportions of all doctorates awarded to women were in psychology--63 percent for U.S. citizens, 67 percent for permanent residents, and 42 percent for nonresident aliens. At the other extreme, women earned the lowest proportion of all doctorates in engineering in all citizenship categories. Chart 21.

Again, Mainland China was not even represented among the home countries of the doctorate recipients of 1981. When combined with \"China, unspecified,\" the proportion of all S&E doctorates awarded to Chinese nationals reached 33 percent in 1991. Other \"Pacific rim\" areas ranked among the top 20 were the Republic of Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. With Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand, this area of the world was the home of 51 percent of all S&E doctorates awarded by U.S. academic institutions in 1991, compared with 22 percent of the 1981 total. Non-U.S. citizens differed significantly from their U.S. citizen colleagues in terms of their primary source of support while in graduate school. Whereas 11 percent of the U.S. citizens for whom source of support was known were primarily supported from Federal funds, only 2 percent of the non-U.S. citizens reported the Federal Government as their primary source of support. As was the case for graduate enrollments, non-U.S. citizens receiving S&E doctorates were concentrated in a few institutions, with the top 10 schools accounting for one-fifth of the total and the leading 50 institutions accounting for about three-fifths of all S&E doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens. Most of these institutions were also among the top 50 in total foreign enrollment and in non-U.S. citizens enrolled in graduate S&E programs.  Chart 26.

The highest proportion of non-U.S. citizens holding postdoctoral appointments among the science fields were in the mathematical sciences--61 percent--although the largest number--more than 5,700--were in the biological sciences. More than two-thirds of the postdoctoral appointees, both U.S. citizens and others, were in the biological and physical sciences, reflecting the emphasis on postdoctoral training as a step toward full faculty status that characterizes both these fields. Relatively few postdoctoral appointees (fewer than 2,000 in 1991), either U.S. citizens or noncitizens, were employed in the engineering fields; and of these, more than one-half were in chemical, metallurgical/materials, and mechanical engineering. Metallurgical/materials engineering had the highest proportion of non-U.S. citizens, 76 percent, followed by chemical engineering with 72 percent. The most rapid growth in both the number and proportion of non-U.S. citizens holding postdoctoral appointments occurred in the health fields, where the number increased from 1,100 to 3,400 and the proportion from 25 percent to 42 percent over the past decade."}, {"section_title": "39", "text": "The pattern of geographic distribution of postdoctoral appointees resembled that of graduate students, as might be expected since the same institutions that enroll large numbers of graduate students also employ most postdoctoral appointees. California led in the total number of non-U.S. citizen postdoctoral appointees, with over 2,500, followed by Massachusetts (almost 1,600), New York (1,400), and Texas (1,200). These four States together accounted for 46 percent of all non-U.S. citizens with postdoctoral appointments. At the other end of the scale, the 21 States plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, with 100 or fewer non-U.S. citizen postdoctoral appointees each, accounted for only 6 percent of the total.

According to sample data collected in the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients, non-U.S. citizens accounted for approximately 6 percent of the 449,000 scientists and engineers employed in the United States in 1989, the latest year for which data are available. An additional 11 percent of all scientists and engineers were foreign-born U.S. citizens. In absolute terms, these proportions would work out to about 28,000 scientists and 45,000 engineers. Since 1983, when data on non-U.S. citizens by visa status were first collected, permanent residents have outnumbered those on temporary visas by approximately 5 to 1, in contrast to the distribution of doctorate recipients presented in chapter 3, which indicated that most of the non-U.S. citizens receiving doctorates from American universities were on temporary visas and expected to return to their home countries.

This reflt;cts the pattern already observed in both graduate enrollment and postdoctoral appointments. Among the science fields, the mathematical sciences again showed the largest proportion of non-U.S. citizens, almost 10 percent, and psychology the smallest, less than 2 percent. In numerical terms, however, the physical sciences led with an estimated 5,400, equivalent to over one-fourth of the total. Electrical/electronics engineers and materials engineers shared the lead in terms of the proportion of non-U.S. citizens, with 13 percent in both fields.

The survey has been conducted biennially since 1973 by the National Research Council for the National Science Foundation. The target population for the 1989 SDR was those who had earned doctorates in science or engineering between January 1, 1946 and June 30, 1988. Individuals not in the U.S. at the time of the survey, and citizens of foreign countries who indicated at the time they received their degree that they had firm plans to leave the United States after obtaining the doctorate, were excluded from the survey. The survey was conducted on a sample basis, with 72,555 individuals selected from the sampling frame of 525,685, for a sampling rate of about 14 percent. The sample was stratified on the basis of source and type of degree, sex, field, year, racial/ethnic background, and citizenship, with sampling ratios ranging from 2 percent for the largest cells to 100 percent for the smallest cells. Of the 72,555 individuals in the sample, 70,395 were determined to be active scientists and engineers; of these, 38,799 responded for a response rate of 55 percent. "}]
