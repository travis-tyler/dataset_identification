For the N-CANDA acquisition protocols, this is the AnteriorPosterior direction.\nOn one scanner (Siemens), we have observed a transient problem (underlying cause still unidentified), which lead to distortion outside the PE direction. This is easily recognized from the \"sideways\" distortion in the axial images, which is particularly strong near air-filled cavities, i.e., around the sinuses or ears. Note in the following example specifically the \"diagonal\" appearance of the eyeballs:\nThis non-standard distortion appears to affect the b=0 as well as all diffusion-weighted images, cannot be corrected, and makes the collected DWI data unusable.\nFor comparison, see a typical example below of DWI data with only the expected distortion along the PE direction (which can be corrected):\nUnfortunately, the underlying cause of the non-PE distortion is still unknown, as the problem disappeared before it could be diagnosed.\nIf you observe unusual distortion in newly collected DWI data, contact your site's scanner maintenance staff immediately."}]
