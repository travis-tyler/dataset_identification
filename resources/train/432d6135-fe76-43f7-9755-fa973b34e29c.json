[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related form of dementia, associated with deposition of intracellular neuronal tangles consisting primarily of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau) and extracellular plaques primarily comprising amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. The p-tau tangle unit is a posttranslational modification of normal tau protein. A\u03b2 is a neurotoxic peptide excised from the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the \u03b3-secretase complex. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded RNAs that modulate protein expression as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We identified miR-298 as a repressor of APP, BACE1, and the two primary forms of A\u03b2 (A\u03b240 and A\u03b242) in a primary human cell culture model. Further, we discovered a novel effect of miR-298 on posttranslational levels of two specific tau moieties. Notably, miR-298 significantly reduced levels of 55 and 50 kDa forms of the tau protein without significant alterations of total tau or other forms. In vivo overexpression of human miR-298 resulted in nonsignificant reduction of APP, BACE1, and tau in mice. Moreover, we identified two miR-298 SNPs associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau and lower CSF A\u03b242 levels in a cohort of human AD patients. Finally, levels of miR-298 varied in postmortem human temporal lobe between AD patients and age-matched non-AD controls. Our results suggest that miR-298 may be a suitable target for AD therapy."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a phenotypic spectrum that includes memory loss as well as decline in other cognitive domains (e.g., executive function, language, perceptual-motor), functional decline and especially in later stages neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., irritability, depression, agitation, and hallucinations) [1] . Given that the strongest risk factor is age and the population of aging adults is increasing, the incidence of this disorder is expected to likewise rise dramatically. In 2019, an estimated 44 million cases of AD have been reported worldwide [2] , with 5.8 million cases are estimated for within the USA, alone. It is estimated there will be one half to one million new cases within 2019, although at least half of those who already have AD will likely die due to the disorder within the same year, depending on estimation methods [3] . The neuropathology of AD is characterized by deposition of senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles [4] . Senile plaques are generated by oligomerization of soluble \u03b2amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide, which is generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the \u03b3-secretase complex [5] . The most common forms of A\u03b2 are 40 and 42 amino acid peptides, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. Thus, reduction of soluble A\u03b2 by targeting APP and BACE1 is a therapeutic goal, in accordance with the amyloid hypothesis [6] . However, both APP and BACE1 play an important role in normal physiological function of neuronal and glial cells [7] [8] [9] . APP acts in pancreatic islets [10] , and BACE1 plays a role in normal liver metabolism [11] [12] [13] ; therefore, a complete knockdown of either protein is undesirable. Moreover, attempts at inhibiting BACE1 or buffering A\u03b2 directly have had limited success [11, 14] though work continues to identify selective inhibitors of upstream modulators of BACE1 expression. Therefore, a novel mechanism to reduce A\u03b2 levels by modulating APP and/or BACE1 is warranted. An additional hallmark of AD is accumulation of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau [15] (gene: MAPT), (p-tau) in intraneuronal tangles. Any endogenous target that could potentially regulate both would be a valuable route of study for effective treatment.\nModulation of protein expression can be achieved by microRNAs (miRNAs), which often target the 3\u02b9 untranslated regions (UTR) of specific mRNAs and modify their expression post transcriptionally [16] . Specific miRNAs are differentially expressed in brain tissue from AD vs non-AD individuals [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Further, miRNAs also exist in biofluids such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and blood derivatives such as serum and plasma [19, 23, 24] from AD patients, thereby confirming a possible role as biomarkers for AD diagnosis. miRNAs that modulate APP, BACE1, and tau have been identified, and the APP and BACE1-regulating miRNAs likewise reduce levels of soluble A\u03b240. APP is regulated by miR-16 [25] [26] [27] , miR-101 [28, 29] , miR-153 [30, 31] , miR-193b [32] , and miR-200b [33] . Similarly, miR-9 [21] , miR-15b [34, 35] , miR-29a/b [21] , miR-135a [33] , miR-135b [36] , miR-195 [37] , and miR-339-5p [38] modulate BACE1 expression in different models. Tau is regulated by, among others, miR-16, miR-24c-5p, and miR-132 [39, 40] . To our knowledge, only miR-384 has been reported to target both APP and BACE1 [41] and miR-16 to target both APP and tau [25, 26, 40] . No miRNA has been reported, thus far, to regulate all three of these AD-associated proteins.\nmiR-298, encoded by the MIR298 gene, is a negative regulator of BACE1 in murine cells [42] . However, potential regulation of miR-298 on human BACE1 protein was not evaluated in that study. We, therefore, studied the effect of miR-298 on BACE1 expression in human cells. We found that miR-298 negatively regulates both APP and BACE1 expression, resulting in a reduction of soluble A\u03b2 levels. To our surprise, we found miR-298 modulates expression of two specific tau isoforms, reiterating the potentially important role the miRNA may have in AD pathology. In vivo overexpression of human miR-298 by AAV-miR-298 construct resulted in nonsignificant reduction of APP, BACE1, and tau in mice. Finally, we measured levels of miR-298 in human brain (Brodmann areas-BA 21/22, aka middle and superior temporal gyri), cerebellum, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) from autopsied brains of both AD patients and agematched non-AD controls. Notably, miR-298 levels vary in AD only in BA 21/22 samples. In summary, we report convergent supporting evidence for the proposed miR-298 effect, from human primary cell culture, human genetics, human brains, and animal model spinal cords (Fig. 1 ). We posit that miR-298 deserves more attention and study."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Identification of putative miR-298 binding sites on the APP, BACE1, and MAPT 3\u2032-UTR sequences Multiple miRNA prediction utilities and databases [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] were consulted to probe the 3\u2032-UTR sequences of APP and BACE1.

We used in silico database and prediction utilities to identify candidate target sites on the APP and BACE1 3\u02b9-UTR sequences. These bioinformatic predictions informed further exploration. b We first created 3\u02b9-UTR APP and BACE1 fusions in dualreporter luciferase vectors, which were then optimized and used for validation studies. We co-transfected the clones into human-origin cell lines with miR-298 mimics, with miR-298 mimics plus antagomir inhibition, and mutated clones with miR-298 mimics. c We followed validation with functional studies, and measured levels of APP, BACE1, and tau proteins in cell lines and primary human brain cell cultures. We treated cultures with miR-298 mimics or mimics plus antagomirs to measure potential changes in target protein levels. d Upon validation of binding sites, we also tested levels of miR-298 in human control and AD brain samples, specifically by qRT-PCR. Surveys of APP and BACE1 protein levels in a portion of these brain samples have been published elsewhere [28, 38] . Investigation between miR-298-associated SNPs and endophenotypes of AD patients revealed that potentially important connections between miR-298-associated SNPS vs. A\u03b2 levels and tau phosphorylation. This information led us to expand functional studies to include potential effects of miR-298 treatment on tau levels as well as APP and BACE1. f Finally, we compared interspecies responses in mouse models with mmu-miR-298.\ntransfections were performed at DIV 17 using 75 nM miRNA mimic, 75 nM miRNA antagomir, and 50 nM siRNA.

We performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis. LD is a nonrandom association of two sequence features, such as SNPs. Mapping multiple LD events can also reveals haplotype blocks. Of the 33 SNPs, 32 exist within four LD blocks (Fig. 11 ) of 2, <1, 9, and 1 kb in length.

Therefore, the reduction of the potentially toxic A\u03b2 peptide remains a viable therapeutic goal. While the peptide could be reduced by other means, such as targeting various A\u03b2-degrading enzymes [69] , we focused on reducing generation of A\u03b2. Drug therapies targeting APP and BACE1 have had limited success due to factors including effects of drugs on organs other than the brain [11] as well as the limitation of specificity. It is difficult to produce drugs that would target both crucial proteins involved in the generation of A\u03b2; namely APP and BACE1. The other dominant hypothesis of AD etiology is that it is primarily due to intracellular accumulation of p-tau [70] . A drug target that modulates all three of these potential participants in AD could be highly impactful. MicroRNAs are short, endogenous, single-stranded RNA that serve as a \"socket\" for RISC regulation of mRNA translation. Therefore, the identification of an miRNA that targets both APP and BACE1 would be advantageous in the reduction of A\u03b2. In addition, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau is a hallmark of AD and multiple other tauopathies. An miRNA that might happen to regulate, even in part, both A\u03b2 and tau could potentially be quite useful for therapeutic development.\nPrevious work has shown miR-298's role in targeting proteins implicated in cancer, such as catenin delta 1 [71] , apoptotic protein Bax [72] , and polycomb protein enhancer of zeste [73] . MiR-298 has been shown to improve outcomes in a spinal muscle atrophy model [57] and to paradoxically show worsening of spinal cord injury outcomes in murine models [74] . Mouse miR-298 targets mouse BACE1 [42] , but effects of human miR-298 on human BACE1 are unknown.\nUsing a multitude of approaches ( Fig. 1) , we found that miR-298 regulates protein expression of APP, BACE1, and at least two isoforms of tau. Initially, we found that miR-298 was a putative modulator of both BACE1 and APP using bioinformatics algorithms. We confirmed that miR-298 targets the APP 3\u2032-UTR via one of the two predicted target sites. The putative seed site of miR-298 on BACE1 3\u2032-UTR was not mutagenized to test its validity. Although the presence of a predicted miRNA binding site strongly favors that the mechanism is direct regulation through conventional RISC mechanisms, it always remains a (however distant) possibility that miR-298-mediated reduction of BACE1 would be through an unidentified and entirely speculative indirect mechanism. We also confirmed that miR-298 reduces APP and BACE1 protein expression in two different cell cultures.\nMurine overexpression of miR-298 in vivo did not produce a statistically significant alteration in APP, BACE1, or t-tau protein or mRNA levels. While this result does prima facie disagree with our results obtained in tissue cultures, it is important to note that all three proteins showed nonsignificant reductions and therefore we believe that a larger sample size may result in more statistically robust reductions. Thus, we infer that crossspecies interaction may be weaker, not absent. We reiterate that human miR-298 and the host mouse miR-298 sequences differ. We used spinal cord because the concurrently discovered SNP variations used CSF markers, and it was possible they reflected spinal cord differences. We included the \"negative\" mouse data to Fig. 10 Levels of miR-298 in control vs. AD brain regions. a RNA was purified from frozen human brain tissues as described herein. RNA was then subject to reverse transcription and PCR with TaqMan kits. Signal was normalized to RNU48 signal. b Comparing non-AD vs. AD levels by brain region.

No significant differences. illustrate limitations of using animal models in AD research. Human systems (both the sequence and models) must be used to verify animal results, and a negative animal result does not necessarily entail a negative human result, particularly given the differences between mature hsa-miR-298 and mmu-miR-298 sequences. Crossspecies difference that may not be differences in the specific \"target site\" can produce different results. We had chosen the specific hsa-miR-298 viral delivery due to its efficacy in reducing levels of androgen receptor in mouse models [57] , which we presumed would apply to other mouse mRNAs' translation vs miR-298. Our data suggest that such presumptions of success (or failure) should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, we found convergent supporting evidence for the proposed miR-298 effect, from human cell culture, human genetics, human brains, and animal model nervous system tissue. A case can be made that this molecule deserves more attention and study [75] .\nIn any case, to find an explanation for the negative result in mice, we tested mouse miR-298 vs. human miR-298 in human-derived cell cultures. The mouse miR-298 did not reduce APP and BACE1 protein levels, while human miR-298 was active. We noted poor conservation between miR-298 sequences of both species. It is also worthwhile to note that secondary structure of a given mRNA exerts a significant effect upon miRNA activity [76] . Comparison of the mouse and human APP 3\u2032-UTR sequences, for example, revealed that the mouse sequence was over 100 bases shorter (data not shown), which would reasonably produce important secondary structure differences.\nWhen we examined known SNPs of hsa-miR-298, we found an AD endophenotype associated with specific tau phosphorylation. To capitalize on this serendipitous discovery from clinically derived data, we tested miR-298's role on tau levels. We used lysates from our primary human mixed culture and found that miR-298 modulated a specific (55 kDa) form of tau, but not t-tau or the major isoform (48 kDa). The identification of the tau-immunoreactive 55 and 50 kDa bands are unclear, but may represent specific tau isoforms or phosphorylated tau moieties. The tau protein can be alternatively spliced into six forms [77] , and miR-298 may act upon a sequence within a specific exon. Using RNAhybrid [50, 68] , an algorithm that can predict noncanonical [78] miRNA interactions, we found a noncanonical predicted site for miR-298 on the tau 3\u2032-UTR. \"Noncanonical\" binding has turned out to be remarkably common for miRNA activity [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . However, it is also possible that miR-298 reduction of tau isoforms will be an indirect effect; viz a viz a different intermediate protein.\nIn the future, mutagenizing the putative noncanonical site on the 3\u2032UTR would determine whether miR-298 modulates tau expression directly or indirectly. In addition, miRNA regulation/disruption of mRNA splicing through indirect pathways does exist [84, 85] , including in AD [84] . A post hoc query of the DIANA-microT database [45] revealed miR-298 interactions with spliceosome components DDX17, HNRNPL, and RBM74, among others. However, miR-298 may instead alter tau phosphorylation through acting on c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) [74, 86] , and JNK alters tau phosphorylation [87] . Hence, we posit that miR-298 modulated the expression of 55 and 50 kDa tau protein moieties either directly via tau isoform transcript regulation, or indirectly via spliceosome or tau kinase regulation. Further mechanistic studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism and functional consequences of this miR-298-mediated tau pathway. In addition, we post hoc queried the DIANA-microT database and found interactions between miR-298 and the MAPK1 and PHKG2 kinases, both of which also phosphorylate tau. Given that a miR-298 SNP associated with differential tau phosphorylation in the SNP association clinical sample, the latter is more likely. However, each possibility would be worth investigating in future studies. Regarding tau, we observed a significant decrease in 55 kDa and 50 kDa tau protein bands and non-significant decrease in 48 kDa and total tau proteins. Protein signals were scanned and quantified independently by different raters. We urge caution in interpretation, since the 50 kDa band, though light and distinct, was not well separated from the much darker and more widely expressed 48kDa band. Attempts to resolve the two by adjusting exposure of ECL signal or lowering loading protein samples would have rendered both the 50kDa and 55kDa bands difficult or impossible to detect. However, if the analysis were done for each individual band's densitometry as a fraction of total tau signal, we found the same results with 55kDa, but the proportion of 48kDa tau vs. total tau was elevated after miR-298 treatment (data not shown). Repeating the experiment with several mixed brain cultures from HFB samples of similar demography and clinical history could be tried, beyond the three cases we tried (data not shown). Unfortunately, obtaining a supply of HFB remains a critical challenge [88] . Finally, in our experiments we observed 3 major tau forms, and not the six tau isoforms observed generally in case of adult human brain [89] . The progression of tau expression from 3 to 6 forms, with or without 3 repeats, and consequent tau's expanding role from the fetal to adult stage, would warrant an important area of further investigation. Potential complexity of miR-298 activity could reach beyond even these pathways, given that miR-298 participates in interspecies communication of some form. That is to say, miR-298 is among the known miRNAs whose levels are altered by the gut microbiome, specifically in the ilium [90] . In addition, microbiome manipulation in the ilium resulted in disruption of several proteins' levels, including proteins regulated by miR-298. These included the chaperone FK06 binding protein 51 kDa (FKBP5). FKBP5 mediates oligomerization of tau [91] . Another potential miR-298 target disrupted by manipulation of the ilium microbiome was stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme 1 (SCD1). Desaturases underlie some tau hyperphosphorylation pathways [92] , and SCD1 in particular is elevated in brains of AD patients [93] . How much this may be connected to results in our cell culture studies, of course, remains to be seen.\nOn searching for reported SNPs within the MIR-298 gene, we found one SNP (rs71828623) with a G/T mutation within the seed sequence of MIR-298. However, it had no reported association with any AD biomarker or subphenotype. We also found other SNPs in proximity of the MIR-298 gene, two of which were associated with the AD biomarkers CSF phosphorylated tau (rs6070629) and CSF A\u03b242 (rs79259988). The specific phosphorylation variant pT181-Q\u00df associated with rs6070629 has also been tested as a vaccine antigen. This vaccine induced robust, protective immunity against tauopathy [94] .\nThe predominant model of miRNA protein translation suppression is that RISC binds to mRNA and destabilizes the molecule [95] . We, therefore, tested whether or not induction of overexpression of miR-298 would alter overall levels of mRNA for APP, BACE1, and tau. We found that APP and BACE1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced, while tau reduction was not significant. Given that miR-298 reduced levels of only a single tau variant, this is not surprising, since the activity of miR-298 on tau may be through inducing alternate splicing and/or phosphorylation.\nWhen we examined expression of miR-298 in the human brain by qPCR, we found that miR-298 levels were reduced in AD, but only in the TL (BA 21/22). Both cerebellum and PCC had no differences by disease status. Interestingly, pilot miRNA sequencing of non-AD and AD PCC tissue from the Rush cohort (n = 10/group) revealed a~3-fold upregulation of miR-298 in AD. The discrepancy between these data and the qPCR-based results may be technology-specific, as a systematic comparison of microarray profiling, qPCR, and next-generation sequencing of miRNAs demonstrated that miRNA levels derived from sequencing and qPCR could differ by as much as 5 log2 [96] . Furthermore, we only found the difference when looking at relative (\u0394\u0394Ct) measurement. When we looked at absolute mass of miRNA, no apparent AD-related change existed. Conclusive resolution of these apparent paradoxes will require further work. However, we do note reports that indicate both absolute and relative quantification of mRNA may be of use [97] . Technical hurdles, such as circumventing the blood-brain barrier, still exist, but advancing techniques, such as viral, liposomal, or convection-enhanced delivery that may yet overcome this issue [98] [99] [100] . Finally, a better picture would be obtained by including brains from donors with subjective cognitive decline or MCI [101, 102] , since the consensus of the field has evolved to include the premise that critical changes in brains are most likely to happen well before any overt clinical presentation. Nevertheless, our demonstration that miR-298 modulates APP, BACE1, and tau isoform or phosphorylation levels has implications for its utility as a drug target.\nCurrently approved treatments for AD consist of cholinesterase inhibitors and a single NMDA antagonist. While ablation of BACE1 expression and/or activity has been shown to reverse AD pathology in AD-transgenic mice [103] , clinical trials have been unsuccessful. In fact, the majority of more recent anti-AD drug candidates have been BACE1 inhibitors, but have been withdrawn due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. The possibility may exist that a sufficiently high dose of a BACE1 inhibitor may be inherently toxic, due to BACE1's multiple other substrates [104] [105] [106] . Treatments that target A\u03b2 directly have also not fared well. All these approaches share a single feature: They pick one aspect of AD and target it exclusively. AD is a multifaceted disorder. Even at its simplest, it cannot be reduced to a tauopathy or an amyloidosis; AD is a tauopathy and an amyloidosis. Therapeutics that target tau are being researched for AD, but trials are concentrating on the N terminus of the tau protein, which is often truncated in AD [107] . An alternative is an antibody-based approach [108] , which is being tested for progressive supranuclear palsy. However, anti-A\u03b2 treatments for AD appear to be meeting limited success. Perhaps a single target with multivalent effects (e.g., APP, BACE1, and p-tau), may prove more useful. In some cases, a single miRNA may play a role in multiple disorders, such as the potential for miR-101 to be involved in both AD and pulmonary fibrosis [109] . As a methodological note, our choice of hsa-miR-186 as a negative control for APP regulation was not coincidental. This miRNA species is known to downregulate BACE1 and its downregulation during aging may increase risk of AD [108, 111] .\nThis present work significantly advances the field. Specific miRNAs play a critical role in brain aging, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and brain trauma [112] miRNAs play major roles in cognitive impairment in both AD-like pathology and dementia with Lewy bodies [113, 114] . For example, miR-455-3p may have protective effects against abnormal APP processing and A\u03b2-toxicity in AD [115] . Furthermore, specific miRNAs may associate with mitochondrial metabolism, cholinergic imbalances, and epileptiform activity [116, 117] . Notably, a family of miRNAs that has strong implications in multiple disorders, including neurodegenerative (miR-15/107) is significantly expressed in human brain tissues [118, 119] . At the functional level, neuronal-expressed microRNA-targeted pseudogenes compete with coding genes in the human brain [120] . How miR-298 could exert other roles beyond what we report here warrants further investigation.\nWe identified miR-298 as a novel therapeutic target to reduce expression of APP and BACE1 and reduce levels of two moieties of t-tau. In addition, levels of A\u03b2 peptides are significantly reduced, presumably by reduction of both the APP substrate and the rate-limiting BACE1 enzyme. This result has applications to both understanding the mechanism of AD as well as treating the neurodegenerative disorder. Thus, miR-298 has the potential to be a regulator of multiple proteins that are critical in AD etiology and development."}, {"section_title": "Data availability", "text": "The datasets generated during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."}]
