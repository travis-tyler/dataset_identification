The BRFSS collects information about respondents' county of residence, making countylevel analyses possible. Recently, public health practitioners have been interested in obtaining BRFSS data on the substate level; however, the small county-level samples often produce unstable prevalence estimates with large standard errors. CDC recommends a minimum of 50 observations to reliably estimate prevalence (1) .\nBreast cancer control is a research area that could benefit from estimating prevalence at the substate level. Most of the data available on the use of preventive services, like mammography, are national and state data, and studies have identified correlates of cancer screening on these geographic levels by using national health survey data (2, 3) . Research is needed on subpopulations defined by geographic units smaller than the state because findings from the national or even state level often do not translate to the contextual experience of women on the county or neighborhood level (4) . Substate variation in mammography prevalence (5, 6) has been found for metropolitan statistical areas and counties with adequate sample size (\u226550). Geographic gaps exist in mammography interventions; certain areas disproportionately receive funds and outreach (7) . Women who are not screened may be concentrated in locations with particular screening barriers (8) .\nData aggregation strategies attempt to overcome sample-size limitations by combining several years of data for 1 county (9) or combining data from several neighboring counties (3) . However, temporal aggregations conceal time-trend differences, and spatial aggregations limit the ability to show interarea differences. An alternative method is small-area analysis, a statistical procedure that aims to produce stable estimates for areas of inadequate sample size. Studies have used various small-area estimation techniques to estimate prevalence at the substate level (10, 11) . However, a recent study found that synthetic multilevel regression produced the most valid prevalence estimates (1) .\nThe purpose of this study was to apply the synthetic regression estimation technique to determine the extent to which geographic disparities exist in mammography and the extent to which the magnitude and distribution of geographic disparities vary by race and age. One of the national health objectives related to public health infrastructure is to ensure that health agencies have the necessary infrastructure by increasing the proportion of leading health indicators for which data are available (12) . If data are not available to state and local public health agencies, then health or access problems may not be identified for a population or distinct subpopulations of an area (13) . Local health departments can use small-area analysis for their data needs at these local levels and for select populations in these areas to identify disparities and target interventions and public health funding."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sources", "text": "The BRFSS is an annual random-digit-dialed survey of noninstitutionalized adults (\u226518 years) that is funded by CDC and executed by health departments in every state and the District of Columbia (14) .

Mammography facility data certified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17) provided a county-level measure of access to mammography facilities. We merged and linked data sets by BRFSS respondents' county of residence."}, {"section_title": "Study sample", "text": "The analyses included women aged 40 to 79 years. An age threshold of 40 years captured the most inclusive screening guidelines provided by the American Cancer Society and the US Preventive Services Task Force (18, 19) . We selected an age limit of 79 years because the benefit of screening for older women is debatable (20, 21) . For these analyses, the age range of the BRFSS sample matched the age categories of the census data.\nOf the 58,901 women aged 40 to 79 who participated in the 2000 BRFSS, we excluded from the analyses women with missing information on county code (n = 14,599; 24.8% of initial sample), who refused to provide their county of residence (n = 167; 0.3% of initial sample), and with \"don't know\" or \"not sure\" responses to county of residence (n = 140; 0.2% of initial sample). A large percentage of women were missing information on county of residence because CDC set the county code as missing for women from counties with fewer than 50 observations in the 2000 public-use BRFSS data.

Additionally, Hispanic ethnicity was not included in our cross-classification of race and age because it was not possible to use census data to create a cross-classification of race, ethnicity, and age for noninstitutionalized women aged 18 years or older. We also considered county-level variables shown to be related to recent mammography as confounders, similar to variables explored by Legler et al (23) . We used scatterplots and correlation coefficients to evaluate collinear relationships among independent variables. The final model included average per capita annual household income (census data), number of doctors per 10,000 women aged 40 or older and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (Area Resource File data), and number of FDA-certified mammography facilities per 10,000 women aged 40 or older (FDA data).

First, we used generalized estimating equations for logistic regression to analyze the association between recent mammography and the race-age variable, producing a predicted prevalence for each race-age category.

We built separate models for each regional census division to account for regional effects when predicting mammography prevalence.\nNext, we used the resulting predicted probabilities from step 1 in the synthetic estimation of mammography prevalence to estimate the proportion of women in each county who reported recently having had a mammogram. The synthetic estimate of the prevalence (p j ) of recent mammography for county j equaled\nwhere p ij is the predicted probability for a specified raceage category from step 1; n ij is the number of women in race-age group (i) who reside in the county (j); and n j is the total number of women aged 40 to 79 who reside in the county (j). The sum of the race-age weighted prevalences equaled the prevalence of recent mammography for the county.\nWe performed all statistical analyses by using SAS version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and SAS-Callable SUDAAN version 9.1 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) to adjust for complex survey design. We used small-area analysis to estimate the prevalence of recent mammography in each county for women aged 40 to 79. Further, we repeated the procedure to estimate county-level mammography prevalence for each race and age category to determine the extent to which geographic disparities existed for and differed by sociodemographic subgroups.\nWe mapped results using ArcGIS version 9.2 (ESRI, Redlands, California), which produced a visualization of county-level prevalence to identify geographic disparities in screening.

We hypothesized that county-level analyses would produce similar patterns in prevalence as found at the state level, that counties in the Northeast would report the highest prevalence of mammography, and that counties in the Southeast and Mountain regions would report the lowest prevalence. A prior study found similar geographic patterns when using 2002 BRFSS data to estimate prevalence of mammography for the 9 census regions (5). We posited that some intrastate variation in mammography prevalence would be observed and that the magnitude and location of these geographic disparities would vary by race or age. We further hypothesized that counties with a greater proportion of younger and nonwhite women would have lower prevalence of mammography because these groups have historically had lower prevalence of mammography (25) and are not uniformly represented across US counties (22) ."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of small-area estimates", "text": "Because a gold standard was unavailable, we used statelevel direct estimates to evaluate the validity of small-area estimates.

P values < .05 were considered significant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The prevalence of recent mammography in our national sample of women aged 40 to 79 years was 78.5%. The average county-level prevalence of recent mammography was 77.9% (95% CI, 77.8%-78.0%) ( Table 1) ; small-area estimates on the county level ranged from 69.6% to 84.0%.\nWe found county prevalence estimates calculated by using small-area analysis to be generally reliable. Overall, 99.6% of counties had 95% confidence intervals within 5 percentage points of the estimates. For example, the prevalence of recent mammography for women aged 40 to 79 in Stephens County, Georgia, was 80.0% (95% CI, 78.9%-81.0%). The largest confidence interval for a countylevel prevalence estimate (59.3%-79.9%) was in Shannon County, South Dakota.\nThe highest prevalence of mammography in our study sample was in the New England, North and South Atlantic, and East North Central census divisions (Figure) . The lowest prevalence of mammography was in the Mountain states and Texas. Intrastate variation was greatest in California, where certain counties were in the lowest category of prevalence (69.6%-74.3%) and others were in the highest category (\u226581.6).\nCounty-level prevalence estimates varied by race (raceand age-specific maps not shown). For white race, the average county-level prevalence was 78.4%, and countylevel estimates ranged from 73.8% to 84.3%. Lower-prevalence areas clustered in Texas and the Mountain states, and areas on the high end of the distribution clustered in the Pacific, New England, and Atlantic divisions.\nThe average county-level prevalence was 78.5% for black women and 67.4% for women of other nonwhite race. While The average county-level prevalence was highest for women aged 50 to 64 (82.3%), followed by women aged 65 to 79 (80.7%), and then lowest for women aged 40 to 49 (71.2%). Although women aged 40 to 49 had on average the lowest county-level prevalence of recent mammography, the largest range in county-level prevalence estimates was seen in women aged 65 to 79 (range, 53.0%-88.0%). Texas, the south Mountain division, and southern California had the lowest screening prevalence for women aged 40 to 49 (56.7%-67.4%), while the New England and East North Central divisions had the highest prevalence of mammography for women in this age group (75.8%-79.8%). Intrastate variation in prevalence existed in North and South Dakota. Prevalence of recent mammography for women aged 50 to 64 was high (75.7%-89.5%); areas of highest prevalence were found in the New England and South Atlantic states (85.1%-89.5%). The Southern California, Mountain, and parts of the South Central divisions had the areas of lowest prevalence for this age group (75.7%-80.2%). Finally, the Pacific, Mountain, New England, and parts of the South Atlantic divisions had the highest prevalence of recent mammography for women aged 65 to 79 (84.0%-88.0%). Counties in the West North Central census division and parts of Texas had the lowest prevalence of mammography for women in this oldest age group (53.0%-77.9%).\nOn average, small-area estimates aggregated to the state level were within 2.4 percentage points of the directly derived state estimates of recent mammography prevalence from the BRFSS (range, \u221210.3 to 8.6) ( Table 2) .

The smallest differences occurred in Kansas, New York, and North Carolina, where the aggregated value underestimated the direct value by 0.3 percentage points."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We demonstrated the value of small-area analysis in producing county-level prevalence estimates of mammography for women aged 40 to 79 years. The prevalence of recent mammography across counties in the continental United States is generally high. Our findings were consistent with estimates calculated for metropolitan statistical areas by using BRFSS data from a similar time period (9) . Furthermore, we showed that small-area estimates aggregated to the state level were comparable to state-level direct estimates of recent mammography prevalence.\nMapping of prevalence estimates showed that the location and magnitude of screening disparities varied by race and age. County-level prevalence estimates and lower minimum prevalence values varied more for black and other nonwhite women than for white women. Research shows substantial disparities in the quality and quantity of health care received by minority populations (26) , and these disparities are disproportionately distributed across the nation (27) . Regional variations in mammography use by race are likely due to quality of care, insurance coverage, and availability of health care to minority populations (28) . By monitoring mammography use in minority populations and tracking these geographic variations, interventions aimed at improving quality and access can be targeted to the neediest counties (23).\nOur age-related findings may be likely explained by confusion over conflicting screening recommendations for younger and older women. In 2000, the benefit of mammography for women younger than 50 was being debated because the reduction in breast cancer mortality for these women was uncertain, given their low incidence of cancer (19, 29) . Similar questions arose concerning the benefits of screening for older women, who commonly have comorbidities and lower life expectancy (20, 21) (56.7%-79.8%) was generally lower than for other age groups, and range in county-level prevalence estimates was largest among women aged 65 to 79 (53.0%-88.0%).\nWomen in these age categories may differentially be recommended for mammography by clinicians or have misperceptions about their need for screening. A recent study found that among women with access to health care, nonscreeners were more likely to be younger (aged 40-49), and these younger women were more likely to have postponed having a mammogram than to not realize that they needed the examination (30) . Additionally, among women aged 65 or older with access to health care, 75% reported no mammography recommendation from a physician in the past year (30) . Knowledge of age-related geographic disparities could help public health professionals in underscreened counties develop programs targeted to 2 groups: women who might not perceive the benefit of mammography at their age and clinicians who might not be recommending or referring younger and older women to screening.\nFindings showed intrastate variation in county-level prevalence of mammography. Conducting substate surveillance for subpopulations (eg, by race or age) to identify interregional and intrastate differences is vital to state and local health officials' understanding of who remains underscreened for breast cancer (9) . This knowledge can be used to design interventions and formulate policies to increase screening in high-risk areas, subsequently reducing rates of breast cancer mortality and late-stage diagnosis (31) .\nIn general, we observed little variability in the small-area estimates for women aged 40 to 79, probably because of the selection of a cross-classification variable. Unfortunately, a race-age-sex cross-classification was the only combination of variables possible using publicly available census data for the noninstitutionalized adult population. Previous studies identified race and age as determinants of screening use (32, 33) , but income and insurance/usual provider are stronger determinants of screening (34) . If our crossclassification variable could include income and insurance/ usual provider, then we would probably have seen more variation in small-area screening prevalences, especially since the relationship between income, insurance/usual provider, and screening varies by region (9) . Even with this attenuation, small-area estimation is necessary to understand geographic disparities in mammography use if the results are reported appropriately. The results are valuable for surveillance purposes and tracking trends over time because these are often the only data available on the substate level (35) .\nSmall-area estimation was necessary because 92% of US counties (using 2000 BRFSS data) had insufficient sample size to estimate the prevalence of mammography. CDC in recent years has increased the sample size of the BRFSS to support substate or subpopulation analyses (6) . From 2000 to 2006, the number of women aged 40 to 79 who were interviewed increased from 62,389 to 146,156. Even with the BRFSS sample size increase, small-area estimation methods would be needed to estimate mammography prevalence in 80% of US counties in 2006. CDC should continue increasing the BRFSS sample size by recommending target sample-size goals and providing funding to states.\nThis study has several potential biases and limitations. The political and conceptual definitions of county differ by state. In the BRFSS, the parishes, boroughs, or counties defined within a state are identified by using FIPS county codes. However, public health departments, outreach, and interventions do not occur on these levels in all states. For example, some states, such as Rhode Island, have regional or state health departments rather than county health departments, and thus county data mean little or nothing in terms of public health activities in these states. These different meanings of \"county\" may have introduced random error into our results. Additionally, questions on the BRFSS do not allow differentiation of screening mammograms from diagnostic mammograms; thus, BRFSS data may overestimate the prevalence of screening mammography.\nThis study excluded 14,906 women with no information on FIPS county code to link with census data because CDC did not include county code in the BRFSS for people residing in counties with fewer than 50 observations. The purpose is to prevent the public from analyzing and reporting prevalence estimates for counties with inadequate sample size. In our exploratory analyses, compared with included women, women excluded from the analyses were more likely to be non-Hispanic white, married, and educated (college graduates). While it is uncertain how our small-area estimates would differ with the inclusion of these women, the estimates would probably be slightly higher because education, marriage, and white race are all positively associated with mammography use (2).\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions. Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by any of the groups named above.\nFinally, data collected for the BRFSS are self-reported. Research generally shows self-reported cancer screening history to be valid (36) . However, mammography was found to be overreported in the BRFSS by racial/ethnic minority women when Medicare claims data were used as the standard (37) , and thus BRFSS-derived prevalence of mammography for minority women may be overestimated. Furthermore, prior studies found that women tend to underestimate time since their last mammogram (\"telescoping\"), which could also contribute to overestimation of BRFSS data (38).\nIn conclusion, small-area estimation using BRFSS data is advantageous for surveillance of mammography at the county level. This method allowed us to document geographic disparities and improve knowledge of the spatial distribution of mammography prevalence. Future interventions should consider this county-level geographic variation to target women in the neediest counties. "}]
