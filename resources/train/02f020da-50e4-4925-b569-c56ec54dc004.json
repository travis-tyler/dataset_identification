We hypothesized that: (1) streams in watersheds with higher percentages of forest cover will have lower nitrogen concentrations and export rates; and (2 ) nitrogen in base flow, derived from agricultural sources, will support extensive mats of opportunistic macroalgae in shallow areas of the lagoon. This study quantified base flow nutrient export rates for one year from fourteen first-order streams, distributed along a 70 km north-south transect of the Virginia (VA) Eastern Shore. We measured monthly dissolved inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations (nitrate (NO3'), nitrite (NO2\"), ammonium (NEU+), phosphate (PO43'), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) and water discharge rates. We assessed relationships of nutrient concentrations and export rates with watershed characteristics (e.g., land cover and soil drainage class). Nitrogen budgets for all fourteen watersheds were developed to provide estimates of nitrogen retention rates. Lastly, we predicted the total annual nitrogen loading rate in base flow from Hog Island Bay watersheds based on a multiple regression model to determine if it is sufficient to support observed annual average macroalgal biomass in this coastal lagoon on the VA Eastern Shore. W ater discharge rates in the streams studied (range: 1.44-34.60 cm/yr) were likely lower than the long-term average because the study occurred during a severe drought period (2001)(2002). NO3' was the primary N species found in base flow (66-98% of total N). Monthly DIN:DIP ratios for the streams were generally greater than 16, indicating that the streams were phosphorus limited during base flow conditions. Watersheds in the northern region had significantly higher annual flow-weighted mean NO3' and DON concentrations than southern streams (north and south respectively, NO3 ': 275.3 and 111.8 (iM;DON: 25.3 and 8.3 pM). Seasonal mean NO3' concentrations were significantly higher in winter than other seasons, while mean DOC and NH4+ concentrations were significantly higher in summer than other seasons. For the southern streams (n=9), annual flow-weighted mean NCV concentrations and export rates were negatively related to percent of forest cover in the watersheds (r2=0.53; p=0.026). In a multiple regression analysis with forest cover, we found that the addition of percent of developed land cover explained more of the variance in NO3' export rates (r2=0.86; p=0.003), in which higher percentages of developed land cover were related to higher NO3' export rates. Relationships of other nutrient exports with watershed characteristics were unclear. Nutrient export rates estimated for predominantly forested watersheds in the VA Eastern Shore (TDN: 0.12-2.3 kg N/ha/yr; DON: 0.04-0.08 kg N/ha/yr; DOC: 2.4-3.8 kg C/ha/yr; P 0 43*: 0.005-0.012 kg P/ha/yr) were generally lower than those for predominantly agricultural watersheds (TDN: 1.6-9.2 kg N/ha/yr; DON: 0.07-0.23 kg N/ha/yr; DOC 3.2-8.4 kg C/ha/yr; and P 0 43': 0.007-0.039 kg P/ha/yr). This study's estimates were similar to those reported for Maryland and Delaware, in particular nutrient export rates determined for a low precipitation year. Calculations of N budgets showed that agricultural land cover received much higher net N inputs than forested and developed land covers. Calculated agricultural and forest net N input rates (respectively, 23-36 kg N/ha/yr and 1-6 kg N/ha/yr) were in the range of those estimated in other studies. The mean of 81 percent (range: 50-99%) of total net N inputs was retained in the watersheds or lost due to denitrification, similar to forest N retention rates of 70-90% estimated in other studies. Riparian forests, which are frequently associated with poorly drained soils, likely removed N in ground water through uptake into woody biomass as well as denitrification. The predicted TDN load in base flow from watersheds of Hog Island Bay (20,896 kg N/year) was sufficient to support estimated mean macroalgal N demand (19,371 kg N/yr). Consequently, base flow derived from the shallow aquifer is a significant source of N supporting macroalgal production in Hog Island Bay. Other potential N sources include DON from micro-and macroalgal exudation and microbial decomposition of organic matter, direct atmospheric deposition, and direct ground water discharge to coastal lagoons."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Eutrophication is a growing problem in coastal ecosystems world-wide where land use changes in watersheds can promote increased release of nutrients that support primary production (Valiela e t al., 1992;Nixon, 1995;NRC, 2000;Howarth et al., 2002). Excess primary production can cause ecological changes, such as oxygen depletion (hypoxia and anoxia) and fish and shellfish mortalities (Valiela et al., 1992;Valiela et al., 1997;Cloem, 1999;Cloem, 1996). In shallow coastal lagoons, nutrient enrichment has led to shifts in community structure of primary producers, with macroalgae or phytoplankton displacing seagrasses and causing anoxic events and decreased invertebrate abundance and species richness (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Valiela et al., 1992). Experimental evidence indicates that N is the key limiting nutrient for macroalgal and phytoplankton growth in shallow coastal waters (Taylor et al., 1995;Pedersen and Borum, 1996). Shallow coastal lagoons and bays, which are important types of ecosystems located at the land-sea margin of continents, constitute 13% of the world's coasts (Nixon, 1982). Lagoons are often located behind barrier islands and are commonly described as having shallow depths (<3 m), low freshwater input from streams and rivers, and narrow connections with the bordering ocean (Kjerfve and McGill, 1989). On the seaside of the Eastern Shore of Virginia (VA) during some years, extensive mats of opportunistic macroalgae bloom in localized, shallow areas of the coastal lagoons (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Tyler et alia., 2001). In Hog Island Bay, a coastal lagoon located within the Virginia Coastal Reserve -Long Term Ecological Research site (VCR-LTER), die-backs and decomposition of macroalgae have led to localized areas of anoxia during the summer. While Hog Island Bay lost its seagrasses by 1933 from \"wasting disease\" (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Tyler et alia., 2001), Chincoteague Bay continues to have the seagrass, Zostera marina, commonly called eelgrass (Boynton et al., 1996). Nitrogen enrichment appears to be contributing to decreased densities of plants in the seagrass beds, possibly from shading by phytoplankton, epiphytes, or macroalgae. Base flow, which is ground water discharge to streams, can be a major mechanism for transporting nutrients to coastal waters in comparison to surface water runoff in streams (Jordan et al., 1997a, Valiela et a l, 1992, Bachman et al., 1998. Researchers suspect that nitrogen in base flow, derived from agricultural sources, supports the observed macroalgal mats in Virginia's coastal lagoons (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Tyler et alia., 2001). Identifying potential sources and sinks of nutrients in ground water discharging to tributaries of the VA Eastern Shore coastal lagoons is critical for developing water quality management strategies and addressing the effects of nutrient enrichment to coastal ecosystems. Some research has been conducted on nutrient ground water discharge (direct discharge or base flow) to the Chesapeake Bay estuary (Bachman et al., 1998;Jordan et al., 1997a;Libelo et al., 1991;Reay et al., 1993;Reay, 2002, Liu et al., 2000), but little research has focused on examining or quantifying this potential source of nutrients to coastal lagoons of the mid-Atlantic region (except Dillow and Greene, 1999;Speiran, 1996;Speiran et al., 1997), especially in Virginia. Estuaries are usually distinguished from coastal lagoons because they are generally deeper, receive larger riverine input, and have more exchange with the adjacent ocean; thus their responses to increased nutrient loadings are likely to be dissimilar (Kjerfve and McGill, 1989). Furthermore, the VA Eastern Shore, located on the lower Delmarva Peninsula, has flatter topography and smaller catchment size than the upper Delmarva Peninsula (Maryland and Delaware), where several base flow and total stream flow studies have been conducted (Jordan et a l, 1997a, b;Phillips and Bachman, 1996;Bachman and Phillips, 1996;Liu et a l, 2000). These differences may lead to some regional departures in nutrient export and water discharge rates in the lower Delmarva Peninsula from those in the upper Delmarva Peninsula. Because of the lack of watershed studies in the VA Eastern Shore, in particular catchments of coastal lagoons, it is important to quantify base flow nutrient discharges and assess effects of watershed characteristic directly rather than draw conclusions from other studies. Some studies have found significant relationships between nutrient concentrations in base flow and ground water and land cover in the watershed (Valiela et a l, 1992;Phillips and Bachman, 1996;Jordan et a l, 1997a;Liu et a l, 2000). Ground water discharge from agricultural and urban areas with septic tanks generally contains elevated concentrations of nitrate or ammonium, while ground water from forested and wooded areas has low nitrate and ammonium concentrations (Libelo et a l, 1991;Reay et al, 1991;Simmons et a l, 1991;Valiela et a l, 1992). Soil characteristics in the watershed are additional factors that can affect nitrogen concentrations and speciation in base flow. For example, poorly drained, saturated, and high organic content soils, which tend to be anoxic, can promote the loss of nitrate through denitrification (Groffman et a l, 1993;Hanson et a l, 1994;Groffman and Hanson, 1997;Speiran et a l, 1997;Flite et a l, 2001;Meisinger and Randall, 1991). In areas such as the Coastal Plain region, riparian forests typically have poorly drained sediments, which can potentially facilitate removal of N from ground water via both plant uptake and denitrification, with estimated forest N retention rates of 70 to 90% (Peterjohn and Cornell, 1984;Lowrance et a l, 1984a;Jacobs and Gilliam, 1985;Reay et al., 1991;Phillips et a l, 1993;Jordan et al., 1993;Lowrance et a l, 1997). The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify base flow nutrient discharges as a source of nutrients to the Eastern Shore coastal lagoons in VA. We determined relationships of various watershed characteristics, including land cover and soil drainage class, to nutrient concentrations and export rates in fourteen streams, distributed along a 70 km north-south transect of the VA Eastern Shore. Nitrogen budgets of the watersheds were developed to provide estimates of potential riparian forest N retention rates. We then predicted the total annual nitrogen loading rate from base flow to Hog Island Bay to determine if it is sufficient to support macroalgal biomass observed in this coastal lagoon."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nutrient sources and movement in water", "text": "There are many anthropogenic sources of nutrients to surface and ground waters, including: fossil fuels, fertilizer, symbiotic N fixation from leguminous crops, animal waste, septic systems, waste water from treatment plants, and atmospheric deposition (Jordan and Weller, 1996;Howarth et a l, 2002;NRC, 2000). Atmospheric deposition is primarily derived from NH3 emissions from fertilizer, soil, and animal waste and NOx emissions from fossil fuel combustion by automobiles and power plants (Russell et a l, 6 1998). The dominant nutrient sources to coastal waters vary depending on land use activities in the watershed. Nutrients can enter water initially during recharge to aquifer (ground water) from the watershed or in direct surface water runoff from land to streams (storm water runoff) during precipitation events ( Figure 1) (Phillips et al., 1999). Ground water discharge to streams from the saturated zone of shallow aquifers is called base flow , it provides sustained flow of water in streams when there are no precipitation events (Phillips et al., 1999;Bachman et a l, 1998). In addition, water from the unsaturated zone of the aquifer (soil water) can mix with infiltrating precipitation and discharge to streams during and after storms (Phillips et al., 1999). As a result, stream flow is composed of base flow, soil water, and storm water runoff, depending on the precipitation events. Small headwater streams ( < 1 0 m width) transport most of the water and nutrients from the watershed and frequently represent up to 85% of total stream length (Peterson et al., 2001). Ground water can also discharge directly to coastal waters (e.g., bays, lagoons) (Tobias et al., 2001;Dillow and Greene, 1999); however this study focused on base flow. N loading rates from base flow are thought to be quantitatively more important than loading rates from direct discharge. Dillow and Greene (1999) estimated potential nitrate loading from direct discharge of ground water to several coastal bays of Maryland to be 123,400 kg N per year, which is one-third the potential nitrate loading from base flow (391,000 kg N per year). Due to different flow paths and rates of ground water flow, age of ground water in the aquifer can vary, with younger water at shallower depths and older water at greater depths (Figure 1). Bohlke and Denver (1995) found in two streams on the upper  (Phillips et a l, 1999) Delmarva Peninsula (Maryland) that age of ground water discharging beneath the center of streams was generally older than water discharging at the edge of streams. They observed that discharging ground water measured at sites less than 2 m apart within a stream were more than 1 0 years different in age, indicating that ground water flow lines were close together and nearly vertical beneath the stream. Speiran et al. (1997) also observed a similar pattern of ground water flow paths and ages in the aquifer of three streams in the lower Delmarva Peninsula (Virginia), with age increasing with greater aquifer depth and older water discharging beneath the center of streams. Of 48 springs sampled in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, 75 percent had \"apparent\" ages of less than 1 0 years and 1 0 percent had apparent ages between 1 0 and 20 years (Phillips et al., 1999). \"Apparent\" age is based on chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) dating techniques and is the amount of time since water entered the aquifer. For samples specifically in the Coastal Plain hydrogeomorphic region, the apparent age ranged from 6 to 12 years old. Bohlke and Denver's (1995) analysis of concentrations of conserved species (e.g., M g2+ from artificial fertilizer application) in base flow suggested that ground water discharging to the highest headwaters of streams were relatively young (about 20 years old). Robinson and Reay (2002) found that average residence times ranged from 16 to 21 years in an outer Coastal Plain watershed on the VA Eastern Shore that discharged to the Chesapeake Bay. Consequently, nutrient water quality in base flow generally represents the effects of land use activities that occurred in the past. Base flow, in comparison to surface water runoff, is a significant source of water to streams. Bachman et al. (1998) estimated that base flow accounted for 16 to 92 percent of total stream flow, with a median value of 54 percent, at 276 sampling sites in non-tidal streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In particular, the median contribution of base flow to total stream flow was greater than 60 percent in Coastal Plain streams (both Coastal Plain Undissected Uplands and Dissected Uplands) ( Figure 2). Base flow was about 60 percent of total stream flow for the Morgan creek watershed in the upper Delmarva Peninsula, Maryland (Bohlke and Denver, 1995). Phillips and Bachman (1996) estimated that base flow accounted for 80 percent of stream flow at eight sites in the Delmarva Peninsula. Base flow can also be a major mechanism for transporting nutrients to coastal waters in comparison to surface water runoff (Jordan et al., 1997a, Valiela et al., 1992. In the Chesapeake Bay watershed, base flow was reported to account for 26 to almost 100 percent of nitrate load in total flow, with a median value of 56 percent (Bachman et al., 1998). Bohlke and Denver (1995) found lower nitrate concentrations in storm flow samples taken during two rain events than in base flow samples, suggesting that storm water runoff likely diluted base flow and contributed a smaller portion of nutrients to total stream flow. Jordan et al. (1997a) also noted that the nitrate concentration increased as the proportion of base flow increased in streams of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions of the Chesapeake Bay. In addition, they found that base flow index (proportion of base flow in total stream flow), along with percent cropland and their interaction, explained 79% of the variance of nitrate concentrations in streams. In another study, nitrate and nitrite concentrations were analyzed over a tidal cycle in Phillips Creek, which is located on the lower Eastern Shore, VA (Neikirk, 1996). There was a strong negative relationship between salinity and NO2' and NO3\" concentrations, indicating that stream flow may be the source of nitrogen ( Figure 3). Samples were taken when there were no Figure 2. Box plot and whiskers of the percentage of base flow to total stream flow in different hydrogeomorphic regions in the Chesapeake Bay.

VA (Neikirk. 1996). precipitation events for several days preceding the sampling, therefore the stream flow was mainly base flow."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen transformation processes", "text": "Key nitrogen transformation processes are remineralization, nitrification, denitrification, assimilation, and nitrogen fixation, all of which are primarily microbially mediated. Along ground water flow paths in an aquifer through residential, agricultural, and riparian zones, various chemical and physical conditions (e.g., redox potential, organic matter content, electron donor and/or acceptor availability) may affect nitrogen speciation and concentrations. Processing could also occur in stream water during transport down the stream channel, as well as in ground water during discharge through organic-rich sediments to streams. Remineralization of protein and other dissolved organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria during aerobic or anaerobic respiration releases ammonium and phosphate ( Figure 4). Denitrification is a microbially mediated process that causes the net loss of fixed nitrogen from a system (Ward, 2000). Denitrifiers use NO3' as an electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration of labile organic matter, reducing NO3' to various intermediates, with N2 usually as the final product. The denitrification pathway follows: NO3' (nitrate) => NO2* (nitrite) => NO (nitric oxide) => N20 (nitrous oxide) => N2 (Capone, 2000). An alternative pathway for nitrate reduction is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) (Tiedje, 1998;Tobias et al., 2001). Bohlke and Denver (1995) observed that in an agriculturally dominated watershed with anoxic ground water,  NO3' concentrations were lower than in a similar watershed with oxic ground water. Excess N2 in the anoxic water samples provided evidence of denitrification. McMahon and Bohlke (1996) also found evidence of denitrification in an alluvial aquifer near Greeley, Colorado based on excess N2 and enrichment of 15N-NC>3' with a concurrent decrease in NO3' concentrations along the ground water flow path. A supply of labile organic carbon is required for denitrification and higher organic matter content soils tends to have higher denitrification rates (Meisinger and Randall, 1991). Pavel et al. (1996) observed that denitrification rates were positively correlated with organic carbon content of surficial riparian wetland soils near a stream in an inner Coastal Plain watershed. Frequently, denitrification is dependent on nitrification for a source of substrate, a process termed \"coupled nitrification-denitrification\" (Ward, 2000, Capone, 2000. Nitrification involves oxidation of ammonium and nitrite to nitrate by 0 2. Under anoxic conditions, ammonium remains untransformed. If denitrifiers do not obtain their nitrate from nitrifiers, then nitrification and denitrification are uncoupled. Prokaryotes and higher autotrophic organisms, such as plants, trees, phytoplankton, and benthic micro-and macroalgae, assimilate inorganic nitrogen for organic matter production, as well as release DON and DOC. Before inorganic nitrogen can be assimilated, oxidized forms, such as N 0 2* and NO3' must be reduced to N H / by assimilatory N 0 2' and NO3' reductase (Capone, 2000). Nitrogen fixation is the process of reducing N2 to NH4+, which is mediated by a large diverse group of bacteria and archaea, including cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixers make nitrogen biologically available to organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments. ammonium, whereas ground water from forested and wooded areas has low nitrate and ammonium concentrations (Libelo et al., 1991;Simmons et a l, 1991;Valiela et a l, 1992;Reay et a l, 1991). Heisig (1999) found a positive linear relationship between nitrate concentration in base flow and unsewered housing density in 33 small watersheds in southeastern New York, with highest nitrate concentrations in the winter and lowest levels in the summer. These studies suggest that forests can take up DIN from ground water and that agriculture and septic tanks in the watershed can be important sources of nitrogen to ground water discharge and total stream flow. Soil characteristics in watersheds are additional factors that can affect nitrogen concentrations and speciation in base flow. For example, poorly drained, saturated, and high organic content soils, which tend to be anoxic, can promote the loss of nitrate through denitrification (Meisinger and Randall, 1991;Groffman et a l , 1993;Hanson et a l, 1994;Groffman and Hanson, 1997;Speiran, 1996;Speiran et a l, 1997;Flite et a l, 15 Total N (m g/L ) Percentage Cropland Figure 5. Flow weighted total N and nitrate concentration in total stream flow versus percentage of cropland in the watershed (Jordan et al., 1997b). Conversely, well-drained, low organic content, and unsaturated soils, which tend to be oxic, promote nitrification but not denitrification. In areas such as the Delmarva Peninsula, the poorly drained sediments typically found in riparian forests potentially increase losses of N via both plant uptake and denitrification (Speiran, 1996;Speiran et al., 1997;Phillips et al., 1993;Reay et al., 1991). Jordan et al. (1993) observed in a coastal plain watershed (Maryland, upper Delmarva Peninsula) that nitrate concentrations in ground water decreased from 571 pM at the edge of a com field to <29 pM halfway through a riparian forest. However, most of the decrease in nitrate occurred when the soil Eh below the water table was less than -9 0 mV, indicating reducing conditions suitable for denitrification. Hanson et al. (1994) noted that poorly drained soils under riparian forests in a Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island watershed had higher rates of denitrification than moderately drained soils located at the upland to wetland transition zone. They also noted that higher ground water nitrate inputs further stimulated these rates, indicating nitrate limitation of denitrification. Their study suggested that up to 50% of the groundwater nitrate load was removed by denitrification. Cooper (1990) similarly observed that the majority of nitrate loss (56-100%) in ground water occurred in the riparian organic soil of a small New Zealand headwater stream. Removal was enhanced by a higher percentage of ground water flowing through the organic soils than the mineral soils. Types of sediments that have a high potential for denitrification include marine and estuarine silts and clays rich in pyrite, glauconite (clay mineral with reduced iron), and/or organic carbon (Bachman and Krantz, 2000). Sediments with low potential for denitrification are coarse sands and gravels that are mainly quartz, chert, and feldspar. Meisinger and Randall (1991) provide approximate denitrification estimates based on soil drainage classification and soil organic matter content. Speiran (1996) studied the influence of forest buffers on nitrogen concentrations in ground water discharges to streams and concluded that forest buffers alone (e.g., by plant uptake) may not be depleting nitrate, but that soil type contributed to removal of nitrate through denitrification. He also concluded that ground water flow paths and depth of surficial aquifer could affect the ability of forest buffers to remove nitrate from ground water. If the surficial aquifer is thick, ground water can flow below the influence of shallow forest root zones and poorly drained sediments and discharge to stream bottoms relatively unchanged (Speiran, 1996;Speiran et a l, 1997;Phillips et a l, 1993;Bohlke and Denver, 1995). A shallow surficial aquifer can help constrain flow paths to forest root zones or to poorly drained soils near the surface, fostering assimilation and denitrification of nitrate. Willems et a l (1997)  wetland soils had higher organic carbon content than shallow and deep subsurface soils and denitrification rates were higher in surface soils than in subsurface soils. Basnyat et a l (1999) developed a model based on land use in the watershed to predict nitrate concentrations in total stream flow in the Fish River, Alabama. They found a significant relationship between the different percentages of land use along the stream-buffer/riparian zone (based on lengths of land use along stream) and nitrate concentrations. Their model regression equation suggested that forests and grasslands, which included wetlands in their land use classification scheme, act as sinks for nitrate. Nolan (2001) developed a multivariate logistic regression model to predict the number of ground water wells across the United States with nitrate concentrations in excess of 285 pM. Model variables included: nitrogen fertilizer loading (p=0.012); percent croplandpasture (pcO.OOl); natural log of population density (p<0.001); and percent well-drained soils (p=0.002). Tufford et al. (1998) showed with a regression model that land use less than 150 meters from a stream channel was a better predictor of nutrient concentrations in the stream (total N and total P) than land use further removed from the stream.  found that about 60 meters of forest buffer would be needed to reduce nutrient levels in ground water to background levels of 25 pM in a VA Eastern Shore watershed, but noted that the required buffer size estimate varied depending on soil characteristics, ground water flow patterns, vegetation, and nutrient levels in the ground water. Phosphorus is primarily removed from surface and ground water by deposition of phosphorus-adsorbed particulates (Peterjohn and Correll, 1984), but dissolved phosphorus can also be removed by microbial and plant uptake, adsorption by aluminum (Al) and ferric (Fe) oxides and hydroxides and the precipitation of Al, Fe, and calcium phosphates (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2000;Walbridge and Struthers, 1993). Dissolved phosphate can also be removed by sorption to clay particles, which tend to accumulate in riparian soils (Cooper and Gilliam, 1987;Walbridge and Struthers, 1993). Therefore, soil characteristics of riparian forests also play an important role in the retention of dissolved phosphate from surface and ground water."}, {"section_title": "Significance o f Research", "text": "In shallow coastal lagoons, nutrient enrichment may have caused the replacement of seagrasses by macroalgal or phytoplankton blooms (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Valiela et al., 1992). There are several chemical and physical factors that may regulate the competition of primary producers. Temperature, light availability, and inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations can limit or promote photoautotrophic growth, while water residence time and grazing can affect accumulation of biomass (Taylor et al., 1995;Hauxwell et al., 1998;Fong and Zedler, 1993;Duarte, 1995;Valiela et al., 1997). Based on the known physiological requirements of primary producers, increasing nitrogen (N) loading rates in lagoons with short residence times are believed to change the dominant primary producer from slow-growing seagrasses to fast-growing macroalgae due to shading (Taylor et al., 1995;Duarte, 1995;Pedersen and Borum, 1996;Valiela et al., 1997). At moderate to high N loading rates and long residence times, phytoplankton are expected to replace macroalgae. Hauxwell et al. (2001) provided evidence through controlled in situ experiments that macroalgal canopies significantly impacted eelgrass production by directly shading them and that seagrassb production dramatically increased when the macroalgal canopy was removed. In the VA Eastern Shore coastal lagoons where residence times tend to be short (days to weeks) (Fugate, unpublished data) and nitrogen loadings are suspected to be moderate to high, attached ephemeral macroalgae may be better poised to take advantage of available N than are phytoplankton (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Tyler et alia., 2001). Seagrasses have only recently reappeared in very small patches in the Eastern Shore lagoons since they disappeared in the 1930's. Northern lagoons, such as Chincoteague Bay, continue to have seagrasses; however nitrogen enrichment may be contributing to decreased densities of plants in the seagrass beds (Boynton et al., 1996). With a lack of data on nitrogen loading rates from base flow to the VA Eastern Shore coastal lagoons, this study will provide improved estimation of nitrogen loading rates to assess quantitative effects of nutrient enrichment on primary producer communities and to examine the potential role of coastal lagoons in transforming and retaining nutrients. In addition, this research will help coastal resource managers predict long term effects of land use changes in watersheds on nutrient loading rates."}, {"section_title": "OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES", "text": "Objectives for this study were to: 1.

The Delmarva Peninsula, except for a small section in the upper part, makes up the outer Coastal Plain. The inner Coastal Plain consists of Chesapeake Bay's western shore and a small northern section on the Delmarva Peninsula. Land cover in the VA Eastern Shore is approximately 38 percent agriculture, 32 percent forest, 27 percent wetlands, and 2 percent development (Malcolm Pimie, 1999). Poultry farming is an especially important activity in the northern part of the VA Eastern Shore, which had 61 farms and more than 22 million broiler chickens raised in 1997, while the southern half had none reported (USDA, 1997). The VA Eastern Shore is approximately 100 km long and 5 to 20 km wide. As a result of the relatively smaller width of the VA Eastern Shore, watershed sizes and riverine inputs to coastal waters are smaller than in other areas (e.g., Maryland, Delaware, western shore of Chesapeake Bay). Elevation of the uplands generally ranges from 10 to 15 m above sea level and declines gradually to sea level across scarps and terraces; elevations tend to be greater in the northern VA Eastern Shore than in the southern portion (Speiran, 1996). In contrast, upland elevations range from 9 to 24 m above sea level in the Maryland and Delaware portions of the outer Coastal Plain (Phillips, et al., 1993). The northern half of the VA Eastern Shore is also mostly located in a hydrogeomorphic region characterized by poorly drained uplands OTHERS e \u00ab c h 9 * , lid il ro*rjhe*, lag o a n a, and has a larger ratio of poorly drained soils to total area than the well drained uplands region ( Figure ) (Phillips et al., 1993). The eastern half of the Shore, the Eastern Lower into the shallow lagoons that separate the mainland from 14 barrier islands (Hayden and Porter, 2001). The ground water system consists of the unconfined, surficial Columbia aquifer and three confined Yorktown-Eastover aquifers (upper, middle, and lower), which are separated by intervening confining units ( Figure 7) (Richardson, 1994). The Columbia aquifer contains elevated nitrate concentrations up to 2700 pM (Malcolm Pimie, 1999) and its composition ranges from very fine silty sands to coarse and gravelly clean sands with minor discrete areas of interbedded clay and silt (Richardson, 1994). Thickness of this surficial aquifer ranges from 8 to more than 30 meters in the uplands region (Phillips et a l, 1993). Ground water in the Columbia aquifer is recharged locally by rainfall and flows from the center divide on the peninsula (generally Route 13) primarily laterally east towards the coastal lagoons and west towards the Chesapeake Bay (Richardson, 1994;Speiran, 1996). This ground water discharges to lagoons, springs, streams, marshes, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean (Richardson, 1994 (Richardson, 1994) the water moves laterally through the unconfined aquifer. Base flow reportedly is a significant component of total stream flow on the Delmarva Peninsula (60-80%) (Bohlke and Denver, 1995;Phillips and Bachman, 1996;Correll et al., 1999b). This study occurred during a drought period that lasted from April 2001to November 2002(NOAA, 2003a "}, {"section_title": "Study site selection and watershed data analyses", "text": "Fourteen streams in the VA Eastern Shore were selected based on the following criteria: measurable flow, non-tidal, perennial flow, no ponds upstream of sampling points, first order, accessible, and percentage of forest and agricultural land cover in the watershed (Figure 9, Table 1). First order streams were selected to better assess land cover effects and were frequently tributaries to major streams. Ponds were avoided because nutrients can be transformed and processed due to longer residence times. A range of percent forest cover was important for statistical analyses of the relationship between nutrient concentration and land cover. The streams were distributed latitudinally along the VA Eastern Shore over a distance of 70 km. They were clustered in two . Location of the fourteen sampling sites (red circles) and studied streams (blue lines) on the VA Eastern Shore. Watersheds (yellow lines) of the approximately 56 major creeks that flow into the coastal lagoons on the Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed (Hayden and Porter, 2001).  Table 1. List of fourteen streams and sampling site locations, from north to south in the Virginia Eastern Shore. regional groups: five streams in northern Eastern Shore, VA in Accomack County and nine streams in the southern portion, which were predominantly in Northampton County with some in Accomack County. The northern group is found in an area with two large industrial poultry factories and concentrated poultry farming. Wheat, soybean, com, tomato, and other vegetable farming are prevalent in both regions (USDA, 1997). GIS (ArcView and Arclnfo) was used to delineate watersheds at the sampling points and determine percentages of land cover and soil drainage class in these watersheds and within four intervals of distance from the streams (buffer regions). Watershed boundaries were digitized by examining elevation data on USGS 7.5-minute mylar topographic quadrangle maps (1:24,000) and watershed boundaries for 56 major streams of the coastal lagoons delineated by Hayden and Porter (2001). Buffer regions were delineated for the following intervals of distance from the stream channel: 0 -6 m, 6 -30 m, 30-60 m, and >60 m. Stream channel data were determined from 1:100,000 scale US Census Tiger hydrography lines, which were also used to identify stream order. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Change Analysis Program (NOAA CCAP) land cover data (1:24,000 scale) from 1988-89 were used to determine land cover percentages in watersheds and buffer regions. This land cover data was appropriate for this study because ground water age in the Coastal Plain ranges from 10 to 20 years old (Phillips et a l, 1999;Robinson and Reay, 2001). To simplify analyses, nine land cover classes found in the watersheds were grouped into three major land cover categories: agriculture (cropland, grassland); forest (deciduous, evergreen, mixed, and palustrine forests, scrub/shrub); and developed land (low intensity and high intensity developed land). Cropland (i.e., winter wheat) is frequently mistaken for grassland and ground-truthing found that areas classified as grassland were most likely cropland. We determined soil type using the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database (1:15,840 scale) (USDA, 1998;USDA 1999) and soil drainage class for each soil type from USDA Soil Surveys for Northampton and Accomack counties (Cobb and Smith, 1989;Peacock and Edmonds, 1994). Soil drainage class describes \"frequency and duration of periods of saturation or partial saturation during soil formation\" ; therefore it indicates \"natural\" drainage, not altered, artificial drainage (Cobb and Smith, 1989;Peacock and Edmonds, 1994). Table 2 provides definitions of each soil drainage class. The soil drainage classes were grouped into three major categories: well drained (well drained, moderately well drained, somewhat excessively drained); poorly drained (poorly drained, somewhat poorly drained); and very poorly drained (very poorly drained). We also determined soil type and drainage class percentages found specifically in forested and agricultural land cover for each watershed."}, {"section_title": "Sampling and analytical methods", "text": "The streams were sampled once a month for more than a year, from May 2001 to May 2002. In order to focus on base flow in the streams and to exclude surface water runoff, samples were collected when there was at least a 48-hour period of no precipitation prior to the collection days. Rain gauges (Davis Instruments rain collector with HOBO Event Recorder) were installed at four sites latitudinally along the Eastern Shore, VA (three installed in August 2001 and one installed in October 2001) to measure instantaneous rainfall and to verify that local precipitation events did not occur before sampling ( Figure 10). We downloaded from the internet daily rainfall data at other local weather stations in Painter, VA (NOAA, 2003b) and Phillips Creek, VA (Krovetz et al., 2002) for periods before August 2001. Water samples (250 mL each) were collected upstream of the nearest road in triplicate, filtered with a 0.45 jam Acrodisc Supor (Gelman) syringe filter, and frozen until analyzed for nitrate (NO3'), nitrite (NO2\"), ammonium (NH4 +), phosphate (PO4 3'), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), Ancillary field data collected with a YSI 30 meter included measurements of temperature and specific conductivity. NO3\" and NO2' in the water samples were analyzed using an Alpkem \"Flow Solution\" autoanalyzer (Perstorp, 1992); NFL** was determined by the phenol hypochlorite method (Solorzano, 1969). P 0 43' was analyzed by the molybdate method (Parsons, 1984). DOC was analyzed using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A. Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) was analyzed by alkaline persulfate digestion in sealed ampules to oxidize organic and inorganic nitrogen to NO3' (Grasshoff, et. al., 1983), which was then measured with the Alpkem \"Flow Solution\" autoanalyzer. We derived DON by subtracting dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3' + NO2 ) from TDN. All concentration units are expressed in micromolar (fiM), based on the key element of interest in the nutrient compound (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon)."}, {"section_title": "Water discharge rate, flow-weighted mean nutrient concentration, and nutrient loading rate", "text": "To quantify the water discharge rate for each stream, we measured cross-sectional area of streambed and flow rates once a month using the surface float method (Buchanan  Table 2. USDA definitions of soil drainage classes (Cobb and Smith, 1989;Peacock and Edmonds, 1994).  Krovetz et al. (2002). and Somers, 1969). This method was used because a current meter was not suitable given the very shallow stream depths. Surface velocity was used to calculate mean vertical velocity by multiplying surface velocity by 0.85, as described by Buchanan and Somers (1969). Instantaneous discharge rates (m /sec) were calculated using the mid section method (Buchanan and Somers, 1969) and were assumed to represent average base flow discharge rate throughout the month. We determined discharge rate per unit watershed area (cm/sec; 1 cm= 1 0 0 m3/ha) in order to compare the streams, removing the potential effect of area on discharge rate. These rates were converted to daily and monthly discharge rates (cm/day; cm/mo). Monthly discharge rates were summed over a year to determine total annual discharge rate (cm/year). The months of May 2001 to April 2002 were defined as the year and used for all calculations of annual mean and total values. We calculated an annual nutrient loading rate (kg/yr) for each stream by multiplying monthly nutrient concentrations and monthly discharge rates, converting it to appropriate units (kg/mo), and summing monthly nutrient loading rates over a year. Export rates (kg/ha/yr) were calculated to normalize loading rates by area and facilitate comparison of watersheds. We calculated an annual flow-weighted mean nutrient concentration by dividing the annual nutrient loading rate by total annual discharge rate and converting it to appropriate units (pM). We were unable to collect nutrient concentration and discharge rate data at Monthly nutrient concentrations and discharge rates for Gargatha Creek were highly correlated with the respective monthly data for Nickawampus Creek, suggesting that they followed similar seasonal trends. The variance explained by regressions with Gargatha Creek ranged from 64 to 77 percent."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen budgets", "text": "We developed nitrogen mass-balances for the fourteen watersheds by using sitespecific watershed characteristics and published values for major N inputs and outputs. N budgets were calculated separately for each land cover type: agriculture, forest, and developed land. Table 3 summarizes all N inputs and outputs by land cover types that were determined in the nitrogen budgets. Inputs are anthropogenic sources of N and biogeochemical processes that contribute N to the watersheds. Outputs are processes that remove N from the watershed, and therefore, would reduce the availability of N to ground water. These predicted inputs and outputs were based on published values and were not directly measured in the field. They were based on several simplifying assumptions, including: 1 ) the system is in steady-state; and 2 ) there is no seasonal variation because nutrients in ground water reflect cumulative, long-term inputs and outputs. Since soil-water-crop and N management practices have apparently not changed dramatically over the last 20 years on the VA Eastern Shore, we expect our assumption of a steady-state condition to be valid. Biogeochemical process rates (e.g., denitrification, volatilization, N fixation) were assumed to be constant throughout the year, although we understand that these values vary with abiotic conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, redox  watersheds, we determined area of soil types found specifically in agricultural land cover, using GIS analyses of the USDA SSURGO database (USDA, 1998(USDA, , 1999; see \"Study site selection and watershed data analyses\" section). Soil types have diverse denitrification rates, intrinsic fertility, and crop-specific productivity potentials because of their physical and chemical properties (Cobb and Smith, 1989;Peacock and Edmonds, 1994). For their nutrient management standards and criteria, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (VADCR, 1995) recommends N fertilizer application rates and estimates yields (harvest) for various crops by soil productivity groupings (soil types) (Table 4). We used published percent denitrification rates for each soil type (Meisinger and Randall, 1991 and references therein), based on drainage classification and percent organic matter content determined for the soil type (Cobb and Smith, 1989;Peacock and Edmonds, 1994). This assumes average rainfall for the year, which was not true during our study period; therefore denitrification rates are likely to have been overestimated. Loss by denitrification was applied to fertilizer and atmospheric deposition loadings for each area of soil type in agricultural land cover (Table 4). Estimated N content of com, wheat and soybean were 13.0, 19.2, and 55.0 g N per kg crop (0.73, 1.15, and 3.3 lb N/bu), respectively (Meisinger and Randall, 1991). We assumed that no N fertilizer was applied to soybeans due to its N-fixing capability and estimated that 65% of the harvested N from soybeans were supplied by N fixation (Meisinger and Randall, 1991). Meisinger and Randall (1991) reviewed literature for legumes and concluded that N in unharvested soybeans is one-third of total plant N; conversely with two-third of plant N harvested, they estimated N-fixation in unharvested soybean would be 50% of the preceding calculation of N-fixation from harvested soybean (e.g., x h -X A + 2 A). NH3 volatilization rates in applied fertilizer are highly variable (0-60%) and depend on numerous factors, including type of fertilizer, application method, soil pH, temperature, and precipitation amounts after fertilizer application (Meisinger and Randall, 1991 and references therein;Harper et al., 1987;Watson et a l, 1994;van der Weerden and Jarvis, 1997;Cookson et al., 2001;Goebes et al., in press); we assumed the volatilization rate to be approximately 10%. Published values for non-symbiotic N fixation and atmospheric deposition are presented in Table 5. Since the agricultural mass-balance was based on a two-year crop rotation, input and output values were converted to annual figures for comparison purposes. For forested land cover, we estimated N inputs of atmospheric deposition and non-symbiotic fixation and N outputs of denitrification and N uptake into woody biomass. We did not include nitrogen uptake by leaves because we assumed it would be returned in leaf litter over an annual cycle. The percent denitrification rate for each soil type, as described earlier (Meisinger and Randall, 1991), was applied to atmospheric deposition loadings for each soil type area in forested land cover (Table 4). Rates of nonsymbiotic N fixation are different in forests than agricultural land cover, thus we used 1 kg N/ha, which is based on upland forests (Table 5) (Castro et a l , 2001). N uptake rates into woody biomass were estimated to be 7.1 kg N/ha for a temperate mixed hardwood forest (Table 5) (Magill, et a l, 2000). In this loss term, we did not include potential uptake of N from ground water flowing underneath from agricultural and developed land because we desired to estimate potential N retention rates in the watershed. In addition, not all forests in the watersheds were positioned to intercept ground water before discharge to streams (e.g., upland forests). For developed land cover, we used net inputs of septic systems, in which outputs (i.e., loss within drainfield) were previously incorporated into the published value of 2.95 kg/person/year (Reay, submitted Bureau, 1990; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). We assumed that all persons residing in the watersheds were on septic systems. About 71 to 94% of housing units in block-groups where the 14 watersheds were located utilized septic systems or cesspools for sewage disposal (U.S. Census Bureau, 1990).\nPotential N inputs and outputs by land cover type are listed in Table 3. As described in the Methods section, these predicted inputs and outputs were based on published values and were not directly measured in the field. Therefore, these numbers are rough estimates and do not account for real life variations, but help us to understand magnitudes of inputs and outputs and the potential role of riparian forests in retaining nitrogen in ground water.  (Table 17) (VADCR, 1995). Symbiotic N fixation in soybean fields was the second highest N input (range: 2582 to 5207 kg N/yr) (VADCR, 1995). This input was affected by a soil type's productivity potential for soybeans. Inputs of atmospheric deposition and non-symbiotic N fixation in agricultural land cover (respectively, range: 633 to 1506 kg N/yr and 281-583 kg N/yr) were relatively small compared to fertilizer and soybean N inputs (Meisinger and Randall, 1991;Meyers et al., 2001). Their variability was caused by agricultural area differences. Crop harvest was the largest output term (range: 7291-17662 kg N/yr) (VADCR, 1995). Variation was attributed mainly to agricultural area, but also to a soil type's different productivity potential for each crop. Volatilization and denitrification of N from fertilizer removed N at approximately similar magnitudes (respectively, range: 687-1671 kg N/yr and 616-2437 kg N/yr) (Meisinger and Randall, 1991 and references therein;Harper et al., 1987;Watson et al., 1994;van der Weerden and Jarvis, 1997;Cookson et al., 2001;Goebes et al., in press). Denitrification of N from atmospheric deposition was a relatively small output (63-208 kg N/yr), due to the small inputs of atmospheric deposition compared to fertilizer (Meisinger and Randall, 1991).     For forest cover, atmospheric deposition was the dominant input (range: 392-1941 kg N/yr) (Table 18) (Meyers et al., 2001). Non-symbiotic N fixation inputs were relative small (range: 34-159 kg N/yr) (Castro et al., 2001 and references therein). Both input terms of deposition and non-symbiotic N fixation were based on forest cover area, therefore larger areas would have greater N inputs. For outputs, N uptake into woody biomass was a larger loss term than denitrification of N from atmospheric deposition (respectively, range: 284-1132 kg N/yr and 65-334 kg N/yr) Meisinger and Randall, 1991). Output calculations were also based on forest cover area, but estimates of denitrification of N from atmospheric deposition also took soil properties into account. Net N input also varied among watersheds, ranging from 115 to 533 kg N/yr. Net N input per forest cover area was almost 10 times smaller than net inputs from agricultural land cover and did not vary much (range: 2.5-4.5 kg N/ha/yr). Net inputs from developed land cover were based on estimated total population in the entire watershed (Table 19). The Partings Creek watershed had the largest population (190 persons); thus the highest net N input (561 kg N/yr) and net N input per area (2.9 kg N/ha/yr). Population in other watersheds was relatively low (range: 14-82 persons), with smaller net N inputs (range: 41-561 kg N/yr) and net N inputs per area (range: 0.4-2.9 kg N/ha/yr) than from forested and agricultural land covers. Total net N inputs, calculated by summing net inputs from all land cover type, varied greatly from watershed to watershed (range: 1870-4549 kg N/yr) (Table 20). Variations were attributed to differences in total watershed area, % forest and agricultural land cover, and soil types. As a result, total net N input per watershed area also demonstrated variability (range: 11.6-26.1 kg N/ha/yr). Watersheds with a high    T able 20. Estimated total net N input with all land covers combined and total net input per watershed area. Estimated TDN load in base flow from each of the watersheds was compared to total net N input to calculate % N potentially stored in watershed or removed as gas. percentage of agricultural land cover did not necessarily have the highest net N inputs. For example, Holt-R and Assawoman #3 had 75 and 69% agricultural land cover, respectively, but Assawoman #3 had much higher estimated total net input per area (26.1 kg N/ha/yr) than Holt-R (19.0 kg N/ha/yr). Similarly, there was large variation in the percent of N that could potentially be stored in the system (e.g., retention of N in forest woody biomass or soil, ground water storage) or removed as gas through denitrification (range:-3.9 -98.9%) (Table 20)."}, {"section_title": "Macroalgal nitrogen demand", "text": "We used a multiple regression model of TDN export rates versus watershed characteristics (see Results section) to estimate nitrogen loadings rates from watersheds of Hog Island Bay (HIB; also called the Machipongo River watershed) ( Figure 11). We calculated % land cover in the watersheds, based on land cover areas determined by Porter and Hayden (2001) who also used NOAA CCAP land cover data. Nitrogen export rates were then predicted based on the model and summed for comparison to annual nitrogen demand of macroalgae growing in HIB. We assumed that nutrients were transported conservatively downstream from the headwater regions of streams to HIB and that nutrient export rates from the headwater regions were similar to rates from the entire watersheds. Streams reportedly do not store nutrients or organic matter over multiple annual cycles; they eventually export any temporarily stored N as regenerated inorganic or organic N within weeks to several years (Peterson et al., 2001). Although there are likely additional N sinks (e.g., ponds or impoundments on the streams) and sources in the watersheds (e.g., septage lagoons), we assumed there were none in the HIB watersheds.  was then summed to determine annual N demand (Table 6). N demand may be overestimated because the growth rate estimates did not take into account the effects of shading on macroalgal production. To obtain rough estimates of total demand in HIB, we   comparisons of regional mean nutrient concentrations. We conducted Split-Plot ANOVA (SP ANOVA) on seasonal mean nutrient concentrations and discharge rates to determine differences by season (within-subject factor) and region (between-subjects factor) (Zar, 1996). We used SP ANOVA because the streams were sampled repeatedly over one year and were located in two regions. Differences were significant at p=0.05. The following months of data were averaged to represent the seasonal means: 1) spring: March, April, May; 2) summer: June, July, August; 3) fall: September, October, November; and 4) winter: December, January, February. Levene's test of homogeneity of variance was conducted to determine if means had similar variances. The test was found to be non significant for all analyses (p>0.05). Tukey's test was used to evaluate pair-wise comparisons after a significant effect from season. When interaction effects were significant, we conducted repeated measures ANOVA (RM ANOVA) for each region. We used linear regression to determine relationships between annual flowweighted mean nutrient concentrations and the following independent factors: 1 ) % forest cover; 2) % agricultural land cover; 3) % developed land cover; 4) % very poorly drained soil; 5) % poorly drained soil; and 6 ) % well drained soil. For significant regressions (p=0.05), step-wise regression was used to determine significant multiple regressions. Independent factors that had significant correlations with each other were not included together in multiple regressions due to concerns about multicollinearity (Zar, 1996). When regressions were non-linear, independent factors were natural log transformed to obtain linear regressions. Although we intended to assess relationships of nutrients with % land cover and soil drainage class in buffer zones, there were not enough streams to include the additional independent variables in regression analyses. Step-wise regression with too many independent variables may lead to significant relationships that may not be real, because there is a greater probability of finding a variable that explains significant variance by chance."}, {"section_title": "RESU LTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Land cover and soil drainage class", "text": "Watershed areas ranged from 100 to 240 ha and forest cover ranged from 24 to 64% of total area (Table 7).

There was generally less forest cover in buffer regions farther from the stream (>30 m) than closer, signifying that more forest cover occurred closer to streams and were riparian forests (Table 8 ).

Percent forest cover in the watershed was not significantly correlated with % very poorly drained soil (r=-0.32, df=13, p=0.271) or poorly drained soil (r=0.41, df=I3, p=0.145), likely due to the large variability of soil drainage classes in forest cover. Conversely, % agricultural land cover in the watershed was also not correlated with percent well drained soil (r=0.42, df=13, p=0.138).

Mean N0 3 * concentrations for the 13 streams were significantly higher in  Figure 24) (Tukey's, p<0.05). DON had a significant interaction effect, in which the seasonal pattern was dissimilar by region (Table 14, Figure 25). Northern mean DON concentrations appeared to be higher in spring and summer (RM ANOVA, F=3.75, df=3, 9, p=0.054), while southern mean DON concentrations were generally similar across all seasons with a small increase in spring (RM ANOVA, F= 1.54, df=3, 24, p=0.23). PO43' also had a significant interaction effect, in which northern mean PO43' concentration increased in summer while southern mean remained mostly constant for all seasons (Table 14, Figure 25). For the northern region, summer mean PO43' concentration was significantly higher than fall and winter means (RM ANOVA, F=7.29, df=3, 9, p=0.009; Tukey's, p<0.05). In addition, overall northern mean PO43\" concentration was significantly higher than southern mean (Table 14, Figure 25). Mean DIN:DIP ratio had no significant seasonal effect, however, mean DIN:DIP ratios appeared to higher in winter in both regions (Table 14, Figure 26). Mean DOC:DON had a significant interaction effect, in which northern mean DOC:DON ratio increased in fall while the southern mean ratios for all seasons were generally steady (Table 14, Figure 26). For the northern streams, mean DOC:DON ratio was significantly higher in fall than in summer ( Figure 26) (RM ANOVA, F=4.88, df=3, 9, p=0.030).

We did observe a general pattern of higher nutrient concentrations in the four northern streams than in the southern streams for most nutrients, especially during spring and summer (Figures 24, 25), suggesting a regional difference that could not be detected statistically due to large variability of nutrient concentrations in the northern streams and small sample size."}, {"section_title": "Regression analyses: annual flow-weighted mean nutrient concentrations versus watershed characteristics", "text": "Relationships between nutrients in streams and watershed characteristics were analyzed separately by region due to regional differences in nutrient concentrations. Each nutrient (NO3', NKU+, DON, POT3, DOC) was regressed against the following independent watershed characteristics: 1) % forest cover; 2) % agricultural land cover; 3) % developed land cover; 4) % very poorly drained soil; 5) % poorly drained soil; and 6 ) % well drained soil. For the nine southern streams, annual flow-weighted mean NO3' concentrations had a significant negative relationship with % forest cover (Table 15, Figure 27) (r =0.53, df= 8 , p=0.027). NOs' had a weak, positive relationship with % agricultural land cover, although not significant at a=0.05 ( Figure 27) (r2=0.36, df=8 , p=0.088). This was expected because % forest cover and % agricultural land cover were negatively correlated (r=-0.95, df=8 , p<0.0001). Thus, forest cover was a better predictor of annual flowweighted mean NO 3' concentration than agricultural land cover. These results suggested that forested habitat might remove NO3' from ground water in the shallow aquifer. Percent developed land cover and various soil drainage classes were not related to NO3' (p>0.05). The relationship between NO3' and % forest cover was not significantly improved by adding other land cover or soil drainage class variables in a multiple regression. Annual flow-weighted mean NTV\", DON and DOC concentrations were not related to any land cover or soil drainage class type (p>0.05). Annual flow-weighted mean PO43' concentration was positively related to % well drained soil (Table 15, Figure   27) (r2=0.79, df=8 , p=0 .0 0 1 ). PO4 3\" was also negatively related to % poorly drained soil as a first regressor (r =0.61, df=8 , p=0.013), which was expected because of the strong negative correlation between % poorly drained and well drained soils. Adding agriculture as a second regressor to % well drained soil significantly increased the total variance explained to 92% (df=8 , p=0.0004); residuals from the first regression were negatively related to % agricultural land cover (Table 15, Figure 28) (r2=0.62, df=8 , p=0.012). Since agricultural and forest cover were correlated, forest cover as a second regressor to % well drained soil explained 91% of the variance (df=8 , p=0.0008); residuals increased as forest cover increased (Table 15, Figure 28) (r =0.57, df=8 , p=0.019). Similar results were found when % forest or agricultural land cover was used as a second regressor to % poorly drained soil (Table 15). None of the other land cover or soil drainage class types were related to PO4 \" as a first regressor (p>0.05). For the five northern streams, there were no significant relationships between any  Regression analyses: nutrient export rates versus watershed characteristics NO3' export rates for the southern streams displayed a non-linear relationship with % forest cover; thus % forest cover was lognormally transformed. As a result, NO3' export rates decreased as ln-% forest cover increased (r2=0.53, df=8 , p=0.026), similar to the negative relationship observed between annual flow-weighted mean NO3' concentration and % forest cover (Table 16, Figure 29). Since discharge rate was an important component of the export rate, we regressed annual discharge rates versus ln-% forest cover and found a weak negative relationship (Figure 30) (r2=0.33, df=8 , p=0.104). This association suggested that watersheds with more forest cover might have lower discharge rates because of higher evapotranspiration rates. Therefore, the significant regression relationship of NO3' export rates with forest cover may represent the combined effects of forest cover and water budget on NO3' retention. Ln-% developed land cover increased the r2 value to 8 6 % as a second regressor (df=8 , p=0.003), and was positively related to the residuals (Table 16, Figure 29) (r2=0.70, df=8 , p=0.005).

DOC and PO43' export rates both had non-linear correlations with % poorly drained soil; thus these data were lognormally transformed. For both nutrients, export rates increased as ln-% poorly drained soil decreased (Table   16, Figures 32, 33) (DOC: r2=0.46, df=8 , p=0.045; P 0 43': r2=0.77, df=8 , p=0.002). However, both relationships appeared to be driven by one point and should be interpreted with caution. Since there was a strong negative correlation between % poorly drained and well drained soils, P 0 43' export rates were positively related to ln-% well drained soils (Table 16, Figure 33) (r2=0.48, df=8 , p=0.039).

Below Base flow discharge rates are positively related to water table elevations (Staver and Brinsfield, 1991); thus, we would expect lower water discharge rates in the streams. Correll et al. (1999a) also found that total discharge rates (surface water runoff and base flow) during low precipitation years were lower than in mean precipitation years for 8 first and second-order streams in the inner Coastal Plain region. During mean precipitation years (averaged over a 25-year period; 1139 mm), mean total discharge rates were 18.2 to 33.7 cm/yr. However, during a low precipitation year (824 mm), discharge rates were 7.7 to 13.9 cm/yr. Although these estimates were of total stream flow, 65 to 75% of annual water discharge was base flow (Correll et al., 1999b). We also would expect base flow to account for a higher percentage of total stream flow in drought conditions since there would be less surface water runoff.   Month 15. Ground water levels below surface (m) for wells in (A) Northampton an ck counties (VADEQ, 2002). Our estimates of base flow discharge rates were generally similar to the low precipitation estimates from Correll et al. (1999a), except for three streams with much lower discharge rates (1.44-4.51 cm/yr) and three with much higher rates (28.09-34.60 cm/yr). Our discharge rates were also similar to and sometimes less than total discharge estimates for three streams in the Maryland and Delaware portions of the outer Coastal Plain region (11, 29, and 31 cm/yr), determined when total precipitation was slightly higher (1060 mm) (Jordan et a l, 1997b). Variations in discharge rates may be caused by latitudinal variations in precipitation and ground water levels. Some wells had larger declines in water table elevation during the drought period than others, especially in Northampton County (Figure 35). In addition, watersheds with more forest cover generally have lower discharge rates, as we found for southern streams (Figure 30), because riparian forests have greater evapotranspiration rates than other land covers (Correll et al., 1992 & references therein). Jordan et al. (1997b) found that the stream with the lowest discharge rate had the highest forest cover (89%) in its watershed. Soil characteristics and slope could also contribute to variations in discharge rates."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient concentrations and species composition", "text": "The lowest mean monthly NOs'concentrations were observed in Little Mosquitoleft,Machipongo,and Mill Creeks (61.25,65.82,and 3.44 pM, respectively). These low concentrations may be attributed to a combination of factors including low discharge rates (<4.5 cm/yr), shallow stream water depths, and % forest cover. Residence times were longer and surface-to-volume ratios larger in Little Mosquito-left and Machipongo, characteristics which promote rapid N uptake and processing by both microbes and primary producers (Mulholland and DeAngelis, 2000;Peterson et a l, 2001). The lower N O f concentrations in Little Mosquito-left and Mill Creeks may result from higher % forest cover (59 and 67%, respectively) and, thus, higher uptake. However, Machipongo Creek watershed had a lower percentage of forest (46%) than Little Mosquito-left and Mill Creek watersheds; thus, shallow stream depth and low water discharge rate may be more important modifiers of N 0 3' concentration for this stream. N 0 3' was the primary N species found in base flow (66-98%) ( Figure 22). Ground water and streams typically contain principally N 0 3' (60-99%) because they are frequently well oxygenated; any reduced forms of inorganic N will be rapidly nitrified (Reay et a l, 1991(Reay et a l, & 1992Bachman and Phillips, 1996;Jordan et a l, 1997bJordan et a l, & 1997cPeterson et a l, 2001). In addition, N H / assimilation by microbes and primary producers is energetically favored because oxidized N forms, such as NO2 ' and N 0 3\\ must be reduced to NFL+ by assimilatory NO2\" and N 0 3' reductase (Capone, 2000). Peterson et al. (2001) found that assimilation and nitrification removed, respectively, 70 to 80% and 20 to 30% of NH4L We found a significant negative correlation of N 0 3\" concentrations (flow weighted mean) with N H /in streams, suggesting that much of the NFL* was nitrified during transport from its source to the stream (Table 12) (Hedin et a l, 1998). We also observed a pattern of high monthly mean N 0 3' concentrations when DON concentrations were low, and vice versa, which suggested that DON was being mineralized or N 0 3' was being assimilated for DON production (Figure 16). In particular, some months had equivalent changes in concentrations (e.g., May-July 2001;April-May 2002). These latter months coincided with onset of the forest growing season; thus the pattern may signify NO3' uptake for forest production. DOC and DON concentrations were positively correlated, which may indicate that they came from similar sources (Table 12, Figure 18). In Mill Creek, unlike the other streams studied, DON and NFLr were the predominant N species rather than NO3' ( 6 6 and 22% of total N, respectively) ( Figure   22). Mill Creek also had a relatively high flow-weighted mean DOC concentration (491 jliM ) . The mean monthly C:N ratio in DOM was approximately 34. A large fraction of nitrogen input to streams with forested watersheds is frequently organic (either particulate or dissolved) from forest production (Triska et al., 1984). DOC concentrations are also elevated under poorly drained, forested watersheds (median: 466 pM ) compared to well drained, less forested watersheds (median: 192 pM ) (Phillips and Bachman, 1996). In addition, Mill Creek may have had low dissolved oxygen concentrations in its ground water and stream water, which would have sustained mineralization and reduced nitrification rates (Hill, 2000). Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) may also have occurred, removing NO3' and generating N H / (Tobias et al., 2001). Dissolved PO43* concentrations were very low, as expected, because phosphorus is usually bound to particulates and we only measured dissolved nutrients ( Figure 17, Table 11). Jordan et al. (1997b) found that total P concentrations in total stream flow were correlated with particulate matter concentrations. Phosphorus adsorbs to aluminum (Al) and ferric (Fe) oxides and hydroxides and precipitates as Al, Fe, and calcium phosphates (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2000;Walbridge and Struthers, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Relationships o f annual flow-weighted mean nutrient concentrations and export rates to watershed characteristics", "text": "For southern streams, the percent of forest cover in the watershed explained most of the variability in annual flow-weighted mean NO3' concentrations and NO3' export rates (53%) (Figures 27, 29). These relationships indicated that either forests were removing NC>3' from ground water before discharge to streams, or conversely, that in watersheds with greater % forest cover, there were lower fertilizer N inputs. In addition, forested watersheds tend to have lower water discharge rates, which would lead to lower N 0 3' export rates (Figure 30). Phillips and Bachman (1996) also found significant a negative correlation between forest cover and NCV concentrations in base flow. We did find that annual flow-weighted mean NO3' concentrations had a weak positive relationship with agricultural land cover, but it only explained 33% of the variance (Figure 27). Developed land cover in watersheds, as a second regressor to forest cover, explained an additional 33% of the variance (total 8 6 %) (Table 15, Figure 29). Valiela et a l (1992) observed that NCV concentrations in ground water were significantly related to building density, which was a proxy for septic tank density. Septic system effluent from residential areas, a component of developed land cover, is a NO3' source (Libelo et al., 1991;Valiela et a l, 1992;Hamilton et a l, 1993;Heisig, 1999;Reay, submitted). Other Coastal Plain region studies (in Maryland and Delaware) have found that % agriculture was a better predictor than forest cover for NO3' concentration in total stream flow and base flow (Jordan et a l, 1997a, b;Liu et a l, 2000) and explained a larger percentage of variance (75%) (Jordan et a l, 1997b); however, % developed land cover was not a significant predictor of NCV concentration as a first or second regressor in these studies. Differences between our results and these other studies are most likely due to regional variations in agricultural activities (e.g., crops planted, fertilizer type and application rates) and different sources of land cover data. Since base flow is derived from ground water, our results suggest that land cover affected ground water NO3' concentrations. Many studies have shown that ground water NO3' concentrations are elevated under agriculture land and residential areas with septic tanks (-200-700 pM ) and low under forests (-6-80 pM ) (Lowrance et a l, 1984b;Libelo et a l, 1991;Reay et a l, 1991Reay et a l, & 1992Hamilton et a l, 1993;Jordan et a l, 1993). In areas such as the Delmarva Peninsula, poorly drained sediments are typically found in riparian forests and well-drained soils in agricultural fields (Hamilton et a l, 1993;Phillips et a l, 1993, Phillips and. Poorly drained soils can foster the loss of NO3* through denitrification because they are frequently saturated, anoxic and have high organic content (Groffman et a l, 1993;Hanson et a l, 1994;Groffman and Hanson, 1997;Speiran et a l, 1997;Flite et a l, 2001;M eisinger and Randall, 1991). Conversely, well-drained, low organic content, and unsaturated soils, which tend to be oxic, can promote nitrification but not denitrification. As a result, the low NO3' concentrations found under poorly drained, riparian forests have often been attributed to denitrification (Cooper, 1990;Jordan et a l, 1993;Phillips et a l, 1993;Hanson et a l, 1994;Speiran, 1996;Speiran et a l, 1997). However in most cases, such conjecture has not been validated by direct measurements of in situ denitrification. Contrary to our hypothesis that watersheds with higher % poorly or very poorly drained soils would have lower NO3' export rates, we found that NO3' export rates were significantly higher in watersheds with higher % very poorly drained soil (Table 15, Figure 29). There may be three explanations for this observed relationship. Firstly, drought lowered the water table causing soils classified as very poorly drained to become unsaturated and more oxic, allowing for increased nitrification and mineralization rates, and correspondingly higher NO3' concentrations (Hill, 2000).  observed during drought conditions that a pine tree stand had increased rates of N mineralization, nitrification and NO3' leaching from the soil relative to normal rain periods. Walling and Foster (1978) found that NO3' concentrations in river flow increased substantially during and after a drought (up to 45 times higher than previous years). They speculated that drying and rewetting of soil from scattered showers increased nitrification and mineralization rates, allowing accumulation of NCV, which was flushed out with precipitation events. High NO3' levels persisted after peak river discharge, up to nine days, suggesting that high NO3' was connected to soil water. The second explanation is that a greater proportion of older, nitrate-rich ground water from greater depths may be discharging to the stream, due to the lower water table elevations. Hamilton et al. (1993) observed that nitrate concentrations varied vertically beneath riparian forests in some areas of the Delmarva Peninsula, with higher nitrate concentrations in deep ground water recharged from distant agricultural and developed lands and lower concentrations in shallow ground water recharged from the forested land. We may expect higher nitrate concentrations in the streams with more very poorly drained soils during the drought because there would be less precipitation and, thus, recharge of water through the forested soil. W ater recharge through very poorly drained soils is likely to be slow compared to other soil drainage classes because water is removed from the soil very slowly (Cobb and Smith, 1989;Peacock and Edmonds, 1994). With lower water table levels, we may also expect reduced nitrogen retention from forests because ground water flow paths could bypass the riparian forest root zone. The third explanation may be that the regression relationship was not real and due to chance; one point with the highest % very poorly drained soil may be driving the significant relationship (Figure 29). Sampling should be conducted over several years and include more streams in the southern region to help determine if the drought effect was valid. Annual flow-weighted mean PO43' concentration and PO43', NH4+, and DOC export rates demonstrated negative relationships with % poorly drained soils (Tables 15,16,Figures 28,31,33). We did not expect to observe this relationship because poorly drained soils, with high organic content generally display low dissolved oxygen, particularly during the summer. Low dissolved oxygen conditions would have led to accumulation of NH4+ and PO43' from, respectively, lower nitrification rates and release of P 0 43' adsorbed to iron oxides when Fe3+ is reduced to more soluble Fe2+ (Mulholland, 1992;Walbridge and Struthers, 1993). Higher dissolved DOC, NH4 +, and PO43' concentrations have been found in ground water under riparian forests, with low oxygen levels and reducing conditions (Reay et al., 1991;Mulholland, 1992;Jordan et al., 1993;Phillips and Bachman, 1996;Carlyle and Hill, 2001). On the other hand, under high dissolved oxygen conditions, NFL* will be nitrified and PO43' will form insoluble complexes with iron (Mulholland, 1992;Carlyle and Hill, 2001). DOC can also form complexes with aluminum and iron oxides and adsorb to clays (Kaplan and Newbold, 2000 and references therein). Therefore, under conditions of low water table, poorly drained soils might have become unsaturated and increasingly oxic, thereby promoting 3-+ d ecreased PO4 NH4 , and DOC export rates. PO4 * concentrations and export rates were positively related to % well drained soil, but this may be attributed to the significant negative correlation between % poorly drained and % well drained soils in the watersheds (Figures 28, 33, Tables 15, 16). On the other hand, base flow may be composed primarily of older, deeper ground water as a result of the lower ground water levels, which may have lower PO43', NFLf1 \", and DOC concentrations than shallow ground water recharged from riparian forest soils. We should also consider the alternative explanation that the regression relationships shown in the figures may not be real. The relationships of DOC, PO43', and NH4+ export rates versus % poorly drained soil appeared to be driven by a single point. For NFU+ export rates, adding % developed land cover as a second regressor to % poorly drained increased the total r to 79% (Table 16, Figure 31). Simmons et a l (1991) found elevated NIL* concentrations in ground water discharge from urban areas. Septic tank N effluent is predominantly composed of NH*+ (>99%), which is then nitrified to N 0 3' under oxic conditions (Reay, submitted). However, the NFLf1 -, which remains untransformed (<5%) can still be discharged to streams. Annual flow-weighted mean PO4 ' concentrations were negatively correlated to % agricultural land cover as a second regressor to % poorly drained or % well drained soil (Table 15). Although concentrations were generally low, Reay et al. (1992) measured PO4 ' concentrations in ground water that were two-fold higher under agriculture than forest; however, in other studies, no significant effect of land use on dissolved PO43' in base flow or total PO43' in total stream flow was observed (Liu et a l , 2000;Jordan et a l, 1997b, c). N-based fertilizers and N-fixing soybeans can contribute excess N relative to P to agricultural lands, thereby causing P limitation. Thus, watersheds with greater proportions of agricultural land cover may have lower PO43\" concentrations. Annual flow-weighted mean DON concentrations and export rates did not relate to any land cover or soil drainage class. On the other hand, Jordan et a l (1997b) observed that annual flow-weighted mean total organic nitrogen (TON) in total stream flow had a weak, positive correlation with % cropland; however, this relationship was likely influenced by particulate organic N from storm water runoff."}, {"section_title": "Comparison o f nutrient export rates from the VA Eastern Shore watersheds to other watersheds", "text": "Estimated annual N export rates from watersheds dominated by forested land cover (>60% forest; i.e., Mill and Greens Creeks) in the VA Eastern Shore were comparable to those from forested watersheds in the DE and MD portions of Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions (Table 23). Since their estimates were based on total nutrient export, which included both dissolved and acid-extractable particulate nutrients and total stream flow (Correll et a l, 1999b(Correll et a l, , c, & 2001, we would have expected base flow export rates in our study, which measured only dissolved nutrients, to be much lower. However, base flow is a significant component of total stream flow (60-80%) (Bohlke and Denver, 1995;Phillips and Bachman, 1996;Correll et a l, 1999b), and our watersheds had lower percentages of forest than their watersheds (>90%), which likely balanced out the difference.    C /3 C /3 03 03 03 ca ca ca ca ca DON, DOC, and P O^' fluxes from our studied watersheds during a low precipitation year (795 mm) were much lower than estimates of TON, TOC, and TP from the MD and DE watersheds during average precipitation conditions (>1000 mm). Correll et al. (1999bCorrell et al. ( , c, & 2001 found highly significant regression relationships between all nutrient export rates and precipitation, in which export increased with greater annual precipitation. In their study, TP was mostly in particulate form (63-89%) and TOC and TON had variable percentages of dissolved phase (38-79%) (Jordan et al., 1997b). Correll et al., (1999bCorrell et al., ( , c, & 2001 predicted nutrient export rates during low precipitation conditions ( 1 and 2 standard deviations below mean precipitation), and these predicted exports were similar to our DOC, DON, and PO43' estimates, especially for Mill Creek (Table 23). Total nutrient export rates may be closer to dissolved nutrient export values in base flow during low precipitation years because there would be reduced storm water runoff and associated particulates. The higher NCV export rate observed in Greens Creek may be related to the developed land cover (4%) in its watershed. Estimates of annual nutrient export rates in VA Eastern Shore watersheds that were predominantly agricultural (>60%) were also analogous to those from watersheds in MD and DE (Table 23), in particular predicted exports for 862 mm of precipitation. The Nickawampus Creek watershed likely had greater N exports than the other VA watersheds because it had 13.5 % developed land cover. Nitrogen export rates from agricultural watersheds were also higher than those from forested watersheds. Watersheds in the Piedmont region appeared to export more nutrients from forested and agricultural watersheds than those in the Coastal Plain region. Watersheds in the Piedmont region may not be as effective in retaining or removing nutrients in ground water because there may be deeper ground water pathways to bypass forest root zones or forests may not be positioned in the landscape to promote interception of agriculturally derived nutrients (e.g., more uplands forests) (Jordan et al., 1997c;Lowrance et al., 1997). Lowrance et al. (1997)  and water table depth is usually less than 3 m. Our agricultural watersheds, located primarily in well drained uplands of the outer Coastal Plain (except Assawoman #3), had comparable N export rates as the inner Coastal Plain watersheds at similar precipitation amounts (862 mm) (Table 23). Our estimates suggest that the model relating different riparian forest functions to hydrogeomorphic region, proposed by Lowrance et al. (1997), might not be applicable to VA Eastern Shore watersheds. The well drained uplands region in VA appears to be hydrogeomorphically different than the well drained uplands in MD and DE. Even with drought conditions, water table elevations in the well drained uplands region of VA were generally less than 3 m below surface (Figure 35), which is shallower than the 3-10 m depth in the flow system described by Lowrance et al. (1997). We did not have specific data for surficial aquifer depths in our watersheds, but Speiran 117 (1996) studied four watersheds in the VA Eastern Shore with aquifer depths ranging from 8 to 12 m. In general, the VA well drained uplands region, part of the Butlers Bluff Member of the Nassawadox Formation, has aquifer depths up to 18 m (Speiran, 1996). Thus, the aquifer in the well drained uplands in VA appeared somewhat shallower than those in MD and DE (10-40 m). Although the well drained uplands region may has a deeper aquifer depth than poorly drained uplands, the relatively shallow water table elevation and surficial aquifer in the VA Eastern Shore may permit ground water interactions with the forest root zone and foster denitrification and/or plant uptake."}, {"section_title": "Northern watersheds", "text": "Streams in the northern region of our study transect had significantly higher annual flow-weighted mean N O 3' and DON concentrations than southern streams, although there were similar proportions of land cover and soil drainage class in both regions ( Figure 36).

We were unable to find any significant relationships between nutrient concentrations or export rates and watershed characteristics in the northern part of our study transect, most likely because of the small number of streams studied and the high variability in nutrient concentrations. As previously discussed, oxidation of very poorly drained soils in areas with lowered water Soil Drainage Class Figure 36. Mean percentage of land cover and soil drainage type by region and standard error bars. None of the mean values were significantly different at p=0.05 (t-test). * p=0.08 flow may have caused the higher NCV concentrations observed in the northern streams. Other potential factors that could contribute to the high nutrient concentrations are poultry litter and atmospheric deposition. The northern watersheds are located in an area with two large industrial poultry factories and concentrated poultry farming. Poultry litter (waste) is typically stored then applied to local agricultural fields because it is not cost-effective to transport litter to other areas (Ambler, VADCR Nutrient Management Specialist, personal communication). Since 2001 poultry farms in Virginia have been required to obtain a Virginia Pollution Abatement permit and develop nutrient management plans for storage and application of litter. However, prior to 2001, litter may have been applied in excess of N crop demand and leached into ground water. Since ground water is generally 10 to 20 years old before discharge (Phillips et al., 1999;Robinson and Reay, 2001), decades of over application may have caused elevated NO3' concentrations in ground water, which discharged as base flow. Mineralization rates of the organic N waste varies depending on storage and application method, with 2 to 12% of initial organic N remaining after 2 to 4 years (Evanylo, 1994). In addition, ammonia is readily volatilized from manure during litter storage and application and converted to NH4+ aerosols, which may be deposited in wet or dry deposition; approximate atmospheric residence time is from 1 to 10 days (NRC, 2003). W et deposition may also contain DON, ranging from 2 to 63% of total N in east coast locations, but DON sources are poorly characterized (Seitzinger and Sanders, 1999 and references therein;Meyers et al., 2001). As a result, N concentrations in precipitation and dry deposition may be greater in the northern watersheds because they are located near local NH4+ and DON sources (Meisinger and Randall, 1991). Long-term high N atmospheric deposition rates to the watersheds would contribute to higher NO3' concentrations in ground water. Undocumented point sources may also contribute high nutrient concentrations. We believe that this is the case for Assawoman #4 Creek, where we observed a strong, unpleasant odor in July 2001."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal variation o f nutrient concentrations", "text": "While variability in annual nutrient concentrations and export rates was explained primarily by watershed characteristics (e.g. land cover, soil drainage class), seasonal variations in nutrient concentrations likely resulted from a combination of environmental factors (e.g., temperature and light), in-stream processing, and riparian forest uptake. Seasonal mean NO3' concentrations were significantly higher in winter than other seasons, while mean DOC and NH4+ concentrations were significantly higher in summer than other seasons (Figure 24). For northern streams, there appeared to be a pattern of higher mean DON concentrations in spring and summer and higher mean PO43' concentrations in summer (Figure 25). Spring and summer mean nutrient concentrations likely reflected greater rates of nutrient ground water/soil and in-stream processing by photoautotrophs and microbial communities elevated by higher temperatures and light availability. The plant growing season begins in spring, which would contribute to increased NO3' uptake in ground water flowing through the riparian forest zone. Researchers have observed in streams the pattern of maximum NO3' concentration during the dormant season (winter) and minimum during the growing season (Vitousek, 1977;Lowrance et a l , 1984c;Correll et a l, 1992;House et al., 2001). In the winter, riparian forest removal of NO3' from ground water was inefficient (Correll et al., 1992 and references there in), while soil microbial activity (i.e., denitrification, mineralization) in both riparian forest and streambed was reduced due to low temperatures (Lowrance et a l, 1984c;Pavel et al., 1996;Willems et al., 1997). Furthermore, summer dissolved oxygen levels in stream and ground water may be lower and mineralization rates greater, which can contribute to reduced nitrification rates and increased NH4+ concentrations (Mulholland, 1992, House et a l, 2001). Ammonia volatilization from soil, fertilizer, and animal waste and subsequent deposition are other potential sources of NH4+, which peak in spring/early summer due to warmer weather and timing of fertilizer application (Russell et al., 1998;Cookson et al., 2001;Goebes et al., in press). In-stream processing can greatly affect DOC and DON concentrations, especially during spring and summer with higher temperatures and light availability. The observed higher DOC and DON concentrations during these seasons were likely derived from several in-stream sources, including exudation from benthic algae (periphyton), microbial degradation of particulate organic matter (POM), and leaf leachate (Triska et al., 1989;Mulholland, 1992;Bott, 1982, 1988), as well as from leachates of riparian forest production (Triska et al., 1984;O 'Brien et al., 1994). This seasonal pattern has also been observed in other streams and headwater ground water seeps (Tate and Meyer, 1983;Kaplan et al., 1980). In several studies, diel patterns of low NO3' and high DOC concentrations in streams have been observed during midday with the opposite pattern at night (Triska et al., 1989;Mulholland, 1992;Bott, 1982, 1988). Primary production by periphyton at mid-day during maximum light input resulted in NO3 ' uptake and DOC release, whereas at night, respiration caused DOC uptake and NO3' release (Triska et a l, 1989). Kaplan and Bott (1982) observed that during the spring, DOC concentrations in base flow in a Piedmont stream in Pennsylvania increased as much as 40 percent above the daily minimum. Lab and microcosm experiments also provided evidence that benthic algae excrete dissolved organic matter (DOM), while bacteria remove and transform DOM (Kaplan and Bott, 1982). Net algal DOC excretion provided 20 percent of total DOC export from the watershed. Similar to NO3*, DOC concentrations were associated with diel patterns of light, temperature, and photosynthesis, with a positive correlation between DOC concentration and temperature and irradiance. Higher temperatures in spring and summer also increase microbial decomposition of POM trapped in the hyporheic zone (stream subsurface area), with release of DOC and DON Bott, 1982, 1989;Kaplan and Newbold, 2000). Sediments without algae in light and dark treatments released DOC at comparable rates, which indicated microbial decomposition of POC rather than algal exudation (Kaplan and Bott, 1982). Kaplan and Bott (1989) also observed a positive correlation between DOC concentration and diel temperature during algal blooms; bacterial activity (measured by phospholipid and total lipid biosynthesis, respiration, and thymidine incorporation into DNA) increased with higher temperatures. During summer algal blooms, DOC concentrations did not vary on a diel basis (Kaplan and Bott, 1989), since temperatures are more likely to remain constant throughout the day in summer than in spring. In the fall, rapid leaching of leaf litter is a source of DOM in streams, accounting for about 30 percent of daily DOC export (M e y er# a l, 1998). This source probably contributed to relatively high fall DOC concentrations measured in our streams. The microbial breakdown of POM and DOM may have contributed to the higher observed PO4 * concentrations in northern streams during the summer relative to fall and winter. The lack of observed seasonal changes in P0 4 3' concentrations in southern streams may be a result of lower organic matter concentrations (Figure 24), thus lower mineralization rates. With greater oxygen concentrations in the streams, PO43' is more likely to be bound to particulates (Walbridge and Struthers, 1993). Meyer and Likens (1979) did not observe seasonal and diel variation in dissolved organic P and PO43' in stream water and subsurface water. Assawoman #4 behaved somewhat differently than other streams in our study. There was a large spike in DON, DOC, NH4+, and PO43* concentrations and almost no NO3' (<2 pM ) in July 2001 ( Figure 19). In August, NO3* increased rapidly and other nutrients returned to pre-July levels. This pattern suggests a large, local source of organic matter into the stream, most likely a point source; DOC concentration was more than seven times greater than other monthly DOC concentrations. Although we did not measure dissolved oxygen, we hypothesize that in July, the stream became anoxic and NO3-was either removed by denitrification or DO was sufficiently low to prevent nitrification of NFL^. In August, the DON and NFL* were oxidized and nitrified to NO3'."}, {"section_title": "DIN:DIP and DOC:DON ratios", "text": "Monthly DIN:DIP ratios for all streams (range: 26-5502), except for Assawoman #4 and Mill Creeks in some months, were greater than 16, indicating that the streams were P limited during base flow conditions (Figure 20). High DIN:DIP ratios are commonly found in Coastal Plain streams (TINiTIP range: 51-450) and ground water (DIN.DIP range: 106-1092) (Jordan et a l, 1997b, Reay et a l, 1992. High DIN:DIP ratios would potentially contribute to P limitation of primary producers in receiving waters, however primary production in coastal lagoons appears to be N limited (Taylor et a l, 1995;Pedersen and Borum, 1996;Valiela et a l, 1997;McGlathery et alia., 2001). In Hog Island Bay, mean DIN:DIP ratios ranged from 2.4 to 3.1 at three sites across Hog Island Bay and mean DIN concentrations were relatively low (1.2-4.4 pM ) (McGlathery et alia., 2001), indicating that the ocean likely contributed P and that N was rapidly removed and diluted when discharged to the lagoon. Mean DIN:DIP ratios were generally higher in winter, probably due to greater NO3' export and lower P0 4 3' export during this season (Figures 21, 26). Monthly DOC:DON ratios varied greatly within streams and were frequently very high, often due to low DON concentrations coinciding with relatively high DOC concentrations in the fall (Figure 18, 20). Our DOCiDON ratios may reflect different sources of DOC and DON to the streams. In the fall, mean DOC:DON ratios for northern streams were significantly higher than in the summer, which was likely due to the influence of fresh leaves falling into the streams and leaching more DOC than DON (Figure 26). DON also likely decomposes faster than DOC. For less than half of the streams, we observed large amounts of leaf litter in November. Fresh leaf litter leachates have high DOC:DON ratios, ranging from 35 to 200, depending on tree type (Qualls et al., 1991;. In November, we also observed a decrease in mean NO3 ' and NH4+, which was likely due to bacterial immobilization of N during leaf decomposition ( Figure 16) (Mulholland, 1992). Soil water is another source of DOC and DON, with a lower DOC:DON ratio of about 47 (Qualls et al., 1991). Lower mean DOC:DON concentrations (<60) found predominantly in the southern streams were probably derived from soil water that percolated into ground water and discharged to the streams (Figure 20)."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen budgets and riparian forest N retention rates", "text": "We developed N budgets for each watershed, based on published values of major inputs and outputs (Table 4), to provide estimates of net N input to forested, agricultural, and developed land covers in the watersheds. We assumed that the land covers did not affect each other; thus forest cover, either upland or riparian, did not receive ground water inputs of agriculturally or residentially derived nitrogen. Therefore, N advection in ground water flow was not included in the mass-balance calculations. Agricultural land cover received much higher net N inputs than forested and developed land covers. Our calculated net N input rates to agricultural land cover (23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36) kg N/ha/yr) were in the range of those reported for other mixed agricultural land (3.7-46.5 kg N/ha/yr) (Beaulac and Reckhow, 1982;Jordan et a l, 1997b). Similarly, our net N input rates to forested land cover (2.5-4.5 kg N/ha/yr) were in the range of other estimates (1-6 kg N/ha/yr) (Beaulac and Reckhow, 1982;Jordan et a l , 1997b). The N budgets demonstrated that fertilizer and N fixation from soybeans could be primary sources of N to agricultural lands (Table 17). Atmospheric deposition could be the main N source to forested lands, assuming that the forests were not bordering an agricultural field or developed area (Table 18). Important loss terms were crop harvest, denitrification, and forest uptake for woody storage. Calculation of the difference between estimated net N inputs to the watersheds and measured N outputs in base flow allowed us to roughly predict how much N could potentially be stored in or removed as gas from the watershed. Surface water runoff of N was not considered here, because it is likely to be a minor output. Base flow in the Coastal Plain generally accounts for about 60 to 80 percent of total stream flow (Bohlke and Denver, 1995;Phillips and Bachman, 1996;Correll et al., 1999b). In addition, this study occurred during a drought period; thus base flow would likely encompass a greater percentage of the total freshwater input. For all watersheds but Little Mosquito-right, the mean percentage of total net N input retained in the watersheds or removed as gas was 81 percent (range: 50-99%) (Table 20). Possible major sinks of N in the watersheds include: storage in ground water, burial in soil, riparian forest uptake, and denitrification. Nitrogen may have been stored in the surficial and confined aquifers, in which ground water is exchanged between the unconfined Columbia aquifer and the lower confined Yorktown aquifer (Richardson, 1994;Nuttle and Harvey, 1995). Riparian forests, which are frequently associated with poorly drained soils, likely remove much of the nitrogen in ground water before discharge to streams through uptake into woody biomass and denitrification. In the Coastal Plain region, riparian forests have been estimated to retain 70 to 90 percent of net N inputs (Peterjohn and Correll, 1984;Lowrance et al., 1984a;Jacobs and Gilliam, 1985;Jordan et al., 1993;Lowrance et al., 1997). Our forest N uptake rates for woody storage (7.1 kg N/ha/yr) assumed that the forest was not positioned to intercept high N ground water derived agricultural and developed land . However, Peterson and Correll (1984) observed a N uptake rate of 11.3 kg N/ha/yr by riparian forests from ground water flowing from adjacent agricultural lands, suggesting that forests can play a larger role in nitrogen retention in agricultural watersheds. Jordan et al. (1993) observed in a MD Coastal Plain watershed that NO3' concentrations in ground water decreased from 571 pM at the edge of a com field to <29 pM halfway through a riparian forest. The decrease in NCV occurred when the soil Eh below the water table was less than -9 0 mV, indicating reducing conditions suitable for denitrification. When there are both reducing conditions and a source of labile organic carbon, denitrification in poorly drained soils under riparian forests has been found to remove up to 50 percent of ground water NO3' load (Hanson et al., 1994). Gargatha and Nickawampus watersheds had lower estimated N retention rates (-50% ) than other watersheds in our study, which suggested that ground water may have flowed below the influence of shallow forest root zones and poorly drained sediments and discharged underneath the streams relatively unchanged (Speiran, 1996;Speiran et al., 1997;Phillips et al., 1993;Bohlke and Denver, 1995). The reduction of N could have occurred during recharge through poorly drained soils in the uplands (Speiran, 1996;Speiran et al., 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Estimates o f the predicted base flow TDN load from Hog Island Bay watersheds to the coastal lagoon relative to macroalgal N demand", "text": "The predicted TDN load in base flow from Hog Island Bay (HIB) watersheds was 20,896 kg N/year. Since our study occurred during a drought, the predicted TDN load may be an underestimate due to low water discharge. In order to determine whether the predicted TDN load from watersheds was sufficient to support observed macroalgal biomass in HIB, it was necessary to make the following simplifying assumptions: (1) nutrients are transported conservatively downstream from the headwater regions of streams to HIB; (2) nutrient export rates from the headwater regions are similar to rates from the entire watersheds; (3) there are no additional sinks of N in the HIB watersheds (e.g., no ponds on the streams); (4) there are no additional autochthonous or allochtonous N sources to HIB; (5) macroalgae are the primary sinks for TDN in HIB (e.g., no N uptake by other primary producers such as emergent macrophytes, phytoplankton, and benthic microalgae). The predicted TDN load in base flow was sufficient to support estimated mean annual macroalgal N demand in HIB (19,371 kg N/yr), suggesting that the primary source of N supporting macroalgal production was base flow derived from the shallow aquifer. However, it is ultimately the agricultural and developed land use in the watersheds that likely contaminated the shallow aquifer. Tyler et alia, (in press) showed that macroalgae in Hog Island Bay were a net sink for DIN throughout the year, but simultaneously were releasing up to 22% of DIN uptake as DON. In shallow coastal lagoons, nutrient enrichment has led to shifts in community structure of primary producers, with macroalgae or phytoplankton displacing seagrasses and causing local anoxia when they die-back and decompose in the summer (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Valiela et al., 1992). Increasing N loading rates to lagoons with short residence times are believed to change the dominant primary producer from seagrasses to macroalgae because they are able to increase their growth rates rapidly and shade the seagrasses (Taylor et al., 1995;Duarte, 1995;Pedersen and Borum, 1996;Valiela et al., 1997;Hauxwell et al., 2001). In coastal lagoons with long residence time and moderate to high N loadings, phytoplankton are expected to replace macroalgae because they have sufficient time to grow and accumulate (e.g., overcoming flushing rates) and shade both seagrasses and macroalgae. In Hog Island Bay with short residence times (days to weeks) (Fugate, unpublished data) and high N loadings from base flow, macroalgae are better poised to take advantage of available N than are phytoplankton (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Tyler et alia., 2001). When the macroalgal bloom collapsed in some summers, DIN and DON released from mineralization stimulated phytoplankton growth in the water column. While Hog Island Bay lost its seagrasses by 1933 from \"wasting disease\" (McGlathery et alia., 2001;Tyler et alia., 2001); Chincoteague Bay, a coastal lagoon located on the border of VA and MD portions of the Delmarva Peninsula, continues to have seagrasses (Boynton et al., 1996). However, nitrogen enrichment and increased densities of macroalgae may be contributing to losses of seagrasses (Boynton et al., 1996). Extremely high values of macroalgal biomass have occasionally been observed at the shoal site in HIB (>1800 g dry weight/m2; McGlathery et al., unpublished data), suggesting that the TDN load from base flow may not be sufficient to support the unusually high macroalgal production in some years. Since there is also N uptake by other primary producers, we should consider other potential N sources, including: epifauna bivalve nutrient regeneration (Sorabella, 2002), DON from primary producer exudation and organic matter decomposition, benthic DIN remineralization, direct atmospheric deposition, and direct ground water discharge to coastal lagoons. Benthic macroalgae can use some forms of DON as well as DIN (Tyler et alia., 2001;Tyler, 2002). DON, derived from both macro-and microalgal exudation and microbial degradation of organic matter in sediments, is the primary component of TDN in the HIB water column (58-95% of TDN) (Tyler et alia., 2001). Tyler et alia. (2001) observed that fluxes of urea from the sediment were significant in HIB during the summer. Since base flow provides small amounts of DON (1-30% of TDN load from HIB watersheds), the recycling of nutrients is an important source of DON for macroalgae in the coastal lagoon. Benthic nutrient regeneration can be another N source in shallow bays. In a highly eutrophic coastal lagoon in Sweden, Sundbacket al. (2003) observed DIN release from sediment, which provided up to 55 to 100 percent of estimated N macroalgal demand during onset of a bloom (Sundback et al., 2003). However in Hog Island Bay, despite high sediment mineralization rates, fluxes of NO3' and NH4+ from sediment were either insignificant or taken up by the sediment (Anderson et alia., 2003). ijenitrification and immobilization by both benthic microalgae and heterotrophic bacteria were likely sinks for the remineralized N. Therefore, sediment nutrient regeneration may not be an important N source to macroalgae in HIB. Direct atmospheric deposition to HIB could be a significant source of N, especially because the coastal lagoon has a water surface area (1 0 , 0 0 0 ha) comparable to the watershed area (9,220 ha). Meyers et a l (2001) estimated that direct atmospheric deposition to Delaware and Maryland coastal lagoons and Chesapeake Bay ranged from 7.87 to 9.35 kg N/ha/yr. Their estimates were based on data from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program monitoring of wet deposition to watersheds, US EPA 's Clean Air Status and Trends Network data of dry deposition to watersheds, and calibrated atmospheric deposition models. They noted that atmospheric deposition rates (on a per unit area basis) to the water bodies were less than those to nearby watersheds because air turbulence, which promotes deposition of NO3' and NH4 + gas and aerosols, is lower over water bodies (Meyers et a l, 2001). Atmospheric deposition is primarily derived from NH3 emissions from fertilizer, soil, and animal waste and NOx emissions from fossil fuel combustion by automobiles and power plants (Russell et a l, 1998). Using the atmospheric deposition estimates derived by Meyers et a l (2001) and based on a water surface area of 10,000 ha (McGlathery et alia., 2001), HIB may directly receive more than 78,700 kg N/yr from deposition, which is almost 4-fold greater than estimated N loadings from base flow. Direct ground water discharge under the lagoon is another potential N source, but there are little data on direct discharge to coastal water bodies. Based on water mass-balance calculations, ground water flow analysis, and ground water nutrient concentrations, Dillow and Greene (1999) indirectly estimated potential NO3' loading from direct ground water discharge to several coastal bays of Maryland to be 132 one-third of the potential NO3' loading from base flow. Applying this proportion to N loadings in base flow from HIB watersheds, direct ground water discharge could possibly contribute about 7000 kg/ha to HIB. Based on the magnitudes of these two alternative sources, atmospheric deposition would quantitatively be more important than base flow as a source of N to the coastal lagoons; however, base flow still provides a significant amount of N to coastal lagoons and can satisfy N demand of observed mean macroalgal biomass in HIB."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study was conducted to determine if nitrogen in base flow from watersheds on the VA Eastern Shore could support extensive mats of opportunistic macroalgae observed in shallow areas of Hog Island Bay during some years. We also assessed relationships between nutrients concentrations and export rates and watershed characteristics (e.g., land cover and soil drainage class) to help identify potential sources and sinks of nutrients. In summary, our study of nutrient discharges in base flow from.watersheds in the VA Eastern Shore found that: \u2022 Base flow derived from the shallow aquifer was a significant source of N supporting macroalgal production in Hog Island Bay. The predicted TDN load in base flow from HIB watersheds (20,896 kg N/year) was sufficient to support estimated mean macroalgal N demand (19,371 kg N/yr). \u2022 Direct atmospheric deposition is a major source of N to Hog Island Bay and quantitatively more important than base flow. HIB may directly receive more than 78,700 kg N/yr from direct atmospheric deposition, which is almost 4-fold greater than N loadings from base flow. Direct atmospheric deposition to coastal waters could be more important for HIB because surface water area (10,000 ha) is comparable to watershed area (9,220 ha). Other potential N sources include DON from macro-or microalgal exudation and microbial decomposition of organic matter and direct ground water discharge to the coastal lagoons. \u2022 Annual flow-weighted mean NO3 ' concentrations and export rates in southern streams were negatively related to percent of forest cover. Forest cover explained the most variability of NCV concentrations and export rates, suggesting that forests in southern watersheds potentially removed NO3' in ground water before discharge to streams. On the other hand, it may also suggest that watersheds with greater percentages of forest cover receive lower fertilizer N inputs. \u2022 Higher percentages of developed land cover in the watersheds were related to higher NO 3 * export rates. In a multiple regression analysis with percent of forest cover, addition of percent of developed land cover explained more of the variance in NO3' export rates. We suspect that septic system effluent from developed land cover the source of NO3' . \u2022 NO3' export rates were positively related to percent of very poorly drained soil. The fact that our study occurred during a severe drought may have modified the hypothesized ability of poorly drained soils to reduce NO3' concentrations by denitrification. With the drought, water table elevations were lower and the soils classified as very poorly and poorly drained might have actually been unsaturated and oxic, thus promoting nitrification and mineralization. On the other hand, base flow may have been composed primarily of older ground water drawn from greater depths as a result of the lower ground water levels, which frequently have higher nitrate concentrations than shallow ground water recharged from forest soils. \u2022 Shallow stream depths and low water discharge rates may also moderate NO3 ' concentrations. We observed that three streams with low annual water discharge rates had the lowest mean monthly NO3 concentrations. \u2022 The mean percentage of total net N inputs retained in the VA Eastern Shore watersheds or lost due to denitrification was estimated at 81 percent. This was based on the calculation of the difference between estimated net N inputs to the watersheds and measured N outputs in base flow. Riparian forests, which are frequently associated with poorly drained soils, likely removed N in ground water through uptake into woody biomass and denitrification. Our rates were similar to forest N retention rates of 70-90% of net N inputs estimated in other studies (Peterjohn and Correll, 1984;Lowrance et a l, 1984a;Jacobs and Gilliam, 1985;Jordan et a l, 1993;Lowrance et a l, 1997). \u2022 Nutrient export rates estimated for predominantly forested watersheds in the VA Eastern Shore were generally lower than those for predominantly agricultural watersheds. TDN export rates from forested watersheds ranged from 0.12 to 2.3 kg N/ha/yr, while those from agricultural watersheds ranged from 1.6 to 9.2 kg N/ha/yr. \u2022 Agricultural land cover receives much higher net N inputs than forested and developed land covers. Based on N budget calculations, estimated net N input rates ranged from 23 to 36 kg N/ha/yr for agricultural land cover, 1 to 6 kg N/ha/yr for forested land cover, and 0.4 to 3 kg N/ha/yr for developed land cover. \u2022 There are likely greater anthropogenic N inputs to watersheds in the northern area of the VA Eastern Shore than those in the southern area. We draw this conclusion because watersheds in the northern region had significantly higher annual flow-weighted mean NCV and DON concentrations than southern streams. \u2022 Water discharge rates in the studied streams were likely lower than long term averages, because this study occurred during a severe drought. We draw this conclusion because ground water levels in the VA Eastern Shore were lower than average and base flow discharge rates are positively related to water table elevations (Staver and Brinsfield, 1991). \u2022 Ground and stream water were likely oxygenated. We observed that NO3' was the primary N species found in base flow (66-98% of total N) for most streams. \u2022 Most streams were phosphorus limited during base flow conditions. Monthly DIN:DIP ratios for most streams were greater than 16. \u2022 Nutrient concentrations in winter likely better represent ground water quality, because of less in-stream processing and riparian forest uptake. . Seasonal mean NO3' concentrations were significantly higher in winter than other seasons, while mean DOC and N H / concentrations were significantly higher in summer than other seasons. Seasonal variation in monthly nutrient concentrations likely resulted from a combination of environmental factors (e.g., temperature and light), in-stream processing (e.g., benthic algal exudation, microbial degradation of particulate organic matter, leaf leachate), and riparian forest uptake (e.g., dormant vs. growing season).  01 331.98 51.28 242.74 1.83 209.67 194.20 65.10 137.90 116.23 80.35 12.95 253.84 84.17 83.15   08/01 296.04 42.47 214.68 1197.28 198.87 173.59 54.68 134.03 116.06 101.23 2.51 171.31 73.80 61.85   09/01 317.37 53.80 218.84 469.08 202.00 186.43 68.87 156.99 118.08 89.72 3.67 182.83 102.27 58.56  10/01 306.87 39.27. 216.75 546.09 216.30 209.11 62.58 149.15 122.42 89.33 2.97 263.81 118.64 74.05   11/01 248.16 12.49 198.87 199.82 170.06 200.25 15.97 78.02 103.73 40.35 0.85 243.00 90.89 66.76   12/01 353.61 19.50 256.10 1040.83 272.56 258.53 89.30 160.36 122.48 92.14 0.30 258.98 126.92   1 Nickawampus 11/01-1/02 monthly mean nutrient concentrations estimated by regression relationships of measured data between Gargatha and Nickawampus.
