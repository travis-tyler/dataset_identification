[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In December 2019, a number of cases of viral pneumonia were found in Wuhan, China, and the initial cases were related to the exposure in Wuhan seafood market (Jiang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . On February 11, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced the official name of the new coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); simultaneously, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia was officially named \"COVID-19\" (Munster et al., 2020; Zhu N. et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 has spread to 206 countries and regions in the world by April 4th, 2020, accounting for 88.4% of the total. More than 1 million cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide, and more than 50,000 cases have died.\nCoronavirus is a common positive-strand RNA virus that causes respiratory diseases, existing widely in nature. Humans, vertebrates and invertebrates can be their parasitic host (Guo et al., 2020) . So far, 7 kinds of infectious coronavirus have been found, i.e. HCoV-229-E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Among those, 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 can cause common cold symptoms, and the remaining three are highly pathogenic SARS-CoV (atypical pneumonia), MERS-CoV (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2.\nAccording to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 database officially released by the National Genomics Science Data Center on January 22, the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 29903nt, which mainly includes the genes ORF1a and 1b encoding non-structural proteins and S, E, M, N encoding structural proteins. The M and E protein play a critical role in coordinating virus assembly and forming mature viral envelopes, while the N protein binds to the viral RNA and is involved in the transcription and replication of viral RNA, as well as packaging of the encapsidated genome into virions (Ashour et al., 2020; Nishiga et al., 2020; Zhu C. et al., 2020) . Research shows that both SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 and the SARS outbreak in 2003 probably originate from the bat, and genome sequence similarity is up to 80%. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection path and the pathogenesis are similar to SARS Zhou et al., 2020) , namely, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin converting enzyme gene 2 (Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, ACE2) interacting invades into the host cell, and then complete the replication of the virus (Prompetchara et al., 2020) .\nPathogens are usually tested by molecular diagnosis and immunodiagnosis. The N protein can be exposed in the process of virus assembling, which make it become one of the targets of clinical detection. An article published reported detect the N protein of MERS-CoV with antigen detection method was feasible (Chen et al., 2015) . In the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the fluorescence PCR method was adopted in preference. The results of this method were accurate, but there were also some problems such as complicated operation and susceptibility to environmental factors. Therefore, the rapid immunodiagnostic reagents can be used for screening in the middle and late stages of the epidemic prevention. In the process of developing immunoassay reagents, the specific and conserved sequence of viral N protein was selected through the published genome sequences, a large number of antibodies were screened, and then the viral antigens were detected by the method of double-antibody sandwiched antigens."}, {"section_title": "Patients and Samples", "text": "Nasal/oropharyngeal swabs of a total of 990 samples from January 2020 to April 2020 were collected and tested in this study, including 247 COVID-19 patients, 443 patients with other respiratory diseases and 300 healthy people.

The strip has great identification ability, with a false positive rate of 1.5% (1/68). For the cases with COVID-19, we observed the antigen detection rate at different time of onset. As shown in Figure 3C , the detection rate of antigen was higher than 48% within 35 days after onset of fever. Its trend overall the development of disease was similar to that of RNA detection. The detection rates of both of the two methods were significantly reduced after 35 days, which were consistent with the course of disease.\nIf the antigen test was used to supple RNA detection for auxiliary diagnosis, the diagnostic value of combined evaluation increased to AUC of 0.865(95% CI: 0.822-0.909) ( Figure 3D ), while the diagnostic value of single antigen test and RNA test was 0.802(95% CI: 0.752-0.852) and 0.825(95% CI:0.776-0.874)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "At present, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 mainly includes nucleic acid detection and immune detection. Nucleic acid testing, or molecular testing, is the gold standard for diagnosing infectious diseases by detecting the genetic material of viruses. However, this method is mainly performed by fluorescence quantitative PCR, which has the problems of complicated extraction process, high requirements of experimental environment and conditions, long detection time, and extremely high rate of missed detection. In addition, research has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of RNA virus, and RNA is easily degraded during the extraction process (Landolt et al., 2016; Nwokeoji et al., 2016; Le Bleu et al., 2017) , which will lead to the false negative results. Therefore, RNA cannot be adapted to the requirements of rapid test and a large number of suspected case screening. According to the experience obtained from the immunoassay of SARS virus, immunoassay can be used as a supplement to the nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially for suspected cases with similar clinical symptoms and negative nucleic acid test, which has a great complementary diagnostic effect Shi et al., 2003) .\nImmunoassay is based on the specific response between antigens and antibodies, by detecting viral proteins (antigens) in the body, or antibodies specific to viral proteins in the body to make a diagnosis. Immunoassay includes antigen detection and antibody detection. The antigen detection kit based on immunofluorescent microspheres only needs to add the sample to the lysate to lyse out the antigen in the sample for detection, which can avoid the tedium of quantitative PCR. Though the RNA extraction process greatly simplifies the experimental operation process and shortens the detection time, there still remain missing test. On the other hand, RNA detection is aimed at the detection of live virus, while antigen detection is aimed at virus protein. In principle, protein fragments can also be detected after virus rupture. Therefore, it is particularly important to perform antibody testing after infection as a complement to the deficiency. By comparing several detection methods of the SARS-CoV-2, the detection time of nucleic acid is earlier, antigen detection is more convenient and faster, and the combined use can better meet the requirements of SARS-CoV-2 detection. In this study, the diagnostic value of combined evaluation increased to AUC of 0.865(95% CI: 0.822-0.909), while the diagnostic value of single antigen test and RNA test was 0.802(95% CI: 0.752-0.852) and 0.825 (95% CI: 0.776-0.874) ( Figure 3D) . In order to improve the sensitivity of this method, high specific monoclonal antibodies with enough affinity were selected for the specific spatial structure (antigenic determinant) of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Then, the method of fluorescence immunolabeling combined with fluorescence photometric signal detection was chosen, which could improve the sensitivity of the analysis method by 1-2 orders of magnitude, when compared to the traditional colloidal gold particle labeling method. Data from multicenter clinical trials showed that the sensitivity of antigen strip in COVID-19 cases at progress stage was 67.15%, but the results were close to RNA test, with a PPA and NPA of 83.16 and 94.45%. On another hand, the detection rate of antigen strip in COVID-19 cases at cured stage 7.02%, except for the possibility of false positives, this result also indicated that antigen fragments may temporarily store in the body of the cured patients or antigen test may assist RNA detection as a discharge index. The product \"New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) N Protein Detection Kit (Fluorescence Immunochromatography)\" have been certified by European Conformity (Mar. 13, 2020; certificate no. HKT-20200313-001) and obtained the Provisional Authorization issued by health science authority of Singapore (July 13, 2020; MDPA2020-98).\nIn the present study, the validation experiment for the activated SARS-CoV-2 virus was conducted in the P3 laboratory, and the clinical experiments were performed in the P2+ laboratory laboratories (medical staff using P3 protection). The test strips exhibited good performance in detecting the live virus. How about the detection of inactivated virus? The results before and after the inactivation were compared, and it was found that the protein destruction after inactivation would affect the detection results (data shown in another study). The average test result (T/C value) of 450 ng of purified N protein was 2.89 (positive) before inactivation, and 0.041 (negative) after inactivation (56\u00b0C treatment). Then, the N protein was mixed with the throat swab (obtained from healthy people) and nasal swab (obtained from healthy people), respectively. The detection results were significantly reduced after the sample inactivation. Although the activated virus was a limitation in the present study, this ensured the sensitivity and accuracy of the detection. Therefore, the test should be operated in the P2+ laboratory, which can much faster provide a preliminary result, and cooperate with the nucleic acid detection, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy. On the other hand, the antigen test does not require trained specialists or large-scale equipment, making it possible to be easily used in healthy population screening, and the self-monitoring of patients after cure. We have done comparison tests in terms of simplicity and feasibility. An UV-light can be used as a detection instrument for the antigen strips with a high sensitivity. The detection results of UV-light (LoD 1 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /ml) were consistent with that of Savant-100 Fluorescence immunochromatographic analyzer, which was used in the study (the data of detection and clinical trials were submitted to CE certification and Singapore HAS certification).These advantages would meet the need of \"rapid, instrument-free antigen test\" recommended by Mina and colleagues in a recent perspective paper (Mina et al., 2020) .\nThe commentary recommends that in addition to current RT-PCR fluorescent testing, lateral-flow testing methods that are rapid and instrument-free should be developed for use in school, airports, and even at home. Such rapid test methods would be able to diagnosis COVID-19 earlier before infected patients are able to transmit their infections to others. The investigators will continue to improve the method in further research, in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the strips for inactivated virus. Furthermore, the investigators hope to develop portable equipment, reagents and standards suitable for home use, similar to those used as a blood glucose meter."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT", "text": "The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary materials.
