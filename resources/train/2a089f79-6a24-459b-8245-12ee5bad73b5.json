[{"section_title": "Creating More Robust STEM Transfer Pathways: National Context", "text": "No single data source provides a comprehensive estimate, but the available evidence suggests two-year to four-year college and university transfer in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is small relative to the need for a greater number of STEM-educated citizens, workers, and professionals in the United States. Barriers, promising strategies, and policy supports for expanding those pathways is the subject of this report. This consideration takes place in a broader national context. In May, 2010, the National Science Board (NSB) issued a comprehensive report titled Preparing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators: Identifying and Developing our National Human Capital. The three keystone recommendations of this report and several of its policy actions deserve particular attention when examining the evolving relationships and dynamics between two-year and four-year colleges and universities for the purpose of broadening STEM transfer pathways. These are: (1) NSB Keystone Recommendation #1: Provide opportunities for excellence (2) NSB Keystone Recommendation #2: Cast a wide net (a) Policy Action: Improve talent assessment systems (b) Policy Action: Improve identification of overlooked abilities (3) NSB Keystone Recommendation #3: Foster a supportive ecosystem (a) Policy Action: Professional development for educators in STEM pedagogy These particular recommendations and policy actions, excerpted from among others in the NSB (2010) report, are highlighted here are because the challenges of (1) providing quality science and mathematics teaching to all students (i.e. \"opportunities for excellence\"), improving assessment and talent identification, and (3) creating supportive ecosystems through professional development for STEM educators are particularly central to the challenge of creating more robust STEM transfer pathways. The dimensions of these problems are cultural as well as structural, yet prevailing attempts to improve transfer, such as articulation agreements, curriculum alignment through common course numbering, and guaranteed transfer of credit policies, have been structural. Therefore, to improve transfer in STEM it is necessary to consider the cultural characteristics of STEM learning environments and those who have traditionally succeeded in them in formal educational systems in the U.S. Engineering, the sciences, whether physical, biological or technical, and computing all require mathematical knowledge, reasoning, and skills. These are fields in which epistemic knowledge, which is to say knowledge viewed as objective, rationale, and value-neutral, is highly valued (Greenwood & Levin, 2005;Polkinghorne, 2004). In a disciplinary typology, STEM fields are considered \"hard-pure\" or \"hard applied\" fields, in contrast to \"soft-applied\" fields at the other end of the continuum (Austin, 1990). Knowledge in these fields is produced in pursuit of generalized and absolute truths, which are the basis of prediction, reduction of error, and the ability to transform and manipulate natural forces. Such abstract and generalized truths are produced through certain ways of knowing, learning and thinking, which are called \"rational.\" Success in STEM fields holds prestige in ways that success in other fields does not, because rationale knowledge is currently accorded status in U.S. society as an elevated form of knowledge held by elites (Polkinghorne, 2004). Scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, therefore, have a strong identity as rational thinkers. They are also acknowledged survivors or victors who have prevailed in competitive learning environments where producing correct answers is valued. Their identities have been forged in the distinctive \"culture of science,\" with its \"gatekeeper\" courses and competitive grading (Hurtado et al., 2011). Without introducing an expectation of reduced academic standards, the Keystone Recommendations of the Next Generation report emphasize that the standards of instruction, assessment, and selection into STEM have become too narrow. They have failed to ensure \"opportunities for excellence,\" or high quality learning environments, for all students across the educational spectrum. What can be viewed as \"monocultural\" standards by some obscure talent assessment and the identification of STEM talent in women of all racial-ethnic groups and men who are Latino, African American, Native American or Southeast Asian. Talent identification in students with physical disabilities is similarly inhibited. Subject content and learning environments viewed as value-neutral and objective to some are experienced as \"racialized\" (Martin, 2009) and hostile climates (Pascarella et al., 1997;Starobin & Laanan, 2008) by others. The paradox that must be addressed is: If epistemic knowledge represents generalized truths, how can one's ability to learn or produce it be associated with ascribed racial, gender, or social characteristics? The answer is multifaceted and emerges from studies of identity development, stereotype threat, racial discrimination, and the \"chilly climate\" of STEM. Key findings of this literature are summarized in this report. At this juncture, it is important to note why these considerations are of particular importance when considering strategies to expand STEM transfer pathways between two-year and four-year institutions. It is due to the fact that the status differences among fields of study are compounded by the status differences between two-year and four-year college and university faculty. These status differences introduce distrust of the quality of the community college and technical college curriculum among faculty and administrators who serve on the admissions and curriculum committees of four-year institutions. As a result the curriculum is poorly aligned and collaboration is rare (A. C. Dowd, 2010;Gabbard et al., 2006aGabbard et al., , 2006b). Many students who transfer (in any field) experience a \"border crossing\" (Bensimon & Dowd, 2009;Pak, Bensimon, Malcom, Marquez, & Park, 2006) that is said to produce \"transfer shock\" (Laanan, 2003). These challenges are exacerbated when it comes to transfer in STEM because of the sequential nature of the curriculum. They are also exacerbated by differences in the level of financial and human resources provided for STEM instruction in different sectors of postsecondary education. Stating that a \"national effort to sustain and strengthen science and engineering must also include a strategy for ensuring that we draw on the minds and talents of all Americans,\" a comprehensive review of science and technology education in the U.S. conducted by distinguished scholars and educational leaders for the National Academies 2010 and habits of mind, (2) opportunities to put these into practice, (3) developing a sense of competence and progress, (4) the motivation to in, a sense of belonging to, or self-identification with the field, and (5) information about the stages, requirements, and opportunities for participation and successful completion. It is notable that transfer from a two-year college to a four-year college or university requires that students can acquire these \"ingredients\" in two different and often culturally distinct settings, creating an even greater challenge to their success. To move deliberately in creating STEM learning environments in which a greater number and a more diverse body of students are successful, the Crossroads report also charged institutions with five roles: 1. Strong leadership from trustees, regents, president, provost, deans and department chairs 2. Campus-wide commitment to inclusiveness 3. Deliberate processes of self-appraisal focused on campus climate 4. Development of a plan to implement constructive change 5. Ongoing evaluation of implementation efforts This report introduces a proposal for the creation of Evidence-Based Inquiry Councils (EBICs), adapted from (A. C. Dowd & Tong, 2007), with a focus on creating effective STEM transfer pathways. EBICs would provide an organizational structure to support the five institutional roles described in the Crossroads report and to foster the \"supportive ecosystem\" called for in the NSB's Next Generation report. The EBIC design, as proposed here, relies on five strategies to create such an ecosystem: networks, learning, financial rewards, elevated status, and improved affordability. These strategies tackle the problem that the transfer structures are not sufficient to support robust transfer pathways in STEM in the absence of interpersonal relationships and shared cultural norms across sectors. Professional development for faculty and college administrators in STEM pedagogy and culturally inclusive practices is needed to create such an ecosystem. Such professional development activities will be well received only if they are accorded prestige and provide resources for the production of new knowledge through research, design experiments, and inquiry, which is the systematic use of data, reflection, and experimentation to improve professional practices. Therefore, this report makes the following recommendations: 1. Create prestigious regional instructional design and research centers, called Evidence Based Inquiry Councils (EBICs), involving STEM faculty, deans, and department heads in geographic clusters of two-year and four-year colleges and universities to invent, experiment with, and evaluate innovative curricula, pedagogies, and assessments of student talents and learning. 2. Provide financial resources to transfer students by fully funding Pell grants, creating a STEM work-study program through the HEA Reauthorization, and establishing public and privately funded STEM transfer scholarships and Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), giving EBICs oversight of the scholarship and work-study award process to engage them in rethinking processes and criteria for talent identification. In the following sections, I present the basis for this recommendations, with section one presenting a portrait of Latino STEM transfer to illustrate the limited prospects of STEM bachelor's degree attainment for two-year college students; section two identifying barriers to transfer (including affordability, the limited impacts of articulation agreements and many special programs, and the marginalizing effects of the STEM monoculture); and section three  (Adelman, 2005), particularly in populous states with growing Latino populations, such as California, Texas, and Florida. Estimates vary, but roughly 60% of Latino students enrolled in postsecondary education attend a community college (Arbona & Nora, 2007;Snyder, Tan, & Hoffman, 2006). Immigrants, first-generation students, and those from low-income families are also more likely to begin postsecondary education in community colleges. These characteristics and racial-ethnic minority group status are also intertwined. Expanded transfer access is necessary because although Hispanic participation in STEM fields has risen, it has not kept pace with Hispanic population growth. Growth in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanic students has occurred primarily in non-science and engineering fields. From 1998 to 2007, there was a 64% increase in the number of non-science and engineering bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanic students, as compared to an increase of only 50% in science and engineering degrees awarded to Hispanic students. Further, the proportion of STEM doctoral degrees awarded to Hispanic students (estimated at less than 5%) severely lags the proportion of Hispanics in the U.S. population (around 15%). Arbona and Nora (2007), analyzing National Longitudinal Educational Survey data of a sample initially collected in 1988 (NELS: 88), found that among those Latino students who first attended a community college, only 7% had obtained at least a bachelor's degree by 2000. Similarly, an estimate obtained from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01) showed that although 25% of Hispanic students who attended a two-year college initially intended to transfer to a four-year institution and obtain a bachelor's degree, six years after first enrolling in community colleges only 6% had been awarded a bachelor's degree (Hoachlander, Sidora, & Horn, 2003). National estimates such as these are useful, but it is important to note that transfer rates are contested (Horn & Lew, n.d.;Kienzl, Wesaw, & Kumar, 2011) and vary considerably by state. Depending on how broad or restrictive the denominator is, i.e. the determination of who \"counts\" in estimating the rate, and the length of time allowed for transfer to take place, transfer rates vary widely. Using a broad denominator of Latinos entering community colleges in  Dowd et al., 2006; A. C. . These results are not based on the most current data, but the forces that likely diminished transfer during those decades are still active today, including intensive demand for elite education that make transfer applicants less attractive to selective institutions (A. C. Dowd, Cheslock, & Melguizo, 2008). The loss of transfer access to selective institutions is of concern in regard to STEM graduate degree production because the competitive, \"top 100\" STEM research universities are the main gateways to STEM doctoral and professional degrees. As long as selective institutions restrict transfer access, the challenge of creating more robust transfer pathways in STEM for community college students will fall largely to nonselective institutions."}, {"section_title": "Generating Portraits of Transfer in STEM for Other Groups", "text": "No group depends on the community college to the same extent as Latino students. In fall of 2000, 58% of Hispanics enrolled in college were attending two-year institutions compared to 42% of African American and 36% of White students (Harvey, 2003, cited in Arbona andNora, 2007). The community college is clearly an important site of entry to postsecondary education for African American students, but it is important to note that technical colleges and colleges in the for-profit sector play similar roles.  1985-1986; 1995-1996 and 2005-2006), focusing on broad STEM codes including engineering, engineering technologies/technicians, biological and biological sciences, mathematics and statistics, physical sciences and science technologies/technicians. The article focuses on gender, in particular, and shows that although the overall numbers are increasing in STEM, the percentage of women is not. Overall, the annual number of STEM completers in their most recent data was less than the total number twenty years prior, which illustrates the loss of interest in STEM among all college students."}, {"section_title": "Section II: Barriers to Transfer in STEM 1", "text": "The numbers do not reveal the nature of the problems facing students who want to transfer. The findings of ethnographic and policy case studies have previously indicated the negative impact of poor curriculum alignment and the cultural \"transfer shock\" of moving from community colleges to the four-year sector, where the pacing and volume of course content is greater. This section discusses four barriers to transfer in STEM fields: affordability; ineffective articulation agreements, the marginalizing effects of the STEM monoculture, and the limited capacity of many special and targeted STEM outreach and mentoring programs."}, {"section_title": "Affordability", "text": "Many studies indicate that targeted financial aid is extremely important and that grants improve students' persistence and degree completion in college. Scholarships and fellowships also reduce students' need to borrow for postsecondary education at the undergraduate and graduate level. This is of particular importance when we consider diversity in STEM because debt can constrain opportunities for graduate and professional study for underrepresented students. Malcom and Dowd (2012), analyzing NSRCG data, found that cumulative undergraduate debt among STEM bachelor's degree holders (measured in relative terms in comparison with the typical amount of debt at the graduate's institution) had a more negative effect on graduate school enrollment right after college among Hispanic STEM baccalaureates than among students of other racial-ethnic backgrounds. Although this difference was not statistically significant, the research illustrates the importance of scholarships and fellowships in improving Hispanic student participation in STEM fields and professions. The findings provide support for policies that offer student loan forgiveness to students who work in socially valued professions such as mathematics education and clinical health care and for fully funding the means-tested Pell grant program."}, {"section_title": "Ineffective articulation agreements", "text": "The goal of establishing \"articulation\" and alignment between the community college and four-year college and university curricula has been a policy focus for several decades. Although Zinser and Hanssen (2006), based on an analysis of national data from the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, conclude that articulation agreements for the transfer of 2-year technical degrees to baccalaureate degrees are valuable, other analyses of secondary data bases indicate that state-level articulation agreements have statistically insignificant effects on transfer Kienzl, et al., 2011). These results, although ambiguous, and to some extent offset by findings that indicate institution-to-institution articulation agreements are effective, indicate that articulation agreements are not likely to be effective, in themselves, in broadening STEM transfer pathways."}, {"section_title": "The STEM Monoculture and Its Marginalizing Effect", "text": "Recent research documents that racial stigma and discrimination creates significant A report issued in 2010 on \"Diversifying the STEM Pipeline: The Model Replication Institutions Program\" raises concern about the lack of \"buy in\" among faculty and senior leadership at participating campuses towards the goal of increasing access and success in STEM education for minority and low-income students. 4 A research article published in 2009 emphasizes that African American students participate in mathematics education with an acute awareness of the dynamics of race and racism in their lives. Successful students embrace a mathematics identity and an identity as African Americans, but this often comes only through a great deal of struggle and perseverance. 5 Programs that do not address the fundamental problem of the negative racial climate in STEM fields are, therefore, unlikely to have a substantial impact to increase diversity."}, {"section_title": "Student Services, Academic Support Programs, and Curricular Reform", "text": "There are currently many special programs at community colleges and four-year institutions that aim to increase the number of students earning STEM degrees by providing enhanced student services and academic advising. Few of these are specifically focused on or targeted at helping STEM transfer students. Typical strategies focus on recruitment, orientation, faculty and peer mentoring, and intrusive advising to inform students if they are running into trouble academically or to guide them in making good academic choices. These strategies are primarily designed to reduce the difficulties of navigating college by providing students with information and extra support. Other programs go farther by offering learning experiences designed to better engage students in scientific study, such as through intensive summer research programs, learning communities, and supplemental instruction. A subset of the student services and academic support programs place a particular emphasis on increasing the numbers of students from underrepresented racial-ethnic groups in STEM. The most common program designs are not informed by studies of the racial climate of STEM classrooms and programs. In addition, they are not primarily designed to transform STEM education at its heart: in the classroom and the core curriculum. They tend to be program based and therefore seldom bridge the boundaries of different disciplines and types of institutions. There is a risk that the improvements in mentoring, advising, supplemental instruction, and laboratory instruction that may be brought about by the special programs will remain on the periphery and not have a broader impact on STEM education. Through a case study involving interviews with ninety faculty, administrators, and counselors at three universities and three \"feeder\" community colleges, all of which were Hispanic Serving Institutions, respondents described and shared data showing programs intensively focused on a small number of Hispanic students relative to the entire Hispanic student body. As often as not, respondents worked in isolation and were not part of robust networks of faculty and administrators engaged in changing the STEM curriculum. For some the isolated nature of the work led to a sense that the goal of improving Hispanic student participation and degree completion in STEM fields was not supported by the college leadership. These results highlight the concern that special programs are not adequate to the task of substantially increasing the number of Hispanic students being awarded STEM degrees. An emerging effort seeks to provide STEM faculty with the know-how (through professional development) to bring about active learning. In relation to the goal of increasing diversity in STEM, active learning and \"real world\" problem-solving approaches hold promise to reduce the sense of alienation of underrepresented racial-ethnic groups too often experience in STEM fields. Studies show that students of color value the opportunity to serve communities and address social problems through their college coursework. However, as important as active learning and real world problem solving is, even this solution is not likely to be sufficient in and of itself to substantially improve diversity in STEM fields or to increase transfer pathways. Active learning can be incorporated without attention to the root problem of the racial discrimination, stigma, and alienation experienced by underrepresented students in STEM fields."}, {"section_title": "Ineffective Remedial and Developmental Education", "text": "Many community college students from all racial-ethnic groups are placed in remedial mathematics classes at community colleges. There is considerable variation by state, but it is not uncommon for the rate of remedial placement to be as high as 50% at community colleges and in some colleges that figure can reach as high as 90%. Remedial instruction in mathematics is also common at the four-year level, but the rates of remedial placement are lower, nearer to 20% or 30%. Improving teaching and learning in mathematics instruction is therefore a high priority for increasing the numbers of STEM degrees awarded to Hispanic students."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "(1) Keystone Recommendation #1: Provide opportunities for excellence (i) Create prestigious research and design centers, called Evidence Based Inquiry Councils, involving STEM faculty in geographic clusters of twoyear and four-year colleges and universities to: 1.
