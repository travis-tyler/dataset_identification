[{"section_title": "", "text": "has placed student learning as one of the top priorities for college accrediting agencies.\nAs a result of these concerns, 44 states have created some form of accountability or statistical reporting system (Burke and Minassians, 2002) and of those, 27 have formal ''report cards'' that characterize, among other things, learning outcomes (Naughton, et al., 2003) . Of those states that do characterize student outcomes in a report card, Naughton et al. (2003) found 227 performance indicators that were either directly or indirectly related to student learning.\nDirect indicators of student learning include scores from achievement and ability tests. The most frequent direct indicators are scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), licensure examination pass rates, and infrequently, value-added measures based on published tests (such as CAAP). Indirect indicators are proxies for learning. They typically include graduation rates, degrees awarded, self-reports of learning (such as obtained through the National Student Survey of Engagement), and employer surveys. Data on indirect measures are generally much easier and less expensive to gather than data on direct measures. Consequently, 80% of the learning indicators reported by 26 of the 27 states in Naughton et al. 's study (2003) focused on indirect indicators.\nIncreasingly, however, policy debate has focused on direct assessment of student learning (e.g., Callen and Finney, 2002; Klein et al., 2002; Shavelson and Huang, 2003) . Not surprisingly, a consensus has not been reached as to what to measure or how to measure it. On the one hand, Callen and Finney have proposed a national assessment for higher education not unlike the National Assessment of Educational Progress (the ''Nation's Report Card'' for K-12 education). Such an assessment would permit state-by-state comparison for policy makers that would be reported in ''Measuring Up,'' a biennial higher education report card. Such an approach provides information to state policy makers for decision-making but this level of aggregation is not particularly useful for institutional improvement. In contrast, some researchers (e.g., Benjamin and Hersh, 2002; Klein, 2001; Klein et al., 2003 ) have proposed a multilevel assessment adapted to local institutions' concerns for the improvement of teaching and learning. In such a system, comparison sets of cooperating institutions could participate and benchmark progress. Results of such an assessment system could also be included in state report cards.\nIn our view, the latter approach is more likely to lead to improved learning in America's diverse institutions of higher education than the former. However, we cannot at present test this assumption without alternatives to compare. In the long run we believe that a rapprochement is needed between the legitimate demands of policy makers and the calls for institutional improvement. This paper is a step in that direction. It reports the results of an effort to assess important aspects of student learning in higher education. Our approach integrates cognitive outcomes associated with learning with thinking and writing ability outcomes associated with broader goals of undergraduate general education. The findings represent direct measures of these broader goals using the college rather than the individual student (or the state) as the unit of analysis. Specifically, the study addresses the following questions:\n1. Can we obtain reasonably reliable school level scores on open-ended (as distinct from multiple choice) tests of the students' writing and critical thinking skills? 2. After controlling for ''input'' (as measured by SAT or ACT scores), do the students' scores improve as they progress through the college years? 3. Are the students' scores on our measures related to their GPAs? In other words, are we measuring skills and abilities that appear to influence and/or reflect learning? 4. After controlling for ''input'' do the students at some colleges generally earn statistically significantly higher scores than students at other colleges? That is, are the measures sensitive to the ''value added'' by the institution? 5. Do students find the measures interesting and engaging enough to motivate them to try their best? 6. Can the measures be administered (and the answers to them scored) in an efficient, timely, and cost effective way? For example, is it feasible to use computer scoring of essay answers on a large scale?\nThe next section of this paper summarizes the approaches that have been used in the past to assess the effectiveness of educational programs. We follow this with a review of the conceptual framework Shavelson and Huang (2003) suggested for defining and building direct measures of student learning. The remainder of this article presents our findings regarding the questions above and discusses their implications."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND: PAST EFFORTS TO MEASURE STUDENT LEARNING", "text": "To provide a context for what follows, we briefly review past efforts to assess institutional quality including student cognitive outcomes. These efforts have generally relied on one or more of the following four methods:\n(1) tabulating actuarial data; (2) obtaining ratings of institutional quality; (3) conducting student surveys; and (4) directly measuring student skills and knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Actuarial Data", "text": "Colleges routinely report various types of actuarial data, such as graduation rates, endowment level, student/faculty ratio, average admissions test scores, and the racial/ethnic composition of the student body. The advantages of such indices are that the data for them are relatively straightforward to collect and the resulting statistics can be compared over time and (with caution) across institutions. Although not intrinsic to the data themselves, the way in which the analyses are conducted typically assumes that a better quality educational institution (or a better quality educational experience) is associated with more and better resources-in this case, better funding, better faculty (which is defined as a higher percentage of any given cadre holding Ph.D.s), and better students as reflected by higher admissions selectivity (Astin, 1968 (Astin, , 1977 (Astin, , 1991 (Astin, , 1993 .\nActuarial data have been used by some states to measure institutional effectiveness (Gates et al., 2001) . They also have been used by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which include data on student enrollment, faculty ranks, and institutional expenditures. These national databases are large in scope, with some of the data coming from secondary sources-such as census counts and transcripts (NCHEMS, 1994) . Reviews of national data systems suggest that they yield little information about an institution's effectiveness in promoting student cognitive outcomes (Dey et al., 1997; National Postsecondary Education Cooperative, 2000a, b) ."}, {"section_title": "Ratings of Institutional Quality", "text": "Ratings of institutional quality are generated annually from surveys of college faculty and administrators, but also may include actuarial data such as selectivity, faculty resources, and financial resources. Although using multiple indicators and measures is consistent with the good assessment practice (e.g., see Astin, 1991; Ewell, 1984 Ewell, , 1988 Gentemann, Fletcher and Potter 1994; Halpern, 1987; Jacobi, Austin and Ayala, 1987; Ratcliff et al., 1997; Riggs and Worthley, 1992; Terenzini, 1989; Vandament, 1987) , college rankings (such as those produced by the U.S. News and World Report) have come under heavy fire, including from highly-rated institutions. For example, a 1997 report by the National Opinion Research Center (commissioned by U.S. News and World Report) was highly critical of the weighting scheme, the subjective nature of the ratings, and the role of reputations in the ranking. Additional problems have been noted by others (see Graham and Thompson, 2001; Klein and Hamilton, 1998; Machung, 1995; McGuire, 1995; Winter, McClelland and Stewart, 1981) ."}, {"section_title": "Student Surveys", "text": "Large-scale questionnaire surveys have been used to ask students about their collegiate experiences, satisfaction with their coursework and school, self-assessments of improvement in their academic abilities, and educational and employment plans (Astin, 1991; Ewell, 1987; Gill, 1993; Johnson et al., 1993; Lenning, 1988; Muffo and Bunda, 1993) . Interviews of individuals or groups also have been used (Johnson et al., 1993; Lenning, 1988; Smith et al., 1993) . The main advantage of these surveys is that they can gather a large amount of data economically about an institution (NCHEMS, 1994) . Survey results also have been used to assess and compare institutional effectiveness (Astin, 1993; Pace, 1990; Terenzini and Wright, 1987) .\nThere are three prominent examples of this approach. The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, based on the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, gathers information about education and work experiences after student completion of the bachelor's degree. The Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) survey, administered by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute (HERI), asks entering freshmen to report on activities, goals, and self. The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) carries on and extends this tradition by asking questions about features of college life that previous research has found to be associated with improved student performance (Kuh, 2001) . The limitation of these questionnaires for assessing student outcomes are inherent to any survey, such as whether students can accurately report how much their college experiences have improved their analytic and critical thinking skills."}, {"section_title": "Direct Assessments of Student Learning", "text": "A fourth approach to assessing the quality of an institution's educational programs measures student learning directly (Winter, McClelland, and Stewart, 1981) . Direct assessments may involve collecting data on course grades, evaluating student work products (e.g., portfolios), and administering various types of tests. An institution's faculty and staff typically conduct these efforts on their own students, although some institutions have collaborated in using the same measures to assess learning outcomes. The latter strategy allows institutions and policy makers to compare institutions (Obler, Slark and Umbdenstock, 1993; Bohr et al., 1994; and Pascarella et al., 1996) . A few states have required that all institutions use the same standardized multiple-choice tests to assess student knowledge, skills, and abilities (Cole, Nettles and Sharp, 1997; Naughton, Suen and Shavelson, 2003; NCHEMS, 1996; Steele and Lutz, 1995) . These methods have been used to collect data on individual students and on groups of students, at the program and at the institutional level (Ratcliff et al., 1991) .\nIn addition to the more commonly used paper and pencil examinations, direct assessments of students include portfolios (Banta et al., 1996; Black, 1993; Fong, 1988; Forrest, 1990; Hutchings, 1989; Johnson et al., 1993; Suen and Parkes, 1996; Waluconis, 1993 ) and on-demand performances, such as presentations, debates, dances, and musical recitals (Palomba and Banta, 1999) . Researchers disagree about the validity of such approaches. One such concern is the lack of standardization across tasks, another is the question of who actually did the work (which is not a problem for a student giving a recital but is an issue for term papers and other work products created outside of class), and still another is score reliability when the results are used to make decisions about individual students; although this may not be a major problem if the data are used to assess program effects (Johnson et al., 1993; Lenning, 1988) .\nCourse grades are an obvious choice as an outcome measure, but they are specific to individual professors. Course grades, then, are difficult to compare even across faculty within a school. They are even more difficult to compare across colleges because of large differences in admissions and grading standards. Finally, the current debate over grade inflation highlights the problem of using grades over time to monitor progress.\nThe shortcomings of these measures as indicators of learning outcomes have led some to suggest comparing colleges on how well their students do on graduate and professional school admissions tests and licensing exams (such as for teachers, accountants, and engineers). However, this approach is fraught with problems, such as concerns about the relevance of these measures to the goals of undergraduate programs, selection bias in who prepares for and takes these tests, and student motivation and related issues (which contributed to the Air Force Academy discontinuing its requirement that all of its graduating seniors take the GREs).\nOur approach to direct assessment takes a different tack. The tasks are all open-ended (rather than multiple-choice) and matrix-sampled within a college (i.e., each student takes only a few of the several different tests used) so that a wide range of tasks can be administered. This is done to reduce the response burden on individual students while still allowing coverage of a broad spectrum of areas."}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "The measures we are using fit within Shavelson and Huang's (2003) framework for conceptualizing, developing, and interpreting direct measures of students' learning. This framework utilized past research on cognition and human abilities (e.g., Gustafsson and Undheim, 1996; Martinez, 2000; Messick, 1984; Pellegrino, Chudowsky and Glaser, 2001) to characterize alternative ways of measuring college students' knowledge and learning.\nThere are at least three reasons why the Shavelson and Huang framework is useful for assessing higher education learning outcomes. First, and most importantly, it clarifies the constructs we are and are not measuring and the higher education goals associated with them. The framework, then, guides instrument construction/selection and interpretation. Second, the framework shows where our constructs fit within a 100-year history of efforts to assess student learning in higher education and what has been measured in the past. Third, some of the visions of student learning being proposed by others for higher education initially appear to be inconsistent and contradictory. The framework allows us to integrate and represent these visions.\nFollowing Shavelson and Huang, cognitive outcomes in higher education range from domain-specific knowledge acquisition to the most general of reasoning and problem-solving abilities, to what Spearman called general ability or simply ''G.'' (We refer to ''G'' to avoid antiquated interpretation of g as genetically determined; see Cronbach, 2000; Kyllonen and Shute, 1989; Messick, 1984; Snow and Lohman, 1989 ). Yet we know that learning is highly situated and context bound.\n1 Only through extensive engagement, practice and feedback in a domain does this knowledge, interacting with prior knowledge and experience, become increasingly decontextualized so that it transfers to enhance general reasoning, problem solving and decision making in a broad domain and later to multiple domains (e.g., Bransford, et al., 1999; Messick, 1984) .\nWhat is learned (and to what level it transfers) depends on the aptitudes and abilities that students bring with them from their prior education (in and out of school) and their natural endowments (e.g., Shavelson et al., 2002) . A useful framework for linking outcomes with assessments, then, must capture this recursive complexity. It must allow us to map the proposed tests onto the knowledge and abilities that are so highly valued as cognitive outcomes in higher education.\nAs shown in Table 1 , levels I-VI in the Shavelson and Huang framework move from ''abstract/process oriented'' at the top of the table to ''concrete content oriented'' abilities at the bottom. This ordering also corresponds to abilities that are based on ''inheritance interacting with accumulated experience'' to those based on ''direct experience.''\nGeneral abilities, such as verbal, quantitative and visual-spatial reasoning (see Carroll, 1993) , build on inherited capacities and typically develop over many years in formal and informal education settings. These abilities contribute to fluid intelligence (closely allied with ''G'' and indirectly related to prior learning from a wide range of experiences) and crystallized intelligence (closely allied with learning experiences). ''[F]luid intelligence is functionally manifest in novel situations in which prior experience does not provide sufficient direction, crystallized intelligence is the precipitate of prior experience and represents the massive contribution of culture to the intellect'' (Martinez, 2000, p. 19) . However, measures of crystallized, fluid, and general intelligence do not adequately reflect the incollege learning opportunities available to students. They are included in Table 1 for completeness only.\nShavelson and Huang acknowledged that their hierarchy oversimplifies. Knowledge and abilities are interdependent. Learning depends not only on instruction but also on the knowledge and abilities students bring to college. Indeed, instruction and abilities are likely to interact to produce learning, and the course of this interaction evolves over time so that different abilities are called forth and different learning tasks are needed in this evolution (Shavelson et al., 2002; Snow, 1994) . Thus, Table 1 does not behave in strict hierarchical fashion. It is intended to be heuristic, to provide a conceptual framework for discussing and developing learning measures. The research reported here focuses on levels III-VI of this framework and especially on the cusp between III and IV. By domain-specific knowledge, Shavelson and Huang were referring to knowledge of specific subjects, such as chemistry or history. This is the kind of knowledge we would expect to see assessed in students' learning within an academic major. Domain-specific knowledge corresponds to such valued outcomes of higher education (goals) as are typically labeled, ''learning high-tech skills'' or ''specific expertise and knowledge in chosen career.' ' Shavelson and Huang (2003) divided domain-specific knowledge into the following four types:declarative (''knowing that''), procedural (''knowing how''), schematic (''knowing why''), and strategic (''knowing when, where and how''-knowing when certain knowledge applies, where it applies, and how it applies).\nTests of domain knowledge are appropriate measures of student learning in a major and should be included in the assessment of student learning. Such tests may be published, such as the GRE's area tests. Yet the GRE tests are no longer widely used in most academic majors for a number of reasons including, among others, their fit with the department's particular definition of the major. We also know that students' knowledge in their academic majors is tested extensively by individual instructors and, in some cases, in a capstone course or by an integrated examination. We believe that capitalizing on the availability of such tests provides an opportunity to assess domain-specific knowledge in context. We plan to explore some simple, straightforward ways of doing this, such as by using a pretest, intermediary, and final exams in core (or capstone) courses in the major to examine gain-score effect sizes with and without adjusting for SAT (or ACT) scores.\nBroad abilities are complexes of cognitive processes (''thinking'') that underlie verbal, quantitative and spatial reasoning, comprehending, problem solving and decision making in a domain, and more generally across domains. These abilities are developed well into adulthood through learning in and transfer from non-school as well as school experiences, repeated exercise of domain-specific knowledge in conjunction with prior learning and previously established general reasoning abilities. As the tasks become increasingly broad-moving from a knowledge domain to a field such as social science, to broad everyday problems-general abilities exercise greater influence over performance than do knowledge structures and domain-specific abilities. Many of the valued outcomes of higher education are associated with the development of these broad abilities. For example, two important goals identified in the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education's (Immerwahl, 2000) survey were ''improved problem solving and thinking ability,'' and ''top-notch writing and speaking.'' Assessments of learning currently in vogue, as well as some assessments developed in the mid-20th century, tap into these broad abilities. Most have focused primarily at the level of the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The science area score falls between domain specific knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Other tests are more generic, focusing on critical writing and reasoning. Some examples are the GRE's Analytic writing prompts, the College-BASE, the Academic Profile, CAAP, UAP Field Tests, and the 90-minute tasks used in this study. Indeed, many tests of broad abilities contain both area (e.g., sciences) and general reasoning and writing tests.\nACT and the Educational Testing Service have both offered ''general education'' measures in reading, writing, and mathematics, such as for ''rising junior'' exams. While few would argue against college students being proficient in these areas, there is little evidence that scores on such measures are sensitive to the effects of different types of college level programs. For example, 23 institutions participated in perhaps the most comprehensive longitudinal study of learning at the college level to date (Pascarella et al., 1996) . This study ''found little evidence to suggest that attending an academically selective four-year institution had much impact on growth in critical-thinking skills during the first three years of college'' (Pascarella, 2001, p. 22) .\nA cross-sectional study at 56 institutions found that most of the improvement in skills occurs in the first two years of college (Flowers, et al., 2001 ). However, both the Pascarella et al. and the Flowers et al. studies relied on multiple-choice tests of general education skills.\nThere were no openended measures (even in writing) and the tests they used did not ask students to apply their abilities to realistic and inherently engaging complex tasks."}, {"section_title": "INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING DIRECT MEASURES", "text": "This section describes the procedures we used and the results obtained in our initial exploration of the feasibility and utility of using open-ended direct measures of student learning. Specifically, we examined whether measures that were designed to be more aligned with the abilities that colleges say they are trying to develop (and focused on levels III through V in the conceptual framework) could be administered efficiently, whether the responses to these tasks could be scored consistently, whether the scores on them were reliable enough across tasks to have confidence in the school level results, whether those scores were related to years in college and possible differences in programs across institutions, and whether the tasks were engaging enough to motivate students to try their best on them.

For example, some schools offered participation to all students and then took the first 25-30 who applied in each class whereas others used a sophisticated stratified random sampling procedure. Participation was optional at all campuses. Thus, it is not appropriate to report or compare individual school means (nor was it ever our intention or need to do so)."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "The GRE prompts described below were used at six colleges.

Our goal was to examine the utility of these measures when the institution rather than the student is the primary unit of analysis.\nWe found that student answers on our measures can be scored very reliably. This was true for both the 90-minute tasks and the GRE prompts. The .78 correlation between the hand and computer scoring of a pair of a student's answers to the GRE prompts and the .84 correlation between these two scoring methods on a 90-minute task were impressive. More importantly, the near perfect correlation between these scoring methods when the school is used as the unit of analysis suggests that in the future we can rely on machine scoring for school-level analyses. This would result in a significant reduction in scoring time and costs. For example, the cost for one person to grade the response to a single GRE writing prompt is about $2.50, but about $1.00 for the computer grading. The computer also is much faster for reporting scores. Our results further suggest that a 3-hour test battery consisting of one 90-minute performance task and the two types of GRE prompts would yield total scores that were sufficiently reliable for school-level analyses. This conclusion is consistent with our finding statistically significant Erwin and Schrell, 2003) could pose a problem if the goal was to treat these tasks as parallel forms of the same test or to use the scores on a single task to make important decisions about individual students. However, score reliability was more than adequate for the purposes of reporting results for colleges. Moreover, by using the matrix sampling approach utilized in this study, institutions can measure critical thinking and writing skills across a much broader spectrum of academic disciplines than would be feasible with a single task.\nFinally, our cross-sectional analyses found that student performance on our measures was related to grades in college and after controlling on SAT scores, mean scores increased consistently from freshman to senior class. These findings suggest that our measures are sensitive to student learning over time. However, as is true of any large-scale assessment (e.g., NAEP), we cannot say whether this improvement was due to college experience, some other experience, maturation, or some combination of these or other factors, although the first attribution seems most plausible. Similarly, unmeasured variables (such as differences in student motivation across colleges) may have contributed to the school effects we observed (see McCaffrey et al., 2003 for a discussion of the limitations of value added analyses). Nevertheless, given the increasing pressure to hold colleges accountable, it would be better to evaluate colleges on the basis of an imperfect measure of student learning than on indicators that have little or no relationship with grades.\nOne of the major challenges to scaling up the approach used in this study is finding effective ways to motivate students to participate. We paid the students in this research, but that is not feasible for a large-scale assessment program. It also raises concern about possible sample selection bias. An operational program would therefore have to embed the measures in capstone courses or all students would have to take them to satisfy graduation requirements. In the focus groups that were held after the test sessions, students reported that the intrinsically interesting nature of the tasks encouraged them to try their best, so motivating them to do well may be less of a challenge than getting them to take the measures."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS", "text": "This study describes the results with a promising set of cognitive assessment tools that can be used to measure general as distinct from domain-specific reasoning and writing abilities that are valued as outcomes of college attendance. These open-ended measures can be administered in a few hours and scored reliably. A machine can even grade some and perhaps eventually all of the answers. This makes these measures very efficient relative to other outcomes assessment batteries. The measures appear to assess important abilities that are applicable across major fields. In addition, the scores on them appear to be sensitive to between-institution effects. Such findings are rare in the higher education research literature (Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991) . These instruments may also prove useful for benchmarking purposes if future studies with larger numbers of institutions replicate our findings of statistically significant between-institution effects.\nOne of our next steps will be to investigate how scores on the outcome measures used in this research relate to engagement and participation measures at both the student and school levels. This will allow us to estimate the extent to which those practices that the literature espouses to be educationally effective (Chickering and Gamson, 1987; Kuh, 2001 Kuh, , 2003 translate into cognitive payoffs. With data from enough colleges and universities it also may be possible to develop residual models, whereby we can compare how particular institutions or types of colleges actually score with how they would be predicted to score, given the nature of their students and institutional characteristics. This would open up a potentially instructive approach to measuring institutional effectiveness. In addition, combining these value-added measures with other information about students (e.g., NSSE) and institutions will allow us to learn much more about the impact of college on student learning as well as the kinds of educational experiences that contribute to desired college outcomes.\nFinally, we found that the measures we used produced reasonably reliable student-level scores that correlated as highly with GPAs as did SAT scores. Future studies with larger and more representative samples of institutions and students may therefore find a role for such measures in the college admissions process (see Klein et al., 2004 for a discussion of this topic). Indeed, some of the prompts we used are already an integral part of the GRE and the Graduate Management Admissions Test."}, {"section_title": "ENDNOTES", "text": "1. There are multiple theories of intelligence with Spearman at one extreme postulating a single undifferentiated general intelligence and at the other Guilford postulating 128 abilities and Gardner postulating different, independent intelligences. Shavelson and Huang do not intend to resolve this dispute (but see Carroll, 1993 or Gustoffson, 1996 for recent treatments). Rather, their intent is heuristic, providing a framework in which to locate debates and achievement tests that have been used in the past to assess student learning. 2. See Carini et al.
