[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not unitary as heterogeneity exists in the disease's clinical and anatomical characteristics. MRI studies have revealed that heterogeneous grey matter atrophy patterns are associated with specific traits of cognitive decline. Although white matter (WM) impairment also contributes to AD pathology, its heterogeneity remains unclear. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method is a suitable framework to study heterogeneity and allows to identify latent impairment factors of AD instead of simply mapping an overall disease effect. By exploring whole brain WM skeleton images by using LDA, three latent factors were revealed in AD: a temporal-frontal impairment factor (temporal and frontal lobes, especially hippocampus and para-hippocampus), a parietal factor (parietal lobe, especially precuneus), and a long fibre bundle factor (corpus callosum and superior longitudinal fasciculus). As revealed by longitudinal analysis, the latent factors have distinct impact on cognitive decline: for executive function (EF), the temporal-frontal factor was more strongly associated with baseline EF co mpared with the parietal factor, while the long-fibre bundle factor was most associated with decline rate of EF; for memory, the three factors showed almost equal effect on the baseline memory and decline rate. For each participant, LDA estimates his/her composition profile of latent impairment factors, which indicates disease subtype. We also found that the APOE genotype affects the AD subtype. Specifically, APOE \u03b54 was more associated with the long fibre bundle factor and APOE \u03b52 was more associated with temporal-frontal factor.

Although memory loss is the primary symptom, AD patients manifest heterogeneous cognitive profiles, i.e., each individual could express different extents of decline in memory, executive skills, language, and perceptuospatial abilities [1] [2] [3] , which complicate the diagnosis. Hence, there is a pressing need to identify AD subtypes for improving diagnosis accuracy and monitor disease progression.\nAD is a complex neurodegenerative disease in that pathological and structural heterogeneity is constantly observed in AD [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . For example, neuropathological studies found that 25-30% of the AD cases had untypical distributions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and exhibited different rates of disease progression compared with typical AD cases [10] [11] [12] . MRI studies reported that 10-30% of the AD patients exhibited untypical hippocampal atrophy [13] [14] [15] . Moreover, a recent MRI study suggested that the varying patterns of the whole brain grey matter (GM) atrophy were associated with distinct trajectories of multidomain cognitive decline in AD [16] [17] [18] .\nWhite matter (WM) impairment also contributes to AD pathology [19, 20] and can be detected even before the development of cortical atrophy in at-risk and heathy participants [20, 21] . Most WM studies on AD assumed a single disease effect that charts only the overall associations between WM changes and cognition decline in AD [22, 23] . One study reported that WM impairment in AD was associated with impairment in different cognitive domains [24] . A recent study assessed WM impairment in typical and atypical AD and identified syndrome-specific patterns of WM microstructure breakdown [25] . Inspired by these findings, we hypothesize that heteroge neity exists in WM impairment in AD, which could explain the variations of multidomain cognitive decline among participants across the disease spectrum.\nIn this work, we explored the heterogeneity of WM impairment in AD by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify multiple latent disease factors from WM skeletons constructed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data [16, 26] . LDA provides a probabilistic description of multiple impairment factors. For example, concerning patient A, the WM impairment pattern might be 70% owing to factor 1 and 30% to factor 2; while concerning patient B, the impairment might be 20% owing to factor 1 and 80% to factor 2. It remains an open question whether subtypes, which manifest heterogeneity in AD cases, are exclusive or mixing up in an individual. LDA explores the mixed effects of multiple latent factors in a probabilistic framework and is therefore well suited for studying heterogeneity in AD.\nAD develops slowly from a preclinical phase and the pathophysiological changes start about a decade before the final diagnosis [27] . In this work, we found that heterogeneity of WM impairment already appears before clinical syndromes are fully expressed. We revealed the association between the WM impairment factors and the cognitive decline in participants throughout the disease spectrum. In addition, we verified A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T that the genotype was associated with the latent factors, i.e., APOE \u03b54 was most strongly associated with the long fibre bundle factor and APOE \u03b52 was more associated with temporal-frontal factor. Our work provides insights into disease heterogeneity in brain white matter throughout the prolonged course of AD, sheds light on the association between the genotype and the disease subtype, and facilitates precision medicine."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "We performed the following analyses on fractional anisotropy (FA) maps derived from DTI scans, which measure WM integrity.

The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership and led by Principle Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to examine whether structural MRI, functional MRI, DTI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD (up-to-date information is at www.adni-info.org).\nOur work was based on ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO (extracted on April 08, 2018), and enrolled all the available participants having both corrected FA images and structural MRI images of good quality. As listed in Table 1 , this study included 232 participants at baseline, comprised of 48 AD patients, 90 EMCI, 44 LMCI and 50 NC.

Based on the derived latent factors, individual factor composition was inferred for every participant. With the factor composition profiles (at 893 time-points) quantified by the LDA framework, we delved into further statistical analysis to reveal the associations between latent impairment factors and cognition and APOE genotype."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "For neuropsychological data, memory (ADNI-Mem) [28] and executive function (ADNI-EF) [29] scores were explored. For genotype data, APOE \u03b54 and APOE \u03b52 were considered. 170 participants at baseline have genotype information available, which were used to explore genotype effects on disease subtypes (i.e. latent factor compositions). \nwas originally proposed to discover latent topics in a set of text documents. In the brain imaging scenario, each participant's WM image is a collection of voxels, and each voxel is associated with a subset within total K impairment factors; this is analogous to text analysis in that a document is collection of words, and each word is associated with a subset within total K latent topics. Each latent impairment factor is represented by a probability distribution over all WM voxels ( | ), which can be visualized as a probabilistic impairment map overlaid on the FSL MNI152 FA skeleton template ( Fig.2 ). Each AD patient expresses multiple WM impairment factors to different extents and ( | ) denotes the composition of impairment factors expressed by a patient.\nAs LDA works on discrete data, the continuous FA maps need to be discretized by mapping greater WM impairment to a larger positive integer. Specifically, FA values were first log-transformed to make data better conform to normality, and then ztransformed (with respect to NC baseline scans) for each AD patient at baseline. A score below zero at a given voxel of a particular participant is an indication of degeneration relative to the NC participants. Z scores above zero suggest unimpaired voxels and were set to zero. The z scores were discretized by multiplying by -10 and rounding to the nearest integer. Larger positive values imply more severe impairment.\nFor a specified number of WM impairment factors, LDA analysis was performed on the transformed FA images of AD patients to identify latent factors and infer factor compositions. Specifically, the probabilistic distributions ( | ) of WM impairment, estimated from AD patients were used to infer factor compositions ( | ) of individual participants. The factor composition of a participant can be visualized as a point inside the factor space (e.g., = 3 is represented by a triangle) as shown in Fig.4 . The factor composition represents a subtype of AD.\nMoreover, the robustness of LDA were also evaluated on two aspects (SI Appendix). First, the stableness of identified latent factors across different initializations was investigated. For each , the LDA algorithm was run for 20 times with random initializations. We observed that different random initializations led to almost identical solutions, suggesting that the identified latent factors are robust across different runs. The run with the highest data likelihood (indicating the model b est fits the data) was selected as the optimal factor decomposition of the current . Second, the spatial consistency of two sets of latent factors identified by LDA with different 's was investigated. The spatial consistency of latent factors is defined as the situation that latent factors reside in approximately the same brain regions regardless of a particular value. For in candidate sets of {2, 3, \u2026 ,6} [31] , we observed that the identified latent factors were robust across different 's (SI Appendix, Fig.S1 ).\n\nThree impairment factors were the temporal-frontal factor, the parietal factor, and the long fibre bundle factor.\nThe number of impairment factors is a free parameter in the LDA model. We first qualitatively inspected how the estimated factors ( | ) changed as was varied from 2 to 4. The impairment factors were spatially consistent (Section 2.3) for all = 2 to 4 ( Fig.2) . Specifically, the = 2 model revealed an impairment factor throughout cortical regions, which included temporal regions (para-hippocampal WM and temporal WM), frontal and parietal WM, and another long fibre bundle factor that spreads over corpus callosum and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The = 3 model revealed a similar long fibre bundle factor, whereas the cortical factor split into a parietal factor with WM impairment mainly in parietal lobe and a temporal-frontal factor associated with extensive WM impairment in para-hippocampus gyrus, temporal lobe and frontal lobe. The = 4 model revealed three latent factors similar with the = 3 model, as well as a redundant factor that spanned over the brain regions identified by the other three factors. A closer inspection revealed that the redundant factor was a mixture of the other three factors, and thus did not provide any new insight into susceptible WM tissues. In addition, when further increased, more redundant factors were observed. To summarize, the latent impairment factors were spatially consistent as was varied (Fig.2,  Fig.S1 ); whereas redundant factors appeared when increased from 3 to 4 or more. We further quantitatively evaluated the spatial separation among individual latent factors within each LDA model of a particular . As visually seen in Fig.3, = 3 \nachieved the largest spatial separation between latent factors. Therefore, = 3 was selected as the best number of latent factors on this data. Notably, our findings are consistent with previous AD subtype studies in terms of the number of subtypes. For example, Murray's study revealed three AD subtypes, which is based on neuropathologcial evidence [10] . In addition, other previous studies based on structural MRI also reported three distinct patterns of GM atrophy [16, 17] and NFT changes [12] .\nIn addition, among the 48 AD patients, 38 had their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid data available and 35 of 38 patients were A\u03b2+ (CSF amyloid concentration < 192 pg/mL). We performed LDA on the 35 A\u03b2+ AD dementia patients alone and compared the WM impairment factors with those derived using all 48 AD patients (SI Appendix Fig.S2 ). The WM impairment factors obtained under the two settings (48 AD vs. 35 A\u03b2+ AD) were almost identical, with an average correlation = 0.95 . Considering such a high similarity, we used the factors derived from the larger sample for further analysis.\nrepresent pure factors; a closer distance to a corner indicates a higher probability to the respective factor. As can be seen, most participants express multiple factors, and NC participants are clustered more closely than AD patients, indicating the heterogeneity of AD.\nTo investigate whether the expression of impairment factors changed over the progression of AD, we compared the factor compositions of participants who had both the baseline scan and the 12-month follow-up scan available. As shown in Fig.5 , the factor probabilities were highly consistent ( > 0.96 across all the three factors), indicating that the factor compositions remained stable over the disease progression (for time-points at 3/6/24 months, see SI Appendix Table S1 ). This result is in accordance with earlier study on GM, which reported that the atrophy factor compositions were stable after two years [16] . This finding further supports that the impairment factors represents different impairment subtypes instead of different disease stages.\nparietal factor ( = 0.02); the long fibre bundle factor was significantly more associated with the EF decline rate compared with the temporal-frontal factor ( = 0.009), and tended to be more associated with the EF decline rate than the parietal factor ( = 0.08). For memory (Table 2B) , the three factors were almost equally associated with baseline memory and decline rate across the disease spectrum. The long fiber bundle factor tended to be more associated with memory decline rate than the parietal factor in AD patients ( = 0.07). Our findings suggest that latent factors have distinct effects on diffe rent cognitive domains.\nThird, we evaluated whether incorporating factor compositions could lead to better modelling of longitudinal effects on cognition. ANOVA analysis was performed to compare the latent factor based model and the traditional model in distinct cognitive domains. We found that the latent factor compositions significantly contributed to better prediction of EF ( = 0.01) while had no significant effect on memory prediction ( = 0.48). These results comply with the aforementioned findings (in Table 2 ) and show that by enrolling subtype information (through latent factor composition), longitudinal changes can be predicted with higher sensitivity in specific cognition domains. +0.19 (0.10) p = 0.07 $ denotes the temporal-frontal factor, the parietal factor, and the long fibre bundle factor. For example, the second row suggests that participants expressing more temporal-frontal factor has higher baseline executive function than those expressing more long-fiber bundle factor. Significant comparisons are highlighted in bold.\n\noperations [38] [39] [40] . The long fibre bundle factor was associated with the WM impairment in splenium and the body of corpus callosum (CC) and SLF. The splenium of CC predominantly connects the temporal lobe and the occipital lobe between the two hemispheres. The SLF is an association fibre tract that contains three separate components [41] . SLF II (Table S2) , the major component of SLF, connects the caudalinferior parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and serves to transmit working memory in the prefrontal cortex to provide the parietal cortex with information to regulate spatial attention and retrieval of spatial information [42] .\nAccumulating evidence suggests that structural and histological changes in AD are heterogeneous. For example, heterogeneity in cortical atrophy has been evinced by using structural MRI [16] [17] [18] and heterogeneity in NFT distributions has been demonstrated from thioflavinS fluorescent microscopy [10] . While a few studies have investigated the heterogeneous white matter alterations in AD, using DTI data [24, 43] , to our best knowledge, this is the first study that employ latent factor decomposition on white matter impairment to profile subtypes of AD. By referring to the field knowledge, we can interpret a particular WM impairment factor and how it may be associated with various cognitive domains. However, it is hard to make direct comparison with earlier subtype studies which were mostly based on GM atrophy. We could see rough spatial correspondence between WM impairment factors and GM atrophy factors identified in earlier studies. For example, a recent GM atrophy study identified three subtypes: the parietal predominant subtype that roughly correspond to our parietal WM impairment factor, the medial temporal predominant subtype that roughly correspond to our temporal-frontal factor, and the diffuse atrophy subtype that roughly corresponds to the long fibre bundle factor [18] . Yet such correspondence is not strict due to the tissue difference and should be interpreted with caution. Secondary degeneration of WM, as a result of cortical atrophy, may contribute to the observed rough spatial correspondence. Furthermore, we identified GM atrophy factors based on the structural MRI data of the same dataset (SI Appendix, Fig.S5 ), which also showed no exact one-to-one correspondence with the WM impairment factors. This further illustrates that despite partly as a secondary effect of cortical atrophy, WM impairment still provides unique information on AD. Previous study on ADNI dataset also testified that DTI provides unique information about cognition instead of merely recapitulations of established association between other biomarkers of AD (e.g. hippocampus volume) [44] . Accordingly, WM impairment factors uniquely contribute to portraying subtypes of AD. As future work, one can probe AD subtypes by simultaneously considering GM atrophy and WM impairment.\narises: was the observed heterogeneity attributed to disease stages, or disease expressions, i.e., subtypes [46, 47] ?\nTo address this question, we investigated whether that factor compositions were stable after 3/6/12 months ( Fig.5 , SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig.S6 ). If the disease stages hypothesis stands, a hypothetical individual would express more cortical factor after 12 months, which is not supported by our results. As the factor compositions were stable as the disease progresses, we can conclude that the heterogeneity in WM degeneration is primarily due to the disease subtypes. Our result complies with an earlier AD subtype study that reported stable GM atrophy factor across disease stages [16] .\nbased on the same dataset, revealed that the long fibre bundle factor was more associated with EF decline rate than the other two latent WM impairment factors. Our findings suggested that by differentiating the subtypes of AD, we could achieve a finer view in interpreting the data. Our work corresponds with earlier cross-sectional studies [50, 51] and expands the longitudinal study [44] by illustrating the effect of latent factors on longitudinal cognitive decline of multi-domain.\n"}, {"section_title": "Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS)", "text": "DTI scans help us understand the regional basis of white matter tissue degeneration in clinical conditions.

Earlier work demonstrated that changes in parahippocampal region may result in isolation of the hippocampus, which contribute to impairment in memory [35] ; The frontal lobe regions ha ve been suggested to associate with executive function [36, 37] . The parietal factor was associated with the impairment in precuneus and parietal lobe. The precuneus has been associated with retrieval of episodic memory and self-processing"}, {"section_title": "Factor compositions were stable as the disease progresses", "text": "The LDA method in the Bayesian framework treats AD cases as entities with mixed membership of one or multiple factors, and allows each participant to exhibit his/her own unique factor composition. For a hypothetical patient, his/her factor composition profile could be portrayed as expressing 60% the temporal-frontal factor, 20% the parietal factor and 10% the long fibre bundle factor. Such probabilistic factor composition extends previous approaches that classified patients into distinct subtypes [12, 45] , and makes it more feasible to study how the heterogeneity of WM impairment was associated with variance in cognitive decline in distinct cognition domain. However, a natural question"}, {"section_title": "Factors reflect distinct association with longitudinal cognitive decline", "text": "Our work revealed that distinct WM impairment factors were associated with different cognition domains differently as the disease progressed ( Table 2 ).\nExecutive function includes higher-order cognitive processes such as shifting attention, cognitive flexibility, cognitive fluency, working memory, planning and organization. The temporal-frontal factor showed more association with baseline EF compared with the parietal factor. This finding was in line with earlier work that reported that frontal lobe brain regions were associated with executive function [36, 37] , and the frontal-parietal network has been implicated in facilitating the integration and control of executive processes [48] . The long fibre bundle factor was more associated with EF decline rate compared with the temporal-frontal factor ( = 0.009), and was inclined to be more associated with EF decline rate than the parietal factor ( = 0.08). By looking into the long fiber bundle factor, the largest commissural tract CC predominantly connects the temporal lobe and the occipital lobe between the two hemispheres; the association fibre tract SLF connects the caudal-inferior parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The prior knowledge that CC and SLF serve to transmit working memory in the prefrontal cortex and to provide the parietal cortex with information for regulating spatial attention and retrieval of spatial information [42] , partially supports our discovery that the long fiber bundle factor was most associated with to EF decline rate in AD.\nFor memory, the three factors contribute equally to the memory decline in each group. Also, as illustrated in section 4.1, the temporal-frontal factor involve WM in hippocampus and temporal lobe, the most well-known brain regions related with memory [35] ; the parietal factor includes the precuneus and parietal lobe WM that is related with episodic memory retrieval [38] [39] [40] ; the long fibre bundle factor includes CC and SLF, which are related with visual memory [42, 49] . We can assume that the three factors are all associated with memory decline, yet further studies are necessary to examine whether a dominant factor exists by using a larger data set.\nConcerning previous DTI studies on the same ADNI dataset, though cross-sectional studies [50, 51] showed the association between WM impairment measured by DTI metrics and executive function decline, yet longitudinal study [44] suggested the insensitivity of DTI metrics to reveal the changing rate of cognitive decline. Our study,"}, {"section_title": "APOE genotype was associated with latent factors", "text": "Since disease subtypes may have genetic origins, we investigated whether risk genes are associated with latent impairment factors. APOE has been the best-established genetic risk factor, which associated with structural and functional changes in the elderly and AD patients [33, 34] . The major role of apoE protein in the brain is to transport lipid components that facilitate the shaping of the myelin sheath [52, 53] , thus affecting WM integrity [54] . In this study, we found APOE \u03b54 was most associated with the long-fibre bundle factor, while APOE \u03b52 was more associated with the temporalfrontal factor compared with the parietal factor (Table 3 ). Our work lends support to the hypothesis that the APOE genotype modulates the phenotype of AD through influences on specific largescale brain networks [55] .\nRevisiting the discoveries in LME analysis, the baseline executive function was more associated with temporal-frontal factor compared with the parietal factor, while APOE \u03b52 was also more associated temporal-frontal factor compared with the parietal factor ( Table  2-3 ). In addition, the EF decline rate was most associated with the long fiber bundle factor, while APOE \u03b54 was also most associated with the long fiber bundle factor. Such consistency suggested that our work moved one more step towards dissociating the links between gene, brain structure and cognition. More inspiringly, assume a hypothetical patient with APOE \u03b54/\u03b54 (two \u03b54 alleles), we could expect a higher chance of expressing more long fibre bundle factor and faster EF decline. Similarly, a hypothetical patient with APOE \u03b52/\u03b52 (two \u03b52 alleles) could expect a higher chance of expressing more temporalfrontal factor compared with the parietal factor, as well as higher baseline EF scores.\nTo summarize, variation in genotypes of patients were associated with expressions of WM impairment factors (i.e., subtypes), which would manifest in features of cognitive decline. By looking such association, we could take one-step forward to precision medicine."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "AD dementia is a heterogeneous disease in that the origins and spread of the disease may differ substantially between different subtypes. Earlier work explored the subtypes, using neurological scores [2] , the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles [10] , and cortical atrophy [16] [17] [18] . Along this line of research, our work demonstrated that the patterns of WM impairment could also be used to portray AD subtypes. The probabilistic profiles of subtypes, portrayed in the LDA framework, were associated with distinct trajectories of First, the pathological basis of these WM impairment factors is still obscure. A recent study suggested that myelin and oligodxendrocytes are especially vulnerable to amyloid pathology [56] . Further studies are needed to address the characterisation of AD subtypes using other biomarkers, e.g. white matter hyper-intensity, amyloid and tau immunohistochemistry, which may lead to a better understanding of AD heterogeneity and further facilitate early diagnosis and the monitoring of AD progression [13, 57] .\nSecond, pathological findings from autopsied cases provide the golden standard for revealing structural heterogeneity as such studies represent advanced stages of AD. However, for degeneration at the early disease stages, we have been unable to find a well-recognized reference to evaluate the structural heterogeneity findings. In addition, it is hard to make direct comparisons between neuropathologically defined subtypes, GM atrophy defined subtypes and WM impairment defined subtypes, especially as these observations were based on different participants and different analysis protocols. For this study, we presented our subtype observations on DTI data under the LDA framework, which could serve as a reference for clinicians and pathologist to unveil the broader picture of subtypes in AD.\nThird, to simplify the analysis pipeline and increase reproducibility of this study, we used preprocessed images by ADNI where the corrected FA images provided the largest sample set. Therefore, we used FA measure for this study. As an initial trial to probe subtypes using DTI, this work has ignored other DTI metrics that characterize the same underlying microstructures from different aspects. For example, mean diffusivity (MD) was used as widely as FA to map white matter changes in AD; radial diffusivity, and axonal diffusivity gained more popularity as DTI markers of axonal and myeline damage, respectively [22, 58] . Moreover, though FA has been widely used, it was suggested that FA does not always correlate well with the actual individual fiber anisotropy and maybe sub-optimal in detecting disease processes that affect myelination [59] . Future subtyping studies based on DTI may benefit from looking into other diffusion meas ures that provide more information in the diffusion profile. Moreover, as a previous study [60] suggested, joint analysis of the diffusion measures could be more powerful in characterizing histopathology and provide information about disease progresses not available through examination of any measure in isolation. Future DTI studies may benefit from such multivariate method for joint analysis of diffusion measures.\nFinally, our study utilized the DTI images of ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 dataset, in which the enrolled patients were followed up for no more than 5 years. As ADNI is still collecting more longitudinal data, future studies may benefit from enriched data resources and yield more statistically reliable analytical results. Also, as a study based on DTI data, this study has limitations inherent in DTI. More advanced imaging and modelling techniques, such as high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), can resolve more complex diffusion geometries and further facilitate finer portrait of regional tissue impairment that would lead to more accurate subtype profiles."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "By identifying latent WM impairment factors with LDA, our work lends support to the growing belief that AD is heterogeneous rather than a single disease entity. We identified three impairment factors: the temporal-frontal factor, the parietal factor and the long fibre bundle factor. These factors were associated with distinct decline trajectories of memory and executive function across the full course of AD. Moreover, individual participant could express multiple WM impairment factors to different degrees. The heterogeneous factor compositions among participants were associated with different genotypes and can facilitate predicting individual-level cognition and contribute to precision medicine. "}]
