Results: Atrophy rate of 3 specific neocortical regions, lateral frontal, lateral parietal, and anterior cingulate gyrus, was significantly associated with the onset of psychosis including delusions, agitation, wandering, and hallucinations and/or the need for chronic antipsychotic medications. Atrophy rate of the lateral frontal lobe correlated most significantly with onset of psychotic symptoms or need for chronic antipsychotic medications.

This allows for accurate prediction of cognitive decline based on volumetric analyses of specific brain regions. 8 Frontal lobe atrophy has been associated with the onset of psychosis in schizophrenia 9, 10 and has also been associated with the emergence of psychosis in frontotemporal dementia. 11 Psychotic symptoms are correlated with metabolic and perfusion abnormalities in frontal and parietal neocortex in AD. [12] [13] [14] However, longitudinal data on structural correlates to the emergence of psychosis have not been described in the AD literature. Such structural neuroimaging is more readily available than perfusion or metabolic studies of brain function and may represent a practical approach to quantify such changes in the AD brain.\nIn this article, we looked at longitudinal data from 389 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD to investigate whether regional neocortical atrophy is associated with psychotic symptoms as identified by reporting of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and worsening scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) or the reported need for chronic antipsychotic medications."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Population", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a US$60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI was to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco. The ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and patients have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, aged 55 to 90 years, to participate in the research, approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nBriefly, screening criteria for entry into the study included the Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. All participants were recruited between the age of 55 and 90 years and had at least 6 years of formal education. After the baseline visit, subsequent visits occurred at 6-month or 12-month intervals.

A quality control center was designated to exclude scans with serious motion artifacts. The images were downloaded from the public ADNI Web site (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/index. shtml) and, locally, MRI data were reviewed for quality, automatically corrected for spatial distortion due to gradient nonlinearity 16 and B 1 field inhomogeneity, 17 and registered, and the 2 volumes per patient were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Neocortical surface reconstruction 18, 19 and parcellation 20 were performed using a locally optimized version of the FreeSurfer software package (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to obtain neocortical regions of interest (ROIs). 20 Evaluation of Longitudinal Change on Structural MRI. All image processing and analyses occurred at the Multimodal Imaging Laboratory at the University of California, San Diego. Longitudinal change was quantified using a recently developed automated image analysis methodology. 21, 22 Briefly, to obtain 12-month change, follow-up images were fully affineregistered to the baseline images and corrected for intensity nonuniformity. Nonlinear registration was then used to align voxel centers in the baseline with the appropriate location in the follow-up scans, and a volume-change field was calculated. This field was averaged over each FreeSurfer-derived ROI to compute the percentage change from baseline. The volumechange field within this ROI allows an estimation of the atrophy that has occurred in the interim. Because the ROI was derived from the baseline neocortical parcellation, its extent is unchanged between scans, and neocortical thinning is the primary basis of the measured volume change. This method has been validated to be inverse consistent 22 using scan-rescan data and validated for accuracy using models where amount of change was known and where noise was added to approximate that seen in human brain imaging of patients with dementia.\nConsolidation of MRI Data.

Specifically, all but the entorhinal and posterior cingulate regions showed significantly greater atrophy in the group with psychotic symptoms and/or antipsychotic medication use (all P values < .05). It should be noted that although the groups had dissimilar sample size, 6 of the 7 comparisons showed homogeneity of variance according to the Levene's test for equality of variances. For the sixth (lateral parietal), an adjusted P value was calculated and interpreted.\nAs mentioned before, the authors wanted to control for variance potentially associated with preexisting cognitive differences. Therefore, a linear ANCOVA was calculated to test group differences on each of the 7 ROIs. The covariate was ADAS-cog performance from the screening visit. Of the 7 ROIs, 2 (lateral frontal and lateral parietal) showed significant between-group differences (P < .001 and P \u00bc .018, respectively).

Of the 7 ROIs, 4 showed a statistically significant relationship between the number of E4 alleles and change in neocortical volume. Greater loss at 1 year in the entorhinal, lateral occipital, lateral parietal, and posterior cingulate regions was associated with having a greater number of E4 alleles (all P values < .01).\nBased upon these results regarding APOE4 status, a set of 7 multiple linear regressions were conducted, each to predict 1-year change in 1 of the 7 aforementioned ROIs. The regression factors entered simultaneously were age, ADAS-cog from screening, number of APOE4 alleles, sex, and group (psychosis AEs and/or antipsychotic medications vs no psychosis AEs or antipsychotic medications). The results of these analyses were consistent with what was seen with the aforementioned ANCOVA analyses. In predicting lateral frontal change at 1-year postbaseline, all of the aforementioned factors except APOE emerged as statistically significant factors, including group (all P values < .05). In predicting lateral parietal change at 1-year postbaseline, all of the aforementioned factors emerged as statistically significant factors, including group (all P values < .05).

We found a significant relationship between accelerated atrophy in the lateral frontal lobe and lateral parietal lobe with either reported neuropsychiatric symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, wandering, and agitation or the need for chronic medication to treat such symptoms.\nPrevious work has demonstrated that atrophy of the frontal lobe is linked to behavioral changes including the onset of psychotic symptoms. 25 In addition, a meta-analysis of studies in patients with psychosis demonstrated reduced neural activation in areas within the left frontal lobe and the left anterior cingulate gyrus. 26 Previous single-photon emission computed tomography data demonstrated lower perfusion in the left dorsolateral frontal and left anterior cingulate gyrus in patients with AD with psychotic symptoms. 27 In this study, we also found that greater atrophy of the anterior cingulate gyrus correlated with an increase in NPI scores for both hallucinations and delusions, respectively. The anterior cingulate gyrus and frontal regions are, in fact, part of a well-known corticosubcortical network, which is involved in the control of complex human behaviors. The anterior cingulate gyrus represents a key structure of a network connecting several association areas involved in behavior. 28 The most specific function of the cingulate gyrus is the regulation of intentional and motivated behaviors. 29 The frontal gyri are implicated in executive functions (ie, planning, attention, strategy, problem solving, and judgment). Disinhibition and related psychiatric symptoms have been clearly demonstrated in patients with disruption of these circuits, most notably in the frontotemporal dementias. 30 The frontal neocortical networks, in conjunction with the anterior cingulate gyrus, subserve many of the functions that seem to disintegrate with increasing psychotic symptoms. These same regions have been implicated in previous studies 27 as well as in this study.\nInterestingly, of 47 individuals with psychosis, 24 had 1 or more psychosis-related AEs only (no antipsychotic use), 10 confirmed use of at least 1 type of antipsychotic medication (no psychosis-related AE), and 13 had both (ie, at least 1 psychosisrelated AE and ongoing use of antipsychotic medication).\nIt is interesting to note that the average ADAS-cog scores for the psychotic group worsened at a rate of 5 times the rate of nonpsychosis patients. There is a substantial body of literature providing evidence that patients with psychosis of AD show a more rapid cognitive decline than patients with AD without psychosis but who have similar cognitive deficits. 31, 32 This dramatic worsening in cognition may reflect an accelerated pathological process occurring in those patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, as we corrected for baseline cognitive status in this study.\nOne limitation of this study is the combining of patients with MCI and AD. In the ADNI sample, MCI is in fact amnestic MCI, and thought to represent prodromal AD, presenting within 3 years of progression to dementia. 33 Most cases of amnestic MCI as defined in ADNI have AD pathology. This allows for a broader spectrum of AD pathology to be studied, including its earliest stages. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common features of MCI and similar to those of AD and have helped identify a subgroup of patients with MCI with prodromal AD. 34 In conclusion, this study has identified a number of associations between certain foci of neocortical atrophy and the onset of psychotic symptoms as well as the need for medications to control such symptoms. Correlations of this kind may help to identify specific brain circuits involved in the control of complex behaviors as well as their dysfunction and will guide more rational psychopharmacological and behavioral interventions to alleviate these distressing symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Authors' Notes", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).
