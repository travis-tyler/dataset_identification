[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Brain changes reminiscent of Alzheimer disease (AD) have been previously reported in a substantial portion of elderly cognitive healthy (HC) subjects. The major aim was to evaluate the accuracy of MRI assessed regional gray matter (GM) volume, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and neuropsychological test scores to identify those HC subjects who subsequently convert to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia. We obtained in 54 healthy control (HC) subjects a priori defined region of interest (ROI) values of medial temporal and parietal FDG-PET and medial temporal GM volume. In logistic regression analyses, these ROI values were tested together with neuropsychological test scores (free recall, trail making test B (TMT-B)) as predictors of HC conversion during a clinical follow-up between 3 and 4 years. In voxelbased analyses, FDG-PET and MRI GM maps were compared between HC converters and HC non-converters. Out of the 54 HC subjects, 11 subjects converted to MCI or AD dementia. Lower FDG-PET ROI values were associated with higher likelihood of conversion (p = 0.004), with the area under the curve (AUC) yielding 82.0% (95% CI = (95.5%, 68.5%)). The GM volume ROI was not a significant predictor (p = 0.07). TMT-B but not the free recall tests were a significant predictor (AUC = 71% (95% CI = 50.4%, 91.7%)). For the combination of FDG-PET and TMT-B, the AUC was 93.4% (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 93%). Voxel-based group comparison showed reduced FDG-PET metabolism within the temporo-parietal and prefrontal cortex in HC converters.

From a clinical point of view, a crucial question is the accuracy of such neuroimaging measures for the prediction of clinical progression to AD dementia in HC subjects. Previous studies showed that medial temporal lobe FDG-PET hypometabolism was associated with subsequent conversion to MCI or AD dementia (de Leon et al., 2001; Mosconi et al., 2008) . However, the accuracy of medial temporal lobe FDG-PET remained below a clinically significant level for the prediction of progression to MCI (Mosconi et al., 2008) . Results from studies assessing volumetric MRI in elderly HC subjects suggested that regional GM volume decrease was associated with increased risk to develop AD dementia (den Heijer et al., 2006; Dickerson et al., 2011) . However, the accuracy of FDG-PET and GM volume for predicting AD dementia in HC is still unclear, and to our best knowledge, no studies have compared the utility of FDG-PET and MRI for the detection of preclinical AD so far. Importantly, although slight cognitive changes have been proposed to be part of the preclinical stage of AD , the diagnostic benefit of combining neuropsychological test and neuroimaging modalities has not been tested.\nTherefore, the major aim of the current study was to assess the predictive accuracy of regional FDG-PET metabolism, MRI assessed gray matter volume and neuropsychological test performance for predicting clinical progression to MCI or AD dementia in elderly HC subjects. For neuropsychological test scores, we used tests of free recall and the trail making test B (TMT-B)a measure of executive functionsince these tests were previously shown to be predictive of the clinical progression from MCI to AD dementia (Ewers et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "All subjects were recruited within the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://www.adni-info.org/) and all data and scans were obtained from ADNI's publicly available databank (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). In ADNI, the general inclusion criteria were an age between 55 and 90 years, a modified Hachinski score \u2264 4, education of at least 6 grade level, and stable treatment of at least 4 weeks in case of treatment with permitted medication (for full list see http://www.adni-info.org, Procedures Manual).\nA total of 54 HC subjects were included for testing the prediction of the development of MCI or AD dementia. To be included in the current study, HC subjects had to have 1) HC diagnosis at baseline, 2) baseline MRI and FDG-PET scan, 3) conversion to MCI or AD during clinical follow-up or a clinical follow-up interval of at least 36 months, and 4) a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score = 0 at each follow-up time point in HC non-converters (see for flow chart Fig. 1 ). The CDR requirement in the HC non-converters was done in order to have a clean control group to be contrasted against HC subjects who show clinical progression. Such a study design was considered useful to boost power for establishing a prediction model that clearly distinguishes between HC converters and those HC subjects who remain stable. The requirement of at least 36 months of follow-up time for all HC subjects was implemented in order to reduce censoring effects.\nThe ROIs of FDG-PET and GM volume as predictors of clinical progression were a priori established in a training sample including 78 amnestic MCI with abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels and 30 HC subjects with normal CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels. The inclusion criteria were 1) diagnosis of \"MCI of the AD type\" or \"prodromal AD\" (Dubois et al., 2007) as recently proposed by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association workgroup McKhann et al., 2011) , i.e. amnestic MCI subjects with abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels (b 192 pg/ml, henceforth called MCI (A\u03b2+)). HC subjects were included if they had CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels N 192 pg/ml, henceforth called HC (A\u03b2\u2212) (Shaw et al., 2009 ). Due to sample size restriction, the sample of 30 HC (A\u03b2\u2212) subjects in the training sample included also 15 HC subjects that were part of the 54 HC subjects (test sample) in whom the prediction of subsequent conversion to MCI or AD was tested. Statistical analysis ensured that the overlap between both data sets did not bias the results (see Statistics section below)."}, {"section_title": "The ADNI study", "text": "ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the researchapproximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years."}, {"section_title": "MRI and FDG-PET acquisition", "text": "All MRI data were acquired on 1.5 T MRI scanners using volumetric T1-weighted sequences to map brain structures, optimized for the different scanners as indicated at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/ Research/Cores/index (Jack et al., 2008) .\nFDG-PET scans were acquired on multiple scanners of varying resolution. FDG scans were collected as 6 \u00d7 5-min frames beginning 30 min after injection of approximately 5 mCi of tracer (details at: http://adni. loni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/PET-Tech_Procedures_ Manual_v9.5.pdf). Prior to download, FDG-PET images had been preprocessed at the University of Berkeley according to a standard ADNI procedure (frames were co-registered, averaged, oriented along the anterior-posterior commission line and resliced to a 1.5 mm isotopic voxel space). The ADNI preprocessing protocol can be found at: http:// adni.loni.ucla.edu/methods/pet-analysis/pre-processing/. In order to reduce the multicenter variability of the FDG-PET images, correction factors for image reconstruction were obtained on the basis of scanning a 3D Hoffman phantom object at all participating ADNI sites. This allowed to derive scanner-specific correction factors. Image reconstruction was done centrally at the ADNI PET imaging core laboratory (for details see (Joshi et al., 2009) )."}, {"section_title": "Spatial normalization of MRI and FDG-PET scans", "text": "The T1 MRI scans were segmented and the resulting GM partitions were spatially normalized using high-dimensional large-deformation diffeomorphic registration as implemented in the DARTEL tool of SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/) (Ashburner, 2007) . In the first step, the MRI scans were segmented into GM, white matter, and CSF partitions (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) . Rigid body transformation was applied in order to bring GM segments into approximate alignment. The estimation of the non-linear spatial normalization parameters was calculated in iterative steps of the template generation. Within each of 6 successive cycles, an average of the GM tissue class images was generated and all GM maps were spatially normalized using a linear set of basis functions, where the optimization of the parameter estimates followed the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm as the minimum energy optimization procedure (Ashburner, 2007) . The normalization parameters were applied to the GM images. In the next cycle, the GM images that had been normalized during the first step were averaged and once more subjected to the spatial normalization procedure. This cycle was iterated 6 times, successively relaxing the regularization parameters as the image registration improves and the spatial resolution of the template became crisper (see also manual of SPM 8 at http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/manual.pdf). In the final step, the custom GM template was registered onto the ICBM GM template in MNI space included in the SPM8 package and combined with the non-linear flow fields estimated during the diffeomorphic normalization procedure described above. GM segments were modulated (i.e. multiplied by the Jacobian determinants of the spatial transformation) in order to yield a GM concentration in proportion to the dilation or contraction a voxel underwent during spatial normalization. The total intracranial volume (ICV) was estimated as the sum of the GM, WM and CSF tissue class images in native space obtained during the spatial normalization procedure (described above). For FDG-PET, each FDG-PET scan was coregistered to the individual's corresponding GM segment in native space. The spatial normalization parameters that had been estimated on the basis of the MRI images via DARTEL were subsequently applied to the coregistered FDG-PET images so that both the GM maps and the FDG-PET images were in MNI space.\nFor intensity normalization of the FDG-PET scans to the pons, a mask was manually drawn onto the GM template in MNI space, using a 3-D display in the program MIPAV (http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/). The binarized mask was multiplied with each spatially normalized FDG-PET image to calculate the average FDG-PET within the pons region. Each voxel of a subject's FDG-PET image was subsequently divided by the individual average FDG-PET value of the pons.\nCorrection for partial volume effects (PVEs) was done using the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) method (Rousset et al., 1998) as implemented in the software program PMOD (PMOD Technologies Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland). Briefly, the spill-over effects between the different brain compartments are estimated by convolving binarized voxels of interest (GM vs. background) with the point spread function to derive the weights of the spill-over effects. Based on these weights, the PVE corrected FDG-PET images were estimated (http://www. pmod.com/technologies/pdf/doc/PNEURO.pdf).\nAll GM and FDG-PET images were finally spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel at 8 mm FWHM."}, {"section_title": "Construction of FDG-PET and GM ROIs", "text": "Voxel-based ANCOVAs were used to compare group differences between HC (A\u03b2\u2212) and MCI (A\u03b2+) subjects (training sample), using group as the independent variable, and in the case of GM maps, ICV as an additional covariate.

The results of the ROC analysis are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 . Specifically, the ROC analysis for the age-adjusted FDG-PET ROI yielded an AUC of 77.8% (95% CI = (62.2%, 93.6%)).

The FDG-PET ROI after PVE correction remained a significant predictor of conversion (B = 1.4 z-score units, SE = .5, p = 0.004), with the AUC remaining virtually the same when compared to the FDG-PET model without PVE correction: AUC = 80.3% (95% CI = (66.2%, 94.5%)).\nThe ROI of GM volume (medial temporal lobe regions) was not a significant predictor of conversion (p = 0.07). Because the significance threshold was missed by a small margin, the ROC analysis was computed nevertheless.

The comparison of GM volume between HC converters and HC non-converters produced no significant clusters of group differences.\nLastly, we mapped the effect size d of FDG-PET and GM volume for the comparison between HC converters and HC non-converters without thresholding the maps on the basis of p-values. Visual inspection of the effect size maps shows that the effect sizes of group differences (i.e. lower FDG-PET in HC converters) are highest within the temporal, frontal, and parietal brain areas (Fig. 4A) , and are higher in most brain areas when compared to the group difference in GM volume (Fig. 4B) . For GM volume, the highest effect sizes of decreased GM volume within the HC converters group are primarily centered within the medial temporal lobe."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings of the prediction of the conversion from HC to MCI and AD dementia based on the a priori determined FDG-PET ROI (located in the medial temporal and parietal lobes) is consistent with previous studies showing that medial temporal and parietal FDG-PET was Table 2. associated with faster cognitive decline (Jagust et al., 2006) and hippocampal/entorhinal FDG-PET was sensitive to preclinical AD (de Leon et al., 2001; Mosconi et al., 2008) . These regions of reduced FDG-PET in medial temporal and medial parietal brain areas can be considered a subset of those temporo-parietal areas (i.e. medial and lateral parietal lobes & medial temporal lobes) that are typically affected in AD dementia (Mosconi, 2005) . Whereas we found a predictive effect of the FDG-PET ROI on subsequent clinical progression, we did not detect a significant predictive value of the medial temporal GM volume ROI. The findings are in line with MRI studies reporting that baseline total GM or medial temporal GM in HC subjects did not predict global cognitive decline (Jagust et al., 2006) or progression to MCI or AD (Rusinek et al., 2003) . However, the results are in disagreement with other studies suggesting that medial temporal GM volume is affected in preclinical AD (Chiang et al., 2011; Dickerson et al., 2012) . In particular, recent studies showed that a summary measure of cortical thickness ROIs including several temporal, parietal and prefrontal brain regions showed predictive value for the classification of subjects who subsequently converted to AD dementia (Dickerson et al., 2011) . Inconsistencies between the current and previous findings might be explained by methodological differences including differences in cortical thickness vs. morphometric measures (Hutton et al., 2009; Winkler et al., 2010) , or a more advanced state of disease severity of HC subjects included in those studies which detected gray matter atrophy at the preclinical stage (Dickerson et al., 2011) . The most parsimonious explanation is, however, that the subtle gray matter differences were already present but remained below the significance threshold in the current study. The examination of the effect size maps of gray matter volume differences confirmed that reductions in gray matter volume were mostly confined to the medial temporal lobe, which is in general agreement with previous reports of voxel-based analysis showing that GM volume decreases exclusively within the medial temporal and angular gyrus in HC subjects who later convert to MCI (Smith et al., 2007) . Importantly, the effect size map confirmed that FDG-PET hypometabolism was widely spread out within the gray matter brain areas, supporting the notion that FDG-PET was more affected compared to GM volume in subjects who showed clinical worsening that may correspond to preclinical AD. For neuropsychological tests, the TMT-B test but not measures of episodic memory were predictive of clinical progression. We previously reported that the TMT-B test outperformed other neuropsychological tests including tests of free recall, category fluency, digit span, and the Boston naming test for predicting conversion from MCI to AD dementia (Ewers et al., 2012) . Together with the previous findings, the current results suggest that TMT-B test might reflect cognitive function that is affected early in the course of AD. The TMT-B test is thought to be a measure of visual attention and cognitive flexibility associated with frontal and parietal lobe function (Zakzanis et al., 2005) . It is not known exactly which functional and structural brain changes in AD underlie the cognitive performance changes on the TMT-B test early in the course of AD. However, from a clinical point of view, the combination of the TMT-B and regional FDG-PET provides high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of clinical worsening in elderly HC subjectspossibly at an early stage of AD dementia. It should be noted that no systematic screening of a large range of neuropsychological tests or biomarkers candidates was done in the current study. Thus, neuropsychological tests or biomarkers other than those tested here may be relevant as well (Chary et al., 2013; Condret-Santi et al., 2013; Sperling et al., 2011; Tondelli et al., 2012) . In the current study, some of the a priori selected predictors that were previously shown to be sensitive to prodromal AD (Ewers et al., 2012) were confirmed to be successful for the prediction of clinical progression in HC subjects. It is for larger future studies to validate the current results and define a potentially extended test set of best predictors of preclinical AD. Apart from the current objective measures of neuropsychological ability, subjective memory complaints have previously been shown to be a potential predictor of subsequent memory decline (Chamberlain et al., 2011; Scheef et al., 2012) in elderly cognitively normal subjects and may be tested in future studies as well.\nFor the interpretation of the current results, it is important to note that not all HC subjects who converted to MCI may eventually progress to AD dementia. Compared to the HC non-converters, a higher proportion of HC converters showed abnormal measures on primary AD pathology as measured by CSF A\u03b2 and p-tau 181 levels that were available in a subset of the patients, supporting the notion that the HC converters were afflicted by preclinical AD. The development to AD dementia need to be confirmed, however, in future follow-ups within the ADNI project. It should also be noted that the subset of 54 HC subjects represents a subsample of the overall total of 229 HC subjects assessed in ADNI I. The sample size reduction was majorly due to the ADNI I study design, where a subset of the 229 HC subjects received FDG-PET at baseline. For the current study further requirements included follow-up duration (N3 years) and a CDR of 0 for the HC non-converters. We considered Fig. 3 . Projection of voxel-based t-statistic map onto axial brain slices. Yellow designates t-values for significantly higher FDG-PET in HC non-converters compared to HC converters. The opposite contrast (HC converters N HC stable) was not significant. these requirements useful in order to be able to clearly define a control group to establish a sensitive prediction model of preclinical AD.\nIncreased brain A\u03b2 PET binding in the brain has previously been shown to be predictive for the conversion to AD dementia in MCI subjects and may also predict clinical progression at the preclinical stage of AD Okello et al., 2009) . Thus the question needs to be addressed to what extent the current markers add to measures of primary pathology (tau or A\u03b2) to the detection of preclinical AD (Desikan et al., 2012; Prestia et al., 2013) ."}]
