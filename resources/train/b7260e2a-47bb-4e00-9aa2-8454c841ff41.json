[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Glyocogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the phosphorylation of tau. Recent work has suggested that GSK3b also plays a role in the amyloid pathway of AD through genetic interactions with APP and APBB2 on in vivo measures of amyloid. This project extends the previously identified genotype interactions to an autopsy measure of amyloid, while also testing the same interactions leveraging gene expression data quantified in the prefrontal cortex. 797 participants (251 cognitively normal, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 350 Alzheimer's disease) were drawn from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. A mean score of amyloid load was calculated across eight brain regions, gene expression levels from frozen sections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were quantified using RNA amplification, and expression signals were generated using Beadstudio. Three SNPs previously identified in genetic interactions were genotyped using the Illumina 1M genotyping chip. Covariates included age, sex, education, and diagnosis. We were able to evaluate 2 of the 3 previously identified interactions, of which the interaction between GSK3b (rs334543) and APBB2 (rs2585590) was found in this autopsy sample (p = 0.04). We observed a comparable interaction between GSK3b and APBB2 when comparing the highest tertile of gene expression to the lowest tertile, t(1) = -2.03, p = 0.043. These results provide additional evidence of a genetic interaction between GSK3b and APBB2 and further suggest that GSK3b is involved in the pathophysiology of both of the primary neuropathologies of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Glyocogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) has been increasingly investigated in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the past few years (Hooper et al. 2008) , including ongoing work applying GSK3 inhibitors in the context of AD treatment (del Ser et al. 2013a, b) . GSK3 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both primary pathologies in AD, amyloid-b plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles made up of hyperphosphorylated tau. Specifically, the b isoform of GSK3 (GSK3b) is a tau protein kinase (Ishiguro et al. 1993 ) and relates to both tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent neurodegeneration (Lucas et al. 2001 ). More recently, work in transgenic mice has suggested that treatment targeting GSK3 results in partial reversal of tangle pathology and prevention of disease progression early in the disease cascade (Hernandez et al. 2013) . In relation to amyloid, GSK3 has been implicated in Ab production (Phiel et al. 2003) and accumulation (Martin et al. 2013 ). Thus, it has been suggested that genetic interactions with GSK3 upstream of both amyloid and tau pathology may play a causal role in AD pathogenesis (Small and Duff 2008) .\nPreviously, we evaluated the possibility of upstream interactions between amyloid and tau genes by investigating interactions between genes in the amyloid pathway with GSK3 in relation to an in vivo measure of amyloid deposition using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; Hohman et al. 2014) . We identified 3 interactions all involving the SNP rs334543 just upstream of GSK3b. However, the ADNI dataset did not allow for the opportunity to evaluate how the identified SNP-SNP interactions related to pathologic burden at autopsy, nor whether the genotypes identified were associated with levels of gene expression in the brain. This manuscript extends our previous work in the following ways. First, we evaluated the identified SNP-SNP interactions in relation to an autopsy measure of amyloid burden to provide additional verification of the observed effect in an independent sample. Second, we tested whether the genotypes at the relevant SNPs are related to gene expression in the prefrontal cortex. Finally, we tested whether we observe the same gene-gene interactions when leveraging gene expression rather than genotypes in statistical models predicting amyloid burden. Collectively, this work will further clarify the role of GSK3 in both the primary pathologies of AD, while also highlighting the means by which the seemingly independent amyloid and tau pathways may intersect through upstream genetic interactions."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Participants were drawn from two cohort studies of aging and dementia: the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP; Bennett et al. 2012a, b) .

Briefly, brains were removed and weighed, hemispheres were cut coronally into 1-cm slabs, and uniform examination procedures were conducted using slabs and/or pictures from both hemispheres. For the present analyses, we used quantification of amyloid load calculated across eight brain regions (entorhinal cortex, CA1/subiculum of the hippocampus, superior frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, angular gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and occipital cortex), the details of which have been published previously (Bennett et al. 2006b ). These regions were cut into 20 lm to identify and assess average amyloid load using an N-terminus-directed monoclonal antibody (10D5, dilution = 1:300, Elan, Dublin, Ireland; Beta-Amyloid, 17-24 (4G8), dilution = 1:9000, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL; DAKO, dilution = 1:50, Carpinteria, CA). Quantification of amyloid-b load was accomplished by image processing in an automated, multistage computational image analysis protocol. Twenty-four percent of each cortical region (* 75 images) was sampled to determine the average percent is occupied by Ab per region. The value included intracortical vascular amyloid.

Given the genotype interaction observed, we also evaluated expression using tertiles in order to better compare high expression to low expression. In the tertile analysis, the lowest tertile was set as the referent in the linear regression model. Third, we evaluated the previously observed gene-gene interaction using expression levels instead of genotypes. We ran this analysis both treating expression as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (i.e., tertiles with the lowest tertile set as the referent). We also re-ran analyses evaluating amyloid levels derived from the prefrontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus) to assess whether the expression derived from prefrontal cortex was specifically associated with amyloid levels in the prefrontal cortex.

Consistent with our previous results, we did not observe a significant main effect of any of the SNPs on amyloid burden; however, we did observe an interaction between GSK3b (rs334543) and APBB2 (rs2585590) on amyloid burden (t(1) = 2.03, p = 0.04). This interaction was in a consistent direction with our previously observed finding in ADNI (Fig. 1) . We did not observe this same interaction on the presence of CAA (t(1) = 1.32, p = 0.184). We did not find the previously observed interaction between GSK3b (rs334543) and APP (rs457581; t(1) = -0.98, p = 0.33). Therefore, in our follow-up gene expression analyses we only evaluated APBB2 and GSK3b. In eQTL analyses, rs334543 did not show an association with expression levels of GSK3b (p = 0.147), and rs2585590 was not related to APBB2 expression (p = 0.76).\nWhen evaluating main effects of gene expression on amyloid burden, we observed a significant effect of APBB2 (t(1) = 3.06, p = 0.002) but not GSK3b (p = 0.20). Neither gene was associated with the presence of CAA (p [ 0.05).\nFinally, when evaluating the gene-gene interaction using levels of expression, we did not observe a significant interaction between APBB2 and GSK3b when treated as continuous variables (t(1) = -1.03, p = 0.301) but did observe a significant interaction between the highest tertile relative to the lowest tertile (t(1) = -2.03, p = 0.043). As seen in Fig. 2 , high levels of GSK3b expression were protective in those individuals with high levels of APBB2 expression. When restricting analyses to amyloid levels derived from the prefrontal cortex the interaction remained statistically significant both in the middle frontal gyrus (t(1) = -2.47, p = 0.014) and the superior frontal gyrus (t(1) = -2.07, p = 0.039).

Moreover, in a smaller sample of subjects with gene expression data, we were able to provide preliminary evidence that high levels of GSK3b expression in the prefrontal cortex appear to be protective against amyloid deposition in the presence of high levels of APBB2 expression.

In b, the y-axis is mean amyloid burden calculated at autopsy. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. The rs334543 C/C genotype is associated with lower levels of amyloid burden among carriers of the rs2585590 A/A genotype (red line, left column in both panels) (Color figure online) Fig. 2 Gene-gene interaction using gene expression. Mean amyloid burden is along the y-axis. APBB2 expression tertiles are along the xaxis, and lines are grouped by GSK3b expression tertiles. Gene expression was quantified in the prefrontal cortex. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. The highest tertile of GSK3b expression (red line) is associated with lower levels of amyloid deposition among those in the highest tertile of APBB2 expression (right column) (Color figure online) The results of the SNP-SNP replication provide additional evidence that the effect of GSK3b on amyloid deposition may depend largely on the genetic context. Consistent with our previous finding, we observed a protective, dose-dependent effect of the GSK3b (rs334543) SNP in homozygous carriers of the APBB2 (rs2585590) SNP. However, we did not observe the complete reversal of the effect in homozygous carriers of the G allele as previously observed (Fig. 1) . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the difference in the samples evaluated. The present cohort has a much larger percentage of ADs compared to sample previously evaluated in ADNI (44 % AD in ROS/MAP v. 12 % AD in the ADNI Florbetapir sample) and a much lower percentage of patients with MCI (24 % in ROS/MAP v. 54 % in ADNI Florbetapir sample). Unfortunately, we did not have a sufficient sample size in either dataset to provide a comprehensive evaluation of SNP-SNP-diagnosis interactions in our models, as the three way interaction left contingency table cells with as few as 1 subject in both ADNI and ROS/MAP. Larger samples are needed to evaluate how this observed genetic interaction differs across diagnostic categories. Stratified figures are presented in Supplementary Fig. 1 from both ADNI and ROS/MAP to clarify how the observed interaction may differ across diagnostic categories. However, the strongest observed effect in homozygous carriers of the rs2585590 A allele appears to be consistent across datasets and across diagnostic categories. It should also be noted that in the current analysis, we used actual neuropathological measures of amyloid pathology, whereas in ADNI we only looked at a proxy measure of amyloid using PET imaging. The neuropathological metric should be more sensitive and less susceptible to artifact, so although the effect sizes differ, the consistency of the observed interaction across in vivo and ex vivo measures provides strong support for the validity of the observed interaction effects.\nThis manuscript has provided some clarification on the manner of the interaction between GSK3b and APBB2 by demonstrating that the elevated amyloid burden observed in those individuals with the highest levels of APBB2 expression is attenuated in those who also show the highest levels of GSK3b. Given the role the protein product of APBB2 plays in APP processing (McLoughlin and Miller 2008) , it is not surprising that we observed a strong main effect of APBB2 expression levels on amyloid burden. However, the results are important in that they provide additional information about the context in which the beneficial effects of GSK3b are observed. Previously, we had speculated based on the genotype results that GSK3b may be beneficial in the presence of low levels of APBB2, which would lead to a reduced effect of the amyloid intracellular domain (AICD) in driving both APP expression and GSK3 expression (Ryan and Pimplikar 2005 ). Yet, the present results seem to indicate that it is in the context of high levels of APBB2 expression that GSK3b appears to be most beneficial. This makes some intuitive sense given that the AICD only drives GSK3 expression when the FE65 protein is present, which suggests that the added expression of GSK3 may be precisely what results in a beneficial effect.\nGiven that higher levels of APBB2 are associated with higher levels of amyloid at autopsy, and that higher levels of GSK3b are associated with lower levels of amyloid in the presence of high APBB2, it is not surprising that participants with AD showed higher levels of APBB2 and lower levels of GSK3b when compared to normal controls (Table 1) . Interestingly, similar to what we observed in the SNP analyses, the protective effect of GSK3b appears across diagnostic categories ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), suggesting that the high levels of GSK3b in the presence of APBB2 may promote reduced levels of amyloid regardless of disease stage. In the case of AD, perhaps the small reductions in amyloid related to GSK3b are insufficient to stave off the disease process entirely, particularly when additional risk factors for amyloid deposition are present.\nOne limitation of the current study is that both of the observed interaction effects are quite modest. One possible explanation is that our power was somewhat restricted because we were not able to explore genetic interaction effects in the most relevant manner: stratified by diagnostic status. It should also be noted that the expression levels of GSK3b and APBB2 in the prefrontal cortex were considerably lower than expression of other genes. This leaves open the possibility that stronger expression interaction effects may be observed in regions like the hippocampus, particularly given recent evidence that beneficial effects of GSK3b blockers are driven by reductions in hippocampal GSK3b expression and not cortical expression in adult rats (Mendes et al. 2009 ). Moreover, we were unable to specifically address the direct relationship between gene expression and amyloid deposition within each region sampled to quantify amyloid, leaving open the possibility that gene-amyloid effects may differ across regions. From our results, we can only conclude that GSK3b and APBB2 in the prefrontal cortex interact on a global level of amyloid in the brain. Future work evaluating the association between these genes and AD pathology across relevant brain regions may clarify whether the observed effect has some regional specificity, and whether the strength of the effect is highest in brain regions implicated in the earliest disease-related changes.\nThis manuscript also has multiple strengths. The validation of a previously identified SNP provides support of the interaction effect, and more importantly demonstrates that the observed effect carries over from a biomarker of amyloid deposition to measures of amyloid at autopsy. The availability of gene expression data further strengthens our finding by providing some hints at mechanism and clarifying future directions to better understand the role of GSK3b in the pathophysiological cascade in AD. Future work should focus on how the role of GSK3b on disease risk and resilience changes across the course of the dementia spectrum."}]
