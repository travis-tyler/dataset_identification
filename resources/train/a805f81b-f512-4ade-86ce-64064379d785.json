In order to better understand the genetics of AD, we require statistical techniques to address both polygenic and possible non-additive effects.\nMETHODS: We used partial least squares-correspondence analysis (PLS-CA)-a method designed to detect multivariate genotypic effects. We used ADNI-1 (N = 756) as a discovery sample with two forms of PLS-CA: diagnosis-based and ApoE-based. We used ADNI-2 (N = 791) as a validation sample with a diagnosis-based PLS-CA.\nRESULTS: With PLS-CA we identified some expected genotypic effects (e.g., APOE/TOMM40, and APP) and a number of new effects that include, for examples, risk-associated genotypes in RBFOX1 and GPC6 and control-associated genotypes in PTPN14 and CPNE5.\nDISCUSSION: Through the use of PLS-CA, we were able to detect complex (multivariate, genotypic) genetic contributions to AD, which included many non-additive and non-linear risk and possibly protective effects."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Many genes have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as SORL1 [1] , EPHA1 [2] , CLU, and PICALM [3] , all of which have shown effects in a variety of studies [4] . Though there are well-known genetic effects in AD [5] [6] [7] -there are still some controversial findings.\nFor example, the work reported in [8] showed effects of rare variants in PLD3, where follow up studies showed both replication [9] and no replication [10] of PLD3 effects. Overall, recent works suggest that the genetic contributions to AD are: polygenic [11, 12] , epistatic [13] , and non-linear or non-additive [14] . However, the routine analytical approaches for genetic and genomic data do not accommodate such complexities; but, if the genetics of AD are so complex why are we still using statistical methods whose assumptions are not suited to detect such complex effects?\nWith the advent of genome-wide studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are almost exclusively analyzed with the additive model. The additive model transforms a SNP from base pair letters into a count based on number of minor alleles where usually a major homozygote is \"0,\" a heterozygote is \"1,\" and a minor homozygote is \"2.\" The additive model has become popular because it is viewed as both a practical approach [15] and a suitable model for complex traits [16] . However, the assumptions of additivity and/or linearity do not always hold (see [17, 18] ). Recent work (in cholesterol) has shown that the genotypic (\"full\") model is better than the additive model to detect genetic contributions to complex traits [19] . Furthermore, additive assumptions can be detrimental because the a priori choice of a model that does not match the true inheritance pattern causes a loss of power [20] . Additionally, the values of '0' and '2' are inherently ambiguous across samples, and this ambiguity could lead to misinterpretation or even the dismissal of effects because of the direction of genotypic effects. For possible examples in AD: in [21] the authors reported \"direction changes\" in their own replication analyses, whereas in [22] the authors report effects in the opposite direction in their attempt to replicate work in [8] . The additive model has been used in many AD studies even though the existence of non-additive effects is often acknowledged and expected [23, 24] . With resources such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), researchers have had the opportunity to analyze genome-wide data in a variety of ways, yet the ADNI genome-wide data have almost exclusively been analyzed with the additive model (see, e.g., [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ).\nIn this study we investigated the ADNI genome-wide data with a technique tailored for complex and polygenic effects called partial least squares-correspondence analysis (PLS-CA, [31] ). PLS-CA is a multivariate technique that allows for a more general approach (i.e., genotypic model). Furthermore, PLS-CA was designed to address the complexity of genetic contributions (i.e., polygenicity, non-additivity) so that we can detect, rather than assume, specific genotypic effects. PLS-CA treats SNPs as categorical data where the genotpyes are levels within those SNP categories. Our study was designed to identify multiple specific genotypic effects for AD (possible risk factors) and for controls (possible protective factors); the specificity afforded by PLS-CA helps disentangle some of the complexities of genetic contributions to AD. Our goals with this study were two-fold: (1) apply the technique within AD in order to potentially reveal some of the genetic complexities of AD and (2) illustrate a novel approach to perform genetic and genomic association studies.\nOur paper is outlined as follows. In Methods, we describe the ADNI data used in this study, followed by descriptions of the SNP and genotype quality control, and statistical techniques. We then detail the two phases of our study: (1) \"Discovery\" (with ADNI-1) which includes two genome-wide association analyses (one based on diagnosis, and another based on APOE), and (2) \"Validation\" (with ADNI-GO/2) that used the genotypes identified in \"Discovery\" to create a candidate panel and then test group association in a new sample. In\nResults we present findings from each of the phases. In Discussion we emphasize the \"Validation\" phase followed by conclusions and limitations."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article come from the ADNI database and Canada.

The SMC category was not used as a diagnosis in later time points in the ADNI-GO/2 study, only as a recruitment group at baseline. See Table 1 for details.

Some in-house We used two forms of PLS-CA in our discovery phase: discriminant PLS-CA and seed PLS-CA. We used discriminant PLS-CA in the validation phase. For details on background, and notation on PLS-CA and its derivatives see [31] . We briefly describe our motivation to use these two techniques here. We expand on the motivation in Study design and overview. Discriminant PLS-CA is a technique that maximizes the separation between a priori groups of participants (see also [35] ). We used Discriminant PLS-CA to identify genotypes most associated with each group. In Seed PLS-CA, a \"seed\" is a specific genetic marker, where the seed analysis looks for distributions of genotypes similar to the seed (i.e., linkage disequilibrium). We used seed PLS-CA to identify other genotypes with distributions similar to APOE, which is the strongest contributor to non-familial AD [36, 37] ; thus we were trying to find additional candidate genotypes that have roughly the same pattern as APOE in the ADNI sample.

In all tables, a 1 indicates the presence of a particular level of a categorical variable while a 0 indicates absence (e.g., Subj.1 is an Alzheimer's Disease patient, with 2 ApoE E4 alleles, the AG genotype for SNP1 and either a CC or CA [presence of minor allele] for SNP2). Note that one subject has missing data (i.e., \"<NA>\").

We emphasized genotypes instead of presumed additive effects within SNPs. Our Validation phase revealed many complex effects that highlight why a simple additive model (all in the same presumed direction, i.e., the minor allele), or any a priori model, may not be sufficient to characterize complex genetic effects (see also Figure 3 and Table 3 ); for examples: (1) rs769449 is approximately linear where the minor homozygote and the heterozygote are in the risk region, and the major homozygote in the control region, (2) rs4420638 is approximately dominant where the minor allele is in the risk region, (3) rs440666 is approximately recessive where the minor homozygote is in the control region, and (4) rs8052288 showed a heterozygous effect in the risk region."}, {"section_title": "Specific effects of well-known genes", "text": "Some of the strongest effects in all of our analyses were associated with genotypes in Chromosome 19 (Chr19). These effects included some well-known genes in AD: TOMM40, APOE, APOC, and NECTIN2. However, PLS-CA identified exactly which genotypes contributed to which effects (see Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). For examples, the 'AA' genotype of rs769449 (APOE) and the 'GG' genotype of rs2075650 (TOMM40) are at the extreme of our plot, directly opposite of the CON group, and almost exactly half way between AD and MCI (Fig. 3) . This means that 'AA' in rs769449 and GG in rs2075650 rarely occur in CON, but tend to occur roughly equally in both the AD and MCI groups. Most importantly for Chr19 effects: our Discovery phase identified 'AA' of rs6859 associated with the presence of APOE E4, whereas our Validation phase identified 'GG' of rs6859 associated with the CON group. While the \"direction\" of the effect is the same across both studies, the source of the effect was not (i.e., minor allele vs. major allele). Taken together, the Discovery and Validation analyses suggest that, depending on the genotype, rs6859 confers both a risk and a possibly protective factor. APP is also well-known in AD [52] .

Both of these genes have been associated with pathological or cognitive phenotypes of AD. These two genes have shown associations with very different phenotypic or outcome measures in AD. RBFOX1 has been associated with pathological effects in the brain, such as neurofibrillary tangles [53] as well as neuroimaging phenotypes [54] and hippocampal volumes [55] in AD. In contrast, GPC6 has been associated with cognitive and behavioral decline in AD [56] .\nOur analyses also revealed several novel genetic effects. Some of these were \"control\" effects, and some were \"risk\" effects. Of the control-associated effects, we found contributions from genotypes in the PTPN14, CPNE5, and LINC00504 genes. Additionally, we also found contributions from genotypes in the ZYG11AP1 and LOC100421294 genes, where each had various genotypes associated with both \"control\" and \"risk\" effects.

However, these studies use more complex study designs or more complex methods, which, in some cases [54, 55] , demand vast computational resources. Other work, such as [56] , also have more data and larger samples.\nFurthermore, [65] also used the ADNI sample and have recognized the utility and power of the genotypic model. Yet, compared to all of these approaches, our much simpler and computationally less expensive approach (with a comparable or smaller sample size than these other studies) found some of the same effects reported in all of the aforementioned papers, such as the contributions of GPC6 and RBFOX1. PLS-CA also found a number of well-known genetic contributions to AD such as the effects across Chr19. The Chr19 effects were important because they highlight that our method can and does identify well-known and robust effects, and thus illustrates validity for the problems at hand. But more importantly, we identified many novel effects that otherwise could not be detected without a more general approach. Taken together, our study helps reveal some of the genetic complexities of AD, especially in that we have identified many genotypes from many genes that contribute in a variety of ways (e.g., minor allele as possibly protective, heterozygous effects).\nPLS-CA has many advantages over traditional and more recent approaches to GWAS.\nFirst, PLS-CA does not make assumptions about genotypic effects, rather, PLS-CA reveals the types of effects (e.g., additive, dominant) and the directions of these effects. More importantly, because PLS-CA is a multivariate technique, it actually provides estimates of the contributions of these genotypes to polygenic effects (see BSRs in Table 3 or component scores in Figure 3 ).\nTogether these features of PLS-CA are particularly suited for our problem. PLS-CA has identified and specified the expected complex genetic contributions to AD, and thus techniques such as PLS-CA help making clearer interpretations, as well as reduce false positives, nonreplications, conflicting reports, and otherwise problematic interpretations of genetic effects."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The ADNI data sets are, by today's standards, relatively small samples for such a study.\nHowever, our study design emphasized our Validation step to help confirm effects identified in Discovery. Additionally, our Validation phase could have weighted the candidates based on bootstrap ratios from the Discovery phase to emphasize the strength of effects. However, we chose not to and opted for a more data-driven strategy. Ultimately this choice was beneficial: for example, if we had used weighted values in the Validation phase we may have missed effects such as those associated with rs6859 (i.e., rs6859 expressed different effects in Discovery compared to Validation). Furthermore, the individuals within these groups are heterogeneous, and could possibly have confounding factors (e.g., vascular incidents) or misdiagnoses. Because of the difficulty of diagnosing AD in vivo, we are limited in our claims to AD broadly, but have provided a clearer genetic landscape of the cohorts within ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/2. Thus, the effects we have identified should be further verified in a predictive analysis wherein individuals could be genotyped for the specific markers we have identified; which may be possible through similar studies that are in progress (e.g., ADNI-3, the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative [66] ).
