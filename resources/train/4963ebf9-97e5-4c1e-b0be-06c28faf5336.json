Variability in the relationship between the shell based records and the North Atlantic Oscillation coincide with variations in the AMO index, suggesting a complex relationship between atmospheric forcing on hydrographic variability and ecosystem dynamics in northern Norway.\nAmplified increase in surface air temperatures (Arctic Council 2005) and decrease in sea ice extent (NSIDC 2012) within the Arctic highlight the need for a better understanding of this sensitive climate zone prior to substantial anthropogenic forcing (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013) . Recent oceanographic and ecological changes in the Arctic have, in part, been linked to trends in the heat transport of the North Atlantic Current (NAC; Cottier et al. 2007; Berge et al. 2009; Mahajan et al. 2011; Spielhagen et al. 2011 ), large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies (Blindheim et al. 2000) , and anthropogenic forcing (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013) . A comprehensive assessment of the natural range of marine climate variability, however, is greatly hindered because few long-term (>50 yr), continuous instrumental records of environmental conditions exist within the Arctic. Proxy-based reconstructions (Jones et al. 2009; Wanamaker et al. 2011a) are thus needed to fully elucidate past marine climate variability. Understanding a proxy response to environmental variability can provide insight into climate forcing and interactions through time (Witbaard et al. 2003; Wanamaker et al. 2008a) .\nCoastal northern Norway is an ideal location for detailing the influence of North Atlantic marine climate variability on the Arctic due to its proximity to one of the main pathways of Atlantic water entering the Barents Sea, namely, the eastern branch of the NAC (Duplessy et al. 2001; Lind and Ingvaldsen 2012; \u00c5 rthun et al. 2012) . Variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; Duplessy et al. 2001; Hald et al. 2011) , the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; Delworth and Mann 2000; Sutton and Hodson 2005) , and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Barnston and Livezey 1987) play a role in NAC variability as well as climate variability of the North Atlantic and Arctic regions at large. Feedbacks and interactions among North Atlantic climate modes are known to modify precipitation, air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface salinity (SSS) patterns (Marshall et al. 2001; Hurrell and Deser 2009) , however, the relative dominance of these modes in modulating climate through time is poorly understood. Long-term, annually resolved, geographically diverse records of climate variability are needed to evaluate the influence of these various modes on North Atlantic climate variability.\nThe surface components of the AMOC represent the northward flow of warm water from low latitudes toward the Arctic. These waters contribute to Arctic warming and sea ice decline (\u00c5 rthun et al. 2012; Lien et al. 2013; Smedsrud et al. 2013 ) through heat loss to the atmosphere before returning southward to the global ocean through deep-water formation in the Labrador and Norwegian Seas (Rahmstorf 1996; Broecker 1997) . Oceanographic conditions off northern Norway are influenced both by the NAC (a surface component of the AMOC) and the Norwegian Coastal Current, which progressively mixes with the NAC as it moves northward (Helland-Hansen and Nansen 1909; Skagseth et al. 2011) .\nThe AMO is a measure of SST anomalies over the North Atlantic with a periodicity of approximately 60-80 yr (e.g., Delworth and Mann 2000; Sutton and Hodson 2005) . The ecosystem effects of the AMO are substantial and extend throughout the Atlantic basin (Drinkwater 2006; Nye et al. 2013) , however, as noted by Drinkwater et al. (2013) , its impacts on ecosystems at high-latitudes (>608N) have received considerably less attention than regions to the south. AMO variability is widely recognized as the large-scale and long-term manifestation of AMOC variability (Wei and Lohmann 2012; Alheit et al. 2014 ) involving interactions and feedbacks among the ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice (Dima and Lohmann 2007; Drinkwater et al. 2013 ). Empirical evidence for the AMO-AMOC relationship, however, is lacking due to the scarcity of reliable, long-term records of surface and subsurface ocean current behavior in the North Atlantic (Alexander et al. 2014 ). The relationship is partly supported by climate models that identify AMOC variability that mimics AMO variability as well as resulting spatial patterns in SST anomalies (Knight et al. 2005; Zhang 2008; Wei and Lohmann 2012) . A lack of consistent findings from climate models, however, suggests our understanding of AMO forcing mechanisms is incomplete (Alexander et al. 2014; Drinkwater et al. 2014) .\nThe wintertime (DJFM) NAO represents the most prominent pattern of atmospheric variability over the extratropical northern hemisphere (Hurrell 1995) . The NAO index is traditionally defined by the normalized sea level pressure (SLP) difference between Iceland and the Azores, with a positive (negative) index representing a larger (smaller) difference in SLP. The redistribution of atmospheric mass between Iceland and the Azores influences mean wind speed and direction, heat and moisture transport, and storm track behavior across the Atlantic (Hurrell et al. 2003) . The NAO has been linked to localized and rapid changes in ocean properties and circulation including surface temperature, mixed layer depth in the northern Atlantic, timing of stratification, and upper ocean heat content, as well as long term response in overturning circulation . Through modulation of these hydrographic properties, NAO variability indirectly affects marine ecological communities (Drinkwater et al. 2000) including phytoplankton (Dickson et al. 1988; Fromentin and Planque 1996; Greene et al. 2003) , zooplankton (Witbaard 1996; Ottersen and Stenseth 2001) , benthos (Nordberg et al. 2000; Carroll et al. 2009 ) and fish communities (Friedland et al. 1998) .\nWe employ sclerochronological techniques to examine the extent to which annual shell growth and shell geochemical records from the long-lived marine bivalve, Arctica islandica, in northern Norway reflect major North Atlantic climate modes, with a particular focus on large-scale sea surface temperatures and the AMO. Insight into the dynamical relationship between shell growth and several large-scale North Atlantic climate modes including the AMOC and NAO will be discussed. Finally, we assess the potential for using A. islandica at this northern location to reconstruct environmental conditions in a climatically sensitive region where relatively few subdecadal to annual resolution marine proxy records exist."}, {"section_title": "Proxy archive and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Arctica islandica", "text": "The marine bivalve, A. islandica, is long-lived (>500 yr; Sch\u20ac one et al. Wanamaker et al. 2008a; Butler et al. 2013) and widely distributed across the northern North Atlantic (Dahlgren et al. 2000) , making it particularly useful in evaluating long-term, large-scale North Atlantic marine climate dynamics (Wanamaker et al. 2009 ). This sedentary benthic clam is found in water depths ranging from 10 m to as deep as 500 m and thrives in full marine conditions. A. islandica lives within the sediment and extends its relatively short siphons into the main water column, exchanging water to feed and remove waste (for recent review of this archive, see Sch\u20ac one 2013). Shells of the ocean quahog A. islandica provide useful information about oceanographic processes in the northern North Atlantic Ocean including in the North Sea (Sch\u20ac one et al. 2003; Witbaard et al. 2003; Butler et al. 2009; Reynolds et al. 2013 ), Irish Sea (Butler et al. 2010) , North Icelandic shelf (Sch\u20ac one et al. 2005; Wanamaker et al. 2012; Butler et al. 2013) , and Gulf of Maine (Wanamaker et al. 2008a (Wanamaker et al. , 2011b . The formation of continuous, annual growth banding within A. islandica ( Fig. 1 ) allows for annually resolved, absolutely dated chronologies of marine environmental variability (Jones 1980; Weidman et al. 1994; Witbaard et al. 1994; Sch\u20ac one et al. 2005; Scourse et al. 2012 ). Shell growth variability in A. islandica is currently understood to relate to ocean temperature and mixing dynamics primarily through modulation of food availability (Witbaard et al. 1994; Sch\u20ac one et al. 2003; Butler et al. 2010; Butler et al. 2013; Lohmann and Sch\u20ac one 2013) . A. islandica appears to precipitate its aragonitic shell matrix in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater (e.g., Weidman et al. 1994) . Thus, oxygen isotope values of A. islandica shell material reflect seawater temperature and seawater isotopic composition (related to salinity) (Marsh et al. 1999; Sch\u20ac one et al. 2004; Wanamaker et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Sample collection and preparation", "text": "Live specimens of A. islandica were collected from a shallow bay (6 m depth) off the eastern side of the island of Ing\u00f8ya in northern Norway ( Processing of shell material was accomplished using standard sclerochronological procedures (Scourse et al. 2006; Wanamaker et al. 2009; Butler et al. 2009) . A 2-cm section around the maximum growth axis was cut from margin to hinge (Fig. 1 ) using a Gryphon diamond bladed saw. The section was embedded in clear epoxy (Buelher Epoxicure resin and hardener) and bisected using a Buelher IsoMet low-speed saw, producing two mirror-image shell blocks. The blocks were polished using a Buelher variable-speed, grinding-polishing wheel with a series of decreasing grit-size silicon carbide grinding paper (P120, P400, P600, P800, P1200), rinsing well with deionized water between grit sizes. The blocks were given a final rinse with deionized water and allowed to dry.\nOne block from each shell was reserved for geochemical analyses while further processing continued for the other block to be used for crossdating work. The latter block was immersed in a low concentration (1%) HCl bath for a period of 90-300 s (time depending on shell condition and age) at room temperature to etch the shell surface. After etching, blocks were rinsed by gently dipping in deionized water and allowed to dry for at least 4 h. A 0.035 mm cellulose acetate film (Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog No. 50420-30) was carefully laid over the etched shell block surface after coating the surface with a thin layer of acetone, and then allowed to dry for at least 15 min. The acetate replica peels were removed from the shells, trimmed, and mounted between glass slides for visual analysis of shell growth increments under transmitted light microscopy using 5X-20X objectives."}, {"section_title": "Development of the master shell chronology", "text": "Prior to increment measurement, shell growth was qualitatively assessed in both the hinge and margin regions of the maximum growth axis observed on the acetate replica (Fig.  1) . Following identification of the outermost, incomplete increment as the year of sample collection (2009, 2013, or 2014) , exceptionally small or large growth increments were noted as \"marker years\" (see Stokes and Smiley 1996; Black et al. 2005) by visually comparing them to neighboring increments. The synchronicity of marker years between different shells allows for accurate assignment of calendar years to growth increments throughout the series by preventing misidentification of false bands that occur due to growth disturbance during shell formation (for example, see Butler et al. 2009) . If an offset between marker years occurred between different shells, all samples were studied to identify possible mistakes in visual increment identification, relying on the clearest acetate peels that showed the most agreement to identify the true population growth pattern. Intrashell comparison between the hinge and margin regions also aided in identifying false increments and micro-growth bands.\nHere we provide a summary of the methods used for chronology construction. For more details, see Supporting Information. Following the qualitative assessment of the population growth pattern, increments were measured using Buelher OmniMet (v9.5) software with a Nikon Eclipse E600 transmitted light microscope equipped with a uEye camera using 5X and 10X objectives. Increments were measured perpendicular to increment boundaries at a consistent distance, approximately halfway, between the outer and inner boundaries of the outer shell layer on the margin, and along the apex of growth increments on the hinge. Growth measurement series were initially compiled and statistically analyzed using the SHELLCORR MatLab script (Scourse et al. 2006 ) to aid in intershell year-to-year growth comparisons. The statistical crossdating program COFECHA was used to further quantitatively verify the visual crossdating technique (Holmes 1983; Grissino-Mayer 2001) . Errors (e.g., Butler et al. 2009 ) in the chronology identified using SHELLCORR and COFECHA were investigated and corrected by visually analyzing shells for verification and adjusting increment identification and measurement accordingly.\nA master chronology was then constructed using the program ARSTAN (Cook 1985) . Negative exponential curve detrending was used to remove age-related growth trends. The standard master chronology (MSC) was constructed using a biweighted robust mean to minimize the effect of increment width outliers among the growth series (Cook et al. 1990 ). Associated chronology statistics including expressed population signal (EPS; Wigley et al. 1984 ) and mean sensitivity were calculated using COFECHA and ARSTAN's built-in functions."}, {"section_title": "Isotopic analysis", "text": "Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses were performed at Iowa State University's (ISU) Stable Isotope Laboratory in the Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences. Carbonate samples were collected using a Merchantek micromill with a Leica GZ6 microscope capable of 10 lm steps. Annual increments were milled from the outer margin of the shell to a depth of 200-800 lm using Brasseler USA V R scriber point (item #H1621.11.008) and round (item #H52.11.003) carbide drill bits. When annual increments became relatively narrow (<0.1 mm) in senescent samples, other crossdated shell material was selected for micromilling, ensuring that a large enough sample (>100 lg) for isotopic analysis could be extracted. Sample replication resulted as a consequence of overlapping individual d 18 O shell records. For growing season analysis, eight equally spaced samples (>100 lg each) per year were collected from juvenile increments on the outer margin of one shell.\nAll micromilled samples were analyzed at the ISU Stable Isotope Laboratory for d mass spectrometer is 6 0.09& for d 18 O and 6 0.06& for d 13 C, respectively. National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference materials NBS19, NBS18, and LSVEC were used for isotopic corrections, and to assign the data to the appropriate isotopic scale. At least one of each reference standard was used for every six samples. Seawater samples were collected along a salinity gradient near Ing\u00f8ya where mixing between freshwater (i.e., snow melt and small seasonal streams) and seawater was observed (Fig. 2) . Additionally, several seawater samples were collected away from the influence of freshwater. Salinity was measured using a YSI Pro Plus Handheld Multiparameter Meter (precision 6 0.3 ppt). Seawater oxygen isotopic composition was measured on a Picarro L1102-i Isotopic Liquid Water Analyzer with autosampler and ChemCorrect software and a long-term precision of 0.07&. Reference standards OH-1, OH-2, and GISP were used for isotopic corrections. These measurements allowed characterization of the salinity-isotope relationship (mixing line) and thus estimation of seawater properties over the instrumental period. Temperature estimates were derived from d\n18 O shell using the aragonite temperature equation (1) Instrumental data Local sea surface temperature and salinity data were obtained from the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research's (IMR) oceanographic monitoring program (see: http://www. imr.no/forskning/forskningsdata/stasjoner/). A fixed hydrographic station 5 km north of Ing\u00f8ya (Fig. 2) has been sampled submonthly at various depths up to 300 m periodically since 1936 and continually since 1968 with several monthly to multi-year hiatuses. Data from NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (OISST v2; one-degree grid; Reynolds et al. 2002) , the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Surface Temperature data set (HadISST; one-degree grid; Rayner et al. 2003) , and other climate indices (below) were obtained via the online web application KNMI Climate Explorer (http://climexp.knmi.nl/), unless otherwise noted.\nTo supplement the local IMR data, two moorings were deployed in 2012 in the bay where A. islandica were collected (Fig. 2) . On one mooring, temperature and specific conductance (Onset HOBO Conductivity Logger) were recorded every hour 200 m east of the collection area at 5 m depth from June 2012 to August 2014. Another mooring in a deeper part of the bay recorded temperature and specific conductance at 5 m and temperature only at 30 m (Onset TidbTv2) over the same time period.\nThe AMO index as defined by van Oldenborgh et al. (2009) was used for statistical comparisons due to its inclusion of a narrower and more northerly range (258-608N, 78-758W) of North Atlantic SSTs compared with other indices. The AMO index subtracts the regression on global mean temperature as opposed to tropical and subtropical temperatures as in other indices, which we regard as more appropriate due to the far northerly, subpolar location of the study site.\nThe Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) mooring array AMOC series (2004-present) were obtained from http://www.rapid. ac.uk/rapidmoc/. The AMOC record integrates Florida Straits transport, Ekman transport, and upper mid-ocean transport to estimate net northward heat transport at 26.58N. The Strength of the Florida Current record (1981-present) is an extension of the Florida Straits Transport record used in the RAPID series. The data differ slightly in the period of overlap. The ECMWF (European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting) AMOC time series is based on simulations using data from the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System. The ECMWF represents a complex model that uses vertical water column characteristics inferred from modeled parameters to estimate AMOC strength.\nThe winter station-based NAO index was obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/). The index is based on the difference of seasonal normalized sea level pressure for the months December through March between Lisbon, Portugal, and Stykkisholmur/Reykyavik, Iceland since 1864."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods", "text": "Linear relationships between shell records and environmental indices were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of determination (r 2 ).

Monthly aggregated data at 5-m depth from both sources show a high degree of similarity (r 2 5 0.95, p < 0.0001) over the 25 months during which the data overlap (Fig. S1 , Supporting Information). Maximum monthly summer surface temperatures for both the mooring in the bay and the IMR station at 5 m depth were 10.78C. Minimum winter temperatures for the mooring and IMR station were 2.928C and 3.78C, respectively. The greater amplitude observed in the near-shore mooring compared with the off-shore IMR data are hypothesized to reflect the shallower water depth, and thus more effective heating and cooling, in the bay. The difference between the two records is well within the error of the temperature measurements derived from d 18 O shell and thus, the IMR station data is used as a reliable representation of the local growing environment. d 18 O shell temperature estimates of two subsampled annual increments were used to estimate the growing season of A. islandica at Ing\u00f8ya and evaluate evidence for equilibrium precipitation of aragonite with ambient seawater (Fig. 3 ).

The chronology is presented from 1900 to 2012 for consistency with availability of isotope data. Growth chronology statistics, however, are calculated over the period . EPS values averaging 0.89 indicate a statistically robust record over the length of the chronology (Fig. 4b) . Prior to 1880, lower sample depth reduces the average EPS to below 0.85 (Fig. 4b) , the dendrochronological standard threshold at which a chronology is considered to adequately reflect a common forcing (Wigley et al. 1984) . Interseries correlation (rbar; Fig. 4c ), another indicator of synchronous population growth, ranged from r 5 0.36 to r 5 0.73 and averaged r 5 0.52 throughout the chronology.

To verify that composite SST records reliably represent local SSTs and thus facilitate comparisons with more complete, gridded datasets (Fig. 5) , available IMR station data were compared with two gridded SST datasets (Table 1) . These comparisons showed a high degree of similarity between the measured SST and the gridded datasets (r 5 0.9220.97).\nThe annual MSC and d 18 O shell time series each show relatively strong, negative correlations with a broad swath of North Atlantic SSTs during the satellite era (Fig. 5a,b) .

Correlations between the shell-based records and various indicators of AMOC strength vary in sign and strength depending on the index used for comparison (Table 2) .\nO shell series, carrying roughly twice the weight of the MSC in modeling AMO variability, better preserves the low frequency variability that is characteristic of the AMO. The maximized correlation at a 2-yr lag also reflects the low frequency nature of the AMO, and while this relationship statistically accounts for 8% more variability than the relationship at no lag, we choose to focus our discussion on the latter. The lagged correlations may be better assessed by extending the shell records to span the entire length of the instrumental AMO record (1870-present) and is a topic for future work. The shell records at Ing\u00f8ya may provide useful insight into highlatitude impacts of AMO variability that are currently poorly documented . Extending the shell growth and geochemical records presented here may provide the paleoclimatic data necessary to confirm the long-term (multicentury) relationship between North Atlantic and Barents Sea climate variability (Levitus et al. 2009; Drinkwater et al. 2014) .\nO shell and Multiproxy AVE Indices and is maximized at a 5-6 yr lag ( Table 2) . The lag represents a reasonable amount of time it would take for AMOC to reach its influence at 718N. The Florida Current record (1982-present) , one of the only long-term instrumental records of a component of AMOC variability, does not significantly correlate with the shell records. The relationships may be confounded by the complex nature of AMOC north of 268N and its cascading effects leading to variations in shell growth, making such hypotheses difficult to test. The relationships presented here are for exploratory purposes and require further investigation to link AMOC forcing with environmental variability at Ing\u00f8ya.\nO shell , lower shell growth, and therefore a lower Multiproxy AVE Index within or following NAO1 years based on the temperature relationship previously discussed. Warmer waters associated with NAO1 lead to increased zooplankton abundance, reducing the food availability and food quality for bivalves (Witbaard 1996; Ottersen and Stenseth 2001) . Alternatively or congruently, we may expect increased metabolic activity in warmer waters to also contribute to reduced shell growth (Blicher et al. 2010) .\nDuring negative AMO phases (AMO-; i.e., 1900 -1925 and 1965 Alexander et al. 2014) , however, we observe a positive correlation between the 2-yr lagged NAO and the Multiproxy AVE Index. Thus, NAO1 years would be associated with increased shell growth, higher d 18 O shell , and therefore a higher Multiproxy AVE Index. Following the Polyakova et al. (2006) observation of NAO1 leading to cold SST anomalies during AMO-periods, contrasting the traditional NAO paradigm, it follows that NAO1 would also lead to increased shell growth, higher d 18 O shell , and therefore a higher Multiproxy AVE Index during AMO-periods. An additional mechanism that could explain NAO1 leading to increased shell growth at Ing\u00f8ya during AMO-may be related to the NAO's influence on the length of the growing season. NAO1 conditions may lead to increased wintertime cloud cover and higher air temperature, causing less oceanatmosphere heat loss (i.e., warmer wintertime SST; Ottersen and Stenseth 2001) . Increased winter SST may actually lead to prolonged bivalve activity and feeding through the winter. Metabolic demand may not greatly affect shell growth in wintertime temperatures. We therefore imply that food availability, while greatly reduced, is not the primary limiting factor for shell growth during wintertime. Wintertime active feeding has been observed in growth experiments using filtered ambient seawater without the addition of food (Liu pers. comm.), suggesting sufficient material is available yearround throughout the water column, and may be consumed by bivalves if temperature conditions permit activity. The hypotheses behind NAO forcing on shell growth at Ing\u00f8ya, while supported by much of the literature on the subject (i.e., Witbaard 1996; Ottersen and Stenseth 2001; Carroll et al. 2014) , require further testing through more detailed analyses of seasonal temperature variability, primary and secondary production, and bivalve activity in northern Norway.\nO shell . Combining the two proxy series into a multiproxy record significantly strengthens these correlations, suggesting that individually, they record different components of temperature variability. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that the shell based records do not significantly correlate with each other. The spatial pattern of correlation between shell records and large scale SST mimics the path of the NAC, emphasizing its role in modulating hydrography, climate, and ecological processes along Norway. The relationship between shell records and the NAO exhibits variability coincident with AMO variability. This is supported by literature citing complex interactions between NAO forcing on hydrographic variability (Polyakova et al. 2006 ). The results build on the current understanding of the controls on shell growth in the North Atlantic and provide an absolutely dated, annually resolved, 113-yr record that can be used to address larger questions of the dynamics and history of North Atlantic marine climate variability.

Synchronous growth for the A. islandica population at Ing\u00f8ya is evidenced by EPS values averaging > 0.85 from 1880 to 2012 ( Fig. 4b ; Wigley et al. 1984) . Mean sensitivity averages 0.421 over the chronology, a value higher than for many other published shell growth chronologies (Black et al. 2008; Butler et al. 2013) . Of the 15 shells harvested and determined to be > 50 yr in age, 10 of them easily crossdated into the chronology. The remaining shells were not easy to crossdate due to major or minor disturbance marks along the outer margin. In general, the population at the Ing\u00f8ya shallow water site is dense but patchy and not heavily preyed on, harvested, or disturbed by human activity, contributing to the success rate in obtaining high quality material suitable for crossdating."}, {"section_title": "SST and shell growth", "text": "Year-to-year variability in A. islandica shell growth rate arises from cumulative environmental effects on the animal through changes in temperature and food availability (Witbaard et al. 2003) . The magnitude of the observed response to environmental variability has been found to vary among different populations (Sch\u20ac one 2013). Variability in food supply and/or productivity dynamics can explain as much as 55-66% of the variance in shell growth rates (Witbaard et al. 2003; Wanamaker et al. 2009 ). Most studies find that temperature variability accounts for only 10-30% of the variance in shell growth rates (Sch\u20ac one et al. 2003; Butler et al. 2010; Sch\u20ac one 2013) .\nFor the A. islandica population at Ing\u00f8ya, local SST accounts for between 12% and 25% of the variability in shell growth rates depending on the months used to define the growing season. On a larger scale, however, shell growth rates share between 13% and 52% of variability with North Atlantic Sea Surface temperatures in the general path of the NAC (Fig. 5) , emphasizing the role of large-scale ocean dynamics in forcing local environmental variability and thus shell growth at Ing\u00f8ya. Thus, our analysis revealed that shell growth rates at Ing\u00f8ya better relate to large-scale SST than to local SST. This suggests that the combined influence of shallow water coastal processes, which are typically more dynamic compared with open ocean conditions, may cause the more variable shallow water signal to be partly time averaged during biomineralization. This observation underscores the complex interactions among local and large-scale temperature, productivity, and shell growth at the coastal setting of Ing\u00f8ya.\nA significant finding for the Ing\u00f8ya population is the inverse relationship between shell growth and SST, that is, increment widths are narrower during warmer years. This observation is seldom discussed in the literature for marine bivalves (Carroll et al. 2014 ) and suggests the need for further investigation into the controls on A. islandica shell HadISST (1900 HadISST ( -2012 0.92 (p < 0.01) 0.97 (p < 0.01) 1 growth at high latitudes. Located at the northernmost known extent of living A. islandica (Dahlgren et al. 2000; Carroll pers. comm.) , the population at Ing\u00f8ya likely exhibits increased sensitivity to environmental factors limiting growth. The inverse relationship may be caused by warmer temperatures leading to increased zooplankton abundance, greater herbivory on phytoplankton in the photic zone and, ultimately, reduced food availability and/or quality for bivalves (Ottersen and Stenseth 2001; Witbaard et al. 2003) . It is also possible that when seawater temperatures are relatively high, more energy will be consumed for metabolic functions. Hence, less energy is available for shell growth as has been postulated for scallops in Greenland (Blicher et al. 2010) . Thus, interactions among primary and secondary productivity dynamics and temperature/stratification processes propagate effects on the benthic community (Carroll et al. 2014 ). O shell variability explains nearly 25% of the interannual variability of local SST (r 5 20.513; p < 0.001). SST records across a broad swath of the North Atlantic (Fig. 5) share at least 36% of variability with d"}, {"section_title": "SST and", "text": "18 O shell (r 5 20.54 to 20.72; p < 0.05). The spatial pattern of correlation is similar to that of the shell growth/SST pattern of correlation, underscoring the mechanistic link between large-scale ocean dynamics and the signal recorded in shell growth."}, {"section_title": "Combined multiproxy record", "text": "Combining multiple proxy records is a common approach to reconstructing climate variability (Mann 2002; Gagen et al. 2006) . The benefit to this approach is in preserving low frequency information in shell growth records, a routine problem in dendrochronology (Esper et al. 2004 ). The detrending methods required to remove ontogenic trends from individual shell series results in what is commonly referred to as \"the segment-length curse\" (Cook et al. 1995) . Unless more sophisticated detrending techniques are used (i.e., regional curve standardization; Esper et al. 2004; Butler et al. 2010) , the lowest frequency cycles preserved in a detrended record are approximately 1/3 of the average series length (Cook et al. 1995) . Combining the higher frequency components contained in the shell growth chronology with the lower frequency information from another record not subject to such detrending results in a potentially more complete record of proxy variability. Reynolds et al. (2013) employed this principle by combining a Glycymeris glycymeris shell growth proxy record with a nearby sediment core d\n18 O foraminifera record to increase proxy sensitivity to North Sea temperature records. Black et al. (2009) recognized the utility of using multiple annually resolved proxies in providing a \"more holistic perspective\" of environmental variability. They found a more robust relationship with local and regional SST by combining a coastal geoduck shell growth chronology with a nearby tree-ring width chronology in the Pacific Northwest. Based on the differing lifespans of geoducks and trees (multidecadal vs. multicentury), the proxies were subject to different frequency signal loss (Black et al. 2009 ). Tree-ring studies routinely combine multiple proxies from within or among tree populations to achieve improved estimates of climate variables (e.g., Gagen et al. 2006 (Weidman et al. 1994; Sch\u20ac one et al. 2004; Wanamaker et al. 2008a ). The shell growth record at Ing\u00f8ya, while significantly correlated with temperature alone, is likely moderated by stratification dynamics and food availability, which in turn is heavily influenced by temperature conditions as well. Additionally, the timing of temperature changes may be more important than the temperature itself in modulating primary production and zooplankton dynamics, and in this way, may affect precisely when shell growth commences in the spring, the length of the growing season, and ultimately the total amount of shell growth per year. We may, therefore, hypothesize that the shell growth record contains additional information not contained within the d 18 O shell record and vice versa. High quality, long-term data on primary production and zooplankton dynamics are not available near Ing\u00f8ya making this hypothesis difficult to test. While the shell growth chronology and the d 18 O shell record both significantly correlate with local and large scale SST records, they are not significantly correlated with each other, further suggesting they individually record different aspects of hydrographic variability. As discussed at length by McCarroll et al. (2013) , several methods may be employed for producing a multiproxy record. One approach is to combine the series using weighted averages based on the temperature variance explained by each proxy (McCarroll et al. 2003) . This method requires the assumption that the relative strength of the climate signal in each proxy is relatively constant through time. Alternatively, multiple linear regression may be used to maximize the climate signal from the proxies under the assumption that the relationship between the proxy records is relatively constant through time (McCarroll et al. 2013 ). While such assumptions could be valid for the Ing\u00f8ya shell records, they are not tested here. A simpler approach involves z-scoring the indices to equalize variance and taking a simple average, avoiding some assumptions involved in the other methods (McCarroll et al. 2013) . Therefore, this method was chosen to create a Multiproxy AVE Index. Multiple linear regression on the AMO index was used for an additional assessment of the records."}, {"section_title": "AMO", "text": "The strategic location of the study site at the northern extent of the NAC and at the gateway to the Arctic links the local environment with large-scale North Atlantic processes and provides a mechanism that explains the strong relationship also observed between shell records and large-scale climate variability, especially the AMO index. Hydrographic conditions at Ing\u00f8ya are sensitive to minor variations in the strength of the NAC as a result of long-term density driven overturning circulation in the North Atlantic as well as shorter-term wind forcing of surface currents influencing the amount of Atlantic water entering the Barents Sea Opening (O'Dwyer et al. 2001; Smedsrud 2013) . The spatial pattern of correlation between shell records and North Atlantic SST (Fig. 5 ) and between local SST and North Atlantic SST (not shown) provide evidence for the primary influence of North Atlantic waters at the study site. While influence from the Norwegian Coastal Current certainly modifies local hydrography, evidence presented here suggests North Atlantic processes dominate the temperature signal. This is not surprising as NAC and Norwegian Coastal Current dynamics are both influenced by large-scale North Atlantic oceanic and atmospheric processes and are thus not independent of one another (Skagseth et al. 2011) .\nAtlantic water enters the Barents Sea between Norway and Bear Island and is the Barents Sea's primary oceanic heat source (e.g., Aksenov et al. 2010) . As Skagseth (2008) and Levitus et al. (2009) observed, multidecadal variability in Barents Sea water closely parallels the AMO index. They describe the climatic variation in the Barents Sea as a local manifestation of larger-scale North Atlantic climatic variation. This observation is supported by the shell records at Ing\u00f8ya. The relative weights of the multiple linear regression coefficients from Eq. 3 suggest the d"}, {"section_title": "AMOC", "text": "Comparison of Ing\u00f8ya shell records with AMOC is hindered by a lack of available records. No well-documented, long-term (>20 yr), annually resolved, continuous instrumental or proxy records of NAC behavior currently exist north of 608N (Bersch 1995; Hald et al. 2011) , despite the fact that the warming influence of Atlantic waters is increasingly being recognized as a major driver of change within the Arctic (Spielhagen et al. 2011; \u00c5 rthun et al. 2012) . The 2004-present RAPID Project's AMOC series across 268N represents one of the most complete instrumental records that integrates various components of Atlantic circulation at depth, however, the series is too short to lend confidence to the statistical relationship with shell records at Ing\u00f8ya. The same challenge exists in establishing the AMOC as the driving mechanism behind AMO variability. Observational evidence is not sufficient to statistically confirm the AMO-AMOC link resulting in a heavy reliance on evidence from modeling studies (Wei and Lohmann 2012; Alexander et al. 2014) . Furthermore, the complexity of overturning circulation north of 268N suggests the variability measured at this latitude may not be fully comparable at Ing\u00f8ya (718N) .\nIf the longer , model-based ECMWF AMOC record represents reality, the widely accepted hypothesis that a strengthened AMOC leads to positive SST anomalies across many parts of the North Atlantic may be contradicted, as a significant positive relationship is found between this record and d"}, {"section_title": "NAO", "text": "Running correlations between the NAO and the 2-yr lagged Multiproxy AVE Index exhibit oscillatory variability and coincide with variations in the AMO index (Fig. 7) , suggesting complex interactions between atmosphere and ocean forcing on the shell growth environment in northern Norway. While the traditional NAO paradigm predicts warmer (and wetter) conditions in this region during NAO1 years, recent work suggests this may not always hold. Polyakova et al. (2006) , building on Slonosky et al. (2001) , identified a variable relationship between the NAO and North Atlantic SST, surface air temperature, and sea level pressure over the past century. Spatial correlations were shown to be either largely positive or negative during distinct decadal time intervals of the 20 th century coinciding with multidecadal North Atlantic temperature variability (i.e., AMO). Spatial variations in the location and extent of NAO pressure centers are cited as the likely cause for shifts in NAO forcing (Jung et al. 2003; Drinkwater et al. 2013 ). An unsurprising manifestation of such shifts is the resulting effect on the benthic community.\nAlong with the present study, several other studies identify significant and/or oscillatory variability in the relationship between the NAO and biological proxy records (e.g., Carroll et al. 2009; Gamboa et al. 2010) .
