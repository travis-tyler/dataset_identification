[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Urban expansion is one of the most dramatic forms of land transformation in the world and it is one of the greatest challenges in achieving sustainable development in the 21 st century. Previous studies analyzed urbanization patterns in areas with rapid urban expansion while urban areas with low to moderate expansion have been overlooked, especially in developed countries. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion patterns in South Florida, United States (US) over the last 25 years (1992-2016) using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The main goal of this paper was to investigate the degree and spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion at different administrative level in the study area and how spatiotemporal variance in different explanatory factors influence urban expansion in this region. More specifically, this research quantifies the rates, types, intensity, and landscape metrics of urban expansion in Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area (Miami MSA) which is the 7th largest MSA and 4th largest urbanized area in the US using remote sensing (satellite imageries) data from National Land Cover Datasets (NLCD) and Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) at 30 m spatial resolution. We further investigated the urban growth patterns at the county and city areas that are located within this MSA to portray the local 'picture' of urban growth in this region. Urban expansion in this region can be divided into two time periods: pre-2001 and post-2001 where the former experienced rapid urban expansion and the later had comparatively slow urban expansion. Results suggest that infilling was the dominant type of urban expansion followed by edge-expansion and outlying. Results from landscape metrics represent that newly developed urban lands became more aggregated and simplified in form as the time progressed in the study region. Also, new urban lands were generated away from the east coast and historic cities which eventually created new urban cores. We also used correlation analysis and multiple linear stepwise regression to address major explanatory factors of spatiotemporal change in urban expansion during the study period. Although the influence of factors on urban expansion varied temporally, Population and Distance to Coast were the strongest variables followed by Distance to Roads and Median Income that influence overall urban expansion in the study area."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The level of urbanization went up by almost 80 percent in some parts of the world in 2003 including North America, Europe, and Australia and more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas today [1] . This number is expected to increase even more in the coming years. Urbanization is more intense and complex in the coastal areas given that they are more densely populated with higher [49] . NLCD data products are derived from Landsat imageries, geometrically and radiometrically corrected, and uses unsupervised classification method for the LULC classification. The LULC data provided by NLCD contains land cover and land cover change data for the entire United States with a 30 m spatial resolution. Land covers in NLCD are classified into several classes but the 8 broad categories are water, developed, barren, forest, shrubland, herbaceous, planted/cultivated, and wetlands. The overall accuracy of these datasets is 80% or more [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .\nTo be consistent with the temporal resolution of the dataset and keep it at a roughly 5-year temporal scale, we have also used land cover data sets for the year 1996 provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). This dataset covers the coastal portion of the NLCD datasets that contains LULC data with a 30 m spatial resolution and are based on Landsat imageries like NLCD. C-CAP data is also classified into several categories. The overall accuracy of these datasets is 85% or more [55] . Since the focus of this research is to examine the spatiotemporal change of the urban expansion in the study area, the NLCD and C-CAP data were re-classified into two land covers namely urban and non-urban using 'Raster Reclassification' tool in ArcGIS. Every land cover that is not urban was reclassified as non-urban. Table 1 shows a detailed description of different classes in NLCD and C-CAP datasets and the classes that were used in this research to define urban areas. Table 1 .

Not all these factors act as drivers or facilitators of urban land expansion. Some of the factors act as limiting factors of urban growth as well. For socioeconomic factors, we selected population and median household income as the explanatory factors of urban land expansion. For proximity factors that affect urban land expansion, we considered Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2493 6 of 29 distance to major roads and distance to coastal boundary, and for physical factors, we selected elevation of the study area. Table 2 shows a detailed description of these variables and their data sources. Based on available data, datasets for selected influential factors of urban expansion were derived for the study period (1992-2016) from different data sources. Population and income are important factors as part of the socioeconomic factors of urban expansion. 1 km gridded population datasets were derived for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 , and 2015 and used for subsequent study years (1990 data for study year 1992, 1995 data for study year 1996, and so on). Median household income data were derived at the block group level for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, 2011, and 2016. For the study year 1992 we used the 1990 data, 1996 we used the average of 1990 and 2000 data, 2001 we used 2000 data, 2006 we used the average of 2000 and 2010 data. Population and economic development (in this case, median income) are commonly used as a driving factor that facilitates urban expansion [46] . Urban expansion near the major roads is considered one of the most common patterns of urban expansion that guides urban growth [46] . As a result, it is expected that distance to major roads will have a negative effect on urban expansion. Both the primary and secondary roads were considered as major roads in this research. Major road data for the years 1990, 1993, 2000, 2007, 2011, and Since the study area is a coastal area, we considered distance to the coastal boundary as one of the proximity factors to urban expansion. Proximity to water, or in this case, the coast, affect urban expansion in two different ways: while urban expansion could be restricted by the presence of a water body (Atlantic Ocean for this study), it could also advance water resources and waterborne advantages to facilitate urban development at the same time [46] . Generally, people tend to live near the coast due to the high recreational value, which is evident in south Florida. Therefore, it is expected that distance to coastal boundary will have a negative impact on urban expansion in the study area. Based on the available data, coastal boundary in 2013 and 2016 were derived. Coastal boundaries in 2013 were used to represent the study years between 1992 and 2011, and 2016 were used to represent the study year in 2016. Since the factors like coastal boundary and elevation do not change much over time, we kept elevation constant for each year. \nFour of the five selected variables of urban expansion had strongly statistically significant relationships with the urban land areas during the study period (Section 3.6). Elevation, which was preliminarily selected as a physical factor of urban land expansion did not have significant relationship with urban land area in any study year . Since the land surface is almost flat throughout the study region and there is not much change in elevation from mean sea level in this region, this result was not surprising. The population had a very strong positive relationship with \nFour of the five selected variables of urban expansion had strongly statistically significant relationships with the urban land areas during the study period (Section 3.6). Elevation, which was preliminarily selected as a physical factor of urban land expansion did not have significant relationship with urban land area in any study year . Since the land surface is almost flat throughout the study region and there is not much change in elevation from mean sea level in this region, this result was not surprising. The population had a very strong positive relationship with urban land in all six study years since it is found as one of the most important socio-economic factors driving urban expansion in previous studies [36, 46] . Surprisingly, median household income did not have a very strong relationship with urban land expansion except in 2011 and did not even enter the regression models in year 1992, 1996, and 2016. This suggests that median income had very little to do in guiding urban expansion in this region. Unlike developing countries, people here in the US with high median household income tend to live outside of the urban core which might cause a weak statistical relationship with urban lands and median income. However, previous studies found other factors like gross domestic product (GDP), secondary and tertiary industry product, gross output of construction industry as factors of economic development that influence urban expansion [36, 46] . However, based on available data and spatial scale of the study area, median household income was selected as one of the socioeconomic factors that influence urban expansion in this study. Distance to Coast and Distance to Roads both had strong negative relationships with urban land in all the years which suggest that urban land area expanded within proximity to major roads and coastal boundary.\nPopulation and Distance to Coast had the strongest relationship with urban land in all the six models followed by Distance to Roads and Median Income except in 1992. In 1992, the population was the least strong variable. This is due to the increase in population in this area. According to US Census Bureau, the total population in Miami MSA was about 4,056,100 in 1990. In 2000, total population increased to 5,007,564 which is about 23.5% increase from 1990. In 2010, total population increased to 5,564,635 which is about 11.1% increase from 2000. In 2018, it is estimated that the total population is 6,198,782 which is 11.4% increase from 2010 in this region.\nIn previous studies, factors of urban expansion were analyzed either very briefly [61, 62] or using only socioeconomic factors [36] . In this research, we quantified the influence of socioeconomic, proximity, and physical factors on urban land expansion. However, these factors explained over 50% of the variation in urban land during the study period (1992-2016) and inclusion of other factors like urban planning and zoning, policies, hydrological factors, neighborhood impacts, etc., might improve the results."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Annual Urban Expansion Rate", "text": "Annual urban expansion rate (AUE a ) was calculated for the study area to examine the annual expansion rate of an urban area over the last 25 years. AUE a shows the temporal patterns of urban expansion in Miami MSA and the tri-county area distinctly. Along with AUE a , standardized annual urban growth rate (AUE s ) was also calculated. AUE s can be useful to compare the urban expansion rate between the three counties as it does not consider the impact of initial sizes of the counties [26] . The indexes that were used to calculate the AUE a and the AUE s are given below:\nwhere AUE a and AUE s are the annual urban expansion rate (km 2 year \u22121 ) and standardized annual urban expansion rate (%) from the year n to n + i, respectively. UA n+i and UA n are the total area of urban land (km 2 ) at the year n + i and n, respectively, and i is the difference between year n + i and n (years)."}, {"section_title": "Annual Expansion Type", "text": "It is really important to identify the different types of urban expansion in an area to successfully analyze the patterns of urban expansion [26] . According to Xu et al. (2007) [30] , there are three types of urban expansion that can be identified including outlying, edge-expansion, and infilling. Outlying urban expansion happens when the newly developed urban patch has no spatial connection with existing urban land, edge-expansion type denotes the new urban land that spreads out from the border of existing urban land, and infilling urban expansion occurs when the non-urban land that is surrounded by existing urban land converts to urban land [32] . However, outlying urban expansion could either follow a scattered or random development or it could be directed or guided by features like roads and canals. This pattern of outlying urban expansion with major roads in the study area was also explored in this research. Following Xu et al. (2007) [30] , an E index was created to identify different types of urban expansion in the study area using the following equation:\nwhere E means the type of urban expansion, L com is the length of the common edge between newly developed urban land and existed urban land, and P new is the perimeter of a newly developed urban land. The value of E ranges between 0 to 1. Urban expansion type is outlined as outlying when E = 0, edge-expansion when 0 < E \u2264 0.5 and infilling when E > 0.5."}, {"section_title": "Urban Expansion Intensity", "text": "Urban expansion intensity was calculated to examine the spatial distribution of urban expansion in the study area at 5-year temporal resolution using the index created by Sun et al. (2014) [26] , which is as follows:\nwhere UII i, t to t+n is the urban expansion intensity for spatial unit i between the time period t and t+n, UA i,t+n and UA i,t refer to the total urban land area of spatial unit i at the time t+n and t, respectively, and TA i denotes the total area of spatial unit i. In this research, the spatial unit is a 2 km \u00d7 2 km grid. The urban expansion intensities were classified into five groups by a custom standard including standard <10%, 10-20%, 20-40%, 40-70%, and 70-100%, which refer to the urban expansion intensity level of very low, low, moderate, rapid, and highly rapid, respectively. Four different metrics at class and landscape levels were calculated to see the impacts of urban growth in the study area. FRAGSTATS version 4.2 was used to calculate these metrics. Since the main objective of this research is to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of urban expansion over the last 25 years in the study area and there are a lot of metrics available, we chose four metrics to identify the shape, landscape and distribution of urban patches including Number of Patches (NP), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), and Area-weighted Mean Shape Index (SHAP_AM) [28] . NP was calculated using the 8-cell neighborhood rule in FRAGSTATS version 4.2. An increase in NP means a more fragmented urban surface while decrease in NP suggests opposite [57] . Similarly, increase in LPI means the increase in urban center, increase in LSI suggests a more complicated and irregular shape of urban patches, increase in SHAP_AM represents increasing complexity of urban land, and vice-versa [26] . NP, LSI, and SHAP_AM were calculated at class level and LSI was calculated at landscape level for urban land. Table 3 below shows the detailed description of these metrics. Identifying urban expansion directions helps to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of urban development. In this study, we used weighted mean center via ArcMap to depict the change in direction of urban expansion in each study year. In calculating the mean center of urban lands for each year, we used area (km 2 ) of urban patches as the weight. As a result, urban patches with larger areas get higher weight in calculating the mean center."}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing Urban Area", "text": "A linear correlation between the urban area and each of the five explanatory/independent variables was calculated. Then a regression model was created for each of the six study years. Urban area was considered as the dependent variable and variables of urban expansion with statistically significant relationship with urban area were considered as explanatory/independent variables. In doing this, 1 km \u00d7 1 km grids were created over the urban land areas of each year and the total urban area for each grid in each year was calculated to be consistent with the datasets used. Then the values from each influential factor of urban expansion were extracted for each grid each year using ArcMap."}, {"section_title": "Correlation Analysis", "text": "The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) was calculated between the urban land area and the explanatory factors of urban expansion using SPSS (version 26) at a 95% confidence interval.

Independent variables with statistically significant positive or negative correlation with the urban areas were considered only in the regression analysis. The stepwise method was chosen while running the multiple linear regression analysis since the stepwise regression method is a method of fitting regression models where the independent variables are automatically chosen and the influence of each independent variable to the model can be easily determined. Multicollinearity between the independent variables was also tested in each regression model using the Tolerance and Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) in correlation matrix. Generally, if the tolerance value is high (close to 1 and greater than 0) and VIF value is low (smaller than 4 but greater than 1), it is considered as low degree of multicollinearity [58] . Before running the multiple linear stepwise regression, the dependent and independent variables were normalized using the below equation to remove the effect of factor dimension and magnitude [36, 59] :\nwhere x' i is the normalized value of the ith cell of variable x, x i is the value of ith cell of variable x, x max is the maximum value of variable x, and x min is the minimum value of variable x.

To minimize the size effect, NP and LPI were divided by the respective MSA and County area. NP decreased from 1992 to 2001 and then it was stable for the Miami MSA. The three counties (PBC, BC, and MC) follows the same pattern. However, the highest value of NP was different for the three counties. PBC had the highest value of NP among these three counties followed by MC, and then BC. LPI increased rapidly from 1992 until 2001 in Miami MSA which means rapid urban expansion in this period. After 2001, LPI increased very slowly in this area. Although all the counties followed this pattern more or less exactly, BC among the three counties had the highest percentages of LPI in all the time periods. PBC had the lowest percentage of LPI at the beginning (1992). After 1996, it had higher percentages of LPI than MC. SHAP_AM, which measures the mean shape complexity of discrete patches, decreased from 1996 to 2001 in Miami MSA. indicates an increase in urban centers in the study area. The decreasing trend in LSI and SHAP_AM leads to simplified form of urban patches and land areas in the study area. The decreasing number of NP throughout the study period suggests that newly developed urban lands became more aggregated after 1992 in Miami MSA and in all three counties. After a sharp decrease until 2001, the rate of decrease in NP slowed down till the end (2016). Unlike NP, LPI increased during the entire study period at all administrative levels (MSA and County) which indicates an increase in urban centers in the study area. The decreasing trend in LSI and SHAP_AM leads to simplified form of urban patches and land areas in the study area. Although the mean center in the entire study period remained almost stable, there is clearly a westward turn in the mean center in this period. We then further explored the change in mean center of urban areas at the county level. Figure 10 shows the mean center change from 1992-2016 in PBC, BC, and MC. In PBC, the mean center of urban areas shifted towards southeast in 1992-1996. After 1996, there is a significant opposite turn in the mean center "}, {"section_title": "Urban Expansion Direction", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "The results of the correlation and regression analysis are portrayed in Table 5 .

The population was found as the variable that explains most of the variance in urban land area in each year except at the end (year 2016). In 2016, variable Distance to Coast was the most significant variable in explaining the total variance. In 1992 and 1996, Distance to Coast entered in the model as the second explanatory variable followed by Distance to Roads. Median Income was not an entry variable in the first two years' model (1992 and 1996) and last year's model (2016) . From 2001 to 2011, Distance to Coast was the second entry variable in each year's model followed by Distance to Roads and Median Income, respectively. In 2016, Population was the second entry variable in the model and Distance to Roads was the last to enter the model. Elevation (DEM) did not have any statistically significant strong correlation with urban land and therefore, elevation was not selected as one of the independent factors in the models. Since the land surface is mostly flat in the south Florida region and elevation does not change very frequently, our findings of elevation not having any strong relationship with urban land area are admissible.\nIn all models, Population, Distance to Coast, and Distance to Roads are accounted for approximately 90% of the total variation of urban land explained. Median Income was not found influential to the variation of urban land areas explained in 1992, 1996, and 2016. For the rest of the years (2001-2011), Median Income had a weak positive correlation with urban land areas and limited influence in explaining the variance in urban land areas. The population had a strong positive correlation with urban land areas and positive model coefficients in all the study areas indicating that higher population increases urban land areas in each of the study periods. Additionally, Distance to Coast and Distance to Roads had strong negative correlations with urban land areas and negative model coefficients in each year indicating that shorter distances from coast and major roads increase urban land areas regardless of the study year. High tolerance value (close to 1) and low VIF values (1<VIF>3) in the correlation matrix in each year's model suggest that there was a very low degree of multicollinearity among the independent variables.

The urban land area expanded around 1.37 times in 2016 than the initial land area in 1992 in Miami MSA (Section 3.1). However, urban expansion at the county level was different. Urban land in PBC expanded almost 1.52 times in 2016 than the initial size in 1992. Urban land expansion in BC and MC were comparatively slower than PBC but almost like each other (1.32 and 1.28 respectively) in this period. Urban land expanded rapidly during the period 1992 to 2001 in the Miami MSA and at the county level, especially between 1996-2001 when urban land expansion almost doubled than the previous study year (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) , but decreased dramatically afterward (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) in this region (Figure 3) . In late 1980s, this region experienced a rapid population growth due to industrial and economic development, which generated lavish job opportunities and attracted migrants from other parts of the country. These intra-national migrants along with booming tourism sector resulted thriving housing sector, and hotel and recreational facilities development. All these factors contributed to rapid urbanization in 1990s in the study area. However, population growth started to decline considerably since the beginning of 2000s. The population growth rate was found 23.5% between 1990 and 2000 in this region. However, between 2000 and 2010, this population growth rate declined to 11.4% in this area. Although the rate of population growth slowed down after 2000, it is estimated that population will still continue to increase in this region and therefore urban land expansion will further increase considerably after 2016 in the study area.\nThe types of urban expansion varied between the study periods in the study area (Section 3.2). While the urban expansion was isolated at the beginning (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) , it became more aggregated and showed clusters of urban lands in the following periods which might be related to the formation of infilling and edge-expansion types of urban growth [26, 30] . This compactness in urban expansion continued to increase with the increase of infilling expansion type in the Miami MSA and the three counties (Figures 12 and 13) . Interestingly, most of these urban expansions occurred outside of the most prominent and historic city boundaries in the study area ( Figure 13 ). Additionally, major roads of the ending year in each study period (e.g., 2016 roads for period 2011-2016) were used to see if the outlying expansion types were influenced/guided by roads ( Figure 12 ). Figure 12 shows that the outlying expansion types were rather dispersed/scattered in pattern than following or guided by the road networks in each year in Miami MSA. Similarly, most of the rapid and highly rapid urban expansion intensity grids were found between the years 1992 and 2001 (Section 3.3). After 2001, rapid and highly rapid expansion grids decreased dramatically as urban expansion rate slowed down substantially after 2001. Additionally, most of the moderate-highly rapid expansion grids were outside of the major city boundaries which are in line with above results. Urban expansion in the developed region causes a few problems including extreme land price increase, environmental pollution, and rapid rising of living costs which make people move outside of the city area to the suburban region [35] and eventually construct new urban cities/cores. Results from the landscape metrics are consistent with these findings (Section 3.4). The decreasing trend of NP, LSI, and SHAP_AM indicates that urban lands are becoming more aggregated and less complex than the past with their expansion as evidenced in previous studies [26] while continuous increase in LSI represents an increase in the urban center. This also suggests that many non-urban patches initially located in the urban areas might have been transformed into urban patches which are also evident in previous studies [57] . Additionally, a decrease in NP and increase in LPI is an indication of infilling expansion type along with aggregated development [57] . Since infilling expansion type is dominant during the whole study period, along with a continuous decreasing trend in NP and increasing trend in LPI, our results of a more aggregated form of urban expansion process with simplified form of urban lands are reasonable.\nFurthermore, urban land expansions are moving away from the east coast of the study area and directed towards the west (Section 3.5), which is evident in mean center of urban lands from 1992-2016 (Figures 9 and 10) . Although very slowly, this westward turn of mean center of Miami MSA and the three counties proves our previous hypothesis that urban lands are expanding towards suburb region (west side) of the study area since the east part of the study area are already developed. Being very near to the coastline which poses high recreational value and better transportation access, demands on Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2493 21 of 29 land parcels are extremely high on the east side of the study region and eventually the land prices are skyrocketing. All these reasons might be responsible for the urban lands expanding toward west part of the study area and away from the east coast. With the increasing conversion of nonurban lands to urban land, it will be extremely difficult to protect the environment and biodiversity in the coming years [14, 15, 60] . "}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study and Future Work", "text": "To retrieve information about urban land and urban expansion at a finer scale, high spatial resolution imagery like QuickBird and Lidar could be used in the future. Due to the unavailability of those high spatial resolution imageries for the entire study year (1992-2016) in our study area, we used moderate resolution (30 m) land cover maps in this study. This research is limited to the horizontal expansion of urban lands only. However, previous studies found that urban expansion is not necessarily limited to horizontal dimension and urban areas could also be expanded vertically [63, 64] . Investigating the vertical expansion of urban areas in the study area could help understand the urban growth dynamics more profoundly in future. To understand the effects of urban expansion on non-urban lands, analyzing the relationship between urban expansion and the loss of agriculture, protected and reserved areas would be useful for this region. Since the physical factor used in this research does not have any statistically significant relationship with urban land area, other physical factors like soil characteristics, flood risk zones, physical features like schools and entertainment facilities, etc., could be used in future for a comprehensive analysis of influential factors of urban expansion in the study area. Besides, other factors of urban expansion like hydrological factors, policy, and building codes, development control zones, etc. should be used in explanatory factor analysis in future. Additionally, since the study area region has always been a target of hurricanes over the past few decades, analyzing the impact of hurricane damages on urban land expansion in this area could be advantageous."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Urban expansion is one of the most irretrievable land transformation processes in the world and poses major impacts on the environment and challenges for the entire world at global, regional, Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2493 25 of 29 and local scale. There is still a lack of research that focuses on urban expansion process at local scale in the US. Being a developed country, less attention has been paid on the dynamics of urban expansion in this region than necessary and timely monitoring and evaluation of urban land expansion is extremely important.\nIn this study, we used NLCD data and C-CAP data combined with urban growth type and landscape metrics analysis to quantify the dynamics of the spatiotemporal pattern of urban expansion in the moderately developed Miami MSA. We then further extended our analysis to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of urban growth at the county level and compared the results between the three counties (PBC, BC, and MC) that are located within the MSA area. More specifically, we analyzed and compared the spatial and temporal distribution of urban expansion rate, pattern, expansion types, urban expansion intensity, and landscape metrics. Results suggest that this region experienced a moderate but noticeable urban expansion over the last 25 years. Urban expansion in this region can be divided into two phases: pre-2001 phase when urban expansion rate was very rapid in this MSA and post-2001 phase when urban expansion rate was moderate/slow. Urban expansion at the county level was almost the same as the MSA where the overall annual urban expansion rate in PBC was the highest (16.15 km 2 year \u22121 ) followed by BC and MC (9.08 and 9.04 km 2 year \u22121 , respectively). The standardized annual urban growth rate for PBC, BC, and MC are 1.68%, 1.13%, and 0.97%, respectively, which suggests a moderate urban expansion overall in these counties.\nSimilarly, infilling was the dominant expansion type in all the study periods in the MSA and in all three counties. Additionally, they all followed the same pattern of decreasing amount of NP and LSI from the beginning of the study period (1992) which suggests that as the urban land expanded and time progressed in this region, they became more aggregated and simplified. Another interesting finding from the analysis was that the newly developed urban lands were generated away from the east coast in this region over the entire study period which was further corroborated by mean center analysis.\nAs per the cities were concerned, it was evident that the newly developed urban lands were moving away from the major historical and prominent cities in this region. As urban growth creates pressure on the existing population and increases the cost of living and environmental pollution, people might have forced to move away from the city areas to sub-urban areas and eventually created new 'urban cores'. Statistical analysis of the major explanatory factors of urban expansion reveals that Population and Distance to Coast had strongest relationships with urban lands where the former had a positive relationship and latter had a negative relationship. Distance to Roads was another variable that had a strong relationship with urban lands followed by Median Household Income in this region. With continuous population growth and economic development, dealing with urban expansion and environment and biodiversity protection in this region would be perplexing in the coming years. Future research should emphasize the improvement of the spatial and spectral resolution of remote sensing data in order to more accurately portray the urban expansion patterns and should include additional factors of urban expansion including that are used in this research to explain the urban expansion characteristics comprehensively. Finally, the methods and techniques utilized in this research could be applied in future studies focusing on the urban expansion patterns in other metropolitan areas.
