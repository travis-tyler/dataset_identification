[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The ability of startup firms to innovate and grow is not only vital to their own success, but also fundamental to long-term economic growth, job creation, and a dynamic economy (Schumpeter, 1943;Kirzner, 1973;Decker et al., 2014). Successful startup firms often introduce new or improved products into the economy, implement new technologies in the production and distribution of goods and services, or find ways to more efficiently harness existing technologies to satisfy consumer demands. Startups not only bring about innovation through their own entrepreneurial activities, but also act as a competitive force that spurs established firms in technologically sophisticated industries to increase innovation themselves (Aghion et al., 2009). Startups exhibit an \"up-or-out\" dynamic, with most startups failing, but a small fraction exhibiting rapid growth and contributing disproportionately to overall job creation in the economy (Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda, 2013;Decker et al., 2014). Previous research suggests that firm entry has persistent effects on US economic growth, and that the decrease in the rate of firm entry during the Great Recession may have contributed to the slow recovery (Gourio, Messer, and Siemer, 2016;Clementi and Palazzo, 2016). Beyond the Great Recession, Decker et al. (2014) document both a decline in the startup rate and business dynamism in the US economy since the 1980s, with Decker et al. (2016) finding that this decreased dynamism has accompanied a decline in the share of high-growth young firms in the economy since 2000. Given the important role of startups in spurring innovation and job creation, restrictive visa policies that make it harder for these firms to attract high-end talent could reduce innovation and growth in the economy as a whole. Foreign STEM doctorates are an increasingly prevalent source of high-end talent. The National Science Foundation (2019) reports that foreign doctorates with temporary visas are more likely than US doctorates to have a degree in a STEM field, with temporary resident doctorates representing over half of all PhDs awarded in 2018 in the broad fields of Engineering (57%) and Mathematics and Computer Sciences (55%), and with the proportion in these fields -and in Physical Sciences -rising over time. China and India are the largest sources of foreign-born doctorates graduating in the US, and the overwhelming majority of these doctorates receive degrees in STEM fields. 1 Among the most popular pathways for industry-employed foreign STEM doctorates to secure permanent residency in the US is by obtaining an employer-sponsored EB-2 visa (\"green card\"). In October 2005, STEM doctorates from China and India began to face multiple-year delays in the processing of their EB-2 visa applications due to newly-binding limits on the number of permanent residency visas available to those emigrating from these countries. The emergence of these delays increased the risk that an employer-sponsor would go out of business prior to the completion of the permanent residency application process, in which case the foreign STEM doctorate would need to secure a new employer with which to restart the lengthy EB-2 visa process. Since startup firms are more likely than established firms to shut down in the near-term, it is plausible that the emergence of visa delays reduced the desirability of working at startups relative to established firms for those doctorates impacted by visa delays. In this paper, I use a difference-in-differences (DD) approach to estimate the impact of EB-2 visa delays on the propensity of foreign STEM doctorates to work in startup firms early in their career, conditional on being employed by any for-profit business in the US within ten years of graduation. I find that the announcement of impending EB-2 visa delays in fiscal year (FY) 2005 decreased the propensity of Chinese and Indian STEM doctorates to work in startup firms within ten years post-PhD by 7.2 percentage points (42%). 2 This result is consistent with previous research by Roach and Skrentny (2019) who find that foreign STEM doctorates whose first job is in industry are as likely as US STEM doctorates to apply for and receive offers from startup firms, but conditional on receiving an offer, are about half as likely as US-born STEM PhDs to accept a position at a startup. Roach "}, {"section_title": "and Skrentny", "text": "1 See Figures 9 and 3 in National Science Foundation (2019), respectively. The number of temporary resident doctorate residents graduating in the US between 2009 and 2018 were concentrated among the top three countries of origin: China, India, and South Korea. These three countries accounted for 54% of all temporary visa holders receiving a doctorate from a US university over this time span. 2 This represents an estimate of the causal impact of visa delays on the propensity to work in startup firms assuming common trends between STEM doctorates impacted by visa delays and those doctorates not impacted. (2019) conjecture that visa policy is a likely explanation for their descriptive finding, and this paper's findings supports their hypothesis by showing that changes in visa policies cause changes in the likelihood that industry-employed foreign STEM doctorates work in startups. If US STEM doctorates fill the positions at startups that foreign STEM doctorates pass over due to permanent residency delays, should we expect any meaningful impact on the success of startup firms? 3 Previous literature suggests that high-skilled workers entering the US on student or temporary work visas have increased levels of patenting relative to natives (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010;Hunt, 2011), and that startups with higher win rates in the H-1B visa lottery (i.e., that are more successful at hiring H-1B workers) are more likely to receive additional venture capital funding, receive more patents and patent citations, and have a successful exit via an IPO or acquisition (Dimmock, Huang, and Weisbenner, 2019). Kerr and Kerr (2020) highlight the importance of immigration policy to US innovation and entrepreneurship, noting that immigrants from China and India are the main drivers behind the growth in immigrant entrepreneurship and innovation in the US, with immigrants accounting for about a quarter of US entrepreneurship and innovation. Therefore, restrictive high-skilled immigration policies may reduce the rate of innovation at startup firms and their contribution to overall US economic growth, even if US STEM PhDs are able to fill these vacancies. Restrictive high-skilled immigration policies may not just reduce the success rate of startups, but may also deter startup formation, either because a would-be entrepreneur decides not to start a business due to reduced access to high-skilled labor, or because foreign highskilled workers face significant barriers to starting their own independent business directly after graduation. 4 Anecdotal evidence suggests that such barriers are likely to reduce the rate of innovation and growth of the US economy as foreign-born immigrants have played a substantial role in founding many of the most successful US startups during the \"Big Tech\" era, among them Paypal cofounder and Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Paypal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin. 5 Beyond these high-profile examples, a growing body of research finds evidence of an immigrant advantage in entrepreneurial ability and innovative activity. Hunt (2011) finds that immigrants are more likely than natives to start a company conditional on education, suggesting a niche for immigrants in founding firms based on specialized technical knowledge from master's and doctoral degrees. Kahn, La Mattina, and MacGarvie (2017) find that immigrants have higher rates of scientific entrepreneurship than natives, with this immigrant premium increasing in ability. Kerr and Kerr (2020) note that over half of the entrepreneurs in the San Francisco Bay area are foreign-born and find that firms with immigrant owners are more likely than firms exclusively owned by natives to be engaged in R&D and patenting. Brown et al. (2020) report similar results, finding that immigrant-owned firms in the high-tech sector exhibit higher rates of innovation across 15 of 16 innovation measures. The effects of policies designed to increase high-skilled immigration remain a hot topic for public debate and economic research. Proponents may point to studies showing that foreign high-skilled labor is a fundamental input to innovation and productivity growth (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010;Hunt, 2011;Ghosh, Mayda, and Ortega, 2016;Peri, Shih, and Sparber, 2015b), and that the wages and employment of both high-skilled and low-skilled native workers are not harmed -and may even improve -since foreign high-skilled workers are a complement, rather than a substitute, for native high-skilled workers (Peri, Shih, and Sparber, 2015a). On the other side, opponents can point to studies showing that foreign high-skilled labor displaces US high-skilled labor (Borjas and Doran, 2012;Doran, Gelber, Startup Visa. and Isen, 2016), reduces the wages of these US workers (Borjas, 2009;Doran, Gelber, and Isen, 2016), and does not significantly impact firm innovation (Doran, Gelber, and Isen, 2016). From one lens, the calls from leaders in big tech to relax restrictions on high-skilled immigration is a plea to loosen a restraint holding back firm innovation and overall economic growth; from another lens, these pleas for increased access to foreign high-skilled labor come from a desire to earn higher profits by slowing down the growth in wages of high-skilled US workers. 6 Given the contentious nature of the public debate and the conflicting findings of different researchers, additional studies analyzing the impact of high-skilled immigration visa policy on US firms, US workers, and the high-skilled immigrants themselves are necessary to better inform policymakers considering changes to these policies. The findings in this paper suggest that reducing barriers to permanent residency for foreign-born STEM doctorates would enhance the ability of startup firms to attract high-end talent, which in turn might improve the ability of startups to innovate, grow, and compete with established firms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the path to permanent residency for STEM PhDs and discusses previous research utilizing changes in visa policies to identify the impact of these policies on the behavior of foreign-born students and workers. Section 3 describes the data used in this paper -the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) linked with the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) -and details the formation of the analytical sample. Section 3 also outlines the difference-in-differences identification strategy used in this paper, and Section 4 reports the results along with various robustness checks. Section 5 discusses details related to the results, and Section 6 gives the main conclusions of this paper and provides future avenues for research. 6 Examples of tech leaders in favor of relaxing H-1B restrictions include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates (https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88154016) and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt (https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/04/technology/eric-schmidt-h1b-visa/).

International students in the US are typically supported by their universities under the F-1 visa program. Unlike H-1B visas and EB-2 visas, the number of F-1 visas issued in any fiscal year is not subject to a statutory cap. The F-1 visa allows international students graduating in the United States a limited period where they can use their F-1 visa to work for a US firm after graduation, which is known as the Optional Practical Training (OPT) period. The OPT period has historically lasted a maximum of 12 months, but in April 2008 the OPT period was extended an additional 17 months for foreign students receiving STEM bachelor's or graduate degrees from US universities. In May 2016, the OPT extension for STEM students was increased from 17 months to 24 months so that a foreign STEM student could spend up to three years employed in the US while remaining in F-1 status. To remain working in the US after the OPT period has expired, foreign workers on F-1 status must find an employer to sponsor an H-1B visa. 7 The H-1B visa program began in 1990 with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This program enables foreigners with a US bachelor's degree or its foreign-equivalent, known as \"specialty workers\", to obtain temporary employment in the United States. For many high-skilled immigrants, obtaining an H-1B visa represents an important steppingstone on the path towards achieving US permanent residency. Ever since its inception, the number of H-1B visas available in each fiscal year has been subject to a statutory cap. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the H-1B cap over time. For fiscal years 1990 to 1998, the annual 7 A notable exception exists for STEM doctorates seeking employment as a postdoc, who may do so either through an H-1B visa or a J-1 visa. The J-1 visa is not subject to a statutory cap, has a five-year limit, and typically requires the STEM doctorate to return to their home country for at least two years after their J-1 employment. See https://www.nationalpostdoc.org/page/QGV_FAQ_public for a comparison of the J-1 visa and H-1B visa. H-1B visa cap was set at 65,000 workers. During this period, the cap was only met in FY 1997 and 1998, precipitated by the rise of the technology sector during the dot-com boom. In response to this increased demand, the cap was temporarily increased to 115,000 for FY 1999-2000 by the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA), and then temporarily increased again to its highest level of 195,000 in FY 2001of 195,000 in FY -2003 the passage of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (AC-21). Congress failed to renew the temporary cap of 195,000 workers put in place by AC-21 by FY 2004, and so the cap reverted to its initial level of 65,000 visas. Congress subsequently passed the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 which mandated that starting in FY 2005, 20,000 additional visas -referred to as Advanced Degree Exempt (ADE) H-1B visas -would be reserved for foreigners who had earned a master's degree or higher from a US institution of higher education, effectively setting the cap at 85,000 visas. The H-1B visa cap has been met every year since the FY 2004 drop in the cap, and since the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004, there have been no changes in the level of the cap. 8 Before applying for an H-1B visa, foreign-born workers wishing to obtain employment into specialty occupations in the US must first obtain a job offer from a US employer -this employer then acts as a sponsor during the multi-step H-1B application process. First, the employer must file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the US Department of Labor that describes the occupation for which the foreign worker seeks employment, including the wage offered by the employer and the \"prevailing wage\" for the occupation, as determined by the Department of Labor based on occupational title and location of work. 9 In an effort to prevent crowding out of native workers by cheap foreign labor, the employer is mandated 8 The Obama Administration supported an effort to streamline the permanent residency process for immigrants receiving an advanced STEM degree in the US by \"stapling\" a green card to each diploma for those able to find employment in the US (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/immigration/ streamlining-immigration). This policy would eliminate the need for foreign STEM doctorates to participate in the H-1B program, and thus make them immune to the H-1B visa cap. Such a policy would also eliminate the EB-2 permanent residency visa delays that have consistently faced foreign STEM doctorates from China and India, and could also increase the labor mobility and bargaining power of these workers since they would no longer need to rely on an employer-sponsor to achieve permanent residency in the US. 9 An LCA for an H-1B worker is filed using Form ETA-9035 & 9035E. to pay the higher of the actual offered wage and the prevailing wage. If the LCA is approved by the Department of Labor, then the employer can submit an H-1B visa application (Form I-129), along with the approved LCA and the $460 filing fee, to the Department of Homeland Security's US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). If the application is processed and approved by USCIS, then the foreign worker receives the H-1B visa which authorizes the worker's employment at that employer-sponsor for three years, with the possibility of a renewal for an additional three years. The first day of the H-1B application period in every fiscal year is April 1 of the previous year (e.g., April 1, 2005 was the first day of the FY 2006 H-1B application period). In \"normal\" years, H-1B visas are allocated on a first-come first-serve basis until the day the cap is reached. On the day that the number of H-1B applications first exceeds the visa cap, the USCIS randomly chooses which applications received on that day are approved -once they approve enough applications to meet the cap, the rest are rejected. 10 In FY 2008FY -2009 and FY 2014-2020, the visa cap was met within the first week of the H-1B application period. The USCIS responded to this situation in each of these years by subjecting all H-1B visa applications received by the date that the cap was reached to a random lottery, instead of just those applications received on the day the visa cap was reached. 11 It is important to note that not all H-1B visa applications are subject to the cap. First, applications for H-1B renewals are not subject to the cap. This includes annual H-1B visa extensions that are granted to foreign workers whose employers have already applied for permanent residency on their behalf, but who are waiting for their application to be pro-10 For example, pooling across FY 2006 and 2007, H-1B applications on the day the cap was reached totaled 7,243, of which 4,180 applications were chosen for acceptance via random lottery (Doran, Gelber, and Isen, 2016). 11 The two-tiered H-1B lottery has typically been conducted by the USCIS as follows: First, the USCIS allocates 20,000 Advanced Degree Exemption (ADE) H-1B visas via a random lottery to employees meeting the requirement of having received a US master's degree or above. After these 20,000 ADE H-1B visas are randomly selected for processing, any visas left over in the ADE pool are placed into the regular H-1B visa pool before the USCIS randomly selects 65,000 of these H-1B visa applications for processing. In FY 2020, USCIS reversed the order of these lotteries so that the lottery for the 20,000 ADE visas now occurs after the lottery for the other 65,000 visas. See Pathak, Rees-Jones, and S\u00f6nmez (2020) for a detailed discussion and analysis of the different H-1B visa allocation policies pursued by the USCIS since FY 2005. cessed. 12 Second, foreign workers from five countries -Canada, Mexico, Chile, Singapore, and Australia -with which the US has a free trade agreement are effectively exempt from the H-1B visa cap due to the existence of close H-1B visa substitutes available for foreigners from these countries. 13 Third, the passage of AC-21 made it so that starting in FY 2001, H-1B visa applications submitted by institutions of higher education and other non-profit research institutions, including government research institutions, are not subject to the visa cap. After receiving an H-1B visa from an employer, a foreign worker wanting to obtain a green card will have to find an employer -typically the current employer -that is willing to sponsor them for permanent residency. 14 To sponsor a temporary worker for permanent residency, the employer must file a Permanent Employment Certification (PERM) with the Department of Labor, much in the same way as an LCA is required for H-1B workers. 15 After receiving a PERM, the employer can then file an Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers (Form I-140) with USCIS. Upon receiving the Form I-140 and a $700 filing fee, the USCIS assigns the date of receipt as that application's \"priority date.\" Before processing a Form I-140, the USCIS must ensure that there are enough EB-2 visas available to be given out in the given fiscal year. 16 There are typically 140,000 employment- 12 If a worker has applied for permanent residency, but their H-1B renewal period runs out before permanent visa delays are resolved, they are able to apply for annual H-1B visa extensions until permanent residency is achieved so long as the application for permanent residency was filed prior to the sixth year of the H-1B visa. 13 Specialty workers from Canada and Mexico gained access to the TN visa in 1994, specialty workers in Singapore and Chile gained access to the H-1B1 visa starting in 2004, and specialty workers from Australia gained access to the E-3 visa starting in 2005. All three of these H-1B substitute visa classes were created as part of free trade agreements. The annual caps associated with the H-1B1 and E-3 visa classes have never been reached, and there exists no cap on TN visas. 14 Argueta (2016) shows that almost all EB-2 visas granted between FY 2004 and FY 2014 were for those individuals already in the US when applying for permanent residency (pg. 6). See Argueta (2016), Kandel (2018), and Witsman (2018) for in-depth discussion of permanent residency and per-country caps. 15 A PERM for a worker is filed using Form ETA-9089. 16 I use \"processing\" here to mean both the acceptance of the Form I-140 by USCIS and the provision of a visa number to the applicant so that the applicant can file for an adjustment of status using Form I-485. Typically, a visa delay manifests by a person having their Form I-140 accepted, but not being able to receive a visa number due to insufficient visas available in that fiscal year (Jasso et al., 2010). While the USCIS would consider the Form I-140 as having been processed upon acceptance or rejection of the Form I-140, for simplicity I refer to the completion of processing of the Form I-140 as that point in time when the applicant is able to receive a visa number from USCIS that can be used to file Form I-485. based permanent visas available each fiscal year. Of these, 40,040 are reserved for \"First Preference\" EB-1 visas which are used for persons of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors and researchers pursuing a job in higher-education, and multinational managers and executives. Another 40,040 are reserved for \"Second Preference\" EB-2 visas which are used for persons with an advanced degree or those of exceptional ability -these are the visas typically used by industry-employed STEM PhDs to achieve permanent residency status. 17 It is important to note that there is a limit on the number of permanent residency visas available to be allocated to any single country. This per-country limitation is equal to 7% of the maximum number of family-based plus employment-based visas allowed to be issued worldwide in the fiscal year, which has amounted to a per-country cap of about 25,620 visas in recent years (Witsman, 2018). If the number of applications sent from members of a given country exceeds the number of visas it can be granted in a fiscal year, those applications in excess are put into a queue to be processed as more visas become available, where applications within each country-of-origin are processed in the order of the application's priority date. China and India both faced EB-2 visas delays for some months during the 1990's, but stopped facing visa delays starting in May 2001 due to the passage of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (AC-21) wherein countries exceeding their 7% cap were able to claim additional visas so long as these additional visas were available within the worldwide limit -meaning that these visas were left over due to insufficient demand from other countries. From May 2001 through September 2005, the priority date used to process Form I-140 was \"current\" in each month, meaning that no country faced EB-2 visa delays. However, as shown in Figure 2, the priority date and visa bulletin date for EB-2 visa applications from both China and India began to diverge in October 2005, meaning 17 See https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/ employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1 for criteria that defines what is meant by a person of extraordinary ability or an outstanding professor/researcher. See https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/ employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2 for a definition of an individual with an advanced degree or of exceptional ability. Note that a doctoral degree is not required to apply for an EB-2 visa. If the number of EB-1 visas applied for and granted is below 40,040, then the surplus of EB-1 visa spots is allocated to the EB-2 program. that EB-2 applicants from these countries would begin facing significant processing delays, while individuals from other countries would only face a few short-lasting EB-2 visa delays between FY 2005 and 2017. 18 With the introduction of visa delays, taking a job at a startup firm after graduation would become riskier for STEM doctorates from China and India since startups are more likely to go out of business in the near-term compared to established firms. If the employer goes out of business prior to the temporary worker having his/her Form I-140 processed, then that worker would need to restart the entire permanent residency process with another employer and get in the back of the line. 19 Once the Form I-140 is processed and USCIS issues a visa number for the application, individuals seeking permanent residency status must file Form I-485 along with a $1,140 filing fee so USCIS can adjust their status to that of a permanent resident. 20 Form I-485 applicants must first undergo an FBI name and fingerprint check before USCIS can approve the application. Once Form I-485 is approved, the individual will have achieved permanent resident status and will receive a green card, at which point they will no longer need to worry 18 Immigrants from the rest of the world faced visa delays during the following months between FY 2005 and 2017: September 2007, July 2012 to October 2012, August 2016 to September 2016, and August 2017 to September 2017. See https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/ visa-bulletin.html for monthly visa bulletins showing the priority date used for processing EB-2 visa applications during the given month. For China and India, there are several cases where the priority date used for EB-2 visa processing moved backwards (\"retrogression\"); for example, for India the priority date used as the processing cutoff in May 2009 was 02/15/2004, and then in June 2009 the processing cutoff retrogressed to 01/01/2000. Visa retrogression typically occurs later in a fiscal year when the USCIS forecasts that a given country will go over the per-country cap if the processing cutoff is not moved back in time. When a new fiscal year starts, the priority date used as the processing cutoff typically goes to a date comparable to the cutoff used before retrogression occurred. 19 In January 2017, new USCIS rules were enacted to improve the job portability of temporary workers with approved I-140 petitions. Among these were the general enabling of a temporary worker to retain the priority date of their first accepted I-140 petition, allowing these workers \"to accept promotions, change employers, or pursue other employment opportunities without fear of losing their place in line for immigrant visas.\" Another new rule allows temporary workers with a Form I-140 that has been approved for at least 180 days to retain their accepted Form I-140 in cases where their employer goes out-of-business. See https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/ retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled for details. 20 Individuals may delay filing a Form I-485 if they are currently out of the country or are waiting to first get married so that their spouse would be eligible to use their own green card case to file a Form I-485. Waiting to file a Form I-485 is risky for those emigrating from China or India due to the possibility of retrogression in priority dates used as processing cutoffs. about having an employer-sponsor to remain legally in the US. 21 Figure 3 shows the number of EB-2 visas issued in FY 2000 to FY 2019 to residents from China, India, and the rest of the world. 22 As we can see, the number of EB-2 visas granted to temporary residents from the rest of the world approximately doubled between the passage of AC-21 in FY 2001 andFY 2006. This resulted in the onset of visa delays for China and India starting in FY 2006 due to a decrease in the number of surplus permanent residency visas available under the global cap to be claimed by residents from these countries with binding per-country caps. 23 Note that while more EB-2 visas tend to be issued to India compared to China, the number of Chinese temporary residents that graduate with a PhD in the US is more than double that of India for these same years, which suggests that most EB-2 recipients from India lack doctoral degrees or are possibly trained outside the US (National Science Foundation, 2010, 2019 "}, {"section_title": "Previous Literature on the Impact of Visa Policy on Foreign", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Student and Worker Behavior", "text": "The FY 2004 reduction in the H-1B visa cap has been exploited by various researchers using difference-in-differences approaches: The drop in the visa cap reduced the quality of prospective undergraduate students from abroad (Kato and Sparber, 2013), reduced the quantity of international enrollments by 10% (Shih, 2016), and increased the number of international students entering careers in academia (Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado, 2019). Additionally, the decrease in the cap reduced the employment of new H-1B workers in forprofit firms and redistributed H-1B visas toward computer-related occupations, Indian-born workers, and large firms that are heavy users of the H-1B program (Mayda et al., 2018). A similar line of research exploits the April 2008 17-month extension of the optional practical training (OPT) program for students with degrees in STEM fields. The OPT program allows foreigners with F-1 nonimmigrant student visas to obtain employment in the US after graduation without needing an H-1B visa, so long as the employment is directly related to the field of their degree. The STEM OPT extension increased the likelihood that foreign STEM students would use the OPT to initially stay in the US post-graduation, increased the likelihood that the foreign student would transition to a work visa, and induced international students to increasingly pursue STEM majors (Demirci, 2019;Amuedo-Dorantes, Furtado, and Xu, 2019). A new body of research considers the impact of permanent residency delays on the labor market choices of foreign STEM doctorates. Khosla (2018) and Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) both find that the binding limits on EB-2 visas for STEM doctorates from China and India are associated with declines in the stay rates of these doctorates. Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) find that Chinese doctorates are 2.1 percentage points less likely to remain in the US for each year of delay, while Indian doctorates are only impacted by long delays, with those facing delays of at least 5.5 years exhibiting a 10.6 percentage point decrease in the stay rate. Another strand of this research considers the impact of permanent residency wait times on the labor mobility of green card applicants. Hunt and Xie (2019) and Wang (2020) both find that workers exhibit a sudden increase in job transition rates upon receiving permanent residency, and Wang (2020) finds that this response is greater for Chinese and Indian workers, which suggests that the permanent residency application process reduces job PRELIMINARY DRAFT mobility among applicants, especially those subject to delays. This paper is the first to provide direct causal evidence that permanent residency delays decrease the propensity of foreign STEM doctorates to work at startup firms early in their career. 25 This effect is likely due to established firms representing a safer bet for obtaining a green card: the chances of securing permanent residency are likely higher when working at an established firm since, on average, startups face a higher risk of going out of business before EB-2 visa delays are resolved. 26 This possibility was previously hypothesized in Roach and Skrentny (2019) wherein foreign STEM doctorates whose first job is in industry are found to be as likely as US STEM doctorates to apply for and receive offers from startup firms, but conditional on receiving an offer, are about half as likely as US-born STEM PhDs to accept a position at a startup. Roach and Skrentny (2019) find descriptive evidence that suggests permanent residency policies, rather than differences in preferences between foreign and native STEM doctorates, are responsible for this finding, and this paper builds on this descriptive analysis by providing direct causal evidence of the hypothesized effect."}, {"section_title": "Data and Empirical Strategy", "text": "The analytical sample is constructed using individual-level data from the NSF's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) linked with the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). 27 The SED is a census of all doctorate recipients earning their degree in the US and contains many demographic and economic variables including age, sex, race, birth country, residency/citizenship status, fine field of study, and university where each doctorate earned 25 Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) analyze if longer visa delays make Chinese and Indian STEM doctorates less likely to work for small startups, but do not detect any significant effects. I discuss the analytical differences between this paper and Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) in Section 5 after first presenting the methods and main results of this paper. 26 Decker et al. (2014) note that most startups exit within their first ten years, while a small fraction of these startups exhibit very high growth and contribute substantially to job creation in the economy. Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2013) refer to this dynamic as the \"up-or-out\" pattern for young firms. 27 These microdata are restricted-use and so were accessed remotely through the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) data enclave. All results have been reviewed to ensure that no confidential information is disclosed. The analytical sample is comprised of doctorates from SDR-SED data who earned a PhD sometime between fiscal years 2001 and 2010 and who reported working in a job at a US for-profit nonacademic employer (i.e., \"worked in industry\") sometime within ten years post-PhD. 29 For these individuals, I create an indicator variable for whether, within ten years post-PhD, they have ever reported working for an employer that \"came into being as a new business within the past 5 years\" (i.e., a startup firm). 30 I use this as the dependent variable in difference-in-differences regressions for if the announcement of permanent residency delays for Chinese and Indian doctorates led them to reduce their propensity to work in startup firms within ten years of PhD receipt, conditional on being employed by any for-profit business in the United States during this time span. Deming and Noray (2020) find that the earnings premium for STEM majors is highest at 28 SDR respondents are sampled from the SED. For more information about the SDR, see https://www. nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctoratework/#sd. 29 For the main analysis, I follow Roach and Skrentny (2019) in restricting the sample to those doctorates that are employed in industry to explore how visa delays may have changed the preference for working at a startup firm as opposed to an established firm in industry. I also report regressions without this restriction in Table A.3 as a robustness check. In addition, visa delays may have impacted the propensity to work in industry, as obtaining an EB-1 visa -which is typically associated with shorter wait times than the EB-2 visa -is plausibly more likely through an academic employer or government/nonprofit research institution. Figure A.1 shows the fraction of doctorates in the treatment and control groups working in for-profit firms conditional on working in the US within ten years of graduation. Results reported in Table A.2 find some evidence that Chinese temporary resident doctorates might reduce their propensity to work in for-profit firms in response to visa delays, although this finding is not robust to changes in the control sample. labor market entry and declines by over half in the first decade of employment, suggesting that the rapidly changing task requirements of STEM occupations quickly erodes the value of previous training. This finding provides analytical motivation for restricting the dependent variable to early in a STEM doctorate's career, when the skills learned through doctoral training are likely at their highest value to an employer. Including up to ten years after graduation is also, in most cases, long enough to capture the employment decisions of the sizable number of STEM doctorates who first complete postdoctoral training in academia prior to working in industry. 31 Temporary resident STEM doctorates can spend up to three years in OPT status and then normally up to six years in H-1B status, and are likely to apply for an EB-2 visa by the fifth year of H-1B status so as to be eligible for annual H-1B visa extensions after the sixth year that may be necessary while waiting for an EB-2 visa. If temporary resident STEM doctorates are typically employed for eight years before applying for a green card, then there would be an opportunity for these doctorates to work in a startup initially and then later move to an established firm to apply for a green card if the startup failed. 32 If this were the case, then we might not expect EB-2 visa delays to have much of an impact on the propensity of Chinese and Indian temporary resident STEM doctorates to work at a startup within ten years. However, there is evidence that temporary resident STEM doctorates are likely to obtain permanent residency status much quicker than ten years. Roach and Skrentny (2019) find that 63% of the foreign PhDs in their survey who work in industry received a green card within four years, and Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) report that about two-thirds of temporary resident STEM doctorates in the NSF's National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) who graduated after 2000 and obtained a family-based or employer-based green card by 2015 did so within three years of graduation. 33 Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) estimate that the average EB-2 visa processing time for temporary resident PhDs facing no delays is 1.5 years, meaning that temporary resident STEM doctorates are likely to apply for an EB-2 visa through their employer at approximately 1.5 years after graduation. Given this relatively quick time from PhD graduation to EB-2 visa application -paired with previous research finding that the permanent residency application process causes significant job lock before applicants receive green cards (Hunt and Xie, 2019; Wang, 2020) -it seems unlikely that temporary resident STEM doctorates typically plan to take an industry job at one employer before applying for permanent residency at another. Within ten years, we may expect temporary resident PhDs subject to visa delays to reduce their likelihood of working in startups through two channels. The first channel is due to temporary resident STEM doctorates impacted by visa delays reducing their propensity to take initial industry employment at a startup so as to reduce the risk that their eventual employer-sponsor for permanent residency will go out of business prior to resolution of EB-2 visa delays. In addition to this \"initial employment\" channel, there is also a job-switching channel: those impacted by visa delays may be less likely to switch employers within ten years. If doctorates randomly sort across startups versus established firms with the same probability, but differ in the rate of job switching, those who more frequently switch jobs would be more likely to work at a startup within a given period compared to those with lower rates of job switching. To check the degree to which results are sensitive to the job switching channel, I include as a robustness check an alternative set of regressions where the dependent variable is an indicator variable for if a STEM doctorate's first industry job observed in the data within ten years of graduation is at a startup firm. 34 The EB-2 visa delay officially went into effect starting the first day of FY 2006, but there is ample reason to believe that doctorates from China and India graduating in FY 2005 were able to anticipate the emergence of new EB-2 visa delays and respond pre-emptively. This is because the US Department of State publicly releases monthly \"visa bulletins\" detailing changes in the availability of permanent residency visas. Two months later on July 11, 2005, the State Department specifically issued a warning of impending EB-2 visa delays, stating that: As the end of the fiscal year approaches, it might be necessary to establish an Employment Second preference cut-off date for September to keep visa issuances within the annual numerical limits set by law. If required, such a cut-off date is likely to be limited to the China-mainland born and India chargeability areas. Indian temporary resident doctorates graduating in FY 2001 as not having expected to face visa delays, and so define the pre-treatment period as starting in FY 2001 and ending in FY 2004. 37 Previous years are excluded from the study due to the existence of visa delays during these years that could have expected to continue prior to the passage of AC-21. The treatment group is defined as STEM doctorates from China and India whom are temporary residents at the time of graduation, and the control group consists of STEM doctorates who would be unaffected by the EB-2 visa delays: US citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents from other countries at the time of PhD graduation. 38 Figure 4 shows that the treatment and control groups follow similar pre-treatment trends in the propensity to work at startups within ten years, with around 20% of doctorates working at startups on average for both treatment and control group members graduating in FY 2001 through FY 2004. In FY 2005 -the first treatment period -we see the emergence of an approximate 10 percentage-point gap in the startup rate of the treatment and control groups that persists over the entirety of the post-treatment period, with the startup rate of the treatment group and control group hovering around 10% and 20% in the post-treatment period, respectively. This descriptive finding is consistent with Roach and Skrentny (2019) who, using data collected starting in 2010, find that foreign STEM PhDs are about half as likely as US PhDs to accept employment at a startup. While the similar pre-treatment paths of the treatment and control groups suggest that these groups are similar, in Table 1 I compare the demographics of the treatment and control 37 As a robustness check, Table 6 reports results where doctorates graduating in FY 2001 are excluded from the analytical sample. 38 Previous studies analyzing the impact of visa policy on the career choices of foreign-born doctorates have estimated difference-in-differences specifications where natives are included in the control group. See Column 2 of Panel B of Table 4 in Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado (2019) and Column (2) of Table 3 in Amuedo-Dorantes, Furtado, and Xu (2019). The argument in Roach and Skrentny (2019) that visa policies may reduce the propensity of foreign STEM doctorates to work in startup firms is also based on a comparison of foreign-born and native doctorates. Nevertheless, it may be argued that temporary residents and nontemporary residents are subject to different time-varying and unobserved circumstances that impact their propensity to work in startups. Therefore, we test the sensitivity of results to changing the composition of the control group, including estimating specifications where only temporary resident doctorates from the rest of the world form the control group. The drawbacks associated with only using temporary residents from other countries as the control group is that this greatly reduces sample size, and that temporary resident doctorates from other countries may have been impacted by Department of State visa delay warnings, in addition to the EB-2 visa delays that faced temporary residents from the rest of the world at various points during the post-treatment period as discussed in footnote 35. groups in the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods. I find that there are some differences between these groups: doctorates in the treatment group tend to be younger, finish their PhD more quickly, are more likely to be married at time of PhD, are more likely to have been financially supported on a research assistantship during graduate school, and are less likely to be female in both the pre-treatment and post-treatment period. Given these differences, the main specification for this study includes variables in Table A.1 as controls, which include the variables summarized in Table 1 as well as additional variables such as whether the doctorate is earning or has earned a professional medical degree and interactions between the female indicator and various other demographic variables including age, race, marriage status at time of PhD, and whether or not any children were living at home with the doctorate at time of PhD. The main difference-in-differences specification in this study is represented by the following linear probability model (LPM): where Startup icg equals 1 if doctorate i from country c who graduated in year g is observed working in a startup firm within ten years post-PhD, conditional on that doctorate being observed working at any for-profit firm within ten years. Country-of-birth fixed effects are given by \u03b4 c , year-of-graduation (PhD cohort) fixed effects are given by \u03b4 g , and \u03b5 icg is an idiosyncratic error term. T reat group ic is an indicator variable for if doctorate i was a temporary resident at time of graduation and was either born in China or India. The EB-2 visa delay treatment variable, Delay icg , equals 0 for all individuals graduating before FY 2005. For individuals graduating in FY 2005 or later, it equals 1 for Chinese and Indian doctorates who were temporary residents at the time of graduation (i.e., T reat group ic = 1) and equals 0 for everyone else. 39 X i is a vector of individual-level controls that contains the demographic variables from Table A.1 as well as fixed effects for fine field of study, fixed effects for the PhD-granting university of the doctorate, and survey-group fixed effects. 40 The parameter of interest \u03b2 gives the impact of EB-2 visa delays on the share of Chinese and Indian temporary-resident doctorates working in a startup firm early in their career. The identification assumption is that the treatment group, in the absence of EB-2 visa delays, would have followed the same trend as the control group in the post-treatment  were less sensitive to visa delays than Chinese PhDs when considering whether to stay in 43 Table A.3 reports results from the same specifications as Table 2 after removing the sample restriction that PhDs work at a US for-profit firm within ten years post-PhD. Results for Chinese doctorates are highly significant across all specifications, albeit with smaller magnitudes. In Table A.2, I report estimates of the impact of visa delays on the propensity of US-employed foreign STEM doctorates to work in industry within ten years post-PhD and find some evidence that Chinese doctorates may reduce their likelihood of working in industry in response to visa delays, although this result is not robust across all control groups."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Main Results", "text": "44 About 19.0% of temporary resident Chinese STEM doctorates work at startups within ten years post-PhD during the pre-treatment period. the US after graduation. 45 I next test the robustness of the results to inclusion of a treatment-group-specific linear time trend in column (3). In Panel B, I find that the resulting estimates remain statistically significant and similar in magnitude to the estimates obtained in column (2) for temporary resident doctorates from China, while the estimate in Panel A remains stable but only marginally significant. As before, industry-employed Indian doctorates do not appear to reduce the likelihood of working in startups after the announcement of visa delays. I next test the robustness of the results to changing the composition of the control group in columns (4) -(6). Panel A reports statistically significant estimates of the impact of visa delays on working at startups when only native STEM doctorates form the control group, and marginally significant estimates when the control group is limited to other foreign-born STEM doctorates. The point estimate remains negative, but is statistically insignificant, when the control group is limited solely to temporary residents from other countries. This insignificance is the result of both shrinkage of the point estimate and a substantial increase in the standard error compared to column (2). When estimating specifications that allow for country-specific effects, I find that the estimated reduction in the propensity of Chinese doctorates to work in startups after the emergence of visa delays remains statistically significant across all specifications, although the magnitude of the estimated effect is reduced once limiting the control group to only temporary residents from other countries. Indian doctorates, on the other hand, appear insensitive to visa delays for all but one specification. 46 Altogether, it appears that visa delays significantly reduced the propensity of industry-employed Chinese PhDs to work at a startup within ten years of graduation, and that this result is robust to considering alternative control groups. Temporary resident doctorates facing visa delays may reduce their likelihood of working at a startup within ten years of graduation either due to a reduced propensity to initially 45 See discussion in Section 5 for why Indian doctorates may be less sensitive than Chinese doctorates to visa delays. 46 The number of temporary resident Indian doctorates graduating in the pre-treatment period is relatively small, which may explain the instability in results."}, {"section_title": "PRELIMINARY DRAFT", "text": "seek employment at a startup firm, or due to reduced job mobility that makes those who initially obtain employment at an established firm less likely to move to a startup employer within ten years. 47 To check the degree to which the results in Table 2 are due to job lock rather than initial employment choices, I report results in Table 3 from specifications where the dependent variable takes the form of an indicator variable for if a STEM doctorate's first industry job observed in the data within ten years of graduation is at a startup firm. We find similar results using this new dependent variable, suggesting that the initial employment channel is the main driver of the results in Table 2."}, {"section_title": "Threats to Identification", "text": "The validity of the difference-in-differences approach relies on the assumption that the control and treatment group experience common trends such that in the absence of the treatment, both groups would follow along this common trend. While this assumption cannot be explicitly tested, the assumption appears more plausible in those cases where the pre-treatment trends of the control group and treatment group are close to parallel. Figure 4 shows that the treatment and control groups exhibit very similar trends and levels, which suggests that the common trends assumption is plausible. For a more rigorous test of parallel pre-treatment trends, I estimate regressions where I limit the sample to the pre-treatment period and estimate regressions that include a treatment-group-specific linear trend as well as the same controls used in the main regressions. The parameter of interest is the coefficient on the treatment-group-specific linear trend. For each control group considered, Table 4 reports a coefficient estimate that is not statistically different from zero, which is consistent with parallel trends between treatment and control groups in the pre-treatment period. Another concern is that the large reduction in the H-1B visa cap in FY 2004 could possibly be driving the results, rather than permanent residency delays. 48 If this is the 47 Roach and Skrentny (2019) find that foreign-born doctorates who first obtain employment at an established firm and then receive a green card are more likely to move to a startup rather than to another established firm or to stay with their initial employer. 48 Mayda et al. (2018)  would be significantly larger than the estimated effects for other years. This is because FY 2008 and 2009 were years when H-1B visa demand was at its greatest such that the H-1B quota was met within the first week of the H-1B visa application period. However, as we can see in Table 5, the estimated impact does not appear much different in these years. In fact, the estimated effect for FY 2008 is the lowest of all the estimated effects during H-1B visa approvals going to larger firms with a record of intense use of the H-1B program. However, Mayda et al. (2018) note that doctorates make up fewer than 10% of H-1B recipients at for-profit firms between FY 2002 and FY 2009. the treatment period for Chinese STEM doctorates, and the estimated effects for Indian STEM PhDs in FY 2008 and 2009 are less than half the effect size estimated in FY 2004. Altogether, these findings suggest that the decrease in the propensity of industry-employed Chinese STEM doctorates to work in startups within ten years post-PhD is driven by the emergence of permanent residency delays, and not by increasing tightness in the market for H-1B workers. Another possibility is that other changes in visa policies during the post-treatment period could be driving the results rather than permanent residency delays. In April 2008, the optional practical training (OPT) program for students with degrees in STEM fields was extended by 17 months; however, it is unclear how this would impact the propensity of STEM doctorates to work in startups. 49 Nevertheless, I re-estimate the main specification after dropping doctorates that graduated after FY 2007 to reduce the chance that estimates are impacted by the OPT extension. Table 6 shows that results are robust to excluding doctorates graduating after FY 2007, and so it is unlikely that the OPT extension is driving the main results. 50 These results also suggest that the main findings are unlikely to be driven by the H-1B visa lotteries that occurred in FY 2008 and 2009, or by the reduced number of post-PhD years observed for those graduating in the most recent cohorts included in the sample utilized for the main results. Another concern is that there existed EB-2 visa delays for Chinese and Indian temporary resident doctorates between October 2000 and April 2001, and so it is possible that some doctorates graduating in FY 2001 could have been impacted by these delays. Therefore, I re-estimate the main specification after dropping doctorates graduating in FY 2001. The estimated impact of visa delays on the propensity of Chinese temporary resident doctorates to 49 By increasing the number of years a temporary resident doctorate could stay in the US prior to obtaining a green card, it may have increased the propensity to work at a startup early in one's career. Alternatively, it may have attracted temporary residents to established firms that may be better able to afford filing multiple H-1B applications on one's behalf in the event that a first H-1B application is unsuccessful in the H-1B visa lottery. 50 See Table A.5 for robustness check results where the control group is limited to temporary resident doctorates from other countries. A further concern is that the reduction in the fraction of industry-employed Chinese temporary resident doctorates working in startups within ten years of graduation after the emergence of visa delays is a demand-side, rather than supply-side, effect. Decker et al. (2014) note that the startup rate for the high-tech sector has declined since 2000, including during the Great Recession, with either no change or a decline in the average number of workers employed at each startup. While this might explain why, on average, a worker in the US might be less likely to work at a startup, it is unclear that this would uniquely impact the fraction of Chinese temporary resident doctorates working at startups as US citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents from other countries also faced the same economic environment, and so cohort fixed effects should control for such economy-wide shocks and trends. Decker et al. (2016) show substantial heterogeneity within different areas of the high-tech sector in terms of employment growth and the dispersion of employment across firms within each area. In particular, Decker et al. (2016) notes that the manufacturing of goods like computers and semiconductors once made up the largest share of high-tech employment, but has steadily declined and since been surpassed by the areas of Services and Information which includes activities such as data hosting, processing services, and software publishing. These changes in the industries comprising the high-tech sector in turn are likely to impact the demand for doctorates from different fields of study, and so I re-estimate the main specification after controlling for field-cohort fixed effects using the broad fields of study listed PRELIMINARY DRAFT in Figure A.2. As we can see in Table 6, the estimated impact of EB-2 visa delays decreases when including field-cohort fixed effects, suggesting that changes in business dynamism across industries may play a part in explaining the reduction in the propensity of Chinese temporary resident doctorates to work in startups. However, much of the estimated effect remains and is highly significant, suggesting that changes in labor demand across different fields of study play a limited role in explaining the decreased likelihood that Chinese doctorates work in startups after the emergence of EB-2 visa delays. Another possibility is that the emergence of EB-2 visa delays made Chinese and Indian temporary resident doctorates more appealing to employers. For instance, as noted in Wang (2020), the period of job lock induced by EB-2 visa delays may incentivize firms to increase investment in the general human capital of these workers as job lock converts general human capital into quasi firm-specific skills that firms can exploit to reap surplus benefits. However, the increasing attractiveness of workers subject to EB-2 visa constraints should hold for both established and startup firms, and it is unclear which type of firm stands more to gain from reduced worker mobility. One might imagine that the success of startup firms is more sensitive to the voluntary turnover of highly-specialized labor compared to established firms due to potentially higher relative costs of recruiting and training new workers, and so we might expect startup firms to be relatively more attracted to workers subject to visa delays compared to established firms experienced in handling voluntary labor turnover. 51 This demand-side effect would work to increase, rather than decrease, the fraction of Chinese and Indian temporary resident doctorates working at startups as opposed to established firms after the emergence of EB-2 visa delays. However, it could be the case that established firms are better able to train workers, and thus can extract the most value out of job-locked temporary resident doctorates, making Chinese and Indian doctorates more appealing to established firms relative to startups after the onset of visa delays. However, the degree to which this demand-side mechanism might influence the results reported in Table 2 appears limited as Wang (2020) does not find evidence that employers exploit substantial monopsony power over temporary residents, instead finding that firms only reap a small surplus from hiring job-locked temporary workers."}, {"section_title": "Visa Delay Length and the Propensity to Work at Startups", "text": "It is plausible that the precise length of visa delays, and not merely the existence of multipleyear visa delays, impacts the propensity of foreign STEM doctorates to work in startups. One way to allow for heterogeneity in the impact of visa delays due to differences in expected delay length is to estimate a specification that allows the impact of visa delays to vary across cohorts. This is because members of the same graduating cohort are likely to have similar visa delay length expectations. The results from estimating such a specification are reported in Table 5. Figure 5 plots the estimated effects from the first column of Table 5 and Figure 6 plots the estimated country-specific effects from the second and third columns. While there is some variability in the estimated effect of visa delays across cohorts, all point estimates during the post-treatment period in Figure 5 and the top panel of Figure 6 lie within each other's 95% confidence interval, suggesting that differences in expected visa delay lengths may not cause significant differences in the rate of working in startups across cohorts. As before, Indian doctorates do not generally appear to alter their propensity to work in startups in response to visa delays, although the estimated effect in FY 2010 is significant. As Indian doctorates in more recent cohorts have faced longer visa delays, this suggests the possibility that Indian doctorates are only sensitive to long visa delays. 52 A more direct approach is to measure the length of the expected delay for each doctorate and to include these delay lengths as main variables of interest in a regression specification, such as in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019). The difficulty of this approach is in deciding on a measure for the visa delay length that Chinese and Indian doctorates would expect to face at the time of making their decision to apply for an EB-2 visa. Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) construct their measure of the visa delay length in any month by looking at the US Department of State's visa bulletin in each month and, for both China and India, calculating the number of years between the visa bulletin date and the priority date used as the cutoff for the processing of EB-2 visas in that month. For example, the priority date used for the processing cutoff of Indian EB-2 visas in the June 2007 visa bulletin was April 1, 2004, and so the visa delay length in that month would be calculated as being over three years using the method in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019). 53 I calculate the visa delay length in each month using the KM method and plot these visa delay lengths in Figure 2, which reassuringly produces a graph very similar to \" Fig. 1\" in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019). Using the NSF's National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) find that 67% of foreign STEM PhDs who received their PhD after 2000 and subsequently received a permanent residency visa by 2015 did so within three years of PhD. They also find that the median processing time for EB-2 visas for those who do not face visa delays is 1.5 years, suggesting that the median foreign STEM PhD submits an EB-2 visa application 1.5 years post-PhD, and so begins the process of preparing the application at an earlier point. Of course, not all doctorates are the same, and so the date each begins applying for an EB-2 visa is likely to vary. Because of this, Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) suggest using a 3-year symmetric triangular-weighted moving average of monthly visa delay lengths centered on 1 year after PhD completion as their preferred proxy for visa delay length -this helps account for the fact that there is significant month-to-month variability in their measure of monthly visa delay length. This form of weighting results in the visa delay length at 1 year after PhD receiving the largest weight, where the weights decrease linearly moving away from 1 year post-PhD. Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) also consider an unweighted 12-month moving average of visa delay lengths centered on each doctorate's PhD graduation date as an alternative measure. Both these measures are also plotted on Figure 2 for both China and India. In Table 7, I use these two KM measures of visa delay length to test if expected visa delay length is related to the propensity of working in a startup within ten years. Regardless of the measure of visa delay length, I find no impact of visa delay length on working in startups when the visa delay length enters linearly into the specification as in columns (1) -(4). To allow for more flexibility, I round the visa delay length of each individual to the nearest year and then create a set of indicator variables for different rounded visa delay lengths, as is also done in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019). For both KM measures of visa delay length, I find that Chinese STEM doctorates with an expected visa length of about 3 years reduce their propensity to work in startups within ten years, but that those facing five year delays are not impacted. This is a curious finding as one would expect that longer expected visa delay lengths would, at the very least, also reduce the propensity of working in startups. Furthermore, we find that Indian PhDs facing approximately 3-year delays are more likely than those facing no delays to work at a startup, but that this result does not generalize to visa delays of greater lengths. These patterns suggest either that visa delay lengths do not have a systematic impact on the propensity of foreign STEM workers to work in startups, or that the KM measures of visa delay length may fail to approximate the visa delay lengths actually expected by Chinese and Indian STEM doctorates. A shortcoming of the KM measures of expected visa delay length is that the actual visa delay lengths faced by immigrants submitting a Form I-140 in each month are likely to be very different from the expected delays suggested by the KM measures. For example, while the KM method posits that Indian doctorates who submitted their Form I-140 in June 2007 could expect to be delayed for over 3 years before being able to submit their Form I-485, they were actually only delayed for a single month. 54 This is because the processing cutoff used for Indian EB-2 visas in the July 2007 visa bulletin was \"current\" (i.e., there was no delay in that month). It may be the case that prior to July 2007, Chinese and Indian PhDs used a method akin to the KM method to estimate their expected visa delay length, but after July 2007, they -or the immigration lawyers that might be handling their EB-2 visa case on their behalf -would likely have noticed that using the KM method to estimate their expected visa delay length was an unreliable measure. As an alternative to the KM method, I measure the visa delay length in each month by calculating how many years until the priority date first becomes current and I plot these actual visa delay lengths in Figure 7. 55 The actual visa delay lengths plotted in Figure 7 differ remarkably from the expected visa delay lengths calculated using the KM method in Figure 2. Admittedly, it is unrealistic to expect that Chinese and Indian PhDs could forecast the correct visa delay length, but testing how actual visa delay lengths impact the likelihood that a foreign STEM doctorate works in a startup within ten years is interesting in its own right since those able to obtain a green card more quickly may be more likely to work at a startup within ten years. This is because the foreign STEM doctorate would no longer need to worry about their employer staying in business in order to remain in the US after receiving a green card. In Table 8, I use two measures of the actual visa delay length faced by individuals to test if visa delay length is related to the propensity of working in a startup within ten years. The first measure assumes that each foreign STEM doctorate and their employer submits an EB-2 visa application (Form I-140) one year after graduation, and the second measure assumes that the application is submitted 1.5 years after graduation. We find that for each additional year of visa delay, a Chinese STEM doctorate is 1.7 percentage points less likely 55 For India, the most recent priority date used as a processing cutoff was May 1, 2010. Therefore, some Indian PhDs gradating in FY 2010 have never been eligible to complete the EB-2 visa process by filing a Form I-485. For simplicity, I impute a visa delay length of ten years for all individuals who have never had their priority date be eligible for processing -this roughly accords with the visa delay length measured using the KM method in those months. It is difficult to estimate exactly how long these Indian PhDs will have to wait to be able to file a Form I-485. In April 2018, USCIS published a report estimating that it currently held 216,684 EB-2 applications from India that would not be able to be processed in May 2018. For China, this number totaled 16,617 EB-2 applications (https: //www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/nativedocuments/Count_of_Approved_I-140_I-360_ and_I-526_Petitions_as_of_April_20_2018_with_a_Priority_Date_On_or_After_May_2018.PDF). Given that fewer than 5,000 EB-2 visas have been granted to India in each of the last four fiscal years (see Figure 3), estimated wait times are very likely much longer than ten years assuming no policy changes; for instance, some have estimated an upper-bound for the expected EB-2 visa delay for Indians to be about 150 years (https://www.cato.org/blog/150-year-wait-indian-immigrants-advanced-degrees). to work in a startup within ten years. When allowing for a more flexible specification, we find that Chinese STEM doctorates facing delays of any length are less likely to work in a startup than those facing no delays. Indian doctorates do not appear sensitive to visa delay lengths as most estimates for Indian PhDs are either insignificant using both visa delay measures or only significant for a single measure. Altogether, it appears that the propensity of Indian doctorates to work in startups may not be sensitive to visa delay length, while Chinese doctorates are 1.7 percentage points less likely to work in a startup within ten years for each additional year of visa delay. 56"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Why No Effect on Indian Temporary Resident Doctorates?", "text": "Given that Indian doctorates face longer EB-2 visa delays than Chinese doctorates, it is somewhat puzzling that Chinese temporary resident doctorates reduce their propensity to work in startups, whereas it appears that Indian doctorates do not change their behavior. In the same spirit, Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) find that Chinese doctorates reduce their stay rate in the US for each additional year of visa delays, but that Indian doctorates only reduce their stay rate for delays exceeding five years. One possible explanation could be that there exists a traditional path to permanent residency for Indian doctorates that operates through employment at established firms with Indian headquarters, which are consistently among the top recipients of H-1B visas (Mayda et al., 2020). However, USCIS data on the number of H-1B petitions granted to each firm seemingly fails to support this explanation, as very few doctorates appear as either initial or continuing H-1B workers at these firms. 57 However, 56 In regressions not shown, I re-estimate the specifications in Table 7 and Table 8 after limiting the control group to temporary resident doctorates from other countries. Point estimates generally remain similar, but results are not typically significant due to an increase in standard errors. For instance, when limiting the control group to temporary residents, I find that Chinese doctorates reduce their propensity to work in startups by 1.2 percentage points for each additional year of (actual) visa delay, but this result is not statistically significant due to a 44% increase in the standard error relative to that in column (4) of Table 8. 57 See https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/ Immigration%20Forms%20Data/BAHA/h-1b-2012-employers.pdf for FY 2012 data. Accenture, Cognizant, this does not rule out the possibility that Indian doctorates have a strong preference for working at other established firms regardless of visa delays, although it is unclear why this would be unique to Indian doctorates. Another explanation is that Indian doctorates are more likely to avoid visa delays through marriage to either a US citizen or a temporary resident from another country without visa delays. Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) note that, according to the 2013 wave of the American Community Survey (ACS), Indian doctorates are about four times as likely as Chinese doctorates to marry an American citizen, and so are less reliant on employment-based paths to permanent residency. 58 It could also be the case that Indian doctorates are more likely than Chinese doctorates to marry temporary residents from countries not subject to visa delays. Permanent residency applications allow petitioners to use one's own priority date to file for permanent residency on behalf of a spouse or child, and so if Indian doctorates are more likely than Chinese doctorates to marry temporary residents from the rest of the world, then they would be more likely to avoid EB-2 visa delays through this marriage channel. 59"}, {"section_title": "Comparison to Kahn and MacGarvie (2019)", "text": "Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) report finding insignificant estimates for the impact of visa delay length on the propensity of doctorates to work in startups. As previously discussed, this could be due to shortcomings in the KM method of calculating visa delay length. However, there are other differences between the analysis in this paper and that in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019). First, there are differences between the analytical sample: In this paper, I consider specifications where native-born citizens, naturalized citizens, and permanent resident doctorates are included in the analytical sample, whereas Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) only include temporary resident doctorates in their analytical sample since their main out-Infosys, Tata, and Wipro are all \"outsourcing\" companies that heavily employ Indian workers in computerrelated occupations, but report low numbers of doctorates among their H-1B applicants. Companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Google are more likely to employ doctorates through the H-1B program. 58 Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) report that 10.8% of Indian doctorates, and 2.8% of Chinese doctorates, are married to American citizens. 59 See https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM050303.html for details. come of interest is stay rates in the US. 60 Additionally, Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) estimate person-year level regressions, rather than person level regressions. A person-year level regression may be problematic in the context of studying the impact of visa delays on working in startups because, in such a setup, the probability of observing an individual working in startup firms over time is in part dependent upon the success rates of the startup firms for which an individual works, with those that help a startup firm succeed being observed in a startup less than someone who jumps from one failing startup to another. This is because a STEM doctorate who works at a startup right after graduation and remains with this (successful) company will likely only report working for a business founded in the last five years on one or two SDR surveys as the firm \"ages out\" of startup status, whereas a person who might jump from one failing startup to another will report working for a startup across more observations. Additionally, when using an alternative dependent variable such as whether a person's first job observed in industry is in a startup, a person-level approach seems more natural. Another difference is that Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) limit their definition of a startup to a business founded in the last five years with fewer than 25 employees. However, Decker et al. (2014) emphasize the importance of high-growth startups and young firms to overall job creation. For instance, new firms account for fewer than 10% of all firms but are responsible for about 20% of firm-level gross job creation. However, the role played by startups in gross job creation goes beyond their first year of existence. Decker et al. (2014) find that job creation is greatest in the earliest stages of a firm, with high-growth firms (those experiencing over a 25% increase in employment per year) tending to be young, representing 15% of all firms and 50% of gross job creation. Access to foreign-born talent is likely important to the ability of startups to becomes successful and quickly grow, as evidenced in Dimmock, Huang, and Weisbenner (2019), and so restricting the dependent variable to young firms with fewer than 25 employees after as much as five years in operation may be problematic as this would tend to count doctorates entering low-growth companies as working at startups while excluding those going to work at young high-growth firms with the greatest potential to impact innovation and job creation in the long run. 61 However, it is the case that greater than 90% of all true startups (i.e., firms in their first year of existence) employ fewer than 20 workers (Decker et al., 2014), and so limiting the definition of startups based on size is useful if wanting to separate the propensity of doctorates to work at true startups from their propensity to work at young high-growth firms. Therefore, in Table A.6, I report results using the same definition of startups as in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) and find that EB-2 visa delays decreased the propensity of Chinese doctorates to work in small startups, with estimates reduced relative to those reported in Table 2 where high-growth firms founded within five years would be included as startups. The confluence of multiple factors -using a person-year level approach, limiting the dependent variable to only consider startups as firms founded in the last five years with fewer than 25 employees, only considering specifications with temporary resident doctorates in the control group, and using potentially inaccurate proxies for expected visa delay length -may have led to the insignificant results reported in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019) for the impact of EB-2 visa delays on the propensity of Chinese and Indian temporary resident doctorates to work at startups. 61 For example, Amazon was founded in 1994 and employed 256 employees by 1997 (https://www.sec. gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/0000891020-97-000839.txt). Google was founded in September of 1998 and reported employing 260 workers as of 2001, over 50 of whom reportedly held doctorates (http: //web.archive.org/web/20011212085049/http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html). Facebook was founded in 2004 and reported employing over 2000 workers by December 2010 (https://www.sec. gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm). Netflix, founded in 1998, reported 270 employees by the end of 1999 (http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001065280/ c6aa1b92-5c75-4373-9c23-26dd90aaeac9.pdf). Roach and Skrentny (2019) limit their definition of startups to firms founded in the last five years with fewer than 100 employees, which, as mentioned therein, leaves out young firms experiencing the highest growth rates during their sample period such as 23andMe and Uber."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In October 2005, doctorates from China and India began to face multiple-year delays in the processing of their EB-2 permanent residency visa applications. Using a difference-indifferences identification strategy, I find that Chinese and Indian STEM doctorates who were temporary residents at the time of graduation and who were employed at a US for-profit firm within ten years of graduation were 7.2 percentage points (42%) less likely to be employed at a startup after the emergence of visa delays. This main result is driven by Chinese doctorates reducing their propensity to work in startups by 9.2 percentage points (48%), whereas Indian PhDs do not appear to change their propensity to work at startups in response to visa delays. Furthermore, I find that Chinese STEM doctorates are 1.7 percentage points less likely to work in a startup for each additional year of delay. Previous research finds that increases in the restrictiveness of high-skilled immigration policy lead to distortions in the allocation of workers and students across borders (Kato and Sparber, 2013;Shih, 2016;Khosla, 2018;Kahn and MacGarvie, 2019), fields of study (Amuedo-Dorantes, Furtado, and Xu, 2019), employment sectors (Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado, 2019), and for-profit firms in industry (Mayda et al., 2018). this paper adds to this literature by finding that foreign STEM doctorates who face permanent residency delays are likely to respond by increasingly seeking employment at established firms, rather than startups, since established firms are less likely to shut down before visa delays are resolved. Previous research suggests that increased access to high-skilled immigrants is positively associated with startup success (Dimmock, Huang, and Weisbenner, 2019), and so permanent residency delays may have negative downstream effects on startup firms, and in turn lead to a less dynamically competitive economy and slower economic growth. The results in this paper suggest that reducing or eliminating visa delays for Chinese STEM doctorates would make working at startups a more attractive option for these workers early in their career. Policies that could achieve this outcome include stapling a green card to the diploma of every foreign STEM doctorate, increasing the number of EB-2 visas available to STEM doctorates, introducing a Startup Visa program that allows freshly-minted foreign STEM doctorates to start their own businesses, or finding ways to reduce the problems faced by EB-2 applicants if their employer goes out of business before visa delays are resolved. In January 2017, USCIS implemented a new set of rules allowing temporary workers with an approved Form I-140 to change employers while retaining the priority date on their earliest accepted Form I-140, and also eliminated the automatic revocation of an approved Form I-140 for temporary workers whose employer goes out-of-business 180 days or more after Form I-140 approval. One potential avenue for future research is to analyze if these rule changes subsequently increased the propensity of temporary resident doctorates facing visa delays to stay in the US, seek industry employment, and work at startups. Other potential avenues for future research include studies estimating how permanent residency delays impact the number of startup firms in the economy, the outcomes of startups, and the composition of the workforce at these firms. More studies into how permanent residency visa delays and H-1B visa restrictions impact the US economy are important to understanding the probable effects of policies designed to either strengthen or loosen restrictions on high-skilled immigration.   Figure 2 shows the number of years between the visa bulletin date and EB-2 visa application priority date used as the cutoff for processing EB-2 visas from China and India for each month. The solid lines show triangular-weighted 3-year moving averages of these gaps for China and India, where the weights are centered at 1 year after each visa bulletin date. The dashed lines show a 12-month moving average of these gaps, centered on the visa bulletin month. These measures are used to represent expected visa delay lengths in Kahn and MacGarvie (2019)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3: EB-2 Visas Issued Subject to Numerical Limitation", "text": "Notes: Figure 3 shows the number of EB-2 visas issued subject to numerical limitation to immigrants born in China, India, and the rest of the world (\"ROW\") in each fiscal year.

Therefore, some Indian PhDs gradating in FY 2010 have never been eligible to complete the EB-2 visa process by filing a Form I-485. For simplicity, I impute a visa delay length of 10 years for all individuals who have never had their priority date be eligible for processing.
