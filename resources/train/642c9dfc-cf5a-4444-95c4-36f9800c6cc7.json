[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative process leading to irreversible mental dysfunctions. To date, diagnosis is established after incurable brain structure alterations. The development of new biomarkers is crucial to perform an early detection of this disease. With the recent improvement of magnetic resonance imaging, numerous methods were proposed to improve computer-aided detection. Among these methods, patch-based grading framework demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Usually, methods based on this framework use intensity or grey matter maps. However, it has been shown that texture lters improve classication performance in many cases. The aim of this work is to improve performance of patch-based grading framework with the development of a novel texture-based grading method. In this paper, we study the potential of multi-directional texture maps extracted with 3D Gabor lters to improve patch-based grading method. We also proposed a novel patch-based fusion scheme to eciently combine multiple grading maps. To validate our approach, we study the optimal set of lters and compare the proposed method with dierent fusion schemes. In addition, we also compare our new texture-based grading biomarker with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show an improvement of AD detection and prediction accuracy. Moreover, our method obtains competitive performance with 91.3% of accuracy and 94.6% of area under a curve for AD detection.\nKeywords: Patch-based grading fusion, multi-features, Alzheimer's disease classication, Mild Cognitive Impairment 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Patients with AD have a memory lost with diculty of remembering newly learned information that disrupts daily life [2] . Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) present higher risk to develop AD [26] . However, before rst clinical symptoms brain changes occur such as synaptic and neuronal loses. To date, diagnosis of AD is established after advanced brain structure alterations. This motivates the development of new imaging biomarkers able to detect the early stages of the disease. Furthermore, the early detection of AD can accelerate the development of new therapies by making easier the design of clinical trials.\nDuring the last decades, the improvement of medical imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) led to the development of new biomarkers with competitive performance for AD diagnosis and prognosis [6] . Most of the proposed methods have been based on specic regions of interest (ROI). Among structures impacted by AD, previous investigations mainly focused on medial temporal lobe and especially on hippocampus (HIPP). Alterations on this structure are usually estimated using volume [18] , shape [1] or cortical thickness measurements [13] (see [36] for a review). Besides ROI-based methods, whole brain analysis performed on anatomical MRI have also been proposed to detect areas impacted by AD. These methods are usually based on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or tensor based morphometry (TBM) frameworks [3] . It is interesting to note that both VBM and ROI-based studies conrmed that medial temporal lobe is a key area to detect the rst signs of AD [36] . In the medial temporal lobe, the HIPP is one of the earliest region altered by AD [16] . Recently, advanced methods were proposed to capture structural alterations of the HIPP [6] . Those techniques demonstrated their eciency to detect the dierent stages of AD [28] . Among them, patch-based methods obtained competitive results to detect the earliest stages of AD [21; 9; 32] . Moreover, it has been shown that patch-based methods could detect AD more than seven years before conversion to dementia [10] or can be used for dierential diagnosis [19] . Therefore, such advanced image analysis methods seem promising candidates to perform AD prediction.\nPatch-based methods are usually based on intensities [9; 33] or grey matter density maps [20] . However, it is has been demonstrated that HIPP texture improves the detection of early stages of AD [28] . A VBM method using several textural lter on medial temporal lobe area demonstrated the reliability of texture information in AD detection [7] . Moreover, HIPP texture enables to improve AD detection compared to HIPP volume [29] . This method could potentially capture MRI signal alterations related to neurobrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaque deposition, although such alterations are not directly detectable with MRI at current resolution. Besides, a recent study recently showed the eciency of using edge detection lters to improve of patch-based segmentation [15] . This result highlights that patch-based grading methods could be improved by estimating patterns similarity on derivative image features. Therefore, we propose to perform patch-based grading on multiple texture maps obtained with Gabor lters. Gabor lters are designed to detect salient features at specic resolution and direction. These lters were widely used for texture classication [25; 12; 14] . The proposed strategy enables to better capture texture modications occurring at the rst stages of the pathology by improving patch comparison.\nThe rst contribution of this work is to propose a new texture-based grading framework to better capture structural alterations caused by AD. This new framework proposes multi-directional texture grading based on 3D Gabor lters. Secondly, in order to combine all the grading maps estimated on texture maps, we propose an innovative adaptive patch-based fusion strategy based on a local condence criterion. This fusion framework can be applied to any patch-based processing to combine dierent features or modalities. Moreover, contrary to usual grading-based methods using the average grading values over the considered ROI, we propose a classication step based on a nonparametric grading values distribution representation to better discriminate pathologies stages. In our experiments, we rst study the optimal number of Gabor lter directions for AD detection. In addition, we compare dierent texture lers such as local variance or entropy. We also compare our new adaptive fusion method with dierent fusion schemes. Finally, to highlight the improvement of classication performances provided by our new framework, we compare our new method with the state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate its eciency. Data used in this work were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset 1 . ADNI is a North American campaign launched in 2003 with aims to provide MRI, positron emission tomography scans, clinical neurological measures and other biomarkers. The data used in this study are all the baseline T1-weighted (T1w) MRI of the ADNI1 phase. This dataset includes AD patients, MCI and cognitive normal (CN) subjects.\nThe group of MCI is composed of subjects who have abnormal memory dysfunctions and embed two groups, the rst one is composed with patients having stable MCI (sMCI) and the second one is composed with patients with progressive MCI (pMCI), such patients converted to AD during the following 48 months from the baseline [36] . The information of the dataset used in our work is summarized in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Preprocessing", "text": "All the T1w images were processed using the volBrain system [22] 4 . This system is based on an advanced pipeline providing automatic segmentation of dierent brain structures from T1w MRI. However, in this work, only hippocampus segmentations were used. The preprocessing is based on: (a) a denoising step with an adaptive non-local means lter [23] , (b) an ane registration in the MNI space [4] , (c) a correction of the image inhomogeneities [34] and (d) an intensity normalization [24] . Afterwards, MRI were segmented in the MNI space using non-local patch-based multi-atlas methods [8] . The obtained hippocampus were segmented according to the EADC protocol [5] designed for AD studies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "In this section, we describe the dierent steps of the proposed texture-based grading framework as illustrated in Figure 1 .

Finally, the input of classication method is a histogram representation of texture grading values in each hippocampus."}, {"section_title": "Texture maps estimation", "text": "The estimation of patch similarities could be improved by using texture representation instead of using raw intensities. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the use of edge detectors improves patch-based segmentation accuracy [15] . Moreover, it was also demonstrated that HIPP textural information plays an important role in AD detection [28] . Hence, we propose a new texture-based grading framework that simultaneously captures HIPP texture alterations and improves patches similarity estimation. In this work, texture information is extracted from MRI using a bank of 3D Gabor lters (see Figure 2) . We used Gabor lters since they are designed to detect texture patterns at dierent scales and directions [25] . Impulse response of the 3D Gabor lter is given by the following equation:\nwhere X = (x, y, z), \u03c3 represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian function. (\u03b8, \u03c6) are the orientation angles. F represents the central frequency of the frequency response. Finally,\u0125(X, F, \u03b8, \u03c6) is given by:\nIn our method, the texture maps are the magnitude of the signal resulting from the convolution of our Gabor lters bank with the MRI. In the proposed pipeline (see Fig. 1 ), the preprocessed MRI of the subject under study is ltered with a bank of Gabor lters to obtain multiple texture maps. All the training library is also ltered with the same lters bank. Therefore, for each texture map, a texture-based grading map can be estimated."}, {"section_title": "Patch-based grading", "text": "Grading framework uses patch-based techniques to capture signal modications related to anatomical degradations caused by AD [9] . To date, patch-based grading methods demonstrate state-of-the-art performances to detect the earliest stages of AD [20; 33] . To determine the pathological status of a subject, .\ngrading-based methods estimate at each voxel the state of cerebral tissues using anatomical patterns extracted from a training library T composed of two datasets, one with images from CN subjects and one with AD patients. Next, for each voxel of the considered subject, the patch-based grading method produces weak classiers denoted g. This weak classier is based on the similarity between the patch surrounding the voxel under study x i and a set K i of similar patches extracted from T . In this work, we used an approximative nearest neighbor method to nd similar patches in the training library in order to drastically reduce the required computational time [17] . The grading value g at x i is dened as:\nwhere t j is the voxel j belonging to the training template t \u2208 T , P xi and P tj are the patches surrounding x i and t j , respectively. The function w(P xi , P tj ) is the weight assigned to the pathological status p t of t. We estimate w such as:\nwhere h = min tj ||P xi \u2212 P tj || 2 2 with \u2192 0, p t is set to \u22121 for patches extracted from AD patient and to 1 for those extracted from CN subject. The L2-norm is used to estimate the similarly between patches. Thus, our patch-based grading method provides at each voxel a score representing an estimation of the alterations caused by AD."}, {"section_title": "Adaptive fusion", "text": "In this work, we propose a novel framework to fuse the multiple texturebased grading maps obtained from the estimated texture maps. Our fusion strategy assumes that all the estimated grading maps may not have the same relevance, but more importantly all local weak classiers g xi in these maps do not have the same quality. Hence, at each location, we propose to combine weak classiers derived from multiple texture maps according to a condence criterion. Therefore, the grading value g xi,n at voxel x i,n of a texture-based grading map n , is weighted by:\nthat reects the condence of g xi,n for the texture-based grading map n, here t j is the voxel j belonging to the training template t \u2208 T and K i,n is the set of similar patches extracted from the training library T at the voxel x i of the texture map n. Thus, each texture-based grading map provides a weak classier at each voxel that is weighted with its degree of condence \u03b1 xi,n . The nal grading value g xi is given by:\nThe proposed fusion framework is spatially adaptive and take advantage of having access to a local degree of condence \u03b1 xi,n for each grading map n. Basically, the condence \u03b1 xi,n gives more weight to a weak classier estimated with a well-matched set of patches. This adaptive fusion strategy can applied to any patch-based processing to combine multiple feature or modalities."}, {"section_title": "Weak classiers aggregation", "text": "In previous works on patch-based grading, the weak classier aggregation was performed using a simple averaging [9; 17] . While using a strategy based on averaging enables to be robust to noise, this may remove relevant information on weak classiers distribution. Therefore, in this paper we propose to approximate weak classiers distribution using histogram. Consequently, we classify histogram bins instead of classifying mean grading value over the segmentation mask. Here, histograms were separately estimated for right and left hippocampus and concatenate into a single feature vector. The number of bins are set following Sturge's formula that intends to nd the optimum number of bin for a certain size of sample [30] . Finally, to prevent bias introduced by structure alterations related to aging, all the grading values are age corrected with a linear regression based on the CN group [11] . This correction is done by removing the test CN subjects into a cross-validation procedure."}, {"section_title": "Implementation", "text": "During our experiments, texture maps were obtained using one scale and 11 dierent directions. The texture-based grading maps were estimated using patches of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 voxels. The grading step based on an optimized PatchMatch [17] was performed using K = 50. The required computational time was 3s per texture maps, thus the global grading step required 15 seconds with our setup. A support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used to classify each test subject. We used the Matlab function provided by the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. In our experiments, the soft margin parameter C was optimized with a Bayesian optimization method. The results of each experiment were compared in terms of accuracy (ACC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC), specicity (SPE), and sensitivity (SEN). The AUC is estimated with the a posteriori probabilities provided by the SVM classier. We carried out several experiments: CN versus AD, CN versus pMCI, AD versus sMCI and sMCI versus pMCI. A t-test were performed to study the signicance of the results provided by adaptive fusion scheme compared to mean of textural maps and late fusion into SVM classier. Finally, our new texture-based grading framework was validated within a repeated stratied 10-fold cross-validation procedure iterated 50 times for CN versus AD, CN versus pMCI and AD versus sMCI comparisons. The mean ACC, AUC, SPE, and SEN over these 50 iterations are provided as results. As demonstrated in [33] , training the classier with CN and AD enables to discriminate sMCI and pMCI subjects better. Moreover, it enables to perform classication without cross-validation procedure and to limit bias and over-tting problem. Therefore, only one run was performed for sMCI versus pMCI comparison.

A fusion of Gabor lters at dierent scales was also performed. However, this experiment shown that lters at the full image resolution is enough to obtain the best results. The experiments showed that the optimal set of lters directions is {(\u03b8 = 0; \u03c6 = 0), (\u03c0/2; \u03c0/2), (0; \u03c0/2), (\u03c0/4; \u03c0/4), (\u03c0/4; \u2212\u03c0/4)}.

Table 2 summarizes the results of intensity-based grading and the proposed texture-based grading obtained with 5 Gabor lters. Results are expressed with area under the curve (AUC), sensibility (SEN) and specicity (SPE) measures.\nAs it is shown, texture-based grading improves classication performances in all experiments using mean or histogram-based grading.

The results of this comparison are expressed in accuracy. On one hand, to compare classication results using the same structure, the proposed framework is compared with grading methods based on HIPP (see the upper part of Table 4 ). Thus, our proposed texture-based grading method is compared with the original patch-based grading method [9] , a grading based on multiple instance learning method [32] , and a patch-based grading based on a sparse representation using two dierent registration strategies [33] . This comparison shows that our method provides best results among HIPP-based grading methods. It reaches 91.3% of accuracy for CN versus AD, and 72.2% of accuracy for sMCI versus pMCI comparisons. On the other hand, our proposed method applied into hippocampus is compared with methods based on a whole brain analysis using similar dataset (see the lower part of Table 4 ). Indeed, we compare our texture-based grading approach applied on HIPP with an ensemble grading that proposed to extend the original patch-based grading to a whole brain analysis based on grey matter maps [20] , the patch-based grading method based on a sparse representation applied on the whole brain [33] , a sparse ensemble grading method that analyzes the whole brain [21] , and a Deep Learning (DL) method based a whole brain analysis [31] . The results show that our method obtains the best accuracy for AD versus CN. This result is similar to classication results obtained with a DL and sparse ensemble grading method [31; 21] . However, methods based on a whole brain analysis and using non linear registration obtain more accurate classication results for sMCI versus pMCI."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this work, to improve patch-based grading framework, we proposed to capture texture information with a bank of Gabor lters. Our experiments showed that using more than 5 directions does not improve the results while increasing computational time (see Figure 3) . Moreover, we also investigated a multi-scale texture approach. However, the experiments carried out showed that only one scale, at the full image resolution, is enough and the use of multiscale texture did not improve classication performances. Therefore, we propose a multi-directional texture-based grading framework based on 1 scale and 5 directions.\nA new grading values aggregation method based on histogram was also proposed. During our experiments, histogram representation of grading values distribution did not provide improvement for CN versus AD comparison compared to use a simple average value. That could be explained by the fact that CN and AD distributions are well separated and a parametric representation of their distributions is enough to discriminate these two groups. However, for sMCI versus pMCI case, the two distributions are less separable and histogram representation lead to better classication performances with in average a gain of 1 percentage point of AUC compared to a simple average value.\nIn order to fuse eciently the dierent texture-based grading maps, we proposed a novel patch-based grading fusion scheme. This method is based on a condence value estimated at each voxel. The comparison with dierent fusion schemes demonstrated the eciency of our method. Indeed, compared to a straight average of the texture-based grading maps and a SVM fusion of the nal histogram features with the classier, our proposed method obtained best accuracy for AD detection and prediction. Moreover, the obtained improvement was signicant. This improvement can be explained by the fact that our proposed adaptive fusion method weights the grading values of each texture map according to their relevances while the fusion into SVM classier and the average of texture maps considers each grading value as having the same importance. Our work hypothesis is also that directional texture lters enable to improve patch comparison, and thus increase AD detection and prediction accuracy. To validate this hypothesis, our novel texture-based grading using an optimal set of Gabor lters were compared with others texture lters as done for segmentation in [35] (see Figure 5) . STD, entropy, gradient and Gabor lters were compared for AD detection and prediction. This experiment showed that STD and entropy does not enable to improve patch comparison compare to intensity. The limitation of these lters might be to perform feature estimation within a window. Thus, only gradient and Gabor lters improve classication performances for AD detection and prediction. Moreover, Gabor lters obtain best results for both comparisons. This improvement is related to the use of additional texture directions compared to the three texture directions provided by gradient lter. Table 4 summarizes the comparison of our proposed method with other grading methods proposed in the literature. These results demonstrate that Gabor lters enable to better capture structural alterations than method based on intensity or grey matter data. Indeed, texture maps provide enhance information leading to a better grading process. Thus, our method outperforms other grading methods using intensity when applied on the same structure [9; 32; 33] . At the lower part of Table 4 , we compare the performance of our HIPP-based grading method with methods using the whole brain. First, for AD versus CN, the proposed method obtained similar or better results than methods applied over the whole brain. It is important to note that these methods require non linear registration [21; 20; 33; 31] while our method only requires ane registration and proposes a fast grading step. Second, for sMCI versus pMCI, our method obtained better results than all the methods involving a simple ane registration, including whole brain method proposed in [33] . On the other hand, the best results for sMCI versus pMCI are produced by whole brain grading [20; 33] using non linear registration. The improvement when using non linear registration is observed for HIPP-based and whole brain methods [33] . However, this improvement is obtained at the expense of using non linear registration, which is subject to failure and requires high computational time. Our method also demonstrated competitive performances for AD versus CN classication compared to advanced DL methods using whole brain and non linear registration [31] . Finally, this comparison shows that patch-based grading methods [20; 33] obtain similar or better results than recent deep learning methods [31] when applied over the entire brain after non linear registration. 6. Conclusion In this work, we have proposed a new texture-based grading framework to better capture structural alterations caused by AD. Moreover, to combine grading maps estimated on texture maps, we have presented a new adaptive fusion scheme. We also have proposed an histogram-based weak classiers aggregation step to better discriminate early stages of AD. We have studied the optimal set of texture directions and compare to others fusion schemes. Experiments conducted in this work demonstrated the relevance of using textural information in combination with with our novel locally adaptive fusion method. Finally, we have demonstrated the competitive performances of our new texture-based grading framework compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.
