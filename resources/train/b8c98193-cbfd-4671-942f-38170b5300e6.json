[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "South Dakota lies in the northern corn belt of the United States and agricultural production is a main driver of South Dakota's economy. In 2008, agriculture accounted for close to 10% of South Dakota's $37 billion economy 1 . The agricultural industry in the state has undergone a myriad of changes that are related to the rapid adoption of biotechnology and an increased demand for corn driven by the rapid expansion in corn-based ethanol production in South Dakota 2 . These two factors have contributed to a change in the crop rotation profile over the last 30 years, shifting from a profile with a large proportion of wheat, barley and oats toward one that is dominated by corn and soybeans. In 2010, South Dakota was ranked: (a) seventh in corn production, (b) eighth in soybean production, (c) second in sunflower production and (d) fourth in hay production in the United States 3 . South Dakota has adopted genetically modified (GM) varieties faster than any other state (see Fig. 1 ) 4 . The rapid adoption of GM crops in South Dakota over the past 15 years suggests that a change in pest management practices should have occurred during this period. One of the predicted benefits of the adoption of GM crops is a decline in insecticide use due to the ability of insecticidal GM crops to kill specific target insects.\nIn "}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Analysis of chemical usage, specifically insecticides, is complex given the number of factors that influence usage, including advances in seed varieties, introduction of new chemical compounds and fluctuating pest infestation levels.\nRecent studies have focused on various trends in pesticide use. For example, as new ground is broken for growing a crop there is a tendency for pesticide use to increase. The literature indicates that this occurred in the early 1980s. Osteen and Livingston 7 reported that there was an increase in planted acres and also an increase in pesticide application rates. The literature also discusses a recent trend toward mono-cropping or reduced use of rotations to meet market demands. This trend is in contrast to integrated pest management practices that reduce insect pest populations, and monocultures may even intensify pest pressure 8 . Indeed, biodiversity and species evenness are both critical aspects of agroecosystems' natural ability to resist pest pressure, and this ability is reduced or eliminated by monoculture cropping practices 9, 10 . Insecticide use is thus necessary to control the resulting increasing pest populations in monocultures.\nThe presence of damaging insect pests is an important determinant of insecticide use. Intuitively one can assume that insect pest infestation levels are closely related to the amount of insecticide applied. That is to say, ceteris paribus, the more insects that are present the more a producer will spray. These infestation levels, however, can fluctuate from year to year, are often difficult to predict and can spread rapidly. Previous studies indicate that the inability to predict pest infestations can lead producers to spray insecticide prophylactically 11, 12 . Insect pest infestation data have been used in previous studies to investigate the issue of producers making a simultaneous decision of insecticide use and GM adoption 13, 14 . Perceived pest pressure likely affects whether a producer adopts GM seed and also how much they spray. By omitting pest pressure data there is likely a correlation between the error term and the dependent variable. Twostage regressions are often used to model this type of decision-making process.\nThe most common empirical methodology used to investigate insecticide usage on agricultural crops is to evaluate changes in total pounds of insecticide applied [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the literature, however, an evaluation of chemical usage (such as 'volume applied') ignores important chemical attributes like strength and application practices 7 . As a result, problems arise when trying to assess changes in insecticide application rates over time.\nOne alternative method that accounts for changing chemical attributes is a hedonic pricing model. A hedonic pricing model can provide a proxy for changes in chemical potency and breadth 14 . Another alternative empirical method proposed by Alston et al. 18 estimates chemical usage by multiplying the total acreage by the percentage treated for corn rootworm specifically. We have adopted a similar approach in this study. Our empirical methodology focuses on estimating the changes in chemical usage as a percentage of crop acres treated with insecticides in South Dakota.\nThere is a general consensus in the literature that total pesticide (herbicide plus insecticide) usage (total pounds applied) has increased due to increased GM acreage planted 19 , largely driven by increased glyphosate usage associated with glyphosate-tolerant GM crops. The general consensus is GM adoption has decreased insecticide per acre usage on US corn acreage planted over the past decade 20 . However, Benbrook 19 argues that only a small proportion of corn acres were treated with insecticides prior to the introduction of Bt varieties. Therefore, the reduction in per acre insecticide usage associated with Bt adoption may be overestimated in the recent literature. These findings reported by Benbrook suggest that the observed increase in acres treated with insecticide in South Dakota may indicate a reversal in the downward trend for insecticide usage by producers in states with high GM adoption rates. This trend reversal may be reinforced by unintended consequences associated with very high Bt adoption rates. For example, the introduction of Bt corn has allowed US producers to practice mono-cropping or reduced use of rotations to increase corn production. Insect populations facing greater exposure to a single environmental barrier may genetically adapt, thus reducing the effectiveness of the GM trait. Meihls et al. 21 reports western corn rootworm has the ability to adapt to Bt toxins if refuge acre policy recommendations are not followed, and Bt-resistant corn rootworms were recently discovered in Iowa cornfields 22 . Our goal is to make a contribution to the GM/pesticide debate by providing insight on increased insecticide usage in a state having a high GM adoption rate targeting corn insect pests."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Issues", "text": "Corn, soybean, hay and sunflowers are important crops for South Dakota agriculture and each has significant pest problems. Corn has several pests that cause crop damage every year, including the European corn borer . Sunflowers, because they are a native species and harbor an endemic insect fauna, face a substantial pest threat from 15 different insects 25 . Infestations can be highly variable even within a single sunflower field. Over time these pests have undoubtedly affected insecticide use. As this study does not directly link GM adoption to insecticide use, the inclusion of pest infestation data is not critical. However, we included a proxy variable for soybean aphid infestation at the county level in 2007. This proxy is potentially important because the scope of infestation and insecticide-use responses have changed dramatically over the timeframe of this study.\nTo estimate the effect of multiple explanatory variables on insecticide use for all counties in South Dakota, a fixed-effect model was employed. A fixed-effect model is often used on non-experimental data, where a scientific control group is not available or possible, treating each observation as its own control 26 . This model also accounts for time-invariant unobserved effects that are not captured with available data 27 . A typical ordinary least-squares (OLS) model often suffers from omitted variable bias. In the case of insecticide usage, the omitted variable is frequently the magnitude of the pest population. In South Dakota there are limited data on this particular issue, making it challenging to describe the relationship between insecticide use and other variables. Using the fixed-effect model we can assume there are two types of unobserved effects, those that vary over time and those that are constant, denoted as U it and a i , respectively 27 . The unobserved effect, a i , accounts for unobserved effects that do not change over time (i.e., latitude, longitude, soil type and cultural norms). The time-varying error term U it is subject to many assumptions that require some discussion. Examples include precipitation and technology adoption.\nAccounting for pest populations is of particular importance. Some pest populations are unpredictable and can vary greatly from year to year. Also, pest communities have experienced dramatic change over the past 30 years. To account for the potential effect of soybean aphid pest populations at the county level we include a variable that identifies soybean aphid infestation presence in South Dakota in 2007. Other changes in pest populations are contained within the time-varying error term. We also make the assumption that pest populations are not correlated with crop choice as we believe there are other factors that have greater influence on crop selection, including market demands and prices as well as protective measures if pest infestations occur. If correlation between crop proportion and pest population does exist it would violate several of the assumptions necessary to ensure unbiased estimation 27 . Furthermore, we are not interested in how market factors are affecting cropping patterns. We consider this an issue for future research. Given the econometric caveats, our goal is to investigate how changes in cropping patterns may have affected the proportion of crop acreage applied with insecticide. Of special interest is corn acreage treated with insecticide because it is the only major crop in South Dakota that has a GM solution for insect pests."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data from several sources were used in this project. Data were collected from the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) as well as the US Census of Agriculture. Data regarding total acres planted and cropspecific acres planted at the county level were retrieved from NASS's Quick 'Stats All States Data-Crops' 28 . The census data on chemical usage were collected from 'Agriculture Chemicals Used, specifically: sprays, dusts, granules, fumigants, etc. to control insects on hay and other crops'. The census reports all acres treated at the county level, but does not report crop-specific acres treated. The empirical hurdle we overcome is the lack of data on which crops are being treated, and by extension providing insight on why there has been an increase in acres treated as a proportion of acres planted at the county level. Soybean aphid infestation information by county is provided by the Plant Science Department at South Dakota State University and the Agricultural Research Service Station in Brookings South Dakota."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Model", "text": "The data set contains observations for each county over the past seven Census reporting periods . A fixed-effect modeling approach was selected to analyze the constructed panel data set. The data are a balanced panel, meaning that there are no missing observations for any counties over the observed years. Given the econometric issues discussed earlier, we used a 'cluster robust standard error' approach to account for both the intra-cluster correlation and between-cluster heteroscedasticity. Intracluster correlation can be caused by unobserved omitted variables (e.g., insect populations: see equation 21-13 in Cameron and Trivedi 29 for more details). A complete listing of the variables used in the model, and their definitions, is located in Table 1 . Summary statistics for the variables are provided in Table 2 .\nThe analysis uses South Dakota county-level data on acres planted with corn, soybean, sunflower and hay. Figure 2 . for i county in year t.\n(2)\nThe dependent variable in both regressions is a countylevel variable and is defined as: Y it ; total acres treated with insecticide it /total acres planted it . By using the proportion of acres treated with insecticide as the dependent variable, instead of a weighted measurement of pesticides applied, we can avoid the problem of aggregating across a heterogeneous group of pesticides 30 . The outliers within the data identified in Figures 2  and 3 are worth discussion. Figure 2 shows the level and year of outlier occurrence, whereas Figure 3 provides The rapid expansion of the soybean aphid from 20 counties in 2001 to 46 counties in 2007 (all soybeanproducing counties in South Dakota) has resulted in it becoming targeted as a major pest. To capture the aphid effect on insecticide usage a binary variable is included, set to one for counties when the soybean aphid is present in 2007 and zero otherwise. This variable is a proxy for aphid pest populations and it is hypothesized that the presence of the soybean aphid affected insecticide usage in South Dakota. Tables 3 and 4 provide coefficient and goodness-of-fit statistics for the two estimated models. The Hausman Test indicated that a fixed-effect approach is the appropriate choice for both models. The regression estimates for the first model indicate that corn, hay and aphid coefficients are statistically significant and are positively related to the proportion of acres treated with insecticide. The soybean and sunflower coefficients are not statistically significant. The estimated model has a global F statistic of 24.16, an R 2 of 0.35, and a correlation between model residuals and regressors of: (u i , Xb) = \u2212 0.3790."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The initial fixed-effect model estimates indicated that the soybean parameter estimate was significant at the 1% level. However, when the model was adjusted for intra-cluster correlation the parameter estimate became statistically insignificant. This also occurred in the second regression, where the soybean parameter estimate was statistically significant at the 1% level prior to the regression procedure being adjusted for intra-cluster correlation. Therefore, we believe that our parameter estimates are valid but are insignificant due to multicollinearity between the aphid, corn and soybean variables. Table 3 indicates, ceteris paribus, that a 1% increase in corn acres planted will result in an estimated 0.24% increase in total acres treated in a county. The average proportion of county corn acres planted has increased from about 20% in the 1980s and 1990s to 28.5% in 2007. This suggests as corn acreage increases relative to alternative crops, insecticide usage increases. During this period South Dakota producers increased their planting of insect-resistant GM corn acres from 33% in 2000 to 59% in 2007, respectively (Fig. 1) . The literature suggests that the relationship between GM corn and insecticide usage should be inversely related. That does not appear to be the case in South Dakota. These empirical findings may be reflecting the prophylactic application of neonicotinoid seed treatments 32 that often accompany GM trait packages in corn seed purchases. Or the increased usage of insecticide on corn acres planted may be due to producers abandoning traditional crop rotation practices, or breaking native ground to create additional crop land.\nThe statistically significant and positive coefficient for hay is also interesting. The hay coefficient implies that, holding the effects of the other variables constant, a 1% increase in the proportion of hay acres planted would result in a 0.27% increase in the proportion of acres treated. This may be the result of pest damage. Alfalfa, a subset of the hay variable, faces a significant pest threat from the alfalfa weevil. The alfalfa weevil has been present in South Dakota since 1973 and causes economic damage in many western South Dakota counties, where a large proportion of South Dakota alfalfa acres are planted 24 . The soybean coefficient is statistically insignificant at the 10% level. As expected, the corn and soybean variables are highly correlated. The estimated correlation coefficient is 0.80. The aphid variable is also highly correlated with corn and soybeans, 0.40 and 0.45, respectively. Alternative estimation methods to deal with this high level of multi-collinearity were ineffective. Multi-collinearity inflates the standard errors but the coefficient estimates retain efficiency. The soybean coefficient is consistent with expected behavior. The only major insect pest threat to soybeans in South Dakota is the soybean aphid. Therefore, a negative soybean coefficient and a statistically significant positive aphid coefficient are consistent with the expected relationship between these variables and the dependent variable, i.e., the proportion of planted acres treated with insecticide.\nThe soybean aphid coefficient estimate is statistically significant at the 5% level. In 2007, ceteris paribus, it is estimated that counties with aphid infestation had 5.8% more acres treated with insecticide than counties without aphid infestations.\nIn Table 3 , the 2007 year-dummy variable was statistically significant and positive. The regression coefficient indicates the estimated increase in total acres treated in 2007 is 6.1% higher than for the other census years in the study. This result corresponds to the noticeable increase in acres treated as shown in Figure 2 . This statistically significant result prompted additional analysis that resulted in the inclusion of the 2007 interaction terms that are present in the second regression.\nThe second regression and the inclusion of 2007 interaction terms is an attempt to gain insight on why acres treated increased in 2007. The interaction terms capture the change in the slope relationship between the percentage of acres treated and the proportion of acres planted for a specific crop for the year 2007. If the regression coefficient for an interaction term is statistically significant and positive, then the implication is that insecticide usage has intensified for that specific crop. The second regression model is statistically significant, with an F statistic of 51.27, an R 2 value of 0.36 and a correlation between model residuals and regressors of: (u i , Xb) = \u2212 0.2436. The results for the second regression are reported in Table 4 . The 2007 dummy variables were dropped from the second model due to multi-collinearity issues.\nThe coefficient estimates for the crop variables were consistent with the first regression while the interaction terms lend some insight on the increase in insecticide use in 2007. The 2007 interaction variables for corn, sunflower and hay are significant and positive, implying an intensification of insecticide usage. The soybean and soybean interaction terms are statistically insignificant. The soybean parameter estimate was statistically significant at the 1% level prior to the regression procedure being adjusted for intra-cluster correlation."}, {"section_title": "Bt Corn and Insecticide Usage in South Dakota Counties", "text": "The regression estimates (Table 4) 0.22% increase in the proportion of acres treated, ceteris paribus. These back of the envelope findings are surprising on a number of levels. First, GM corn acreage share and insecticide corn acreage coverage both increased. Secondly, in 2007, on average at the county level, corn accounted for 28.4% of total acres planted. Bt corn account for 59% of corn acres planted. Therefore, Bt corn accounted for 16.75% of total acres planted (0.59*0.284).\nIf we assume Bt corn acres were not treated with insecticide, then non-Bt corn acres accounted for 11.65% of total acres planted. The implication is that in 2007 109.87% of non-Bt corn acres planted in South Dakota was treated with insecticide (0.128/0.1165). We regard this estimate as an upper-bound for non-Bt acres treated and it suggests that South Dakota producers treated some Bt acres with insecticide in 2007.\nThis proportion is exceedingly high given: (1) that in 2002 it is estimated that 38.5% of non-Bt corn acres were treated acres; (2) traditional insect pest management patterns prior to GM introduction; and (3) the USDA refuge acreage requirement for producers who use Bt seed. Our estimate of a very large increase in corn acres treated raises some interesting questions. Has the change in cropping or seed marketing patterns forced producers to rely more heavily on chemical control? Is it the result of producers moving away from traditional rotation control methods used in the past to suppress insect pests? Are producers treating Bt corn acres in a manner they treat non-Bt acres? Additional research needs to be conducted on this issue.\nNext, the coefficient estimates for the interaction terms found in Table 4 "}, {"section_title": "Broader Implications of the South Dakota Case Study", "text": "One question raised by the findings reported in this case study is whether the 2007 increase in acres treated with insecticide in South Dakota was an isolated phenomenon or whether other mid-western states experienced a similar increase. Figure 5 shows the proportion of acres treated with insecticide from 1987 to 2007. Of the 13 states that were looked at, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota and Kentucky seem to have experienced a marked increase in the proportion of acres treated in 2007. It is worth noting that while there appears to be a large and sudden increase, because of the limited nature of the data, it is unclear as to whether this increase was in fact gradual for the years in between 2002 and 2007.\nFor some states, like Illinois, the increase in the proportion of acres treated began in 1992. Other states, including Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Indiana, Kentucky, had relatively low, though variable, proportions of their cropland treated with insecticides until the increase in 2007. The differences between states could be the result of varying or spreading pest populations, but more likely this is the result of a national paradigm shift in insecticide use in spite of the widespread adoption of Bt.\nThe 13 states listed in Figure 5 make up the Midwest region of the United States and are intensive cropproducing states. These states will provide the basis for further analysis at the county level and could provide greater insight into the reasons for the 2007 increase in the proportion of acres planted being treated with insecticide."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The empirical evidence gleaned from this South Dakota case study indicates that corn, hay and sunflower production in South Dakota has experienced a recent intensification of insecticide use. Furthermore, we have provided an empirical linkage to the increase in acres treated with insecticide in South Dakota to the intensification of insecticide use for specific crops. USDA data on acres treated with insecticide for other Midwestern states suggest that these states have experienced a similar recent increase in acres treated as is the case for South Dakota. The specter of a pattern of intensification of insecticide usage for crops coinciding with an intensification of GM crop production suggests additional research is needed.\nEmpirical evidence indicates that corn acres planted has a major impact on the proportion of acres treated with insecticide in South Dakota. This is partially due to corn being a major South Dakota crop. It is interesting that as GM adoption rose in South Dakota, so did the proportion of acres treated. There are a number of plausible explanations for this positive correlation. Producers may be treating more acres as an insurance policy against unnamed insect pests that are not targeted by Bt corn. The chemicals and products applied to crops today to protect against this and other non-target pests are often broadspectrum products which will protect against a variety of potential threats, but also pose potential environmental harm to beneficial species 33 . Exogenous shocks affecting the market demand for corn may be affecting traditional crop rotation patterns, which have been a common cultural method for pest management practices. Producers may now be relying on insecticides (planting GM seed and seed and foliar applications) more heavily than traditional crop rotation to control pests, thus increasing the acres being treated.\nAs a final note, our study suggests that additional research is needed on the relationship between GM adoption rates and insecticide usage. Our analysis suggests that regions with high GM adoption rates may be experiencing unexpected insect pest issues not predicted in the previous literature."}]
