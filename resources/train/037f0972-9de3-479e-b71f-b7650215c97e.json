These infection-related QMs are used to calculate overall ratings for NHs (up to 5 stars possible). 6 Training and education of NH staff is crucial to the implementation of and compliance with recommended IPC practices, especially for those providing direct patient care (ie, certified nursing assistants [CNAs] ). Lack of knowledge on IPC topics is perceived to limit the ability of NH staff to adhere to IPC processes. 7 We aimed to describe relationships between methods, frequency, and timing of staff IPC training and infection-related QMs in a national sample of NHs."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "A survey of 2,514 randomly sampled US NHs was conducted between December 2013 and December 2014 to describe the current state of NH IPC programs (response rate, 39%). The individual in charge of the IPC program was invited to complete the survey. A detailed description of the survey has been published elsewhere. 8 For this analysis, the main exposures were derived from the survey and were related to staff IPC training: methods (computer-based training [yes 9 The other QMs were dichotomized based on median prevalence among respondents to compare better versus poorer performing NHs.\nFor each QM, descriptive statistics were computed using \u03c7 2 , Fisher's exact, or t tests, as appropriate, to identify differences between facilities with high versus low QM scores. Based on previous research, occupancy, ownership, setting, and CNA staffing were included as a priori covariates in multivariable logistic regression models. 5, 10 Setting was defined as metropolitan, nonmetropolitan with an urban population, and rural using the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. 11 Inclusion of additional covariates was determined based on the following criteria to identify potential confounding: association with the QM with a P value < .10; association with method, frequency, or timing of training on IPC topics with P value < .10; and change in beta value for method, frequency, or timing of training >10%. In multivariable analyses, variables with P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. To assess for potential selection bias, NH characteristics were compared for facilities with and without 2015 QM data. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). This research was approved by the Columbia University Medical Center institutional review board."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Analyses of surveys from NHs for which we had both exposures and QM data (n = 851) were performed: n = 796 for both urinary catheter and UTI, n = 805 for both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and n = 790 for pressure ulcers.\nCompared with respondents without QM data, those with QM data were more likely to provide computer-based training (51% vs 38%; P = .01). Although not statistically significant, they were also more likely to conduct training at both new employee orientation and when an infection outbreak occurred (64% vs 59%; P = .27) ( Table  A2) . Based on the sample of NHs with QM data, the majority of NHs were for-profit (68%), located in metropolitan areas (72%), and in the Midwest (38%) ( Table A2 ). On average, occupancy, bed size and CNA staffing level were 82%, 120 beds, and 2.42 hours per resident per day, respectively. About 77% provided handouts or posted flyers in care units. Almost all provided inservices and, due to lack of variation, associations between inservices and QMs were not evaluated. About 30% conducted trainings frequently (ie, monthly, biweekly, or weekly). Eleven percent, 6%, and 17% of NHs conducted IPC training only at new employee orientation, only when an infection outbreak occurred, or neither, respectively (data not shown). About 64% of NHs conducted training at both orientation and when an outbreak occurred. The median prevalence of residents vaccinated for influenza and pneumococcal disease was 98% (interquartile range [IQR], 94%-100%). The median prevalence of residents with pressure ulcers, indwelling catheters, and UTI was 5.0% (IQR, 3.0%-8.0%), 2.5% (IQR, 1.4%-4.1%), and 4.0% (IQR, 2.4%-6.8%), respectively.\nIn the bivariate analyses, timing of training was associated with urinary catheter use (P = .01; Table 1 ); however, no other QMs were associated with the exposures of interest (data not shown but are available upon request). In the multivariable analysis (Table 2) , NHs with high urinary catheter use (ie, poorer quality with regard to catheter use) were less likely to conduct training at both new employee orientation and when an infection outbreak occurred (odds ratio, 0.70; P = .02)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "NHs that conducted staff training at both new employee orientation and when outbreaks occurred had better quality related to urinary catheter use. Whereas prior research has assessed the role of IPC professional training on NH quality, 10 to our knowledge none have examined the influence of IPC training of other NH staff. Furthermore, a NH with IPC training at both orientation and when an outbreak occurred may have a more robust IPC program. Our results support existing evidence that a tailored and continuous training program was better than a single intervention in reducing HAIs. 12 Direct patient care staff are responsible for the identification, assessment, and reporting of residents with infections. These responsibilities require sufficient understanding of IPC practices and are vital to the proper implementation of IPC processes. Our results indicate that more intensive training may improve staff knowledge of IPC processes, an important step toward improving overall quality of care. Moreover, urinary catheter use is strongly associated with development of catheter-associated UTIs in NHs, 13 suggesting that reinforcement of IPC processes through timely staff training may be a way to decrease infection rates in NHs, although additional research is warranted.\nWe found that IPC training did not significantly influence the UTI and pressure ulcer QMs. Although urinary catheter use is a strong predictor of UTI, the majority of UTIs in NHs are among residents without catheters, 13 indicating that other factors are involved. Additionally, pressure ulcers might result more from a resident's clinical condition rather than IPC practices and, therefore, pressure ulcer prevention may not receive as much attention during IPC training as other topics. 1 This study has several limitations. The data were cross-sectional; however, we addressed temporality concerns by linking 2014 survey exposure data with 2015 Nursing Home Compare outcome measures. Survey data were self-reported and therefore subject to bias. However, it is likely that exposure misclassification would have been nondifferential and therefore biased the results toward the null. Based on the comparison of NHs with and without QM data, facilities differed on several characteristics and facilities with QM data had more robust IPC training programs. Due to possible selection bias, our analysis likely included facilities with better overall quality and more robust training programs, which could lead to an underestimation of the odds ratio. Another limitation was our inability to account for infection outbreaks. It is possible that NHs that experience more frequent outbreaks may provide more timely training specific to the outbreak or more broadly, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the relationship between IPC training and catheter use. However, no association was found between IPC training and pressure ulcers or UTIs, which are infection outcomes rather than processes."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "HAIs are a major issue in NHs and infection-related QMs are used to evaluate quality.
