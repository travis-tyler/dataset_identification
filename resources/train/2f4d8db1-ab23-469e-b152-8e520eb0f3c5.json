Although there are sex differences in AD risk, sex differences have not been evaluated in genetic studies of AD endophenotypes. We performed sex-stratified and sex interaction genetic analyses of CSF biomarkers to identify sex-specific associations. Data came from a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF A\u03b242 and tau (1527 males, 1509 females). We evaluated sex interactions at previous loci, performed sex-stratified GWAS to identify sex-specific associations, and evaluated sex interactions at sex-specific GWAS loci. We then evaluated sex-specific associations between prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression at relevant loci and autopsy measures of plaques and tangles using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In A\u03b242, we observed sex interactions at one previous and one novel locus: rs316341 within SERPINB1 (p = 0.04) and rs13115400 near LINC00290 (p = 0.002). was associated with higher levels of amyloidosis among females (corrected p values < 0.02) but not males (p > 0.38). In total tau, we observed a sex interaction at a previous locus, rs1393060 proximal to GMNC (p = 0.004), driven by a stronger association among females (\u03b2 = 0.05, p = 4.57 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ) compared to males (\u03b2 = 0.02, p = 0.03). There was also a sex-specific association between rs1393060 and tangle density at autopsy (p female = 0.047; p male = 0.96), and higher levels of expression of two genes within this locus were associated with lower tangle density among females (OSTN p = 0.006; CLDN16 p = 0.002) but not males (p \u2265 0.32).

The Lancet Neurology Commission thus asserted that a focus on sex differences in AD is essential to advance the field [37] . The identification of sex-specific AD genetic drivers could transform the way treatments are developed and administered and be a critical step towards personalized interventions for AD.\nAD is characterized by plaques consisting of aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of phosphorylated tau protein [47] . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 is a biomarker for brain amyloidosis, while total tau (ttau) reflects the intensity of neurodegeneration and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) relates to tau pathology [7] . Alterations in both of these proteins are measurable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) years prior to the clinical onset of disease [31, 32] , and have become a focus of the preclinical characterization of AD [30] . Work over the past 5 years has sought to elucidate the genetic architecture of CSF amyloid and tau through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [11, 12, 15] . APOE has a strong association with both CSF amyloid and tau. Recent work from our group [26] and others [1] suggests that the APOE association with t-tau and p-tau is stronger among females compared to males, but there is no sex difference in associations between APOE and amyloidosis. There have been two additional loci identified in relation to amyloidosis, and four related to CSF tau [15] . Yet, sex differences have not been integrated into GWAS studies of CSF AD biomarkers.\nThis manuscript provides a comprehensive characterization of sex-specific genetic predictors of CSF amyloid and tau. The use of quantitative traits (in this case continuous measures of CSF A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau) provides additional statistical power and outcome metrics that are more proximal to genetic function. We perform a sex-stratified GWAS of CSF amyloid and tau to identify loci that show disparate associations between males and females. For all sex-specific genome-wide associations, we formally assess whether the association differs by sex. Finally, we leverage transcriptomic data from human prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue to test whether we observe sex-specific associations between gene expression at the relevant loci and levels of AD neuropathology at autopsy. This work highlights sex-specific markers of amyloid and tau, and clarifies the degree to which known loci act in a sex-specific manner."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used here were previously described [15] .

Sex-specific analyses were then evaluated using the same covariates stratifying by males and females. For sex interaction analyses, a sex \u00d7 SNP interaction term was included in the original statistical model.\nTo identify sex differences at known loci, we re-evaluated the most significant single-SNP associations from seven genome-wide significant loci for A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau (p-tau 181 specifically) that had been published [15] . We noted any loci with a significant sex interaction effect (nominal p < 0.05) on the published outcome and corrected for the seven SNPs evaluated. Next, to identify novel sexspecific loci, we assessed all GWAS markers for associations within one sex using the established GWAS threshold for statistical significance (\u03b1 = 5\u00d710 \u22128 ). All significant sexstratified effects were also assessed for sex interactions to test whether the coefficients differed by sex.

For eQTL association analyses, we corrected for the total number of tissue-gene combinations using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure.\nAdditional analyses were completed using the measures outlined above. We evaluated SNP associations with the relevant neuropathology covarying for age at death and education. Next, we tested sex-stratified and sex interaction associations between PFC expression of genes implicated in eQTL analyses and the neuropathology of interest, correcting for multiple comparisons using the FDR procedure. If Braineac and GTEx did not provide strong eQTL evidence at a given locus, we evaluated all genes within the cis region of the locus (i.e., 1 MB upstream and downstream of the SNP) and corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR procedure.\nTo explore if genome-wide associated SNPs were correlated with biomarkers of AD risk and progression, we tested for associations with adjusted hippocampal volume, episodic memory performance, and executive function performance in ADNI participants at baseline and over time. Linear regression covarying for age at baseline was used for cross-sectional analyses. Mixed-effect linear regression was used for longitudinal analyses. Fixed effects included age at baseline, SNP, interval (modeled as time in years from baseline), and a SNP \u00d7 interval interaction term. Random effects included the intercept and time interval. All analyses were run in the entire ADNI cohort (males and females), in males only, in females only, and in the entire cohort including a SNP \u00d7 sex interaction. Additionally, sex-stratified and sex interaction results were also calculated from a recently published age-of-onset analysis of AD [29] .

No associations were observed in the GERAD dataset."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We evaluated sex-specific genetic associations with biomarkers of AD neuropathology measured in CSF. We observed female-specific associations with amyloid levels in one previously identified locus on chromosome 6 and one novel locus on chromosome 4, both of which did not show an association among males. For t-tau, we confirmed that the APOE association is stronger among females compared to males [26] and provide new evidence that the previously observed t-tau association on chromosome 3 is driven by females. Finally, we provide functional evidence that the sex-specific association on chromosome 6 is driven by a female-specific effect of SERPINB1 gene expression levels on amyloidosis, and that the sex-specific association at chromosome 3 may be driven by a femalespecific association between OSTN or CLDN16 expression on t-tau levels. Together, our results highlight the importance of sex considerations in models of AD risk, suggesting potential candidate pathways that may differentially drive AD neuropathology among males and females.\nWe provide evidence that genetic variation within Serpin Family B Member 1 (SERPINB1) is related to amyloidosis, particularly among females. A similar sex-specific association was also observed in post hoc age-of-onset analyses, in which the minor allele of rs316341 was associated with an earlier age-of-onset among females, but not males. Our eQTL and PFC expression results provide support for SERPINB1's potential role in amyloidosis, particularly among females. Serpins are a family of protease inhibitors that are expressed ubiquitously including all cell types of the brain. Serpins have been implicated as potential inhibitors of A\u03b2 toxicity [48] , likely through a role in regulating neutrophil infiltration [18] in response to amyloidosis [15] . Neutrophil response is sex dimorphic and modulated by sex hormones in rats [14] , and there is evidence that estrogen has direct effects on neutrophil infiltration and clearance [43] . In total, our results suggest that SERPINB1 may be associated with amyloidosis in a sex-specific manner, with evidence suggesting it is a particularly relevant predictor among females. The previous work on SERPINB1 and neutrophil signaling highlights the need to better understand how gonadal hormonal changes in late life may impact the innate immune response to amyloidosis.\nFor t-tau, our results suggest a fundamental shift in the interpretation of GMNC region. Our results suggest the association at this locus is notably stronger in females than in males, with a similar female-specific association observed in relation to age-of-onset in post hoc survival analyses. Further, our eQTL and gene expression results highlight comparable sex-specific effects in the associations between two genes in this locus and brain tau levels, suggesting the SNP association may be partially driven by OSTN or CLDN16 rather than GMNC. OSTN expression levels are down-regulated in human neurons that are grafted into the brain of an AD mouse model [16] , suggesting OSTN may be modulated by the presence of amyloidosis. It is also notable that OSTN is regulated by neuronal activity, but only in the primate brain, suggesting involvement in higher order brain functions that are specific to primates [3] . OSTN is highly expressed in the neocortex of primates, and regulates dendritic growth [3] . Outside of the brain, the primary role of OSTN is in bone development, and OSTN responds to lowdose estradiol treatment in vitro [8] , leaving open the possibility that OSTN function in brain may act in a hormonedependent manner. Another candidate gene in this region was claudin 16 (CLDN16). CLDN16 is a tight junction protein with a role in renal magnesium processing [27] . Other claudins have been implicated in AD previously [44, 49] , and claudins 1, 11, and 16 are differentially expressed in the kidney of male rats compared to female rats [45] . Together with our results, these previous findings highlight CLDN16 and OSTN as strong candidate genes that may have a sexspecific association with CSF t-tau.\nOne novel association locus on chromosome 4 was identified in amyloid analyses and showed a stronger association among females compared to males. The signal was proximal to a non-protein coding RNA LINC00290, but we did not observe any eQTL associations in the region. In gene expression analyses, we observed some evidence of a comparable female-specific association between gene expression and amyloidosis for one gene in this locus, teneurin transmembrane protein 3 (TENM3). TENM3 is involved in neuronal development, axon guidance, and retinal mapping, and mutations in the gene cause the eye disorder microphthalmia [9] . TENM3 has not been implicated in AD previously, but represents an interesting candidate gene for follow-up.\nIt is notable that the sex-specific associations observed in relation to amyloid and tau appeared to be driven by differences among the cognitively normal individuals in agematched stratified analyses. However, the interpretation of results is challenging given the small sample size of the analyzed sub-groups. One possibility is that the observed sex-specific genetic effects are associated with deposition that occurs in the preclinical stage of disease, but larger datasets will be needed to fully explore the complex interplay between sex-specific genetic risk, age, and clinical status.\nWe also confirmed the sex difference in the association between APOE and CSF tau levels whereby females show a stronger association than males. We previously published this sex difference in a subset of the datasets here, and two additional datasets not included in this analysis (which lacked GWAS data) [26] . Across all the non-overlapping studies, the estimate of the sex interaction is strong. Only the Mayo dataset (see Table 1 ) showed an inverse direction of effect whereby the association between APOE and CSF total tau was slightly and non-significantly stronger in males compared to females. The Mayo dataset included the lowest percentages of females and APOE carriers and included older individuals on average, which may contribute to the divergent signal. Additional work is needed, particularly focusing on how selection criteria that emphasize memory impairment and a family history of AD could contribute to the observed sex difference in APOE associations with tau. Currently, the preponderance of data supports a stronger association between APOE and tau among females.\nThe present study has multiple strengths, including the large sample size, clinical characterization in most datasets, inclusion of comprehensive eQTL analyses, and autopsy follow-up analyses that identified functional candidate genes that had sex-specific associations with AD neuropathology. Our results highlight the value of sex-specific analytical models for genetic association studies.\nOur study has limitations. Our sample size did not provide adequate power to complete a full genome-wide interaction analysis that may highlight gene signals in opposite directions. The samples analyzed come from cohort studies that are highly educated and primarily White, limiting generalizability. Although we covaried for age and evaluated both age-matched and diagnosis stratified models, the sex differences in age and diagnosis are notable. A more carefully matched sample will be needed to better understand how sex differences in genetic risk for AD neuropathology change over the course of aging and disease. It is notable that the sex difference in the association between APOE and AD varies by age [41] , suggesting that larger samples will be needed to better model genetic interactions with age on AD biomarker levels. Our gene expression results from ROS/MAP were measured from prefrontal cortex tissue, which was previously selected for measurement due to its relevance to human cognition and AD. However, RNA was not available from other brain regions for analysis, limiting our ability to evaluate differential associations across brain regions, particularly highly relevant regions such as the hippocampus. Measurement in additional regions is ongoing, and future work delineating sex difference in gene expression associations across the brain is warranted.\nIn conclusion, our work has highlighted sex differences in the genetic predictors of AD biomarkers, including stronger associations between Serpin genes and amyloidosis among females. Modeling sex differences in GWAS analyses provides insights into novel genetic signals associated with disease, and provides a helpful framework for prioritizing and evaluating functional candidate genes.\nthe National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) at the University of Pennsylvania (U24-AG041689-01).
