The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that employment in master's degree level occupations is expected to grow by almost 17 percent from 2016 to 2026, the fastest of any education level, and employment in doctoral and professional degree level is expected to grow by about 13 percent. a In accordance with this rise in demand, the share of college graduates obtaining graduate degrees is also growing at a rapid rate. Between 2000 and 2016, the percent of persons 25 to 29 years old with master's degree or higher has grown from 5.4 percent to 9.2 percent, a near 70 percent growth rate. b However, obtaining a graduate degree is becoming increasingly difficult for those without financial means not only because of high graduate school tuition costs, but because of rising undergraduate tuition costs and, which inevitably leads to, undergraduate student loan amounts. According to the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) report, undergraduate tuition and fees for full time students across all types of postsecondary institutions increased by 15 percentage points from $10,500 in academic year of 2010-11 to $12,100 in 2015-16. Among different types of institutions, the largest dollar amount was at private nonprofit institutions with $3,000 increase from $29,200 to $32,200. c The Collegeboard's report on higher education costs also reported similar trends in tuition cost between academic years 2012-13 and 2017-18. During these years, the average published tuition and fees for private nonprofit 4-year institutions has increased by $3,770 (from $30,970 to $34,740), while grant-in-aid and tax benefits per student a Torpey, Employment outlook for graduate-level occupations, (Washington, DC, 2018) b National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Digest of Education Statistics: 2016, (Washington, DC, 2018) c McFarland et al., The Conditions of Education 2018, (Washington, DC, 2018), [210][211][212][213][214] has only increased by $2,450 (from $17,760 to $20,210), leaving families with an increase of $1,320 in the net cost of college tuition. For public 4-year institutions during the same period, the published tuition and fees increased by $730, but grant-in-aid and tax benefits per student has only increased by $50, only covering 7% of the price increase. d In addition to a rise in tuition costs and decrease in grant-in-aid per student, the average undergraduate student loan amount has also increased over time. Between 2001 and 2017, the average cumulative student debt levels have grown from $21,600 to $26,900 for student borrowers at public four-year institutions and from $25,400 to $32,600 for those at private fouryear institutions e . One survey reported that 64% of the respondents' decisions and ability to continue with education were impacted by student loan debt. f With these worrying trends in the recent years, the issue of undergraduate student debt and its impact on post-baccalaureate decision making has begun to receive national attention. And because a graduate degree is often the most expected subsequent steps to be taken by a recent college grad, understanding the relationship between undergraduate student loan amounts and graduate degree attainment is essential to identifying the problems of rising student debt. d Collegeboard, Trends in College Pricing 2017, (New York, 2017, 18-20 e Collegeboard, Trends in College Aid 2017, (New York, 2017, 22 f National Association of Realtors, Student Loan Debt andHousing Report 2017, (2017) "}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Student Debt and Graduate School Decision", "text": "While a substantial number of studies in the literature have investigated the relationship between undergraduate student debt and decisions related to graduate school application and enrollment, many of them were written in the early 1990s or 2000 using the data collected in the decade prior to publication. In addition, there is no consensus on the effect of student debt on the transition to graduate school among these researchers. One of the main difficulties of identifying a clear relationship is that much of the data used in the studies are not collected from prospective graduate students or applicants, but from recently graduated college students. Because not all college graduates plan on applying for a graduate or professional school and the intent to apply for a graduate school is difficult to identify unless the focus of data collection was to identify this sample, some of these studies were bound to be limited in finding the appropriate relationship. g One group of researchers concluded that there is no significant effect of student debt on graduate school application. Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, and Rock (1991) studied the relationship between indebtedness and graduate school aspiration, application, enrollment and persistence by using the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 and the 1980 and 1982 cohorts of High School and Beyond Survey data. Regression analysis on all three cohort revealed no significant difference between educational debt and graduate school application or persistence, and the researchers even found a positive relationship between educational debt and graduate school aspiration for the earliest cohort of students. Interestingly, the researchers also found a positive association between college costs and educational aspirations for graduate school and interpreted g Catherine M. Millett, How Undergraduate Loan Debt Affects Application and Enrollment in Graduate or First Professional School, (2003), 392 the result as that students who plan to attend graduate schools tend to attend more expensive or selective undergraduate schools. h This finding provides an interesting insight that quality of education and prestige of undergraduate school could be a strong factor of intent to attend graduate schools. Weiler (1991) used the same data from 1980 cohorts of the High School and Beyond Survey and found similar results. He created two study samples, which were composed of a full sample and a restricted sample for those who revealed their intent to pursue a graduate degree or is already enrolled in a doctoral or professional degree and found that educational debt has no significant impact on one's decision to pursue a graduate degree in both full and restricted samples. i However, he also noted that HS&B data was developed to study the transition from high school to work or postsecondary education and, therefore, is limited on identifying the appropriate study sample to study post-baccalaureate decision making. Conversely, other studies have found negative impacts of student debt on graduate school application. Wilder and Baydar (1991) analyzed a sample of individuals who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) in 1986-87 and found that undergraduate debt was a deterrent when applying for graduate school, but not for being accepted or enrolling. Millet used the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Longitudinal Study of 1992-93 and identified recent college graduates by amount of debt and studied the effect of it. She found that students with debt between $5,000 and $14,999 were less likely to apply for a graduate or professional school than h Ruth Ekstrom et al., Undergraduate Debt and Participation in Graduate Education: The Relationship Between Educational Debt and Graduate School Aspirations, Applications, and Attendance Among Students with a Pattern of Full-Time, Continuous Postsecondary Education, (1991)  those without any debt. In addition, she also found that students with a family income of less than $74,999 were all at least two times less likely to enroll in a graduate school than those who had a family income of more than $100,000. j With the contrasting findings from the prior decades, readers may find the true effect of student debt on decision making to be inconclusive. However, one must consider the recent surge in tuition costs and its enlarged impact on recent graduates' decision making. One study by PEW Research Center found that a larger proportion of students in all spectrum of family income levels have borrowed for undergraduate education. The percentage of college graduates from families of high to lower-middle income level who have burrowed have increased by a range of 25 to 28 percentage points in the two decades following 1992. Although the percent of college graduates from low income families who borrowed have not increased as much (10 percentage points), but they had the highest borrowing rate of 67 percent in 1992 and still has the highest borrowing rate among all the income groups with 77 percent. k In addition, median total student debt for college graduates have more than doubled during the same decades from $12,434 in 1992 to $26,885 in 2011. l Therefore, it seems possible that this significant increase in student debt amount in the last two decades will lead to observable changes in postbaccalaureate decision making that were not found in the previous generations."}, {"section_title": "Debt and Decision Making", "text": "There have also been studies on the impact of personal debt on important life decisions made by young adults that can provide insights for the present study. A survey on student debt reported that 32% of the respondents have remained in a job despite being unhappy to pay off the loans and 28% had not made changes to their careers due to student loan debt. m In fact, about 64% of the respondents from the same survey responded by saying that student loan debt impacted their decisions on continuing with education. Although these findings do not qualify as peer-reviewed studies on student debt, they reflect the perspectives of the indebted college graduates and help us hypothesize on the effect of student debt on decision making. Another study looked at the treatment effect of graduating with less debt and the uptake rate of public interest jobs two years after graduation. The results of this study showed that the lottery winners, who were not indebted at the time of graduation were more likely to be working at a public interest positions than the control group students, and the researcher contributed the difference in behavior to the psychological impact of being indebted. n In addition to employment decisions, two studies explored the relationship between young adults' debts, including student debt, and their marriage decisions. The first study used NLSY 1997 cohort data to study the impact of individuals' debts on deciding between cohabitation and marriage from singlehood. The research found that, in general, existence of any debt is positively associated with transitioning into cohabitation, but negatively associated with transitioning into marriage. o A second study that used the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study data also found similar findings that student debt is associated with a delay in first marriage. p The results of the two studies support the idea that young adults delay their decisions when they are indebted. Interestingly, both studies tested their models by gender and found statistically significant relationship between student debt and marriage patterns for females but not for males in the data, suggesting a gender difference in perspective on debt."}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "As a graduate degree is often the best way to increase future earnings or open up new career and academic pathway, an increasing number of college graduates are applying for and attaining graduate degrees. Despite all the gains of a graduate degree, the decision is not an easy one to make because the tuition, fees, and the opportunity costs of going back to school are very high. As such, it is inevitable that prospective graduate school applicants would consider several factors before applying even if they have recognized the need for a degree. For example, one would have to consider whether he or she has the financial capability to pay through the years of studying and weigh between the costs and the return of investment from a degree. During this process, he/she may shy away from taking additional loans for a graduate degree, or the degree altogether as a result, because he/she has already reached the limit on their willingness to pay for education with his/her undergraduate student loans. At the least, they may decide that they want to delay this plan to pay back a substantial amount of their existing student debt before taking on new debt, which will add to the opportunity cost of studying since their salary will rise with added years of work experience. In fact, one may be discouraged to apply for a graduate degree even before finishing his undergraduate degree. As some studies have suggested, students may feel pressured by the existing debt that they decide on a degree or career path that does not require a graduate degree. Although such a career path in itself may not be a problem, the fact that their choices were limited by this debt reflects the reality of less opportunities for those with large student debts, who are often from minority and low-income backgrounds. In addition, even if they later decide that they want to pursue a graduate degree, they may be discouraged to apply because their work experiences do not bridge between the undergraduate degree and the graduate degree of interest, and thereby have weak application standings. These presumptions lead to the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Undergraduate student debt will be negatively associated with the likelihood of graduate degree attainment, and this deterring effect will be greater for larger amounts of debt. Hypothesis 2: Undergraduate student debt will be positively associated with the duration of graduate degree attainment, and this delaying effect will be greater for larger amounts of debt."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Description of Data Source", "text": "The National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) is a biennial survey that collects and publishes data on college graduates with a focus on those in the science workforce. The main purpose of the survey is to examine the relationship between college degree field and occupation of college graduates, in which work-related activities, salary, and demographic information is Although the initial survey was collected in 1993, many changes have been made to the survey over time. One of the most notable one is four-panel rotating panel design that started with the 2010 NSCG survey. In this panel design, each survey collects a baseline sample survey and follows the sample in the following 3 biennial surveys. For instance, the 2017 NSCG survey includes a new baseline sample from the 2015 ACS, returning sample from the 2015 NSCG who were selected from the 2013 ACS, returning sample from the 2013 NSCG who were selected from the 2011 ACS, and returning sample from 2010 NSCG who were selected from the 2009 ACS. Therefore, linking the previous NSCG data with the subsequent survey data makes it theoretically possible to create a longitudinal analysis sample that spans up to 8 years. However, for the current research, I decided to use the 2017 NSCG only for the reasons provided below."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Sample Selection", "text": "The publicly available NSCG survey data prior to 2013 collection year as well as the 2017 data do not provide linkable respondent-level ID that will allow linkage between data sets. Although I was able to link 2013 and 2015 NSCG data because they were the only years with linkable ID, two data periods did not provide enough variation in graduate degree attainment. Despite relative disadvantages of using a cross-sectional dataset compared to a longitudinal dataset, 2017 NSCG has the advantage of providing more recent data as well as providing larger sample size and more variation in graduate degree attainment. Although the survey collected data from all college graduates who are younger than 76, I limited my sample to those who are younger than 36 at the time of data collection, as my research focus is on the recent college graduates who have graduated from undergraduate institutions in the US. The initial sample size of the data was 83,672 respondents and limiting the sample to the age group of interest with bachelor's degree from a US institute yielded a final analysis data size of 23,947. Table 2 in the Result section provides a detailed breakdown of the analytic sample."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To find the relationship between the likelihood of graduate degree attainment and amount of undergraduate student loans, I estimated a linear probability regression model (LPM) and a logit regression using the key dependent and independent variables. The purpose of LPM is to estimate the impact size of an undergraduate loan amount with those who did not borrow any undergraduate loans as the reference group, while the logit model will be ran to confirm the accuracy of the LPM. I also tested for the same relationship separately for each type of graduate degrees in the subsequent analyses because different degrees require different pathways and motivations. Following is the proposed model of the first regression model:  From these regressions, I expect to see a negative relationship between undergraduate loan amount and the likelihood of graduate degree attainment since larger amounts of student loan may put pressures on recent graduates to stay employed full-time or find a career path that does not require a graduate degree in order to meet the payments for the loans. The second analysis tests whether the amount of an undergraduate loan affects the timing of graduate degree attainment. Following is the second regression model: q Among those who reported that their spouses are working at least part-time, some of them reported as leaving in a \"marriage-like relationship\", which was not included in my count of being married. This resulted in higher number of respondents with working spouse than the count of those who are married. type with the largest number of attainments is a master's degree with about 9,500 respondents. In terms of key independent variables, about one third of the sample had zero amount of undergraduate student loan, another third had between $1 and $30,000, and only 4 percent had borrowed more than $90,001. s However, the group with more than $90,001 of student loan debt are different from all the other categories of debt holders as this group has no upper limit on loan amounts and, therefore, may be compose of those with substantially high loan amounts. It is also notable that nearly 60 percent of those with student loans had outstanding student debt in 2017 and that even 34 percent of the oldest age group had outstanding undergraduate loans t . r Educational Attainment in the United States: 2015 reported that the advanced degree attainment rate from those aged between 25 and 34 was 10.9 percent. https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf s See Table A1 in the Appendix for the detailed breakdown by undergraduate loan amount categories t See Figure A1 in the Appendix for the distribution of those with outstanding student loan by initial loan amounts and age groups.   tested Model 3 with a logistic regression model and it produced the same qualitative results, with the average marginal effects producing nearly identical results to the coefficients in Model 3. w The findings in Table 4 supports my hypothesis that the Millennials, with any amount of undergraduate student debt is associated with less chance of attaining a graduate degree than those with no student loans. The coefficients for the key independent variables remained negative and statistically significant at the alpha level of 0.001 even after all covariates were added in Model 3. The coefficient in Model 3 suggests that those with undergraduate loan amount of between $60,000 and $90,000 are associated with the lowest likelihood of attaining a graduate degree than those with zero loans by -14 percentage points, whereas those with loans between $1 and $30,000 has the highest probability among all loan amount categories with -7 percentage points. One notable relationship is that those with more than $90,000 of student loans had a likelihood that is comparable to those with loans between $1 and $30,000. This clearly w See Table A2 in the Appendix for the complete logit regression results and the average marginal effects of Model 3. contradicts the trend of decreasing likelihood with increasing loan amounts that were shown with the first three groups of debt amounts. The results from Models 4 through 6 tells a similar story to that of Model 3, but also suggests an insight to the relatively higher likelihood of degree attainment of those who borrowed more than $90,000 from Model 3. While Models 5 tells a consistent story of a decreasing likelihood of the respective degree attainment with increasing loan amounts, the coefficient for the more-than-$90,000 group in Model 6 shows no statistical difference in the likelihood when compared to the zero-loan group. This is the only key independent variable from Table 4 that suggests no statistical difference when compared to the zero-loan group, suggesting that a systemic difference may exist between those who attained professional degrees with very large amounts of undergraduate student loan and others debt holders and that this difference is pulling up the coefficient of more-than-$90,000 group in Model 3 as well. In addition to the independent variables, several demographic characteristics were found to be statistically significant in Models 3 through 6. Females were associated with nearly 10 percentage point higher likelihood of attaining a graduate degree than males in Models 3 and 4, and at relatively lower magnitude of 2 and 3 percentage points for Models 5 and 6. By racial groups, Asians were associated with approximately 4 percentage point decrease in the probability of attaining a master's and doctorate degrees, but a 5 percentage point increase when attaining a Professional degree compared to their white counterparts, suggesting a preference of professional degree among Asians. Black college graduates, on the other hand, showed statistically significant decrease in the same probability than whites for all degree types and master's degree, but statistically insignificant results for doctorate and professional degrees. The variables for being married, having a temporary US visa, majoring in a science or engineering field as an undergraduate, graduating from a private undergraduate institution, and having a father or mother with master's degree or higher x were all associated with an increase in the chance of attaining a graduate degree when compared to their counterparts. On the other hand, the number of children, having a disability, having a spouse who works at least part time, and receiving grant-like financial support from a family member were all associated with a decrease in the likelihood of attaining a graduate degree. x The baseline groups of father's and mother's education levels were those with education level of high school or less "}, {"section_title": "Secondary Research Question", "text": "The regression results for my second research question, which looks at the relationship between undergraduate loan amount and duration of graduate degree attainment, are presented in Table 5. Model 1 is a multivariate regression with all the covariates used in the first research question except for the variable on years since bachelor's degree attainment. Models 2 through 4 are replications of Model 1, but use durations to a master's, doctorate, and professional degree attainments, respectively, as the dependent variables. The results from Model 1 only partially confirms my second hypothesis. I hypothesized that having undergraduate loans will increase the duration of graduate degree attainment with larger effects for those with higher amounts of student loan. However, the coefficients of the key variables in Model 1 suggests a relationship of an increase in the duration only between those without any loans and those with loan amounts between $1 and $30,000. In fact, this relationship is shared only with the master's degree regression (Model 2), and not with the rest of the regressions on the durations for doctorate and professional degree attainment. In terms of racial group variables, all non-white race groups were associated with longer duration in Model 1, with the longest delay found among \"other\" race group, which includes those who identified as Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and multi-race, followed by black college graduates. However, these results were not shared when the analysis was limited to those who attained doctorate or professional degrees. Other notable coefficient results include having a temporary US visa and number of children in the household, which were all associated with decrease in duration."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "With the increase in the importance of postsecondary and graduate degree education in the United States (US) job market, the rising cost of college tuitions and student loan amounts have caught the attentions of the public and policy makers alike. Especially, the Millennials are facing an uphill battle between rising student debt and post-baccalaureate career and academic pathways unlike the ones prior generations had to face. Therefore, it seems worthwhile and timely to identify the impact of student loans on post-baccalaureate decisions. The results from my first research question are consistent with some of the past studies on this topic (Wilder & Baydar 1991, Millet 2002 and support my hypothesis that the chance of graduate degree attainment decreases with increasing amount of undergraduate student loans. The results from the linear probability model indicated that having undergraduate loan amounts between $1 and $30,000 is associated with a decrease in the chance of graduate degree attainment by 7 percentage points (1.7 times lower odds) when compared to those without any loans, while having $60,000 -$90,000 is associated with the highest decrease in the chance with 14 percentage points (1.5 times lower odds). This finding is similar to Millet's findings from the 1992 Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Longitudinal Study data, in which he found 1.6 times lower odds of applying to graduate school for those with the student loans of $5,000 to $9,999 (approximately $8,700 to $17,500 in 2017 dollars) and 1.4 times lower odds for the amount between $10,000 and $14,999 ($17,500 to $26,000 in 2017 dollars). Because the current study uses data collected in 2017 and the loan amounts exceeds the amounts Millet tested for, the current study provides added insights for the recent college graduates and for larger loan amounts. The results also show that the effect of loan amounts vary by graduate degree type. With smaller coefficients and even a statistically insignificant coefficient for loan amount exceeding $90,000, the professional degree attainment model (Table 4, Model 6) stands out among other degree type models. This is unsurprising because different graduate degrees have different expected return of investment and career pathways. For instance, a professional degree has a substantially higher average return of investment compared to that of a doctorate degree, which can attract those with a high level of undergraduate loans. Therefore, it would be analytically misleading to aggregate outcomes of different degree types for related research attempts. In addition to revealing the negative relationship between loan amounts and graduate degree attainment, the results of this study also suggest a quadratic relationship with increasing loan amounts. This relationship is highlighted in the professional degree attainment analysis. In Table 3, the magnitudes of the coefficients of the key independent variables gets larger along with increasing loan amounts, but the coefficient becomes statistically insignificant when the loan amount reaches more than $90,000. Although there is no definitive explanation for this relationship, one possible interpretation is that the discouraging effect of loan amounts may dissipate at a certain threshold loan amount if delaying repayment to after graduate degree attainment is more economically feasible. z For the graduate degree timing analysis, only the coefficient for the lowest loan amount group ($1 -$30,000) suggests a degree-delaying effect of the student loan and, thereby, provides relatively weak support of my hypothesis. In fact, the coefficients for all levels of loan amount were found to be statistically insignificant for doctorate and professional degree models. From these results, we can infer that only those who plan for a master's degree delay their enrollments to pay off their undergraduate loans up to certain amount of the loan, while loan amounts do not affect the timing for other degree type pursuers. There is also a possibility that those who have plans for a graduate degree in their undergraduate years are characteristically more generous borrowers because either a graduate degree promises a larger return of investment or they want to focus on their academic experience and performance and forgo work-study options or other means of earning money. To validate these hypotheses and supplement my argument, data with information on early intent for graduate degree attainment would be needed. z Figure A.2 shows additional variables that may have a quadratic relationship with loan amounts. Although my analysis controls for many of the demographic and environment characteristics, my results are not free of omitted variable bias. One critical omitted variable of my models is parental income data. This is a major limitation as parental income is expected to directly affect the amount of undergraduate loans borrowed as well as the post-baccalaureate academic plan of a respondent. To get around this limitation, I used the parents' education levels as a proxy for family income as well as to control for the influence of the parents' education level. Despite using this proxy, I cannot confidently rule out the possibility that the omission of family income data is negatively biasing the coefficients of my models. Other possible omitted variables that are correlated with both dependent and independent variables are undergraduate GPA, institutional and regional differences, and salary before graduate degree enrollment. Absence of these data in my models are likely to be causing bias on the coefficients and obstruct finding a causal relationship between undergraduate loan amounts and graduate degree attainment. In addition to omitted variable bias concerns, there is the additional threat of bias in the sample selection. Because the survey does not collect information on intent of obtaining a graduate degree, it is not feasible to create a perfect comparison group composed of those that have plans for graduate degree but were delayed or deterred by their undergraduate loans. Although the direction of this bias is unclear as it would depend on the relationship between loan borrowing patterns and plans for graduate degree attainment, my hypothesis is that those who have no plan for a graduate degree would borrow more freely that those who do since they will incur no additional student loan after a bachelor's degree. And if my hypothesis were true, it would mean that this study's results are overestimates of the true relationship. This relationship would be a worthwhile relationship to investigate and would supplement the current research. The last major limitation of this study is that the survey data used is cross-sectional. Although the survey is collected biennially, the public use version of the data did not have a linkable ID between collection periods and limited the usage of the survey data to cross-sectional analysis. If longitudinal data were available for the analysis, I would have been able to use more variables from the data, such as time variant salary and job satisfaction information as well as use fixed-effects to control for regional or institutional differences. The major policy implication of this study's findings is that there is a need for tuition assistance in forms for more grants or public university tuition control. If millennials are forgoing graduate degree plans due to financial pressure from undergraduate loans, as suggested by my results, the future quality of America's workforce is bound to deteriorate since the chances of receiving more specialized job training and education will decrease from increasing undergraduate loans. Although my findings did not uncover a causal relationship between undergraduate loans and graduate degree attainment, the results nevertheless point to undergraduate loan amounts as a deterring factor of graduate degree attainment. Further research using exact amounts of loans instead of ordinal categories and with longitudinal data may further reveal this relationship and will provide additional evidences for a policy decision in this matter.
