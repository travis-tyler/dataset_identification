While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than twenty AD risk loci 1-5 , the associated disease genes and mechanisms remain largely unclear. To better understand these genetic associations, ADrelated phenotypes can be leveraged. For example, few studies 6,7 have investigated the genetic basis of age at onset of AD (AAO).

At the epigenetic level, genes expressed in myeloid cells display abnormal patterns of chromatin modification in AD mouse models and human samples [18] [19] [20] . Further, AD-risk alleles are polarized for cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) effects in monocytes 21 . Here we show that AD heritability is enriched in functional annotations for cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage, suggesting that integrative analyses of AD loci with myeloid-specific expression and epigenetic datasets will uncover novel AD genes and mechanisms related to the function of these cell types.\nIn this study, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide survival analysis and subsequent endophenotype association analysis to uncover loci associated with AAO-defined survival (AAOS) in AD cases and nondemented elderly controls. We discovered an AAOS-and CSF A\u03b2 42 -associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1057233, in the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus. Cis-eQTL analyses revealed a highly significant association of the protective rs1057233 G allele with reduced SPI1 expression in human myeloid cells. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid and B-lymphoid cell development and function, which binds to the cis-regulatory elements of several AD-associated genes in these cells. Moreover, we show that AD heritability was enriched in PU.1 ChIP-seq binding sites in human myeloid cells across the genome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in the etiology of AD. To validate these bioinformatic analyses, we show that experimentally altered PU.1 levels correlated with phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells and the expression of multiple genes involved in diverse biological processes of myeloid cells. This evidence collectively shows that lower SPI1 expression may reduce AD risk by modulating myeloid cell gene expression and function."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Genome-wide survival analysis", "text": "For the genome-wide survival analysis, we used 14,406 AD case samples and 25,849 control samples from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) consortium (Table 1a) . Of these, 8, 253, 925 SNPs passed quality control and were included for metaanalysis across all cohorts (Supplementary Table 1) , which showed little evidence of genomic inflation (\u03bb = 1.026). Four loci showed genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) with AAOS: BIN1 (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ), MS4A (P = 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ), PICALM (P = 9.1 \u00d7 10 \u221212 ) and APOE (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10 \u221252 ) Supplementary Fig. 1 ). While SNPs within BIN1 6 , PICALM 6, 10 and APOE 6, [8] [9] [10] loci have previously been shown to be associated with AAO, to our knowledge this is the first time the MS4A locus has been reported to be associated with an AAO-related phenotype. The minor allele of rs7930318 near MS4A4A was associated with delayed AAO. Four other AD risk loci previously reported in the IGAP GWAS 1 showed associations that reached suggestive significance (P < 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ): CR1 (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), SPI1 (previously labeled as CELF1 in the 2013 IGAP GWAS paper 1 ; P = 8.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), SORL1 (P = 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) and FERMT2 (P = 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). The direction of effects was concordant with the previous IGAP GWAS logistic regression analysis for AD risk 1 at all suggestive loci: AD risk-increasing alleles were all associated with a hazard ratio above 1 and earlier AAO, whereas AD risk-decreasing alleles were all associated with a hazard ratio below 1 and later AAO (Table 1b and Supplementary  Table 2 ). We also identified 14 loci that reached suggestive significance in the survival analysis, three of which (rs116341973, rs1625716 and rs11074412) were nominally associated with AD risk (Bonferroni-corrected threshold: P = 0.05/22 = 2.27 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) in the IGAP GWAS (Table 1b and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers associations", "text": "To further validate the 22 loci with at least suggestive associations to AAOS, we examined their associations with CSF biomarkers, including total tau, phosphorylated tau 181 and A\u03b2 42 in a dataset of 3,646 Caucasians extended from our previous report 12 (Table 2) . Two SNPs showed associations that reached the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P < 2.27 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). Rs4803758, near APOE, showed the most significant associations with levels of CSF phosphorylated tau 181 (P = 3.75 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) and CSF A\u03b2 42 (P = 3.12 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), whereas rs1057233, in the SPI1 locus, was significantly associated with CSF A\u03b2 42 (P = 8.24 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). Of note, a SNP adjacent to VLDLR, rs7867518, showed the most significant association with CSF total tau (P = 5.83 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) but failed to pass the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. The protective and deleterious effects in the survival analysis of these three SNPs were concordant with directionalities of their CSF biomarker associations; for example, the protective rs1057233 G allele was associated with higher CSF A\u03b2 42 levels and the risk rs1057233 A allele was associated with lower CSF A\u03b2 42 levels."}, {"section_title": "Cis-eQTL associations and colocalization analysis", "text": "Multiple disease-associated GWAS SNPs have been identified as cis-eQTLs of disease genes in disease-relevant tissues and/or cell types 22 . We investigated cis-eQTL effects of the 22 AAOS-associated SNPs and their tagging SNPs (R 2 \u2265 0.8; Supplementary Table 3) in the BRAINEAC dataset (see URLs). We identified four significant associations (Bonferroni-corrected threshold: P = 0.05/292,000 probes = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ): rs1057233 was associated with MTCH2 expression in the cerebellum (P = 1.20 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ); rs7445192 was associated with SRA1 expression (averaged across brain regions, P = 7.0 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , or in the frontal cortex, P = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , for two different probes) and rs2093761 was associated with CR1 and CR1L expression in white matter (P = 1.30 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ; Supplementary Table 4) . Further analysis using the GTEx dataset 23 identified 50 unique, associated SNP-gene pairs across 44 tissues, including 11 SNP-gene pairs in various brain regions (Supplementary Table 5) .\nRecently, genetic and molecular evidence has implicated myeloid cells in the etiology of AD, including our finding that AD risk alleles are enriched for cis-eQTL effects in CD14 + monocytes but not in CD4 + T-lymphocytes 21 . To extend this finding and identify relevant cell types in AD, we used stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to estimate enrichment of AD heritability (as measured by summary statistics from IGAP GWAS 1 ) partitioned by 220 cell-typespecific functional annotations as described by Finucane et al. 24 . We found a significant enrichment of AD heritability in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage (for example, 14.49-fold enrichment, P = 3.49 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , in H3K4me1-tagged enhancers of CD14 + monocytes; and 12.33-fold enrichment, P = 1.41 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , in H3K4me1-tagged enhancers of CD19 + B cells). In contrast, schizophrenia heritability was not enriched in hematopoietic cells (1.24-fold enrichment, P = 0.53, as measured by summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS 25 ) but was significantly enriched in brain (18.61-fold enrichment, P = 1.38 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , in H3K4me3-tagged promoters of fetal brain; Supplementary Table 6 ). These results suggest that myeloid cells specifically modulate AD susceptibility.\nBased on these observations, we hypothesized that cis-eQTL effects of some AD-associated alleles may be specific to myeloid cells and thus not easily detectable in cis-eQTL datasets obtained from braina r t I C l e S homogenates where myeloid cells (microglia and other brain-resident macrophages) represent a minor fraction of the tissue. Therefore, we analyzed cis-eQTL effects of the AAOS-associated SNPs and their tagging SNPs in human cis-eQTL datasets composed of 738 monocyte and 593 macrophage samples from the Cardiogenics consortium 26 . We identified 14 genes with cis-eQTLs significantly associated with these SNPs (Table 3) . Notably, the protective rs1057233 G allele, located within the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of SPI1, was strongly associated with lower expression of SPI1 in both monocytes (P = 1.50 \u00d7 10 \u2212105 ) and macrophages (P = 6.41 \u00d7 10 \u221287 ; Figs. 1a,b and 2a). This allele was also associated with lower expression of MYBPC3 in both monocytes (P = 4.99 \u00d7 10 \u221251 ) and macrophages (P = 5.58 \u00d7 10 \u221223 ), higher expression of CELF1 in monocytes (P = 3.95 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) and lower expression of NUP160 in macrophages (P = 5.35 \u00d7 10 \u221222 ). Each of these genes lies within the SPI1 locus, suggesting complex regulation of gene expression in this region. Within the MS4A locus, which contains many gene family members, the minor allele (C) of rs7930318 was consistently associated with lower expression of MS4A4A in monocytes (P = 8.20 \u00d7 10 \u221228 ) and MS4A6A in both monocytes (P = 4.90 \u00d7 10 \u221223 ) and macrophages (P = 1.25 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ; Fig. 1b) .\nWe then sought evidence of replication in an independent dataset of primary CD14 + human monocytes from 432 individuals 27 . We replicated cis-eQTL associations with expression of SPI1, MYBPC3, MS4A4A, MS4A6A and SELL (Bonferroni-corrected threshold: P = 0.05/15,421 probes = 3.24 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). We found strong evidence for the association between rs1057233 and SPI1 expression (P = 6.39 \u00d7 10 \u2212102 ) as well as MYBPC3 expression (P = 5.95 \u00d7 10 \u221233 ; Supplementary Table 7) . Rs1530914 and rs7929589, both in high LD with rs7930318 (R 2 = 0.99 and 0.87, respectively), were associated with expression of MS4A4A (P = 3.60 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) and MS4A6A (P = 6.37 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ). Finally, rs2272918, tagging rs10919252, was significantly associated with expression of SELL (P = 8.43 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ). Notably, the minor alleles of all of these SNPs showed protective effects in both AD risk and survival analyses, as well as lower expression of the associated genes. Further, based on RNA-seq data SPI1, MS4A4A, MS4A6A and SELL are specifically expressed in microglia [28] [29] [30] (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). However, MYBPC3, which produces Mybpc3 (a myosin binding protein expressed at high levels in cardiac muscle cells), is either not expressed or expressed at low levels in human and mouse microglia, respectively. Amongst all genes probed, MYBPC3 (ILMN_1781184) 1 0 5 5 VOLUME 20 | NUMBER 8 | AUGUST 2017 nature neurOSCIenCe a r t I C l e S expression was the most highly and significantly correlated with SPI1 (ILMN_1696463) expression in both Cardiogenics datasets (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.54, qval = 0.00 in monocytes; Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.42, qval = 0.00 in macrophages), suggesting that low levels of MYBPC3 expression in human myeloid cells are possibly due to leaky transcription driven by the adjacent highly expressed SPI1 gene. We performed the coloc test 31 to determine whether AAOS-associated SNPs co-localize with myeloid cis-eQTLs at the SPI1, MS4A and SELL loci. These analyses (Supplementary Table 8 ) highlighted SPI1 at the SPI1 locus as the strongest and most consistent colocalization target and the only gene in which AD survival and gene expression association signals are likely (posterior probability \u2265 0.8) driven by the same causal genetic variant, in both monocytes and macrophages (PP.H4.abf values of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively). MYBPC3 in the SPI1 locus and MS4A6A in the MS4A locus each also showed evidence of colocalization in both myeloid cell types but did not reach the posterior probability cutoff in one cell type each (MYBPC3 failed to reach the cutoff in monocytes and MS4A6A failed to reach the cutoff in macrophages). MS4A4A and MS4A6E in the MS4A locus showed evidence of co-localization only in monocytes, while SELL did not show evidence of colocalization. In light of the strong cis-eQTL effects and colocalization results described above, we decided to focus subsequent analyses on SPI1 as the strongest candidate gene underlying the disease association in myeloid cells."}, {"section_title": "Conditional and SMR analysis of the SPI1 locus", "text": "The AAOS-association landscape shows that highly associated SNPs at the SPI1 locus span multiple genes (Fig. 1a) . In the previous IGAP GWAS 1 , rs10838725 showed the strongest association at this locus (P = 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and P = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 versus rs1057233: P = 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and P = 5.9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 in IGAP stage I and in IGAP stages I and II combined, respectively).

In our survival analysis, however, rs10838725 showed weak association (P = 0.12, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-1.05), whereas rs1057233, located in the 3\u2032 UTR of a neighboring gene, SPI1, showed the strongest association ( Table 1 Applying conditional logistic regression analysis of AD risk in the ADGC dataset, we found that rs1057233 remained significantly associated with AD after adjusting for rs10838725 (P = 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), whereas rs10838725 showed no evidence of association after adjusting for rs1057233 (P = 0.66). This suggests that rs1057233 is in stronger LD with the AD risk causal variant. The association landscape in the AD survival analysis strongly resembles that of SPI1 cis-eQTL analysis in myeloid cells (Fig. 1a) . We reasoned that the associations of rs1057233 with AD-related phenotypes may be explained by the regulation of SPI1 expression in myeloid cells and that conditional analysis of the cis-eQTL signal could help us further dissect this complex locus. Therefore, we conducted conditional cis-eQTL analyses in both Cardiogenics datasets as we did above using rs1057233 (the top SNP for AD survival) and rs10838725 (the top SNP for AD risk). In addition, we also examined rs10838698 (an SNP in high LD with rs1057233 that was directly genotyped in the Cardiogenics dataset) and rs1377416, a SNP in high LD with rs10838725, which is proposed as a functional variant in an enhancer near SPI1 that is active in human myeloid cells and in the brain of a mouse model of AD 19 . It should be noted that rs1057233 is a functional variant that has been shown to directly affect SPI1 expression by changing the target sequence and binding of the micro-RNA miR-569 32 . Rs1057233 and rs10838698 remained significantly associated with SPI1 expression when adjusting for either of the other two SNPs in both monocytes and macrophages (P < 8.33 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). However, conditioning for either of these two SNPs abolished the associations of rs1377416 and rs10838725 with SPI1 expression (Supplementary Table 9 ). Thus, the functional variant(s) mediating the effect on SPI1 expression and AD risk likely reside(s) in the LD block that includes rs1057233 and rs10838698 but not rs10838725 and rs1377416 (Supplementary Fig. 5 ).\nUsing HaploReg 33 to annotate the top AAOS-associated SNP (rs1057233) and its tagging SNPs (R 2 \u2265 0.8; Supplementary Table 3) , we identified multiple SNPs (for example, rs10838699 and rs7928163) in high LD with rs1057233 that changed the predicted DNA-binding motif of SPI1 (PU.1), raising the possibility of altered self-regulation associated with the minor allele. Based on these results, one or more of these or other SNPs in very high LD with rs1057233 could explain the observed associations with SPI1 expression and AD-related phenotypes. "}, {"section_title": "r t I C l e S", "text": "We also conducted summary-databased Mendelian randomization (SMR) and heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) tests 22 to prioritize likely causal genes and variants by integrating summary statistics from our AAOS GWAS and the Cardiogenics study (Supplementary Table 10 ). SMR-HEIDI analysis was performed for the SPI1 locus, using rs1057233, rs10838698, rs10838699, rs7928163, rs10838725 and rs1377416 as candidate causal variants. In both monocytes and macrophages, SPI1 was consistently identified as the most likely gene whose expression levels were associated with AD survival because of causality or pleiotropy at the same underlying causal variant (rs1057233, rs10838698, rs10838699 or rs7928163 in the same LD block; SMR, P < 4.90 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , Bonferroni-corrected threshold for n = 6 SNPs tested against 17 probes and HEIDI, P \u2265 0.05; Supplementary  Fig. 6 ). Neither conditional analysis nor SMR-HEIDI analyses could definitively identify a single functional variant among this set of four SNPs in high LD. Functional analyses will be necessary to determine which SNPs in this LD block directly affect SPI1 expression. Overall, rs1057233 and tagging SNPs are associated with AD risk and survival and with CSF A\u03b2 42 . The strong cis-eQTL effects and colocalization results point to SPI1 as the most likely candidate gene underlying the disease association at the SPI1 locus. SPI1 (PU.1) cistrome and functional analysis in myeloid cells SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor essential for the development and function of myeloid cells. We hypothesize that it may modulate AD risk by regulating the transcription of AD-associated genes expressed in microglia and/or in other myeloid cell types.\nFirst, we tested AD-associated genes for evidence of expression in human microglia 28 as well as presence of PU.1 binding peaks in cisregulatory elements of these genes using ChIP-seq datasets obtained from human monocytes and macrophages 34 . We specifically investigated 112 AD-associated genes, including the 104 genes located within IGAP GWAS loci 35 plus APOE, APP, TREM2 and TREML2, TYROBP, TRIP4, CD33, and PLD3. Of these genes, 75 had evidence of gene expression in human brain microglial cells, 60 of which also had evidence of association with PU.1 binding sites in human blood myeloid cells 34 (Supplementary Table 11 ). Further examination of PU.1 binding peaks and chromatin marks or states in human monocytes confirmed that PU.1 is bound to cis-regulatory elements of many AD-associated genes, including ABCA7, CD33, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PILRA, PILRB, TREM2, TREML2 and TYROBP (as well as SPI1 itself but, notably, not APOE; Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Together, these results suggest that PU.1 may regulate the expression of multiple AD-associated genes in myeloid cells.\nTo further support the hypothesis that PU.1 target genes expressed in myeloid cells may be associated with AD risk, we used stratified LD score regression 24 to estimate the enrichment of AD heritability (as measured by summary statistics from the IGAP GWAS 1 ) partitioned on the PU.1 cistrome, as profiled by ChIP-seq in human monocytes and macrophages 34 . We found a significant enrichment of AD heritability in both monocytes (47.58-fold enrichment, P = 6.94 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) and macrophages (53.88-fold enrichment, P = 1.65 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) but not of schizophrenia heritability (as measured by summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS 25 ; Supplementary a r t I C l e S Table 12 ). Thus, the contribution of the myeloid PU.1 target gene network to disease susceptibility is specific to AD. However, since PU.1 is a key myeloid transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of genes in myeloid cells, the enrichment of AD risk alleles in PU.1 binding sites could simply reflect an enrichment of AD GWAS associations for genes that are expressed in myeloid cells rather than specifically among PU.1 target genes. To attempt to address this issue, we performed stratified LD score regression of AD heritability partitioned by functional annotations obtained from SPI1 (marking the PU.1 cistrome) and POLR2AphosphoS5 (marking actively transcribed genes) ChIP-seq experiments, performed in duplicate, using a human myeloid cell line (HL60) by the ENCODE Consortium 36 . We observed a significant enrichment for SPI1 (PU.1; 34.58-fold enrichment, P = 1.31 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , in the first replicate;\n58.12-fold enrichment, P = 4.95 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , in the second replicate), much stronger than that for POLR2AphosphoS5 (15.78-fold enrichment, P = 1.71 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , in the first replicate; 16.34-fold enrichment, P = 1.25 \u00d7 10 \u22121 , in the second replicate), consistent with our hypothesis (Supplementary Table 12 ). PU.1 target genes are implicated in various biological processes of myeloid cells that may modulate AD risk. For example, a microglial gene network for pathogen phagocytosis has been previously implicated in the etiology of AD 18 . We modulated levels of PU.1 by Spi1 cDNA overexpression or shRNA knockdown in BV2 mouse microglial cells and used zymosan bioparticles labeled with pHrodo (a pH-sensitive dye that emits a fluorescent signal when internalized in acidic vesicles during phagocytosis) to measure pathogen engulfment. Analysis of zymosan uptake by flow cytometry revealed that phagocytic activity is augmented in BV2 cells overexpressing PU.1 (Fig. 3a) , while knockdown of PU.1 resulted in decreased phagocytic activity (Fig. 3a) . We confirmed overexpression and knockdown of PU.1 expression levels by western blotting and quantitative PCR (qPCR; Figs. 3b-d and 4a) . Phagocytic activity was not changed in untransfected cells when analyzed by flow cytometry ( Supplementary  Fig. 8d-g ). These data suggest that modulation of PU.1 expression levels significantly changes microglial phagocytic activity in response to fungal targets (mimicked by zymosan; P = 0.0295 for overexpression and P = 0.001 for knockdown of PU.1; Fig. 3) .\nTo further explore the functional impact of variation in SPI1 expression, we performed qPCR to test whether differential Spi1 expression in BV2 cells can modulate expression of genes thought to play important roles in AD pathogenesis and/or microglial cell function (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). We found that levels of some of these genes were affected in opposing directions by overexpression and knockdown of Spi1 shSCR vs. shA, P = 0.0014; shSCR vs. shB, P < 0.0001; shSCR vs. shD, P < 0.0001; n = 2). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Sidak's post hoc multiple comparisons test between selected groups. a r t I C l e S (Fig. 4a) , while other genes were affected only by overexpression (Fig. 4b) or knockdown (Fig. 4c) or were not affected at all ( Supplementary  Fig. 9 ). After knockdown of Spi1 in BV2 cells, expression of Cd33, Tyrobp, Ms4a4a and Ms4a6d (the mouse ortholog of MS4A6A) decreased and expression of Apoe and Clu (also called ApoJ) increased (Fig. 4a,c) . These data demonstrate that multiple microglial genes, some already implicated in AD, were selectively perturbed by altered expression of Spi1."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "By performing a large-scale genome-wide survival analysis, we discovered multiple loci associated with AAOS ( Table 1) . The four genomewide significantly associated loci, BIN1 (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ), MS4A (P = 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ), PICALM (P = 9.1 \u00d7 10 \u221212 ) and APOE (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10 \u221252 ), have been previously reported to be associated with AD risk 1 . Notably, to our knowledge this is the first study showing that the MS4A locus is associated with AAOS. The most significantly AAOS-associated SNP at this locus, rs7930318, shows a protective effect (HR = 0.93, CI = 0.90-0.95) in the survival analysis, consistent with the previous IGAP GWAS logistic regression analysis for AD risk (OR = 0.90, CI = 0.87-0.93).\nBy combining AAOS and CSF-biomarker GWAS results, we provide evidence of AD association at additional loci ( Table 2 ). In particular, rs7867518 at the VLDLR locus shows suggestive associations with both AAOS (P = 9.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) and CSF tau (P = 3.03 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). An adjacent SNP (rs2034764) in the neighboring gene, KCNV2, has been previously reported as having a suggestive association with AAO 7 . VLDLR is a receptor for lipoproteins containing proteins encoded by APOE 37 and by CLU 38 , another AD risk gene. Additionally, the VLDLR-5-repeat allele was found to be associated with dementia 37 . This genetic and biochemical evidence suggests VLDLR may be linked to AD.\nCis-eQTL analyses of AAOS-associated SNPs revealed limited associations when using data from brain tissue homogenates, yet identified multiple candidate genes when using data from myeloid cells, the top candidate causal cell types for AD based on the stratified LD score regression analysis of AD heritability presented here. This calls attention to the need for careful selection of relevant cell types in eQTL studies of disease associations. In particular, by conducting cis-eQTL analyses using monocyte and macrophage datasets, we discovered associations of AAOS-associated SNPs with the expression of SELL, SPI1, MYBPC3, NUP160, MS4A4A, MS4A6A and SUN2 (Table 3) . Furthermore, we replicated the cis-eQTL associations of rs1057233 with SPI1 and MYBPC3, rs7930318 with MS4A4A and MS4A6A, and rs2272918 with SELL in an independent monocyte dataset. We further showed that SPI1 myeloid cis-eQTLs and AAOS-associated SNPs are not likely to be colocalized by chance and thus may be in the causal path to AD (Fig. 1) . Notably, the minor allele of rs1057233 (G) is suggestively associated with lower AD risk (P = 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and P = 5.9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 in IGAP stage I and in IGAP stages I and II combined, respectively) 1 and later AAO (P = 8.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) and is significantly associated with higher CSF A\u03b2 42 (P = 8.24 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), which likely reflects decreased A\u03b2 aggregation and \u03b2-amyloid deposition in the brain. Furthermore, it is strongly associated with lower SPI1 expression in human monocytes (P = 1.50 \u00d7 10 \u2212105 ) and macrophages (P = 6.41 \u00d7 10 \u221287 ; Table 3 ).\nColocalization analyses using coloc 31 and SMR-HEIDI 22 support the hypothesis that the same causal SNP(s) influence SPI1 expression and AD risk. However, neither conditional nor SMR-HEIDI analyses were able to pinpoint an individual SNP; both approaches identified an LD block tagged by rs1057233, in which one or more SNPs may individually or in combination influence both SPI1 expression and AD risk. Rs1057233 changes the target sequence and binding of miR-569 32 , and its tagging SNPs alter binding motifs of transcription factors including PU.1 itself (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7d ). Rs1377416 is located in a predicted enhancer in the vicinity of SPI1 and altered enhancer activity when assayed in vitro using a reporter construct transfected in BV2 cells 19 . However, rs1057233 remained significantly associated with AD after conditioning for either rs1377416 (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) or the previously reported IGAP GWAS top SNP, rs10838725 (P = 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) in the ADGC dataset. Further, the cis-eQTL association between rs1057233 and SPI1 expression remained significant after conditioning for either of these SNPs, whereas conditioning for rs1057233 abolished its cis-eQTL associations with SPI1 (Supplementary Table 9) . Thus, rs1057233 and its tagging SNPs likely represent the underlying disease locus and may modulate AD risk through variation in SPI1 expression. Notably, rs1057233 was previously found to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus 32 , body mass index 39 and proinsulin levels 40 and may contribute to the connection between AD, immune cell dysfunction, obesity and diabetes.\nPU.1 binds to cis-regulatory elements of several AD-associated genes expressed in human myeloid cells, including ABCA7, CD33, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, TREM2 and TYROBP ( Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 7) . Further, PU.1 binds to active enhancers of Trem2 and Tyrobp in ChIPseq experiments using mouse BV2 cells 41 or bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages 42 . PU.1 is required for the development and function of myeloid and B-lymphoid cells 43, 44 . In particular, PU.1 expression is dynamically and tightly controlled during haematopoiesis to direct the specification of CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells toward the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage by progressively partitioning into CD14 + monocytes and macrophages, CD15 + neutrophils and CD19 + B cells 45 , the cell types highlighted by our stratified LD score regression analysis. Given its selective expression in microglia in the brain (Fig. 2b) , PU.1 may modify microglial cell function through transcriptional regulation of target genes that act as downstream modulators of AD susceptibility, as evidenced by the significant enrichment of AD heritability partitioned on the PU.1 cistrome in human myeloid cells (monocytes, P = 6.94 \u00d7 10 -3 ; macrophages, P = 1.65 \u00d7 10 -3 ; Supplementary Table 12) .\nIn support of this hypothesis, we also demonstrate that changes in PU.1 expression levels alter phagocytic activity in BV2 mouse microglial cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 8) . Knockdown of PU.1 expression reduced engulfment of zymosan, whereas overexpression of PU.1 increased engulfment of zymosan, a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist that mimics fungal pathogens. This is in line with previous data showing decreased uptake of A\u03b2 42 (also a TLR2 agonist) in primary microglial cells isolated from adult human brain tissue and transfected with siRNA targeting SPI1 46 . Notably, several ADassociated genes (for example, CD33, TYROBP, TREM2, TREML2, CR1, ABCA7, APOE and CLU) have been shown to be involved in the phagocytic clearance of pathogens or host-derived cellular material (for example, \u03b2-amyloid, apoptotic cells, myelin debris, lipoproteins, etc.), suggesting a strong link between perturbation of microglial phagocytosis and AD pathogenesis. In addition to Cd33, Tyrobp, Apoe and Clu, several genes with roles in phagocytosis are dysregulated by altering Spi1 expression, i.e., Cd36, Fcgr1, P2ry12, Itgam, Cx3cr1, Axl and Ctsb (Fig. 4a-c) , suggesting a collective and coordinated effect of Spi1 on the phagocytic activity of BV2 cells.\nOur genetic analyses show that the protective allele at the MS4A locus is associated with lower expression of MS4A4A and MS4A6A in human myeloid cells, and the BV2 experiment demonstrated that lower expression of Spi1 (which is protective in humans) led to lower expression of Ms4a4a and Ms4a6d (the mouse ortholog of MS4A6A), whicha r t I C l e S are also associated with reduced AD risk in humans. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of microglial cells suggested a microglial homeostatic signature that is perturbed during aging and under pathological conditions 47 . It will be valuable to test whether genetically altered SPI1 levels prime microglia to exacerbate or alleviate transcriptional responses that occur during aging or disease development. Together with genetic variation in myeloid genes associated with AD as an amplifier, SPI1 may be a master regulator capable of tipping the balance toward a neuroprotective or neurotoxic microglial phenotype.\nPU.1 expression levels regulate multiple myeloid and microglial cell functions 46 , including proliferation, survival and differentiation, that could also modulate AD risk. Indeed, expression of Il34 and Csf1, which encode soluble factors that bind to Csf1r and are required for microglial development and maintenance in vivo 48 , were elevated after knockdown of Spi1, while expression of Csf1r was reduced (Fig. 4a,c) . Notably, inhibition of Csf1r in a 3xTg-AD mouse model led to a reduction in the number of microglia associated with \u03b2-amyloid plaques and improved cognition 49 . These findings suggest the importance of analyzing cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration phenotypes with differential Spi1 expression, because Spi1 levels modulate expression of Ccl2 and Cxcl2 (Fig. 4a) , encoding MCP1 and MIP2\u03b1 proteins, which help recruit circulating monocytes and neutrophils to the brain to promote neuroinflammation. In addition, knocking down Spi1 reduced expression of a microgliosis marker Aif1 (Iba1) along with Il1b, Nos2, Ptgs2, Arg1 and Nlrp3 (Fig. 4a,c) , suggesting that decreased Spi1 expression may blunt the proinflammatory response of microglial cells to improve disease outcomes. Notably, expression of Cx3cr1 and Axl were elevated upon knockdown of Spi1 (Fig. 4c) , raising the possibility that beneficial effects of changes in Spi1 expression are exerted through modulation of synaptic or neuronal clearance. Further experimental investigation of these phenotypes may shed light on the mechanisms of SPI1 modulation of AD risk. Of note, overexpression and knockdown of Spi1 in BV2 cells produce different and often opposite changes in expression of the genes profiled here, possibly driving alternative phenotypes that may underlie detrimental and protective roles of PU.1.\nIn summary, by combining AD survival and endophenotype GWAS analyses, we replicated and discovered multiple genetic loci associated with AAOS. Specifically, we nominate SPI1 as the gene responsible for disease association at the previously reported CELF1 locus. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor expressed in microglia and other myeloid cells that directly regulates other AD-associated genes expressed in these cell types. Our data suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces risk for AD, suggesting a therapeutic approach to the treatment of AD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AAOS-associated SNPs within the MS4A gene cluster are associated with cis-eQTLs in myeloid cells for both MS4A4A and MS4A6A. Specifically, the allele associated with reduced AD risk is associated with lower MS4A4A and MS4A6A expression. This is consistent with the observation that lowering SPI1 expression, which is protective for AD risk, also lowers MS4A4A and MS4A6A expression. These results reinforce the emerging genetic and epigenetic association between AD and a network of microglial expressed genes 2,5,17-21 , highlighting the need to dissect their functional mechanisms.

The final meta-analysis dataset consists of samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer's Disease (GERAD), European Alzheimer's Disease Initiative (EADI), and Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE). The study cohorts consist of case-control and longitudinal cohorts. For all studies, written informed consent was obtained from study participants or, for those with substantial cognitive impairment, from a caregiver, legal guardian or other proxy, and the study protocols for all populations were reviewed and approved by the appropriate Institutional review boards. Details of ascertainment and diagnostic procedures for each dataset extend from details previously described [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and are documented below:\nAlzheimer's disease genetics consortium. The imputed ADGC sample that passed quality control procedures comprised 8,617 AD cases and 9,765 control subjects from GWAS datasets assembled by ADGC. Details of ascertainment and diagnostic procedures for each dataset were as previously described 2 . ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001000646, the KORA F4 study and the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study. All AD cases met criteria for either probable (NINCDS-ADRDA, DSM-IV) or definite (CERAD) AD. All elderly controls were screened for dementia using the MMSE or ADAS-cog and were determined to be free from dementia at neuropathological examination or had a Braak score of 2.5 or lower. Genotypes from all cases and 4,617 controls were previously included in the AD GWAS by Harold et al 3 . Genotypes for the remaining 2,660 population controls were obtained from WTCCC2. Imputation of the dataset was performed using IMPUTE2 and the 1,000 Genomes (http://www.1000genomes.org/) December 2010 reference panel (NCBI build 37.1). The imputed data was then analyzed using logistic regression, including covariates for country of origin, gender, age and three principal components obtained with EIGENSTRAT software based on individual genotypes for the GERAD study participants. european Alzheimer's disease Initiative (eAdI). All AD cases were ascertained by neurologists from Bordeaux, Dijon, Lille, Montpelier, Paris, and Rouen, France, with clinical diagnosis of probable AD established according to the DSM-III-R and National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria 50, 51 . Controls were recruited from Lille, Rouen, Nantes and from the 3C Study 50 . This cohort is a population-based prospective study of the relationship between vascular factors and dementia. It has been carried out in three French cities: Bordeaux (southwest France), Montpelier (southeast France) and Dijon (central eastern France). A sample of noninstitutionalized subjects over 65 years of age was randomly selected from the electoral rolls of each city. Between January 1999 and March 2001, 9,686 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria agreed to participate. Following recruitment, 392 subjects withdrew from the study. Thus, 9,294 subjects were finally included in the study (2, 104 in Bordeaux, 4,931 in Dijon and 2,259 in Montpellier). In eight years of follow up, 664 individuals suffered from AD, with 167 prevalent and 497 incident cases. The other individuals were considered as controls. Subjects contributed 9,863 DNA samples that passed DNA quality control, which were genotyped with Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChips. Following quality control procedures, a final sample of 5,803 3C individuals (387 AD cases and 5,416 controls, cohort dataset) and 2,298 non-3C individuals (1,420 AD cases and 878 controls, case-control dataset) was included in this study."}, {"section_title": "cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in genomic epidemiology (cHARge).", "text": "The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of risk factors for vascular and metabolic disease that in 1989-1990 enrolled adults aged \u226565 years at four field centers located in North Carolina, California, Maryland and Pennsylvania. The original, predominantly Caucasian, cohort of 5,201 persons was recruited from a random sample of people on Medicare eligibility lists, and an additional 687 African Americans were enrolled subsequently for a total sample size of 5,882. DNA was extracted from blood samples drawn on all persons who consented to genetic testing at their baseline examination in 1989 -1990 , genotyping was performed at the General Clinical Research Center's Phenotyping/Genotyping Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai using the Illumina 370CNV Duo BeadChip system on 3,980 CHS participants who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. The 1,908 persons excluded for prevalent CVD had prevalent coronary heart disease (n = 1,195), congestive heart failure (n = 86), peripheral vascular disease (n = 93), valvular heart disease (n = 20), stroke (n = 166) or transient ischemic attack (n = 56). Some persons had more than one reason to be excluded and for these individuals only the initial exclusionary event is listed. Because the other cohorts were predominantly white, the African American CHS participants were excluded from this analysis to limit errors secondary to population stratification. Among white participants, genotyping was attempted in 3,397 participants and was successful in 3,295 persons. After excluding persons who had died before the start of the CHS cognition study in 1992, persons who could not be evaluated completely for baseline cognitive status and persons who had dementia other than AD, a sample of 2,049 persons was available. The CHS study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards at the individual participating centers.\nThe AD sample for this study included all prevalent cases identified in 1992 and incident events identified between 1992 and December 2006. Briefly, persons were examined annually from enrollment to 1999. The examination included a 30-min screening cognitive battery. In 1992-1994 and again in 1997-1999, participants were invited to undergo brain MRI and detailed cognitive and neurological assessment as part of the CHS Cognition Study. Persons with prevalent dementia were identified, and all others were followed until 1999 for the development of incident dementia and AD. Since then, CHS participants at the Maryland and Pennsylvania centers have remained under ongoing dementia surveillance 52 .\nBeginning in 1988-1989, all participants completed the Modified MiniMental State Examination (3MSE) and the DSST at their annual visits, as well as the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), from 1994 to 1998. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) was used when participants did not come to the clinic. Further information on cognition was obtained from proxies using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and the dementia questionnaire (DQ). Symptoms of depression were measured with the modified version of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). In 1991-1994, 3,608 participants had an MRI of the brain, and this was repeated in 1997-1998. CHS staff also obtained information from participants and next-of-kin regarding vision and hearing, the circumstances of the illness, history of dementia, functional status, pharmaceutical drug use and alcohol consumption. Data on instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL) were also collected.\nPersons suspected to have cognitive impairment based on the screening tests listed above underwent a neuropsychological and a neurological evaluation. The neuropsychological battery included the following tests: the American version of the National Reading test (AMNART), Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), a modified Rey-Osterreith figure, the Boston Naming test, the verbal fluency test, the Block design test, the Trails A and B tests, the Baddeley & Papagno Divided Attention Task, the Stroop test, and the digit span and grooved pegboard tests. The results of the neuropsychological battery were classified as normal or abnormal (defined as > 1.5 s.d. below individuals of comparable age and education) based on normative data collected from a sample of 250 unimpaired subjects. The neurological exam included a brief mental status examination, as well as a complete examination of other systems.\nThe examiner also completed the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hachinski Ischemic Scale. After completing the neurological exam, the neurologist classified the participant as normal, having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or having dementia.\nInternational diagnostic guidelines, including the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable and possible AD and the ADDTC's State of California criteria for probable and possible vascular dementia (VaD) with or without AD were followed. CHS identified three subtypes: possible/probable AD without VaD (categorized as pure AD, included in all-AD); mixed AD (for cases that met criteria for both AD and VaD, included in all-AD); and possible/probable VaD without AD (excluded from the current study).\nThe Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a three-generation, single-site, community-based, ongoing cohort study initiated in 1948. It now comprises three generations of participants including the Original cohort followed since 1948 (n = 5,209) 53 , their Offspring and spouses of the offspring (n = 5,216) followed since 1971 54 ; and children from the largest Offspring families enrolled in 2000 (Gen 3) 55 . Participants in the Original and Offspring cohorts are used in these analyses, but Gen 3 participants were not included since they are young (mean age 40 \u00b1 9 years in 2000) and none had developed AD. The Original cohort enrolled 5,209 men and women who comprised two-thirds of the adult population then residing in Framingham, Massachusetts. Survivors continue to receive biennial examinations. The Offspring cohort comprises 5,124 persons (including 3,514 biological offspring) who have been examined approximately once every 4 years. Almost all the FHS Original and Offspring participants are white/Caucasian. FHS participants provided DNA samples and consent for genotyping in the 1990s. All available eligible participants were genotyped at Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) through an NHLBI-funded SNP-Health Association Resource (SHARe) project using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set and 50K Human Gene Focused Panel. In 272 persons, small amounts of DNA were extracted from stored whole blood and required whole-genome amplification before genotyping. Cell lines were available for most of the remaining participants. Genotyping was attempted in 5,293 Original and Offspring cohort participants, and of these, 4,425 persons met QC criteria. Failures (call rate <97%, extreme heterozygosity or high Mendelian error rate) were largely restricted to persons with whole-genome amplified DNA and DNA extracted from stored serum samples. In addition, since the persons with whole-genome amplified DNA represent a group of survivors who may differ from the others, we included whole-genome amplified status as a covariate in FHS analyses. After exclusion of prevalent dementia, dementia other than AD and missing values, a sample of 2,208 participants was available for this project. The FHS component of this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Boston Medical Center.\nThe Original cohort of the FHS has been evaluated biennially since 1948, was screened for prevalent dementia and AD in 1974-1976 and has been under surveillance for incident dementia and AD since then [56] [57] [58] . The Offspring have been examined once every 4 years and have been screened for prevalent dementia with a neuropsychological battery and brain MRI 59, 60 . To be consistent with the sampling frame for the AGES and CHS samples, we excluded FHS subjects with a baseline age < 65 yrs at the time of DNA draw, which was in the 1990s. To minimize survival biases, Original cohort and Offspring participants who developed dementia before the date of DNA draw were treated as prevalent cases, and subsequent events in the Original cohort occurring before December 2006 were included in the incident analyses.\nAt each clinic exam, participants receive questionnaires, physical examinations and laboratory testing; between examinations they remain under surveillance (regardless of whether or not they live in the vicinity) via physician referrals, record linkage and annual telephone health history updates. Methods used for dementia screening and follow-up have been previously described 56, 61 . Briefly, surviving cohort members who attended biennial examination cycles 14 and 15 (May 1975 to November 1979) were administered a standardized neuropsychological test battery to establish a dementia-free cohort. Beginning at examination cycle 17 (1982) , the MMSE was administered biennially to the cohort. A MMSE score below the education-specific cutoff score, a decline of 3 or more points on subsequent administrations, a decline of more than 5 points compared with any previous examination or a physician or family referral prompted further in-depth testing. The Offspring cohort that was enrolled in 1971 has undergone eight re-examinations, one approximately every 4 years. Starting at the second Offspring examination, participants were questioned regarding any subjective memory complaints, and since the fifth Offspring examination, participants have been administered the MMSE at each visit. In addition, concurrent with the seventh and eighth Offspring examinations (between 1999 59, 60 . The neuropsychological test battery included the Reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-3), the Logical Memory and the Paired Associates Learning tests from the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Visual Reproduction and Hooper Visual Organization Tests, Trails A and B, the Similarities subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence test, the 30-item version of the Boston Naming Test and, at the second assessment only, the digit span, controlled word association and clock drawing tests. Offspring participants suspected to have cognitive impairment based on their MMSE scores, participant, family or physician referral, hospital records or performance in the neuropsychological test battery described above were referred for more detailed neuropsychological and neurological evaluation.\nEach participant thus identified underwent baseline neurologic and neuropsychological examinations. Neurologists trained in geriatric behavioral assessment supplemented their clinical assessment with a few structured cognitive tests and administered the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Persons were reassessed systematically for the onset of at least mild dementia. A panel consisting of at least one neurologist (S. Auerbach, P.A. Wolf (Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine) or S.S.) and one neuropsychologist (R. Au, Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Boston University School of Medicine) reviewed all available medical records to arrive at a final determination regarding the presence or absence of dementia, the date of onset of dementia and the type of dementia. For this determination, we used data from the neurologist's examination, neuropsychological test performance, Framingham Study records, hospital records, information from primary care physicians, structured family interviews, computed tomography records and MRI records, as well as autopsy confirmation when available. All individuals identified as having dementia satisfied the DSM-IV criteria, had dementia severity equivalent to a CDR of 1 or greater and had had symptoms of dementia for at least 6 months. All individuals identified as having Alzheimer's-related dementia met the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for definite, probable or possible AD. Vascular dementia was diagnosed using the ADDTC criteria but the presence of vascular dementia did not disqualify a participant from obtaining a concomitant diagnosis of AD if indicated. The recruitment of Original cohort participants at FHS occurred long before DNA collection, with the result that either the majority of dementia events in the FHS (although ascertained prospectively) were prevalent at the time of DNA collection or persons with dementia died before DNA draw and were thus excluded from analyses of incident disease. Due to the limited number of incident dementia and AD events in the Framingham Offspring, only the Original cohort were included in our analyses of incident events.\nThe Rotterdam Study enrolled inhabitants from a district of Rotterdam, the Netherlands (Ommoord), aged \u2265 55 years (N = 7,983, virtually all white) at the baseline examination in 1990-1993 when blood was drawn for genotyping 62 . It aims to examine the determinants of disease and health in the elderly with a focus on neurogeriatric, cardiovascular, bone and eye disease. All inhabitants of Ommoord aged \u226555 years (n = 10,275) were invited, and the participation rate was 78%. All participants gave written informed consent to retrieve information from treating physicians. Baseline measurements were obtained from 1990 to 1993 and consisted of an interview at home and two visits to the research center for physical examination. Survivors have been re-examined three times: in 1993-1995, 1997-1999 and 2002-2004 . All persons attending the baseline examination in 1990-1993 consented to genotyping and had DNA extracted. This DNA was genotyped using the Illumina Infinium II HumanHap550chip v3.0 array in 2007-2008 according to the manufacturer's protocols. Genotyping was attempted in persons with high-quality extracted DNA (n = 6,449). From these 6,449, samples with low call rate (<97.5%, n = 209), with excess autosomal heterozygosity (heterozygosity > 0.336, n = 21), with sex mismatch (n = 36) or with outliers identified by the IBS clustering analysis (>3 s.d. from population mean, n = 102; or IBS probabilities >97%, n = 129) were excluded from the study population, with some persons meeting more than one exclusion criterion. After exclusions, 5,974 samples were available with good quality genotyping data; 42 persons were excluded since they did not undergo cognitive screening at baseline and hence their cognitive statuses were uncertain. An additional 61 persons were excluded because they suffered from dementia other than AD at baseline. After exclusion of prevalent dementia, a sample of 5,752 persons was available. The Rotterdam study (including its brain MRI and neurological components) was approved by the institutional review board (Medical Ethics Committee) of the Erasmus Medical Center and the Netherlands Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports Participants were screened for prevalent dementia in 1990-1993 using a three-stage process; those free of dementia remained under surveillance for incident dementia, a determination made using records linkage and assessment at three subsequent re-examinations. We included all prevalent cases and all incident events up to 31 December 2007.\nScreening was done with the MMSE and geriatric mental schedule (GMS) organic level for all persons. Screen-positives (MMSE < 26 or GMS organic level > 0) underwent the CAMDEX. Persons who were suspected of having dementia underwent more extensive neuropsychological testing. When available, imaging data were used. In addition, all participants have been continuously monitored for major events (including dementia) through automated linkage of the study database with digitized medical records from general practitioners, the Regional Institute for Outpatient Mental Health Care and the municipality. In addition, physician files from nursing homes and general practitioner records of participants who moved out of the Ommoord district were reviewed twice a year. For suspected dementia events, additional information (including neuroimaging) was obtained from hospital records and research physicians discussed available information with a neurologist experienced in dementia diagnosis and research to verify all diagnoses. Dementia was diagnosed in accordance with internationally accepted criteria for dementia (DSM-III-R) and AD using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for possible, probable and definite AD. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria were used to diagnose vascular dementia. The final diagnosis was determined by a panel composed of a neurologist, a neurophysiologist and a research physician, and the diagnoses of AD and VaD were not mutually exclusive.\nPower calculation. To determine the power to detect genetic variants associated with age at onset, we ran analyses using Proc Power in SAS. The analysis was run using minor allele frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 0. Cases were diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) according to the NINCDS-ADRDA 20 . Control individuals were evaluated using the same criteria and showed no symptoms of cognitive impairment. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants and prior Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at each participating institution. We obtained 787 additional samples with biomarker data used in the analyses from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a publicprivate partnership, led by M.W. Weiner. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD.\nCSF in all studies was collected in a standardized manner 12, [63] [64] [65] [66] . Biomarker measurements within each study were conducted using internal standards and controls to achieve consistency and reliability. However, differences in the measured values between studies were observed, which are likely due to differences in the antibodies and technologies used for quantification (standard ELISA with Innotest for Knight-ADRC, UW, Swedish, German and Mayo, versus Luminex with AlzBio3 for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, BIOCARD and Penn), ascertainment and/or handling of the CSF after collection. CSF A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 values were log-transformed in order to approximate a normal distribution. Because the CSF biomarker values were measured using two different platforms (standard ELISA with Innotest and Luminex with AlzBio3), we did not combine the raw data. For the combined analyses, we standardized the mean of the log-transformed values from each dataset to zero. No differences in the transformed and standardized CSF values were found between cohorts. We also performed meta-analyses for the most significant SNPs by combining the P values for each independent dataset using METAL 67 . No major differences were found between the joint analyses and the meta-analyses.\nQuality control. For survival analysis, we excluded cases with AAO < 60 and cases with prevalent stroke. For CSF analysis, individuals under age 45 years were removed because prior studies have demonstrated that the relationship between CSF A\u03b2 42 levels and age appears to differ in individuals below 45 years versus those above 45 years 68 . Of the remaining individuals in both analyses, we excluded individuals who had > 5% missing genotype rates, who showed a discrepancy between reported sex and sex estimated on the basis of genetic data or who showed evidence of non-European ancestry based on principal component analysis using PLINK1.9 69 . We identified unanticipated duplicates and cryptic relatedness using pair-wise genome-wide estimates of proportion identity by descent (IBD) using PLINK. When a pair of duplicate samples or a pair of samples with cryptic relatedness was identified, the sample with the lower genotyping call rate was removed. We excluded potentially related individuals so that all remaining individuals had kinship coefficients < 0.05. Finally, we excluded individuals with missing disease status, age or gender information.\nTo control for genotype quality, we excluded SNPs with missing genotypes in > 5% of individuals in each dataset for survival analysis and > 2% for CSF association analysis. For the EADI cohort, variants with minor allele frequency < 1%, Hardy-Weinberg P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and missingness > 2% were removed before imputation. Genome-wide genotype imputation was performed using IMPUTE2 70 with 1,000 Genomes reference haplotypes. We excluded imputed SNPs with an IMPUTE2 quality score < 0.5 for survival analysis. For CSF association, we excluded SNPs with an IMPUTE2 quality score of < 0.3 since the dataset was only used for follow-up. In the ADGC, GERAD, CHARGE and CSF datasets, we then removed SNPs that failed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls calculated based on the imputed best-guess genotypes using a P value threshold of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . We excluded SNPs with minor allele frequency \u2264 0.02. Finally, we excluded SNPs with available statistics in only one consortium dataset in the meta-analysis. The number of filtered samples and SNPs in each of the above steps are recorded in Supplementary Table 1. genome-wide survival association study. We conducted a genome-wide Cox proportional hazards regression 71 assuming an additive effect from SNP dosage. The Cox proportional hazard regression was implemented in the R survival analysis package. We incorporated sex, site and the first three principal components from EIGENSTRAT 29 in all our regression models to control for their effects. For EADI, sex and four principal components were included in the model. For the Cox model, the time scale is defined as age in years, where 'age' is age at onset for cases and age at last assessment for controls. The formula applied is as followed:\nwhere X = (X 1 , X 2 , \u2026, Xp) are the observed values of covariates for subject i. The Cox model has previously been shown to be applicable to case-control datasets without an elevated type-1 error rate nor overestimation in effect sizes 72, 73 . The model assumes log-linearity and proportional hazards. The assumption of loglinearity is common in the additive logistic regression used in a typical GWAS. We validated the assumption of proportional hazards assumed by the Cox model by conducting the Schoenfeld test in the 22 prioritized SNPs. None of the SNPs has a Schoenfeld P value, which is the P value for Pearson product-moment correlation between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals and time, of less than 0.035 (multiple test correction threshold = 0.00227) in any of the seven cohorts. Further, only three of the 148 P values were less than 0.05, suggesting that the time-proportionality assumption is unlikely to be violated in these associations (Supplementary Table 1) . Similarly, the Schoenfeld test was conducted for all 22 SNP association models on the covariates in the ADGC and GERAD cohort (Supplementary Table 1 ). We also examined the effect sizes of our candidate SNPs in these cohorts and found consistent effect sizes (Supplementary Fig. 3 ) in the three retrospective case-control cohorts (ADGC, GERAD and EADI case-control) and four prospective cohorts (EADI-prospective, CHARGE FHS, CHS and Rotterdam). After the analysis of each dataset, we carried out an inverse-variance metaanalysis on the results using METAL 25 , applying a genomic control to adjust for inflation in each dataset. Of the 751 suggestive SNPs (P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), we found that these SNPs showed lower standard errors and confidence intervals as the number of cohorts increased, showing consistent directionalities of effect. Particularly, the average standard error for SNPs showing 1-7 consistent directionalities ranges from 0.171, 0.109, 0.0744, 0.0346, 0.0234 and 0.0173 to 0.01795 (Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Thus, we limited our final analysis to SNPs that showed consistent directionalities of effect in at least six of the seven datasets included in the meta-analysis. The association graphs of results from loci of interest were plotted using LocusZoom 74 .\ncSF biomarker association analysis. For the CSF datasets, we performed multivariate linear regression for CSF A\u03b2 42 tau and ptau 181 association, adjusting for age, gender, site and the first three principal components, using PLINK. eQTL analysis. We examined the effect of top survival and CSF SNPs on gene expression using published databases. For general brain expression eQTL analysis, we queried the BRAINEAC eQTL data provided by the UK human Brain Expression Consortium (see URLs).\nWe conducted leukocyte-specific analysis using the Cardiogenics dataset 26 , which is composed of 738 monocytes and 593 macrophages samples. where i is the subject index, x is the effective allele copy number, and y i is the covariates-adjusted, inverse-normal transformed gene expression. Significance of cis (SNP within \u00b11 Mb of the closest transcript end) eQTL effects were quantified with a Wald test on the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator of the coefficient \u03b2, obtained with R. The distribution of the Wald test P values under the null hypothesis of no correlation between genotype and gene expression was estimated by rerunning the same analysis on a null dataset, obtained by permuting the expression samples identifiers. For additional monocyte eQTL analysis, we queried statistics from Fairfax et al. 27 to validate findings in the Cardiogenics dataset. For conditional analysis, we performed analysis for SPI1 (probe: ILMN_ 1696463) against all SNPs within \u00b12 Mb from the closest transcript end by including the effective allele copy numbers of the following SNPs as covariates in the linear regression model, one at a time: rs1057233, rs10838698, rs7928163, rs10838699, rs10838725 and rs1377416. Significance was again assessed with a two-sided Wald test on the OLS estimator of the coefficient \u03b2.\ngene-expression analysis in human and mouse brain cell types. Cell-typespecific gene expression in the human and mouse brain was queried from brain RNA-seq databases described in Zhang et al. 28, 29 and Bennett et al. 30 and plotted using custom R scripts (see URLs). The mouse FAC-sorted astrocytes and immunopanned astrocytes were collapsed into a single astrocyte cell type. epigenetic analysis in human myeloid cell types. We used HaploReg 33 to annotate the regulatory element of the significantly associated SNPs and their tagging SNPs. The myeloid chromatin marks/states and PU.1 ChIP-seq data at genetic loci were further examined through the Washington University Epigenome browser 75 using the public Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium public tracks hub as well as custom track hubs for human monocytes and macrophages (hg19; see URLs).\ncolocalization (coloc and SmR/HeIdI) analyses. Colocalization analysis of genetic variants associated with AD and myeloid gene expression was performed using AAOS GWAS SNP and myeloid (monocyte and macrophage) eQTL datasets from Cardiogenics as inputs. Overlapping SNPs were retained within the hg19 region chr11:47100000-48100000 for the SPI1 locus, chr11:59500000-60500000 for the MS4A locus and chr1:169300000-170300000 for the SELL locus. pelleted at 2,000 rpm and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche)) with one freeze-thaw cycle and 1 h incubation on ice. Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA kit (Thermo Fisher #23225). Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis in Bolt 4 12% Bis-Tris Plus gels with MOPS SDS running buffer and transferred using the iBlot 2 nitrocellulose transfer stack. Membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies against PU.1 (Cell Signaling, #2266) and \u03b2-actin (Sigma, #A5441) in 3% nonfat dry milk in TBS / 0.1% Tween-20 buffer. Secondary antibody staining was visualized using WesternBright ECL HRP Substrate Kit (Advansta K-12045) and ChemiDoc XRS+ (BioRad). Images were quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Two independent experiments were performed without randomization of sample processing, n = 2. The researcher was not blinded to sample identification. Differences between means of data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Sidak's post hoc multiple-comparisons test between selected groups, with a single pooled variance. Adjusted P values for each comparison are reported.\nQuantitative PcR. Sorted GFP + BV2 cells after overexpression or knockdown of PU.1 were collected as described for western blotting. Cell pellets were lysed in QIAzol reagent and RNA was isolated with RNAeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) including the Dnase treatment step with RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). Quantities of RNA were measured using Nanodrop 8000 (Thermo Scientific) and reverse transcription was performed with 1-2 \u00b5g of total RNA using High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed on QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with one-step PCR protocol. We used 3 ng of cDNA for all genes except Ms4a4a, for which we used 24 ng of cDNA in a 10-\u00b5L reaction volume. Primers were from PrimerBank 79 or designed using Primer-BLAST program (NCBI) and are listed in Supplementary Table 14 . Ct values were averaged from two technical replicates for each gene. The geometric mean of average Ct for the housekeeping genes Gapdh, B2m and Actb was used as a reference that was subtracted from the average Ct for a gene of interest (dCt). Gene expression levels were log transformed (2 -dCt ) and related to the combined mean values of pcDNA3 and pGFP-V-RS-shSCR control samples in each sort, giving the relative expression for each gene of interest. Data were visualized in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Four independent experiments were performed without randomization of sample processing, n = 4. The researcher was not blinded to sample identity. Differences between means were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's post hoc multiple-comparisons test between experimental and control groups, with a single pooled variance. Adjusted P values for each comparison are reported in Supplementary Table 13. data availability.
