[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Cognitive impairment in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in animal models of A\u03b2-pathology can be ameliorated by treatments with the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPAR\u03b3) agonists, such as rosiglitazone (RSG). Previously, we demonstrated that in the Tg2576 animal model of AD, RSG treatment rescued cognitive deficits and reduced aberrant activity of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG), an area critical for memory formation. Methods: We used a combination of mass spectrometry, confocal imaging, electrophysiology and split-luciferase assay and in vitro phosphorylation and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results: Using an unbiased, quantitative nano-LC-MS/MS screening, we searched for potential molecular targets of the RSG-dependent rescue of DG granule neurons. We found that S226 phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14), an accessory protein of the voltage-gated Na + (Nav) channels required for neuronal firing, was reduced in Tg2576 mice upon treatment with RSG. Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed that the Tg2576 condition decreased PanNav channels at the AIS of the DG, and that RSG treatment of Tg2576 mice reversed the reduction in PanNav channels. Analysis from previously published data sets identified correlative changes in action potential kinetics in RSG-treated T2576 compared to untreated and wildtype controls. In vitro phosphorylation and mass spectrometry confirmed that the multifunctional kinase GSK-3\u03b2, a downstream target of insulin signaling highly implicated in AD, phosphorylated FGF14 at S226. Assembly of the FGF14:Nav1.6 channel complex and functional regulation of Nav1.6-mediated currents by FGF14 was impaired by a phosphosilent S226A mutation. Bioinformatics pathway analysis of mass spectrometry and biochemistry data revealed a highly interconnected network encompassing PPAR\u03b3, FGF14, SCN8A (Nav 1.6), and the kinases GSK-3 \u03b2, casein kinase 2\u03b2, and ERK1/2. Conclusions: These results identify FGF14 as a potential PPAR\u03b3-sensitive target controlling A\u03b2-induced dysfunctions of neuronal activity in the DG underlying memory loss in early AD."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common of debilitating dementias characterized by loss of memory and cognitive decline, and accounts for 50-60% of all overall cases of dementia in persons over 65 years of age (Francis et al., 1999) . Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a link between insulin signaling, cognition, and risk for AD. Supporting this link, the class of insulin-sensitizing drug known as the thiazolidinediones, which includes rosiglitazone (RSG) and pioglitazone (PIO), and are potent and selective agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), has shown efficacy in patients with MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and concomitant insulin resistance (Risner et al., 2006; Harrington et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2005; Gad et al., 2015; Sato et al., 2011; Perez & Quintanilla, 2015) . Likewise, RSG treatment rescues hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in the Tg2576 AD mouse model (Rodriguez-Rivera et al., 2011; Denner et al., 2012) by a mechanism that involves normalized intrinsic excitability and synaptic function of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG), a critical location for new memory formation . Dysregulation of the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway that subserves hippocampus-dependent cognition (Denner et al., 2012; Ahi et al., 2004; Atkins et al., 1998; Sweatt, 2004; McGaugh, 2000; Jahrling et al., 2014) , the presynaptic VAMP-2 glutamate release machinery (Nenov et al., 2014) , and voltage-gated ion channels may mediate the effect of RSG treatment on granule neuron function, but details of how PPAR\u03b3-agonism affects excitability in ion channel complexes are lacking. Because voltage-gated ion channels are the fundamental unit of excitability in the neuron, investigating how RSG treatment affects ion channel proteins may identify critical nodes in downstream pathways of A\u03b2 pathology and provide useful information for therapeutic strategies (Rusinova et al., 2011; Imbrici et al., 2016; Catterall, 2012) .\nQuantitative phosphoproteomics can be combined with state-ofthe-art mass spectrometry to identify potential signaling pathways that regulate post-translational modifications of cellular components (Baek et al., 2011; Berendt et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2006) . Recent studies have identified highly clustered areas containing phosphorylation sites on the voltage-gated Na + (Nav) Nav1.2 isoform, particularly at the I-II linker and the C-terminal intracellular regions (Baek et al., 2011; Berendt et al., 2010) . These phosphorylation sites control channel gating, expression, and sub-cellular localization, which impact Nav channel function and consequently affect excitability (Berendt et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2015 Hsu et al., , 2016 Wildburger et al., 2015) . Previous studies have identified alterations in the phosphoproteome concomitant with neurologic disease: studies in humans with AD as well as an early onset mouse model of AD reveal significant alterations in global phosphorylation profiles with critical alterations in multiple cellular signaling pathways Zahid et al., 2012) , and phosphorylation as well as other post-translational modifications of Nav1.2 channels (James et al., 2015) , such as methylation, are reciprocally modulated in epilepsy (Baek et al., 2014) . These observations suggest that PTMs on Nav channel complexes may have important implications in the screening and diagnosis of brain disorders.\nIn addition to post-translational modifications, protein:protein interactions (PPIs) contribute to Nav channel function in native conditions . Nav channels are highly clustered at the axonal initial segment (AIS), where they exist in a large macromolecular complex with accessory modulatory proteins (Hsu et al., 2014) . Among these, fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) stands out for its specific modulatory roles on neuronal Nav channels. Recent studies highlight the importance of FGF14, a multivalent accessory protein of the Nav channel, in animal as well as human studies (Hsu et al., , 2016 James et al., 2015; Ali et al., 2016; Alshammari et al., 2016a, b, c; Tempia et al., 2015; Ali et al., 2014; Shavkunov et al., 2013) . Through direct monomeric binding to the Nav channel C-terminal tail, FGF14 forms a complex with the channel that is required for proper gating, expression and trafficking of the channel to the AIS as well as the control of neuronal excitability (Ali et al., 2014 (Ali et al., , 2016 Alshammari et al., 2016a; Laezza et al., 2007 Laezza et al., , 2009 Lou et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2000 Wang et al., , 2002 Xiao et al., 2007; Goetz et al., 2009) . Using the bioluminescence-based luciferase complementation assay (LCA) (Michnick et al., 2010; Remy & Michnick, 2006; Shavkunov et al., 2012; Villalobos et al., 2007 Villalobos et al., , 2008 , a PPI assay that quantitatively measures the complementation of reconstituted FGF14 and Nav1.6 channel complexes, we previously identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a multifunctional kinase dysregulated in Alzheimer's, depression and schizophrenia (Emamian, 2012; Jope et al., 2007; Jope & Roh, 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Budni et al., 2012; Scala et al., 2015; Maqbool et al., 2016; Morris & Berk, 2016; Provensi et al., 2016; Avila et al., 2010) , as a key modulator of the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex. Inhibition of GSK-3 reduces the assembly of the FGF14:Nav channel complex, modifies FGF14-dependent regulation of Na + currents, and induces dissociation and subcellular redistribution of the native FGF14:Nav channel complex (Shavkunov et al., 2013) . Furthermore, CK2 is a known priming kinase of GSK-3, and recent studies have shown that inhibition of CK2 induces similar alterations in assembly and distribution of the FGF14:Nav complex (Hsu et al., 2016) . The significance of FGF14 extends beyond its regulation of Nav channels. In humans, a naturally occurring F145S mutation in the FGF14 gene is implicated in the development of spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27), a severe motor and cognitive neurodegenerative disorder Brusse et al., 2006; Wozniak et al., 2007; Coebergh et al., 2014) , and SNPs in the Fgf14 gene have been associated with depression and schizophrenia (Hsu et al., 2014; Verbeek et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Murillo et al., 2014; Di Re et al., 2017 mice which exhibit phenotypes including changes in network activity, decreased gamma frequency, and cognitive impairments that mimic the human disease (Alshammari et al., 2016b) . In addition, studies performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) WGS data have shown SNP rs17502999 in Fgf14 to be significantly associated with entorhinal cortex volume change in AD (Di Re et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015) . Given that these studies suggest that alterations in the sequence and/or expression of fgf14 are associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairment symptoms seen in AD, investigating the signaling pathways that control the function of FGF14 is essential for discovering what role this protein might play in the pathogenesis of AD and other complex brain disorders associated with cognitive impairment.\nHere we used a combined approach implementing large-scale phosphoproteomics, bioinformatics network analysis, mass spectrometry, and split-luciferase complementation assay (LCA) to identify relevant protein targets in an AD mouse model that is sensitive to the PPAR\u03b3 agonist RSG. Among the hits, we identified Ser226 of FGF14 as a relevant target sensitive to RSG. Using confocal microscopy and image quantification, we show that the Tg2576 phenotype is characterized by a reduction in PanNav and the PanNav:FGF14 ratio at the AIS, which is reversed by treatment with RSG. Analysis of previously published electrophysiological data, which established a mechanistic link between cognitive improvement by thiazolidinediones and neuronal excitability in an AD mouse model , provides correlative findings to the imaging studies. In addition, we show that phosphorylation of FGF14 at S226 by GSK-3 occurs in vitro, while the phosphosilent mutant FGF14 S226A reduced complex formation with Nav1.6. These observations suggest a potential novel role for PPAR agonists in the modulation of an important signaling pathway that is dysregulated in an AD mouse model."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DNA constructs", "text": "All plasmids used in this study were previously described (Lou et al., 2005) .

U.S.A.\n-GFP were plated at low density on glass coverslips for 3-4 h, and then transferred to a recording chamber. Recordings were performed at room temperature using a MultiClamp 700B and Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The extracellular recording solutions contained the following (mM): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.3; and the intracellular solution (mM): 130 CH 3 O 3 SCs, 1 EGTA, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. Membrane capacitance and series resistance were estimated by the dial settings on the amplifier and electronically compensated by 70-80%. Data were acquired at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz prior to digitization and storage. All experimental parameters were controlled by Clampex 9.2 software (Molecular Devices) and interfaced to the electrophysiological equipment using a Digidata 1322A analog-digital interface (Molecular Devices). Voltage-dependent inward currents for HEK-Nav1.6 cells were evoked by depolarizations to test potentials between \u2212100 mV and +60 mV from a holding potential of \u2212 70 mV followed by a voltage pre-step pulse of \u2212 120 mV (Nav1.6). Steady-state (fast) inactivation of Nav channels was measured with a paired-pulse protocol. From the holding potential, cells were stepped to varying test potentials between \u2212 120 mv (Nav1.6) and +20 mV (pre-pulse) prior to a test pulse to \u221220 mV. Current densities were obtained by dividing Na + current (I Na ) amplitude by membrane capacitance. Current-voltage relationships were generated by plotting current density as a function of the holding potential. Conductance (G Na ) was calculated by the following equation:\nwhere I Na is the current amplitude at voltage V m , and E rev is the Na + reversal potential. Steady-state activation curves were derived by plotting normalized G Na as a function of test potential and fitted using the Boltzmann equation:\nwhere G Na , Max is the maximum conductance, V a is the membrane potential of half-maximal activation, E m is the membrane voltage and k is the slope factor. For steady-state inactivation, normalized current amplitude (I Na /I Na ,Max) at the test potential was plotted as a function of prepulse potential (Vm) and fitted using the Boltzmann equation:\nwhere V h is the potential of half-maximal inactivation, E m is the membrane voltage, and k is the slope factor.Transient I Na inactivation decay was estimated with standard exponential equation. Inactivation time constant (tau, \u03c4) was fitted with the following equation:\nwhere A 1 and \u0192 1 are the amplitude and time constant, respectively. The variable C is a constant offset term along the Y axis. The goodness of fitting was determined by correlation coefficient (R), and the cutoff of R was set at 0.85. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit 9 software (Molecular Devices) and Origin 8.6 software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test.\n-GFP compared to FGF14-GFP transfected HEK293-Nav1.6 cells across multiple voltage steps (Fig. 6C ). For instance, at -10 mV voltage step, the peak current density in HEK293-Nav1.6 cell expressing FGF14\n-GFP was \u2212 6.02 \u00b1 1.02pA/pF (n = 11) compared to \u2212 13.43 \u00b1 2.63pA/pF (n = 8) in HEK293-Nav1.6 cell expressing FGF14-GFP (p b 0.01 with Student's ttest, Fig. 6D , Table 5 ). Subsequent analysis of Nav1.6 channel biophysical properties showed that the S226A mutation has no significant effect on both the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation ( Fig. 6E and F, Table 5 ).\n3.7. FGF14, Nav1.6, and GSK-3 form a highly-interconnected network that includes PPAR\u03b3 Based on the relationships described in this work including the biological agonism of PPAR\u03b3 with RSG leading to in vivo phosphorylation of the S226 site on FGF14, the role of this site in association with Nav1.6 (SCN8A), and the ability of GSK-3 to phosphorylate this site, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis that included PPAR\u03b3 as a mediator of RSG action. This analysis, based on prior mass spectrometry and biochemistry data on the effect of RSG in Tg2576 animals (Denner et al., 2012; Ahi et al., 2004; Atkins et al., 1998; Sweatt, 2004; McGaugh, 2000; Jahrling et al., 2014) , revealed an extensive network including these known mediators in addition to the kinases casein kinase 2\u03b2 (CSNK2B) and ERK1/2 (Fig. 7) .

At the cellular level, we identified relevant pathways sensitive to RSG in the Tg2576 mouse model and electrophysiological changes in the dentate gyrus (DG) circuitry that were restored to normal levels by the same RSG treatment . In this study, we used unbiased quantitative nLC-MS/MS to identify differentially regulated phosphorylation sites that might be relevant for DG function. Tg2576 mice overexpressing human APP were fed control or RSG diet for one month starting at 8 months of age. After stable isotope labeling ( 16 O control; 18 O RSG diet) of tryptic peptides, samples were enriched for phosphopeptides and analyzed by nLC-MS/MS.

We examined the effects of diet supplemented with RSG on the distribution of FGF14, PanNav, and Ankyrin-G, a well-known marker of the AIS (Alshammari et al., 2016c; Grubb & Burrone, 2010; Bennett & Lambert, 1999) , in the DG of Tg2576 animals, compared to untreated WT and Tg2576. After sacrifice of animals at 9.5 months of age, 10 \u03bcm sagittal slices of fresh frozen mouse hippocampus were sectioned for immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy performed on the DG of the hippocampus ( Fig. 2A-C) . We observed that Tg2576 animals exhibited a substantial decrease in PanNav intensity in segmented regions corresponding to the AIS (\u2212 4731 \u00b1 745 raw intensity mean difference, vs. WT, p b 0.001; WT N = 1618 ROIs, 9 experiments, 2 animals; Tg N = 574 ROIs, 6 experiments, 2 animals), which was reversed by treatment with RSG (+4619 \u00b1 1101 raw intensity mean difference, vs. Tg, p b 0.001; Tg + RSG N = 1311 ROIs, 9 experiments, 1 animal) (Fig. 2D, F, Table 2) . For Ankyrin-G, a corresponding increase in intensity was observed in Tg (+8891 \u00b1 1024 vs. WT, p b 0.001) and incompletely reversed by treatment with RSG (\u22124212 \u00b1 1377 vs. Tg, p = 0.009) (Fig. 2E) . Interestingly, while AIS in Tg2576 mice did not exhibit a significant change in FGF14 staining intensity compared to WT, treatment with RSG significantly increased FGF14 abundance compared to WT and Tg (+4309 \u00b1 1265 vs. Tg, p = 0.005) (Fig. 2G) . These phenotypes, which manifest as significant alterations in the ratios between FGF14, AnkG, and PanNav (Fig. 2H-J, Table 3 ), suggest that the hippocampi of Tg2576 animals are characterized by a shift in the PanNav and Ankyrin-G composition at the AIS of the DG, and that RSG partially reverses these alterations as well as increases the abundance of FGF14 at the DG. Further support for a role of PanNav, FGF14 and Ankyrin-G in the same AD animal model is provided by complementary confocal studies investigating the CA1 region of hippocampal neurons. In these studies, untreated Tg2576 animals and animals treated with another thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, were compared to WT (Fig. S1) . In this study, we also observed a similar suppression of PanNav in Tg and reversal by treatment with PIO with corresponding changes in the PanNav to FGF14 ratio (Fig. S1A, C, F) ; however, we observed that the CA1 region was in fact characterized by a relative suppression of FGF14 localization in treated Tg mice (Fig. S1D) . These findings suggest that the role of PPAR\u03b3 agonism in Tg2576 mice may involve a complex, region-dependent and agonist-specific mechanism."}, {"section_title": "RSG treatment restores action potential time to rise and time to decay half-amplitude in Tg2576", "text": "Previously we showed that RSG diet ameliorates aberrant synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in Tg2576 DG granule cells (Nenov et al., 2014 . Treatment with RSG significantly restores repetitive firing in two types (type 1 and type 2) of electrophysiologically characterized DG granule cells via bi-directional modulation of spike after-depolarization (Nenov et al., 2014 . Here, in order to characterize functional outcomes associated with changes in Tg2576 AIS expression profiles for PanNav channels, FGF14 and another AIS marker, Ankyrin-G, we assessed time to rise and time to decay half-amplitude of action potentials in two previously identified types of DG granule cells Tempia et al., 2015) . Interestingly, we found reduction in time to rise and time to decay action potential half-amplitude in both type 1 and type 2 Tg2576 DG granule cells, and that treatment with RSG restores both parameters in each group to their wild type control values. Time to rise half-amplitude in Tg2576 DG granule cells (type 1 and type 2 combined) was significantly lower (0.5 \u00b1 0.07 msec, n = 31) compared to wild type (0.75 \u00b1 0.07 msec, n = 27; p b 0.05), and treatment with RSG resulted in significant increase of time to rise halfamplitude in Tg2576 (0.97 \u00b1 0.09, n = 36; p b 0.005) compared to untreated Tg2576 (Fig. 3A-B) . Similarly, time to decay half-amplitude in Tg2576 DG granule cells was significantly lower (2.8 \u00b1 0.1 msec, n = 31) compared to wild type (3.1 \u00b1 0.09 msec, n = 27; p b 0.05), and treatment with RSG resulted in significant increase of time to decay half-amplitude in Tg2576 (3.2 \u00b1 0.09, n = 36; p b 0.01) compared to untreated Tg2576 (Fig. 3A, C) . Changes in the action potential rise and decay time have been attributed to shifts in the spike initiation site. Thus, the changes in action potential kinetics reported here might contribute to the aberrant excitability found in Tg2576 animals and reversed by RSG. Compelling evidence indicates that FGF14 is a relevant accessory protein of the Nav channel complex Ali et al., 2016; Alshammari et al., 2016a; Tempia et al., 2015; Shavkunov et al., 2013; Bosch et al., 2015) , responsible for action potential initiation and propagation in neurons. In previous studies, we showed that FGF14 forms a complex with neuronal Nav1.6 channel, and this interaction is controlled by S/T kinases (Hsu et al., , 2016 Shavkunov et al., 2013) . The S226 residue of FGF14 is located in the C-terminal tail of the protein in a region enriched with other S/T sites (Fig. 4A) . Although the C-tail is not part of the FGF14:Nav interface (Ali et al., 2016) , its role in modulating this interaction has been previously postulated (Goetz et al., 2009 ). Thus, we hypothesized that changes in phosphorylation of residues at the FGF14 C-tail could affect the interaction with Nav channels. Our previous research has shown that GSK-3, a multifunctional kinase important for neuronal survival, cellular signaling, and stress response (Jope et al., 2007; Jope & Roh, 2006; Wu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2011; Kim & Snider, 2011) and dysregulated in a number of AD and psychiatric disorders (Emamian, 2012; Jope et al., 2007; Jope & Roh, 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Budni et al., 2012; Scala et al., 2015; Maqbool et al., 2016; Morris & Berk, 2016; Provensi et al., 2016; Avila et al., 2010) affecting cognition, including depression and bipolar disorder (Gould et al., 2004; Koros & Dorner-Ciossek, 2007; Omata et al., 2011) , critically modifies the interaction, assembly, localization, and activity of FGF14 and Nav channels James et al., 2015; Shavkunov et al., 2013) . Furthermore, we observed that the C-tail of FGF14 contains a consensus GSK-3 phosphorylation motif (S/T)XXX(S/T), the first residue in this sequence corresponding to S226. (The phosphorylation motif for GSK-3 contains two serine/threonines: the first, at the P position, corresponds to the site phosphorylated by GSK-3, and the second, at the P + 4 position, corresponds to a priming phosphorylation site that increases the efficiency of GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation (Casaday et al., 2004; St-Denis et al., 2015; ter Haar et al., 2001) ). Based on these observations, we conducted an in vitro phosphorylation assay using recombinant GSK-3\u03b2 with a FGF14 peptide with the sequence KPGVTPSKSTSASAIMNGGK. After reduction, alkylation, and digestion with Glu-C, high-resolution MS detected the peak of m/z 666.334 (theoretical mass = 666.334; ppm b 1.5), corresponding to the [M + 3H] 3+ peak. The observed fragmentation pattern is consistent with KPGVTPsKSTSASAIMNGGK-NH 2 , corresponding to phosphorylation of S226 of full-length FGF14, with site-determining ions b 5 , b 8 2+ , and y 12 (Fig. 4B, Table 4 ). The absence of any phosphorylated y-ion species excludes the S/T in the post-motif sequence STSASAIMNGGK, and the flanking b ions (b 5 , b 8 2+ ) excludes T224 as a possible phosphothreonine, leaving S226 as the only phosphorylated species. These observations confirm that GSK-3 phosphorylates FGF14 at S226 in vitro, supporting the evidence that changes in the phosphorylation state of this serine in FGF14 in native systems may be driven by endogenous signaling pathways."}, {"section_title": "A phosphosilent mutant of FGF14 impairs Nav complementation", "text": "To assess whether a S226A phosphosilent mutation affects the interaction of FGF14 with Nav1.6, we reconstituted the FGF14:Nav1.6 C-tail complex using LCA (Fig. 5A-B) (Hsu et al., , 2016 Ali et al., 2016; Ali et al., 2014; Shavkunov et al., 2013; Shavkunov et al., 2012; Shavkunov et al., 2015) .

While transient transfection with CD4-Nav1.6-C-tail-NLuc and CLuc-FGF14 gave rise to a robust luminescence signal, replacement of the construct with CLuc-FGF14 S226A reduced the stability of the complex leading to a 24% (FGF14: 1.32 \u00b1 0.08 \u00d7 10 4 RLU, n = 6 vs. 1.01 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 10 4 RLU, n = 6 in FGF14 S226A , p = 0.005) decrease in luminescence (Fig. 5C-D ).

Furthermore, thiazolidinedione drugs are insulin sensitizers and deficits in the insulin pathway are co-morbid with cognitive impairment in AD (Gad et al., 2015; Sato et al., 2011; Perez & Quintanilla, 2015; Rodriguez-Rivera et al., 2011; Jahrling et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Cowley et al., 2012; Bosco et al., 2011; Escribano et al., 2010; Escribano et al., 2009 ). Based on this evidence, we posited that genetic deletion of FGF14 could affect the insulin pathway.

Specifically, we show that in the DG of the Tg2576 mouse model, the level of phosphorylation of FGF14 at Ser226 is elevated, and is reduced with a one-month treatment regimen of the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone (RSG) (Fig. 1) . Confocal microscopy of the DG demonstrates alterations in Nav and AnkG localization in Tg2576 mice, with a large increase in the AnkG/PanNav ratio; this change was reversed in Tg2576 mice treated with RSG (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, RSG further increased FGF14 localization in the AIS of the DG compared to untreated Tg2576 mice (Fig. 2G) , which is associated with normalization of the Nav/FGF14 and FGF14/AnkG ratios (Fig. 2I-J) .

Upon interaction of FGF14 and the C-tail of Nav1.6, the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments reconstitute into functional luciferase enzyme, producing a robust luminescence response when luciferin substrate is added. (B) Lack of a serine/threonine site, as in the FGF14 S226A mutation, is projected to weaken the interaction between FGF14 and Nav1.6, resulting in a diminished luminescence response compared to wild type FGF14.

(D) Quantification of maximum observed intensity over the course of (C).\nFGF14 localization in the AIS of CA1 neurons in PIO-treated Tg2576 mice (Fig. S1 ). We note that the DG and CA1 differ substantially in terms of neurogenerative potential, cell type populations, and resistance to oxidative stress, all which may significantly affect downstream responses to PPAR agonism (Harrington et al., 2007; Jahrling et al., 2014; Nenov et al., 2014; Rusinova et al., 2011) . Analysis of electrophysiological parameters from previously collected studies support an RSG-dependent effect on action potential time to rise and time to decay half-amplitude opposing Tg2576-dependent alterations in the action potential waveform (Fig. 3) . These changes suggest that in DG granule cells of Tg2576 mice, rather than originating in the AIS, the action potential might originate at a subcellular location that is spatially closer to the soma (Foust et al., 2010; Popovic et al., 2011) . Such changes could be the result of redistribution and loss of expression of Nav channel and functionally relevant accessory proteins at the AIS (Fig. 2) . Treatment with RSG restores both the expression and distribution of Nav channels at the AIS and action potential properties, providing a tighter correlation between structural and functional phenotypes. These molecular changes likely contribute to deficits in memory formation associated with signal processing in the DG circuit in AD. Mass spectrometry confirms that the putative GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S/TXXXS/T) at S226 of FGF14 is phosphorylated in vitro by GSK-3\u03b2, which supports a possible regulatory role for this site in the context of GSK-3 signaling (Fig. 4) . Protein binding studies show that the phosphosilent mutant FGF14\nS226A reduces the formation of the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex (Fig. 5) , and concomitantly reduced FGF14 function in mediating Nav1.6-mediated currents (Fig. 6 ). This suggests that phosphorylation sites on the FGF14 C-tail may act as an excitabilitymodulating switch sensitive to changes in GSK-3 activity. We posited that a potential upstream target of the GSK-3 pathway relevant for AD was insulin. However, the absence of FGF14 was not sufficient to suppress insulin sensitivity in mouse brain extract (Fig. S2) , suggesting that GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of FGF14 in the context of AD is not downstream of the insulin pathway or that compensatory mechanisms might correct for the deficit. Finally, bioinformatics pathway analysis revealed a highly-interconnected network encompassing PPAR\u03b3, FGF14, SCN8A (Nav 1.6), and the kinases GSK-3, casein kinase 2\u03b2, and ERK1/2. Overall, these findings support a highly inter-connected FGF14-Nav1.6-GSK-3 network that includes PPAR\u03b3, suggesting that signaling within this interactome may be crucial nodes in the mechanism of PPAR\u03b3 agonists in AD mice (Fig. 7) . Previous research has shown that pharmacological treatment with PPAR\u03b3 agonists, such as RSG or PIO, rescues cognitive impairment in a subset of AD patients (Risner et al., 2006; Harrington et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2005; Sato et al., 2011; Perez & Quintanilla, 2015) . Analogously, a dietary regimen enriched in RSG in the well-studied Tg2576 AD mouse model, which exhibits early AD symptoms, DG synaptic alterations, and significant aberrations in neuronal excitability after 9 months of age, restores memory function and rescues synaptic deficits and intrinsic firing properties of granule cells in the DG (Nenov et al., 2014 , the brain area required for memory formation and most affected in early phases of AD (Rodriguez-Rivera et al., 2011 ).

In addition, we and others have demonstrated additional beneficial effects of RSG, indicating links between insulin signaling, cognition and AD Bosco et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2012; Mattos et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011) . However, we currently lack mechanistic insights into how this network operates and affects key molecular targets. This study provides a potential new mechanistic link between PPAR\u03b3 signaling and the target molecules that might mediate the changes in intrinsic excitability of granule cells in the DG circuit. Together, these findings support a perspective that impaired hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in Tg2576 is centered on changes in ionic conductances, such as Nav channels, triggering early-stage deficits in memory loss (Wang et al., 2016) which prompted us to analyze candidate molecules that may complement axonal function such as FGF14. Previously, we and several other research groups have demonstrated the vital role that FGF14 has in controlling biophysical properties and trafficking/targeting of Nav channels in in vitro and in vivo mouse models (Hsu et al., 2016; Shavkunov et al., 2013; Laezza et al., 2007 Laezza et al., , 2009 Goetz et al., 2009; Shavkunov et al., 2012) .\nThis PPI, established through direct binding of FGF14 with the intracellular C-tail of Nav channels, is required for neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity. In mice, targeted disruption of FGF14 produces severe ataxia, paroxysmal dystonia, and cognitive impairment (Wang et al., 2002; Wozniak et al., 2007) , with neurons that exhibit severe impairments in synaptic transmission and plasticity, and neuronal excitability (Alshammari et al., 2016a,b; Xiao et al., 2007; Wozniak et al., 2007) . Significantly, the assembly and trafficking of FGF14 itself is controlled via a GSK-3 dependent signaling pathway that may critically regulate excitability through PPI at the level of the Nav complex Shavkunov et al., 2013) . Additionally, the distribution of FGF14 is Nav channel-dependent; deletion of the Nav1.6 \u03b1 subunit in mouse Purkinje neurons markedly increases FGF14 levels in the AIS, in parallel with increased expression of Nav1.1 and \u03b2-IV-spectrin (Xiao et al., 2013) . As a result, through interactions with macromolecular complexes at the AIS, FGF14 plays an important role in the regulation of Nav channel activity. Correspondingly, deletion, mutations or genetic variants of fgf14 have been linked to brain disorders and diseases and the list is growing. First identified as the source of the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (Brusse et al., 2006; van Swieten et al., 2003) , a debilitating childhood-onset condition characterized by postural tremor, slowly progressive ataxia, and cognitive deficits, SNPs in fgf14 have been identified recently in a genome-wide study performed on a Dutch major depressive disorder cohort (Verbeek et al., 2012) . Additionally, copy variants of fgf14 have been found in a pediatric population admitted for recurrent unprovoked seizures (Olson et al., 2014) , IGF-1 induced neuroprotection against oxidative stresses is accompanied by downregulation of fgf14 (Genis et al., 2014) , and correlative changes in FGF14 and markers of GABAergic inhibitory transmission have been found in transcriptomics from post-mortem schizophrenia patients (Alshammari et al., 2016b) .\nIt is believed that the primary mode of action of FGF14 is to control channel gating and channel localization at the AIS, with direct influence on neuronal firing Lou et al., 2005) . In recent studies we discovered through a HTS of small molecule inhibitors that the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex assembly is under the control of a network of kinases that exert modulatory actions on complex assembly, with some kinase inhibitors stabilizing the PPI complex and others instead promoting its dissociation (Hsu et al., , 2016 Shavkunov et al., 2013) . As a result, these studies revealed a network of kinases centered on GSK-3 that modulate the FGF14:Nav channel complex bidirectionally . As shown previously, pharmacological inhibition and/or silencing of GSK-3 suppresses the interaction of FGF14 with Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 channels, modulates the functional activity of FGF14 on Na + currents, and control the sub-cellular distribution and co-localization of the two proteins in the axon and the somatodendritic compartment, phenotypes that might contribute to the role of GSK-3 in regulating neuronal excitability in the brain (James et al., 2015; Fig. 7 .

(See www.ingenuity.com for a more detailed description of network statistical calculations, molecule naming and symbol descriptions). Shavkunov et al., 2013; Laezza et al., 2007 Laezza et al., , 2009 ). These studies highlight the potential of using protein complementation assays to assess signaling pathways, a method that has been extended in the current study through the identification of a novel pathway that controls FGF14 function.\nPrimary sequence analysis of FGF14 reveals numerous predicted S/T phosphorylation sites, some throughout the core domain of FGF14 and others grouped within the C-terminal tail (FGF14 T224 to FGF14 T231 ) (Fig. 3A) . Additionally, the S226 site corresponds to a consensus GSK-3 motif, (S/TXXXS/T), shown to be phosphorylated in vitro in this current study, which supports a possible regulatory role for this site in the context of GSK-3 signaling (Fig. 3B) . Thus, by impacting the affinity of the Nav channels for its chaperone protein, FGF14, S/T phosphorylation of FGF14 is likely to be a critical nexus in neuronal excitability. Interestingly, S/T phosphorylation sites that match a GSK-3 motif are also found on Nav; the T1966 residue in the C-tail of Nav1.2 has been validated in vivo and also lies in a putative GSK-3 phosphorylation motif (Baek et al., 2011; Farghaian et al., 2011) . This residue is conserved in Nav1.6 and might also be a candidate for the effect of GSK-3 phosphorylation that we observed in this study. Furthermore, we have recently shown that FGF14 is phosphorylated at S228 and S230 by casein kinase 2 (CK2), an important intracellular kinase that mediates the association of Nav and AnkG, and is known to be a significant priming kinase for GSK-3 phosphorylation (Hsu et al., 2016; Br\u00e9chet et al., 2008; Wildburger & Laezza, 2012) . Given the role of CK2 and the GSK-3 consensus motif, we propose that S228 and S230 may be priming sites for GSK-3 dependent phosphorylation of S226, and that CK2 may act in concert with GSK-3 in fine-tuning regulation of FGF14 distribution and trafficking. In general, GSK-3 phosphorylation sites that could influence the assembly of the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex could be a direct link to extracellular signaling. This signaling could be relayed through tyrosine-kinase receptors, G-protein coupled receptors or other signal transduction pathways upstream of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 pathways, providing candidate targets for homeostatic regulation of firing and mechanistic links to brain circuitry hyperactivity found in brain disorders. Therefore, signaling through the FGF14/Nav1.6/GSK-3 axis may be a critical component of the mechanism of action of RSG on AD mouse models through a network of kinases related to GSK-3 (Fig. 7) . It has been shown that action potential waveform may significantly change due to availability and activity of Nav channels at the somatoaxonal region in neurons (Khaliq & Raman, 2006) . This prompted us to test whether changes in expression patterns for AnkG, Nav and FGF14 in the AIS of DG granule cells could correlate with modifications in action potential waveform in Tg2576. We measured time to half-amplitude of action potential, which reflects changes related to the action potential initiation site (Foust et al., 2010; Popovic et al., 2011) . We found reductions in both rise time and decay time to half-amplitude in Tg2576, and that treatment with RSG can reverse the phenotypes to the level of wild type control (Fig. 5) . Thus, aberrant expression of AnkG, Nav and FGF14 in Tg2576 granule cells could represent the molecular signature of change in the action potential waveform, which might associate with a shift in the action potential initiation site along the somato-axonal axis (Khaliq & Raman, 2006) .\nWhat could be the overarching model of changes in FGF14 phosphorylation downstream of PPAR\u03b3 agonist treatment, and how is this model recapitulated in the framework of the AD mouse model? Under normal conditions, FGF14 might serve as a kinase scaffold or a phosphorylation relay that translates signaling information into changes in firing. Phosphorylation of FGF14 could result in changes in binding and/or recruitment of other proteins to the Nav channel complex with effects on channel targeting and biophysical properties. As such, FGF14 phosphorylation could act as a fast-acting, coincidence detector of signals that can be rapidly translated into neuronal firing. There is a growing interest in understanding how neuronal intrinsic excitability is changed in AD and whether restoring this function might have a therapeutic value. Recent studies indicate that neuronal firing undergoes early alterations in the pathogenesis of AD, preceding the deficits in synaptic transmission . Our discovery is in line with this new line of research. Future studies will focus on the in vivo effects of FGF14 site-specific mutants to probe the effects of modulating specific post-translational modifications on the assembly and function of the AIS, and whether fgf14 \u2212/\u2212 phenocopies RSG in the Tg2576 mouse model. The phosphorylation of FGF14 at S226 may regulate binding with Nav channels, but may also control PPI with other chaperone proteins and as well as convey signaling pathways that target Nav channels to the AIS. Because binding of FGF14 to Nav channels affects the localization and biophysical properties of the channels, we hypothesize that post-translational modification of FGF14 induced by signaling pathways may explain some of the deficits seen in the Tg2576 mouse model. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which the Tg2576 mouse model produces the effects observed, and if PPAR\u03b3 agonists such as RSG or related compounds can be beneficial in other animal models of dementia. Recently, FGF14 SNPs have been associated with volumetric changes in the entorhinal cortex of patients with AD (Yang et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016) . Animal studies furthering investigating the role of FGF14 in the brain will be important translational models to elucidate this emerging role of FGF14 in humans afflicted with AD and other numerous brain disorders, including schizophrenia (Alshammari et al., 2016b; Gadelha et al., 2012; Brzustowicz et al., 1999; Need et al., 2009 ) and major depressive disorder (Verbeek et al., 2012) , to which critical links with FGF14 have been found.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.05.005."}, {"section_title": "Declarations", "text": "All animal procedures were performed in accordance to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols.
