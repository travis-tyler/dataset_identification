The domains of cognition rely on distinct cortical systems, where distributed and specialized brain circuitry serves associated cognitive functions [2] . Degeneration and dysfunction of these large-scale cortical systems parallel the decline of specific cognitive domains observed in dementia [3] .\nPathological events in AD are considered to cause the clinical manifestations through sequential and synergistic build-up of pathological proteins, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau, in the brain and neurodegeneration. Although there is some evidence that elevated levels of A\u03b2 are associated with future cognitive decline [4] , regional A\u03b2 is generally a poor correlate of cross-sectional cognition [5, 6] . Tau and neurodegeneration, on the other hand, have been shown to be closely linked to deficits in cognition [7, 8] . While the associations with tau have been determined through studies of post-mortem brain tissue [9] , we are now able to study them in vivo using PET ligands [10, 11] .\nAutopsy data indicate that the spread of tau pathology follows a progressive sequence [12] consistent with the observed clinical course in AD: tau starts in the medial temporal lobe regions that are responsible for learning and memory, then into the rest of the cortex to affect the cortical areas that serve other cognitive domains. Initial studies using tau-binding radiotracers have recapitulated the Braak staging of tau that has been described in autopsy studies [13, 14] , establishing the promise of these radiotracers for assessing, in vivo, how tau pathology relates to domain-specific cognitive decline.\nAssessment of neurodegeneration in vivo has been available with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cortical thickness to estimate structural atrophy and with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET to evaluate regional hypometabolism. Studies using these modalities have consistently shown that AD is characterized by degeneration in temporal and parietal cortices [15] [16] [17] [18] in a pattern similar to tau pathology. Furthermore, in vivo studies of neurodegeneration, like post-mortem studies of tau, have revealed close associations between the distribution of neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits found in patients with AD [3, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .\nTaken together, studies of tau and neurodegeneration suggest that the two are closely related and that both contribute to variability in cognitive performance. The relationship between neurodegeneration and cognition across different domains in vivo has been explored extensively, but the link between tau and cognition across domains in vivo remains to be fully characterized. Studies of tau-PET in early-onset atypical variants of AD, such as primary progressive aphasia or posterior cortical atrophy, have shown that tau accumulation in cortical systems that serve specific cognitive domains is associated with impairment in those respective domains [24, 25] . Interestingly, the aggregation of tau within functional cortical systems [26] and the association of tau with cognitive loss in different domains [27] has recently been demonstrated to similarly occur in lateonset, amnestic AD. In this study, our interest was to further examine how in vivo measures of tau and neurodegeneration associate with different domains of cognition in the common, amnestic AD phenotype.\nTo this end, we used multi-modal imaging and neuropsychological battery data available in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to investigate the relationship between cross-sectional measures of tau, cortical thickness, and different aspects of cognition. We hypothesized that tau and cortical thickness would both correlate with cognition in a domain-specific manner, with tau demonstrating stronger associations over a wider area of the domain-relevant cortex. We tested these hypotheses by performing surface-based vertexwise analysis and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis in a group of A\u03b2-positive older adults with a diagnosis of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, or AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "Our sample consisted of subjects from phase 2 and phase 3 of the ADNI.

Meng's test compares two dependent correlations and allows us to determine whether FTP is more related to one cognitive test versus another at each point on the cortical surface. Meng's test was performed pairwise for the statistical maps from FTP vertex analyses with RAVLT learning, RAVLT delayed recall, category fluency, and TMT part A. These 4 tests were chosen because they had qualitatively similar topographical associations with tau as for LM immediate recall, LM delayed recall, MINT, and clock drawing, respectively.

We found that worse cognition is related to greater tau burden and thinner cortex. We also found that the tau-cognition relationships were present in a domain-specific manner and were more widespread than the thickness-cognition relationships. We discuss our findings in the context of previous studies that have examined in vivo tau, atrophy, and cognition.\nThe implication of medial temporal, medial parietal, and lateral parietal tau load with memory and with global cognition has been well documented and replicated by several groups since the development of in vivo tau methods [13, 47] . Our findings are congruent with those previous studies and build upon them in a number of ways. For example, in our surface-based tau analyses, we found relatively greater left prefrontal cortex involvement in the RAVLT learning than the RAVLT delayed recall and also greater left prefrontal involvement in the LM immediate recall than LM delayed recall. This first highlights that the association between tau and AD-related learning and memory impairment is not restricted to temporal and parietal cortex. Furthermore, the implication of left prefrontal cortex is consistent with data from functional imaging and lesion studies that have localized verbal learning and verbal working memory to left frontal cortex [48, 49] , suggesting that the specific location of tau deposition relates to specific aspects of cognitive loss.\nThe regional specificity between tau and cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in the context of early-onset, non-amnestic forms of AD, where clinical variants exhibit different topographies of tau that are consistent with the clinical phenotype [24, 25] . There is now also mounting evidence that, even in late-onset, amnestic AD, tau burden regionally associates with performance on Fig. 4 Meng's test analyses show that FTP exhibits domain-specific relations with cognition. Yellow indicates that the cognitive measure noted in the column had a stronger association with FTP at that vertex than the cognitive measure noted in row (P value < .005). Red indicates that the cognitive measures noted in the row had a stronger association with FTP at that vertex than the cognitive measures noted in the column (P value < 0.005). Meng's test was limited to regions of the cortex that were significant after cluster-wise correction in the FTP-cognition or thickness-cognition analysis. Abbreviations: RAVLT, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; TMT, Trail Making Test domain-specific tests of cognitive function above and beyond learning and memory [27] and that this association maps onto the cortical circuitry underlying the respective cognitive domain. This notion is supported by the significant associations between tau and tests of language, processing speed, visuospatial and executive functions, and semantic knowledge that we found in our study. Although there was spatial overlap between cognitive tests in their associations with tau, particularly in early Braak regions, there was also considerable heterogeneity. This includes left-hemispheric laterality for tests of language and stronger superior parietal involvement in tests of processing speed and constructional ability compared to tests of memory and language. These patterns of tau-cognition associations mapped closely with the cortical systems that are believed (based on functional imaging and lesion studies) to support the specific cognitive functions tested. The finding that TMT parts A and B displayed stronger associations in parietal cortex compared to tests of memory and language, for example, is congruent with fMRI studies that have shown that tasks involving numbers rely on parietal cortex [50] and that the set-shifting necessary for successful completion of TMT part B is supported by activation of intraparietal sulcus [51] . Taken together, our findings from surface-based analyses with tau-PET are aligned with recent studies of patients with early-onset [24, 25] [52] and late-onset AD [27] that have demonstrated that performance in various cognitive domains associates with tau along distinct topographic patterns.\nCortical thickness also correlated with performance across tests, and these associations were topographically similar to the tau-cognition associations. Both correlations involved temporal and parietal cortex across cognitive domains, whereas tests of processing speed and constructional abilities showed stronger correlations with tau in more posterior cortex than tests of memory and language. However, the thickness-cognition relationships were more spatially restricted than the tau-cognition relationships. Although the order in which disease-related tau and atrophy appear during aging and AD has been under discussion [53] , models of AD pathophysiology have historically postulated primacy of tau pathology [54] . Our finding that the tau-cognition associations were more The value in each cell of the matrix shows the partial correlation between a regional thickness and cognition, b regional PVC-FTP and cognition, and b between regional PVC-FTP and cognition, after accounting for regional thickness. The association of cognition with regional PVC-FTP or regional thickness recapitulate our vertex-wise findings. Matrices are displayed at a threshold of P value < 9.9e\u22125. In b, the columns for medial orbitofrontal and lateral orbitofrontal are identical, the columns for pars orbitalis, opercularis, and triangularis are identical, and the columns for rostral and caudal middle frontal are identical. This is a consequence of the PVC methods we used (see the \"Methods\" section) which combine individual FreeSurfer ROIs into larger ROIs.

This is recapitulated in our ROI analyses. We further showed in the ROI analyses that, even after taking regional thickness into account, PVC-FTP still predicted cognition. We interpret these findings to mean that tau may exert an influence on cognition via mechanisms that are independent of structural atrophy. There are several potential pathways through which tau may induce cognitive loss such as synaptic dysfunction and synaptic loss. Some of these alterations, which can now be estimated in vivo using PET [55] , should be the focus of future studies to provide a better view of how the hallmark AD pathologies like tau drive decline and to realize new potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. We should note that the widespread topography of tau-cognition associations relative to thickness-cognition associations may be a consequence of deriving the tau and cortical thickness measures from different modalities. However, we applied a differential smoothing procedure to account for this and, moreover, a recent study by Bejanin and colleagues [25] also reported data suggestive of an atrophy-independent effect of tau on cognition, lending further credence to our interpretation.\nOur findings have several practical implications. For example, a critical aim for designing a well-powered clinical trial is enrolling individuals that are on the verge of AD-related cognitive decline. Although our data are cross-sectional, the robust relation between tau and cognition may indicate that tau burden is a better and more sensitive predictor of imminent decline than is cortical thickness. There are several potential reasons as to why tau-PET may be a more sensitive tool for detecting decline. As we discussed above, tau may precede neurodegeneration [56] and begin to exert its affect on cognition prior to discernable atrophy. Furthermore, cross-sectional MRI-based estimates of atrophy may be affected by premorbid, inter-individual variability in thickness. Related to this, there is some evidence that atrophy measures derived from longitudinal MRI may offer predictive power beyond cross-sectional measures of atrophy in forecasting cognitive decline [57] . Thus, it will be important to incorporate longitudinal MRI if seeking to determine which imaging measures are most useful in clinical trial contexts. Lastly, because we focused on cortical patterns of tau and atrophy as they relate to cognition, we excluded hippocampal atrophy from our analyses. Hippocampal atrophy has been shown to be an indicator of imminent cognitive decline [58, 59] so estimates of hippocampal volume loss, in addition to cortical thinning, should be included in studies seeking to address the relative utilities of MRI and PET in predicting decline for powering clinical trials.\nWith further regard to clinical trials, there are now several compounds in the AD pipeline whose mechanism of action involves targeting tau pathology [60] . For these trials, it will be critical to identify individuals that are currently undergoing, or are expected to undergo, cognitive changes that are related to tau, rather than changes due to non-AD neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, or normal aging processes. Our data first demonstrate that noninvasive and economical neuropsychological tests like those used in ADNI can detect tau-related changes, supporting their potential utility as a screening tool. In addition, given that tau correlated with cognition in several domains, our data highlight the importance of designing neuropsychological batteries or composites for clinical trials that evaluate functions beyond memory.\nSome limitations to our study should be acknowledged. FTP has been shown to exhibit off-target binding to choroid plexus in the areas adjacent to the hippocampus [61] , to monoamine oxidases [62] , and others. Newer generations of radiotracers that bind more specifically to tau [63] will minimize this problem in future studies. Another limitation is that our sample of participants is relatively skewed to early disease stages. This may have produced a limited range in cognitive measures and FTP signal, and hence, could have limited our ability to detect some tau-cognition and thickness-cognition relationships that may be present in AD. We were further limited by the brief battery in ADNI. Future studies with more extensive testing, for example, testing memory with nonverbal as well as verbal stimuli, will allow for broader understanding of tau-cognition relationships. The final shortcoming of our study is the small sample size, which potentially explains the failure to find meaningful tau-cognition and thickness-cognition associations in the diagnosis-stratified analyses. Future studies in larger cohorts may demonstrate relationships within diagnostic groups, helping to explain the staging of tau-atrophy relationships across the spectrum of the disease."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In a group of individuals along the AD spectrum, we found that cognitive decline in specific domains parallels the deposition of tau into the cortical systems that are thought to be responsible for subserving those domains. Our vertex and ROI analyses also revealed that there are areas of cortex where cognition is related to tau, but not cortical thickness, suggesting that tau may have an effect on cognition via mechanisms that are, at least in part, independent of significant atrophy.
