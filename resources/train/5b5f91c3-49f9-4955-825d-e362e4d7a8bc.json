[{"section_title": "", "text": "F rom 2003 to 2013, the number of scientists and engineers residing in the United States grew from 21.6 million to 29.0 million (table 1). An important factor in this growth has been immigration: In 2013, 18% (5.2 million) of the scientists and engineers residing in the United States were immigrants, whereas in 2003, 16% (3.4 million) were immigrants. In 2013, the majority of U.S. immigrant scientists and engineers were naturalized U.S. citizens (63%), whereas 22% were permanent residents and 15% were temporary visa holders (table 2)   Three S&E occupations experienced substantial employment growth among immigrant scientists and engineers from 2003 to 2013: life scientists (75%), computer and mathematical scientists (58%), and social and related scientists (55%). There was less growth over the decade in these occupations for U.S.born scientists and engineers. Another story emerges upon examining occupations such as physical and related scientists or engineers. Although there was little change in the total number of physical and related scientists or engineers over the decade, the immigrant share of both occupa-tions increased, and the U.S.-born share of both occupations decreased. The number of immigrant engineers increased by 32,000 (10%), and the number of immigrant physical and related scientists increased by 17,000 (27%) (table 2). Meanwhile, there were decreases in the number of U.S.-born physical and related scientists (5%) and engineers (2%). Overall, the median annual salary of immigrant scientists and engineers ($72,000) was higher than the median annual salary of their U.S.-born counterparts ($64,000) (figure 2). This pattern of higher median salary for immigrants compared to their U.S.born counterparts exists in both S&E occupations and S&E-related occupations and may in part reflect the fact that immigrants are more likely than U.S.-born citizens to have earned a post-baccalaureate degree (41% versus 33%, excluding professional degree). Immigrants earned higher median sala-ries at both the master's and doctoral levels. At the bachelor's level, immigrants and U.S.-born scientists and engineers earned similar median salaries (table 3)."}, {"section_title": "Economic Sector Representation", "text": "In 2013, 76% of immigrant scientists and engineers were employed in business or industry, 11% were employed in 4-year colleges or universities, 6% were employed in other educational institutions, and 8% were employed in government (table 2). Compared to immigrant scientists and engineers, slightly smaller shares of U.S.-born scientists and engineers were employed in business or industry (69%) or in 4-year colleges or universities (7%), and larger shares were employed in other educational institutions (12%) and in government (12%). These differences in the shares of immigrant versus U.S.-born scientists and engineers by employment sectors were similar to those in 2003."}, {"section_title": "Primary or Secondary Work Activity", "text": "Overall, 58% of employed scientists and engineers reported management, sales, or administration as their primary or secondary work activity (i.e., the activity on which they spent the most or the second-most hours in a typical work week) (table 2). However, immigrant scientists and engineers were less likely than their U.S.-born counterparts to report management, sales, or administration as their primary or secondary work activity (49% versus 60%). In contrast, immigrant scientists and engineers were more likely than their U.S.born counterparts to report research and development as their primary or secondary work activity (34% versus 25%). Similarly, immigrant scientists and engineers were more likely than their U.S.-born counterparts to report that their primary or secondary work activity involved computer applications    (computer programming, systems, or application development) (19% versus 9%). U.S.-born scientists and engineers were more likely than their immigrant counterparts to report teaching as their primary or secondary work activity (19% versus 13%)."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Limitations", "text": "Data presented here are from the 2013 SESTAT, an integrated data system that provides a comprehensive picture of individuals educated or employed in S&E fields and serves as the official National Science Foundation (NSF) source for estimates of the collegeeducated S&E workforce. The 2013 data are collected through two biennial surveys: the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The NSCG is the core of SESTAT. It is a representative sample of the entire college graduate population residing in the United States. The NSCG provides information on individuals educated or employed in S&E fields as well as those educated or employed in non-S&E fields. The SDR further supplements SESTAT with the stock and inflow of U.S.-degreed doctoral level scientists and engineers. For further survey information, please visit the SESTAT Web page: www. nsf.gov/statistics/sestat/. Data presented in this report are now available through the SESTAT data tool at http://sestat.nsf.gov/sestat/ sestat.html. The 2013 SESTAT public use data files are available at http:// sestat.nsf.gov/datadownload. Data from these sources are also included in reports such as Science and Engineering Indicators and Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabili- The estimates in this report (which may be shown in text, figures, and tables) are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from actual values because of sampling variability or other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. All comparative statements have undergone statistical testing and are significant at the 10% level unless otherwise noted. In this report, the variances of estimates were constructed based on the surveyspecific replicate weights from the SDR and the NSCG."}, {"section_title": "Note", "text": ""}]
