Objective: This study investigated cerebellar volume and atrophy rate using magnetic resonance imaging in individuals with normal cognition (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Two hundred twenty-nine CN, 398 MCI and 191 AD participants of stage I ADNI database with screening scans were evaluated for cerebellar volume. Of those, 758 individuals with two or more follow-up scans were categorized into stable, converted, and reverted CN, MCI and AD and evaluated for cerebellar atrophy rate. Results: Cerebellar volume was 2.5% larger in CN than in those with AD but there were no differences between CN and MCI and MCI and AD in cross-sectional analysis. Similarly, the atrophy rate was 49% larger in AD and 64% larger in MCI who converted to AD but no difference was detected between CN and MCI. There were no association between education and APOEe4 and cerebellar volume or cerebellar atrophy across the diagnostic groups. Conclusion: Cerebellar atrophy contributes to Alzheimer's clinical progression but mostly at the late stage of the disease. However, even in the late stage shrinkage rate is less than the average of the shrinkage in the cerebrum and is not associated with AD moderators. This suggests that cerebellar involvement is secondary to cerebral involvement and can be due to network connection spread regardless of the primary pathology.

It is connected to almost all parts of the nervous system, comprises more than 50% of the total brain neurons, but surprisingly contributes to only 10% of the whole brain volume [Andersen et al., 1992] . This mismatch is a reflection of the difference in neural architecture. Gray matter makes up 80% of the cerebellar volume (compared with less than half for the cerebrum) [Hoogendam et al., 2012] and consists of densely packed small granular neurons tightly folded which are less diverse compared to those of the cerebral cortex. In contrast to the variety of cytoarchitectonic organisation observed in different regions of the cerebral cortex, all regions of the cerebellar cortex appear similar in histological sections [Standring, 2008] . Specific histological architecture in addition to rich connections to the other parts of the brain makes the cerebellum an important region to investigate in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.\nPathologically, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal intra and extra cellular protein aggregations, i.e., intracellular tau phosphorylation and extracellular b-amyloid deposition. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) revealed significant correlations between postmortem and in vivo presence and density of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau: 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B ( 11 C-PiB) [Driscoll et al., 2012] and Florbetapir-PET imaging [Clark et al., 2011] for b-amyloid deposition and labelled THK5117-PET [Lemoine et al., 2015] for aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau. PET studies suggested no difference in the cerebellar uptake in AD and cognitively normal (CN) participants [Jack et al., 2008b; Jonasson et al., 2016; Rowe et al., 2007] and therefore it has been adopted as a normalizing area for standardized uptake values (SUVs) [Jonasson et al., 2016; Lopresti et al., 2005] .\nAlthough AD related shrinkage and neuronal death are thought to be associated with and possibly due to b-amyloid deposition and tau aggregation [Wang et al., 2002] , their topological patterns and progression are different [Braak and Braak, 1991; Thal et al., 2002] . Moreover, the pattern of regional brain atrophy in AD does not follow precisely either b-amyloid or tau topological patterns . Therefore, normal level of b-amyloid deposition and tau aggregation may not rule out the presence of neuronal loss or shrinkage in the cerebellum. A recent postmortem stereological study suggested no significant differences in the cerebellar total Purkinje and granular cell number nor in the volume of the granular layer between severely demented Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal individuals [Andersen et al., 2012] . However, this finding is inconsistent with a previous study that showed a significant reduction in the granular layer in AD [Wegiel et al., 1999] although both studies reported significant reduction in whole cerebellar volume. These somewhat inconsistent findings may be due to the fact that these studies were postmortem (cross-sectional) with low sample sizes (20 and 16 subjects, respectively) in qualitatively different cohorts and thus afforded low statistical power.\nTo bypass the inevitable limitations of post mortem studies (single measurement occasion and small sample size), structural neuroimaging techniques including magnetic imaging are the best available option for longitudinal examination of brain volume change over time. Our recent published systematic review [Tabatabaei-Jafari et al., 2015] revealed that there is no morphological longitudinal study aimed at comparing cerebellar structural change in normal ageing and cognitively impaired populations including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to evaluate crosssectional and longitudinal structural differences in the cerebellum across cognitively different populations including CN, MCI, and AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nAll individuals participating in ADNI1 study who underwent MRI screening and diagnostic evaluations were included in the cross-sectional analysis and categorized into three diagnostic groups: CN, MCI, and AD. Participants with additional scans in follow-up assessments were included in the longitudinal analysis and categorised into more specific diagnostic groups according to the diagnosis at the first and last scanning time points. Details of the diagnostic criteria can be found on the ADNI web site (http://www.adni-info. org/Scientists/AboutADNI.aspx). Briefly, participants were categorized as CN if they had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score higher than 24, a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 and were not diagnosed with MCI, dementia or depression. Participants were categorized as MCI if they had a MMSE score higher than 24, a subjective report of memory concern, a measured objective memory loss, a CDR of 0.5, absence of dementia and preserved daily living activities. Participants were categorized as AD if they had a MMSE score lower than 26, a CDR of 0.5 or 1.0, and fulfilled criteria for clinically probable AD according to the Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/ Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. Participants with follow-up evaluation were categorized into stable, converted or reverted CN, MCI, and AD according to the first and last time points diagnoses: stable if the first and last evaluation were similar, converted if the last evaluation progressed to declined cognitive diagnosis and reverted if the last evaluation was improved."}, {"section_title": "Image Acquisition", "text": "Participants underwent a high-resolution MRI scans of the brain on 1.5 T scanners from General Electric, Siemens, or Philips (Milwaukee, WI; Germany; The Netherlands, respectively) across multiple scanners using a standardized MRI protocol for 3D MP-RAGE sequences [Jack et al., 2008a] and following parameters: TR 5 2,400 ms, minimum full TE, TI 5 1,000 ms, flip angle 5 88, 24 cm field of view, acquisition matrix of 192 3 192 3 166 and yielding 1.25 3 1.25 3 1.2 mm 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Segmentation and Image Analysis", "text": "Volumetric segmentation were conducted by the ADNI team at the University of California, San Francisco using FreeSurfer version 5.1 for longitudinal analyses [Reutera et al., 2012] .

The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for the repeated longitudinal cerebellar volumes measurements was 0.98 (95%CI 0.9803-0.9843), which indicates that most of the variance (96%) occurs between participants while only 4% occurs within participants.\nNonparametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) was used to visually inspect the data to determine whether linear models were appropriate. The LOW-ESS approach uses weighted least squares (giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated) to estimate the mean response value at each time point and provide a smooth line representing the relationship between dependent and explanatory variables, when there are no assumptions about the relationship. The LOW-ESS plots for cerebellar volume versus age suggested that linear modeling of the relationship between cerebellar volume and age was appropriate for cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses since little departure from linearity was observed across groups except for CNc, which assumed to be due to low sample size i.e. 19 participants (Fig. 1) .\nThe lme4 package (version 1.1-7) was used to conduct linear regressions analyses. In cross-sectional analyses, multiple linear regressions were conducted to investigate the cross-sectional relationship between cerebellar volume and clinical diagnosis status. Cerebellar volume was applied as dependent variable and age (centred on 55, the youngest participants at baseline), gender, education, APOE e4, diagnosis and intracranial volume (ICV) were considered as explanatory variables. In longitudinal analyses, mixed effects models were applied with the same explanatory variables for linear regressions in addition to a random effect by scanner and two random effects by subjects: a random intercept and a random slope for age at each time point. The random slope of time (centred age at each time point) was tested in a minimally controlled model and if statistically significant was included in the model as random effect [Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2013] . A time by clinical diagnosis group interaction effect was tested to determine whether the rate of change in cerebellar volume differed between groups. Fixed effect of age on cerebellar volume for each diagnostic group was considered as cerebellar atrophy rate. The final models were visually checked for any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, and linearity. Likelihood ratio test of the model with the effect in question against the model without was used to determine statistical significance."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demography", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional", "text": "Eight hundred eighteen participants were categorized into CN, MCI, and AD. There were no significant differences in age across the groups, but significant differences in gender and APOE e4 distributions among the diagnostic groups. The male ratio was higher in MCI and, as expected, APOEe4 frequencies were significantly higher in MCI and AD. AD participants were significantly less educated than CN (Table I) ."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal", "text": "Of 818 participants with screening scans 758, who had one or more follow-up scans and cognitive tests, were included in the longitudinal part. They were categorized into different diagnostic groups according to the first and last time points diagnoses: stable CN (CNs), CN converted to MCI (CNc), stable MCI (MCIs), MCI converted to AD (MCIc), stable AD (ADs), CN converted to AD, MCI reverted to CN (MCIr), and AD reverted to MCI (ADr). There were no significant differences in age and education across the diagnostic groups except for education between CNs and ADs. Pearson v 2 test revealed no significant difference in gender distribution but a significant difference in APOEe4 distributions between diagnostic groups. APOEe4 distributions were higher in MCIs than CNs and in ADs than CNs. The mean follow-up period across the groups was 2.54 (1.20) years, which was shorter in MCIs and ADs compared with CNs.\nThe negative association between age and cerebellar volume is consistent with that demonstrated in the crosssectional analysis (0.41%/year in cross-sectional and 0.47% in longitudinal). Pairwise analyses demonstrated significantly larger cerebellar atrophy rates in ADs and MCIc but not in CNc and MCIs compared to CNs. This pattern of results is suggestive of an increasing rate of cerebellar atrophy with progression of AD pathology. It is also consistent with the chronological development of AD pathology with progressive spreading of tau fibrillatory tangles (Braak stages), amyloid deposition, and subsequently gradual decline in cognitive function [Murray et al., 2015] . As Thal et al. demonstrated, clinically diagnosed AD occurs in the amyloid phase 3 to 5 while the cerebellar involvement mostly occurs in the fifth phase [Thal et al., 2002] . Thus, the available evidence suggests that the cerebellum is relatively spared of neurodegeneration in the preclinical stages of the disease and gradually becomes affected as the clinical presentation fully develops. However, it remains unclear whether association of the cerebellum with AD clinical progression is due to spreading of fibrillary tangle and/or amyloid deposition, or secondary to cerebral neurodegeneration.\nAlthough the findings suggest shrinkage in the cerebellum with ageing and larger cerebellar atrophy in ADs compared with CNs and MCIs, it is worthy to consider that cerebellar atrophy in the diagnostic groups were less than that reported for whole brain atrophy (CNs: 0.36%/ year versus 0.57%/year; MCIs: 0.36%/year versus 1.02%/ year; ADs: 0.53%/year versus 1.90%/year) [Henneman et al., 2009; Tabatabaei-Jafari et al., 2015] . This is in contrast to brain areas characteristics for AD pathology, including hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, for which atrophy rates are roughly 200% higher for MCI and 300% higher for AD compared to normal ageing [Desikan et al., 2008; Tabatabaei-Jafari et al., 2015] , further emphasising the relative resistance of the cerebellum to AD related degeneration. However, despite the small effect size and partial resistance, the cerebellum is not intact in AD pathology and future investigation is needed to elucidate the impact of cerebellar atrophy on uptake measurement when using the cerebellum to standardise FDG uptake in PET studies."}, {"section_title": "Cross-Sectional Results", "text": "A significant association between cognitive diagnosis and cerebellar volume (F (2,811) 5 3.95, P < 0.01) was detected.\nPairwise comparisons demonstrated (3,400 mm 3 ; 2.5%) larger cerebellar volume in CN compared to AD (F (1,413) 5 9.82, P < 0.001), but no differences between CN and MCI (F (1,620) 5 3.40 P > 0.1), and MCI and AD (F (1,582) 5 1.62, P > 0.1). Table II presents the mean ICV-adjusted cerebellar volumes and the fixed effect of age for the three diagnostic groups.

However, a significant effect of cognitive diagnosis on cerebellar atrophy rates was detected (v 2 (7,25) 5 22.71, P < 0.001).

This discrepancy is consistent with the documented progression of AD pathology. However, the cerebellum can be parsed functionally and morphologically into different subdivisions and it is likely that AD pathology targets each subdivision differently. Previous voxel-based morphometric studies showed bilateral lower gray matter density in lobule VI [Colloby et al., 2014] and Crus I/II [Guo et al., 2016] in AD compared with CN, suggesting that network-selective vulnerability underlies the cerebellar neurodegeneration [Guo et al., 2016] . Regardless of selective or nonselective volume loss in the cerebellum and its subregions, cross-sectional approach needs to be affirmed by tracking atrophy in a longitudinal approach."}, {"section_title": "Covariates and Correlates", "text": "Age is a common predictor for CN and AD-related brain atrophy and all cognitive groups in the current study were matched for age. However, they were differences in gender distribution, education and APOEe4 alleles-the most wellknown risk factors of AD pathology-as were expected. An effect of sex on cerebellar volume was detected such that males showed less cerebellar atrophy than females. However, no significant association between education or APOEe4 alleles and cerebellar volume were detected. APOEe4 is a known moderator of hippocampal atrophy in AD pathology [Tabatabaei-Jafari et al., 2015] , therefore it might have been expected that carrying the APOEe4 allele would be associated with increased cerebellar atrophy. However, this was not the case in our findings. It may indicate that while neurodegeneration in the cerebrum is directly related to the development of neurofibrillary tangles and b-amyloid deposition which occurs at higher rates in APOEe4 carriers, cerebellar atrophy is the product of secondary processes associated with cerebral neuronal loss, Wallerian degeneration, and widespread disconnection. To clarify this question future investigations need to further elucidate the impact of risk factors in different AD clinical stages."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitation", "text": "This study is unique in using in vivo evaluation of the cerebellum with a reasonable follow up period in a relatively large sample while computing both cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates and using advanced and wellcontrolled mixed-effects models.

However, acceleration in atrophy rate is less than the average of the atrophy in the cerebrum and it is not associated with AD moderators (education and APOEe4 status). These findings in addition to previous evidence of network-selective vulnerability of the cerebellum suggest that AD-related cerebellar atrophy might be secondary to the development of AD pathology in the cerebrum rather than the cerebellum itself. Therefore, modifying interventions targeting the non-specific network progression is a potential therapeutic option additional to interventions targeting the specific pathological process."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
