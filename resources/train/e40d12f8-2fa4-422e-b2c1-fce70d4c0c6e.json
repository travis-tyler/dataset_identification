[{"section_title": "D r a f t", "text": "The deposited nutrient load contributed to over 20,000 square kilometers of bottom-water hypoxia (USGS 2009). Understanding how information influences the farmer's nutrient application decision is important when developing strategies for N load mitigation. This research assesses the value of information farmers receive from several common sources, including nitrogen soil (N-soil) testing and price signals from markets, and makes several important innovations to the existing literature. I account for farmer heterogeneity and endogenous N-soil testing by proposing an instrumental variables approach that overcomes identification issues when estimating N application rates at the field level. Notably, this research incorporates N prices using 2 years of cross-sectional data by exploiting exogenous ammonia production capacity and farm location as instruments for N price.\n1. I cannot observe test-recommended N levels for farmers who do not test the soil, nor do I know why two observationally similar farmers make different choices about whether to test or not. 2. Heterogeneous manager characteristics can cause otherwise similar farmers to make different decisions about the amount of fertilizer to use once they have conducted a test. Such differences, unknown to the researcher, can potentially bias estimates. 3. The classic error-in-variables problem that may come from using a price variable created from nitrogen's relative share of total expenditures for fertilizer. Along with the component's relative size of the total expenditure, I use total applied acres to calculate the dollars per pound of nutrients applied. 4. Farmers may receive quantity discounts when purchasing N fertilizer where more fertilizer is purchased and the unit price falls. If the application rate is correlated with the farmer's total N demand, failing to account for this may result in a bias.\nWho Do Farmers Trust for Their Information? Farmers increasingly rely on N-soil testing when making their application decision. Fertilizer dealers have significant influence on the application decision. Extension and crop consultant services play a lesser role in the decision making process.\n\nreported price effects between 2001 and 2005 provide more evidence of this behavior (see table  2); the number of farmers who reported that the price of N caused them to reduce the amount applied was more than double that of 2001. If policy makers are interested in reducing the \"overuse\" of N or more closely aligning N rates with test recommendations, policy options, such as changing input costs, can influence the amount of N applied and its management. Survey evidence demonstrates that expectations are formed over several production seasons, and the response of farmers to the ARMS questions about high N prices suggests that implementing management changes may not be immediate. Farmers experiencing year-over-year growth in the cost of fertilizer may take incremental steps to change their management behavior. Changing management practices could require farmers to make capital investments in new equipment, for example, purchasing new tillage equipment or waiting for contracts to expire. For these reasons, policymakers may want to consider that it takes time to adjust nutrient management practices or they should institute policies that encourage farmers to do so. Finally, while prices are important for N demand, the sources of information are important as well. The most common source of information, such as advice from a fertilizer dealer, plays a large role in influencing fertilizer applications decisions.\n"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This analysis relied on data from the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). ARMS collects data via a series of interviews with farm operators on a wide range of topics, such as agricultural production practices, costs of production, farm income and finances, and other farm business and household characteristics.

In other words, the test could be endogenous to the amount applied. Based on ARMS data, a minority of farmers employ an N-soil test. In fact, about a quarter of the farmers in the ARMS survey conducted a soil test. When the sample is limited to farmers who use manure and commercial fertilizers in combination, only 13 percent conduct an N-soil test. A set of instruments--National Commodity Crop Productivity Index measures, soil percolation, and average precipitation--are correlated with soil testing, but uncorrelated with the disturbance process in the demand equation. Nitrogen Prices Several sources of plausibly exogenous variation can be used to argue for meaningful price variation: distance to the nearest ammonia plant, capacity of the plant, and distance to New Orleans (the central terminal for imported ammonia). One of the greatest sources of variation comes from differences in the distance to an N fertilizer producing plant. Most of the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer supply is produced near the source of the primary input (natural gas), away from the Corn Belt, and in the South and Southwest (Huang 2007). To move N fertilizer around the country, the industry uses rail, river, and truck freight, as well as pipelines. Because of rising natural gas prices, ammonia is increasingly being imported into the United States, where a majority of the ammonia enters from the Gulf of Mexico, mostly New Orleans. Differential transportation costs and capacity lead to differences in prices throughout the country.

The derived estimates represent the application rate for N fertilizer. The data are cross-sectional and include observed per-acre N use on the field as reported by the farmer. Nitrogen costs are estimated by computing the reported total cost of fertilizer, minus the cost of custom application. Because the reported cost includes the cost of N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), a share variable represents the component's relative size, per pound, in the total amount of fertilizer applied. The two-stage least squares model was estimated with two endogenous variables.

The ARMS question asked whether farmers reduced their application rates of commercial N due to higher prices and, if so, by what amount and by how much. The survey also asked about other behavioral changes: whether they increased the use of manure or other organic N; whether they switched to a different type of commercial N; and whether they more carefully managed the N on the field.
