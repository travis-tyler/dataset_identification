Do you wonder why some are not interested in reading? The Reader Self-Perception Scale 2 (RSPS2) can shed light on factors that influence students' reading attitudes and behaviors and help teachers shape better literacy climates.\nLiteracy professionals have long believed that affective factors can influence the behavior and achievement of developing readers and writers. Research has borne out these intuitions about attitude, motivation, and self-perception so much so that little doubt remains about whether affect has an impact on literacy learning. As a field, we know that children and adolescents who have made positive associations with literacy will tend to read and write more frequently and with greater engagement (Alvermann, 2008; Strahan, 2008) .\nThe increased involvement that occurs when students feel positively about literacy is important because it contributes to enhanced reading and writing ability (Anderson, Fielding, & Wilson, 1988; Foertsch, 1992) . Over time, when students remain focused and determined to succeed with reading and writing texts, their practice will be more purposeful, enduring, and productive. The positive associations they form with literacy will contribute to continued motivation and perseverance.\nConversely, we also know that when students feel less positively about reading and writing, they tend to be inattentive, disengaged, and uncommitted. As a result, their achievement tends to lag (Spaulding, 1992) . In fact, some argue that the growing number of disengaged adolescent readers is \"a crisis\" (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2011; Heller, 2011) . Others suggest that it is opportunistic to focus on the long-neglected needs of adolescents (Jacobs, 2008) .\nRegardless, secondary reading instruction is clearly a priority. For example, the National Governors Association (2009) noted that occupations requiring college-level and higher level literacy skills will generate about 46% of all job growth between 2004 and 2014 . Yet, in 2009 , only 31% of eighth graders performed at proficiency on the National Assessment of Education Progress.\nMoreover, most secondary schools require that intensive support be provided in regular education to the most at-risk students before a degree of school failure that would result in special-education identification (Juel, 1988; Torgesen, Rashotte, Alexander, Alexander, & MacPhee, 2003) . Such an imperative presents challenges for educators and administrators, with perhaps the greatest of these hurdles related to assisting the disengaged reader.\nFor these reasons, it is extremely useful for teachers to know how their students feel about their own literacy. Unfortunately, few instruments exist that measure affective literacy constructs validly and reliably. This gap exists primarily because affect is extremely difficult to gauge (Henk, 1993; Henk, McKenna, & Conradi, 2011) . Without these instruments, teachers have not had a full complement of literacy assessment tools, and this limitation could conceivably compromise the literacy growth of their students.\nTo help address this void, a new instrument has been devised for measuring how adolescents in grades 7 through 10 feel about themselves as readers of print-based texts. Like the original Reader Self-Perception Scale (RSPS), which has been translated into at least seven languages and used in international research, the new Reader Self-Perception Scale 2 (RSPS2) is a developmentally appropriate extension of the earlier instrument and has been widely used to measure the perceptions children have of themselves as readers in grades 4, 5, and 6 (Henk & Melnick, 1992) . The original RSPS and its later-developed counterpart for writing, the Writer Self-Perception Scale (WSPS; Bottomley, Henk, & Melnick, 1997) , can be used for the purposes of assessment, instruction, and research. The RSPS2 can be used in these same ways, but, most important, it will make individual and group reading evaluations of adolescent-age students more nearly complete.\nIn the sections that follow, the relationship between reading and self-efficacy will be explained. The RSPS2 will then be described,"}, {"section_title": "Reading and Self-Efficacy", "text": "The Reader Self-Perception Scale 2, like the RSPS and WSPS, is based on Bandura's (1977 Bandura's ( , 1982 theory of perceived self-efficacy. In his model, Bandura defines self-efficacy as the judgments individuals make about their ability to perform an activity and the effect of this perception on their ongoing and future engagement with it. Simply put, self-perceptions can either motivate or inhibit learning processes (Schunk, 1982 (Schunk, , 1983a (Schunk, , 1983b Zimmerman & Ringle, 1981) . Judgments about one's ability to be successful at an activity influence whether that activity will be sought or avoided, how much effort is put forth on it, and how long the individual will persist at it (Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Schunk, 1984) . All these factors affect the amount of high-quality time on-task that individuals will spend on an activity, which will, in turn, have an impact on their achievement.\nIn a school context, students who regard themselves as capable readers have probably had many positive experiences with reading. They expect to be successful with new texts. By contrast, students who perceive themselves as poor readers often anticipate struggling with new material. They have typically endured a history of failure and rarely experience reading as a source of gratification. In fact, reading is more likely to be a cause of frustration and embarrassment for them. When viewed through this lens, it is not hard to see a causal link between readers' self-perceptions and their reading behaviors, habits, and attitudes. Put differently, how individuals feel about themselves as readers can influence whether they choose to read, the energy they will devote to it, and how long they will work at making sense of text (Henk & Melnick, 1992 ).\nBandura's self-efficacy model would suggest that students consider four basic factors when appraising their reading ability: (1) Performance, (2) Observational Comparison, (3) Social Feedback, and (4) Physiological States. Performance, as he defines it, is a broad category that includes past success, amount of effort necessary, the need for assistance, patterns of progress, task difficulty, task persistence, and belief in the effectiveness of instruction. In the model, observational comparison refers to how students think their reading ability compares to the abilities of classmates. Social feedback includes the direct and indirect input that students receive from teachers, peers, and family members. And physiological states represent the internal feelings that students experience while reading.\nOur previous research with children in the intermediate grades indicates that these four factors do validly and reliably explain how reader self-perceptions are made (Henk & Melnick, 1992 , 1993 ) with one major qualification. As it turns out, as originally defined, the scales for Observational Comparison (OC), Social Feedback (SF), and Physiological States (PS) hold up extremely well. However, for measurement purposes, the Performance category needed to be defined more narrowly as perceptions of growth or improvement. We now refer to this scale as Progress (PR) and limit it to items that measure how one's sense of present reading performance compares with past performance. Interestingly, the construct of progress turns out to be inclusive of nearly all the aspects under Bandura's original Performance category.\nThe four sources of information represented in the RSPS2 naturally interact with one another (Marshall & Weinstein, 1984) . For example, students' perceptions of their progress (PR) will be influenced by how well their progress compares with that of classmates (OC), the social feedback (SF) they receive for their progress, and how the progress they are making causes them to feel inside (PS). Likewise, their internal feelings about reading (i.e., physiological states) will be related to the personal progress in reading that they sense is being made, how their reading ability compares with other that of students, and the amount and type of social commentary they receive from teachers, parents, and classmates for their reading efforts. These types of interactions are inevitable when categories overlap so fluidly.\nFor that matter, these interactions highlight the idea that literacy learning is both complex and socially situated (Alvermann & Guthrie, 1993) . Observational Comparison and Social Feedback are, by their very nature, socially situated, and even the physiological states category has an overt social dimension when public oral reading is accessed by following the link in the citation at the bottom of the page.

We know, for instance, that the prospect of oral reading to any size of audience can be terrifying to some students yet might not bother other readers, particularly competent ones, much if at all. Confident readers might in fact welcome the opportunity and the challenge. The key point here is that students learn about themselves as readers in the classroom, the home, and anywhere else that reading takes on a social dimension. So, although personal or private perceptions of progress and physiological states are important determinants of reader selfperceptions, much of students' self-efficacy beliefs will be tied to the social contexts in which literacy activity happens. Understanding how the four sources of information for reader self-perceptions work can help teachers to shape learning environments for literacy that are more conducive for their students. Properly managed, the classroom context can motivate students to choose reading and to engage both more intensely and for longer periods, all of which stands to increase ability levels. The Reader Self-Perception Scale 2 is reproduced in Figure 1 , with items coded by scale for ease of interpretation. Respectively, the two-letter codes for Progress, Observational Comparison, Social Feedback, and Physiological States are PR, OC, SF, and PS. Please note that when the RSPS2 is copied for administration, the codes should probably be removed so that they are not a distraction for the students. Figure 1 indicates that Progress (PR) items require students to compare past and present performance (e.g., I can understand difficult reading materials better than before), whereas Observational Comparison (OC) items ask students to think about how their performances match with those of classmates (e.g., I read faster than other students). Items representing Social Feedback (SF) address students' perceptions of the input they receive about their reading from teachers, parents, and peers (e.g., My classmates think that I read pretty well; My teachers think that I do a good job of interpreting what I read). Finally, Physiological States (PS) items inquire about how reading makes students feel internally (e.g., Reading tends to make me feel calm)."}, {"section_title": "Journal of", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Description of the Instrument", "text": "The RSPS2 includes one general item and 46 specific items that relate to the four scales (Progress, Observational Comparison, Social Feedback, and Physiological States) . The general item (no. 25) simply states, \"I think I am a good reader.\" The remaining items incorporate elements of reading, such as word recognition, word analysis, fluency, and comprehension as well as some new elements that were not part of the original RSPS.\nThese new items were added based on the results of individual structured interviews (Henk & Melnick, 2004 ) with a total of 60 seventh-and eighth-grade students, split evenly between the grades. The students represented readers of low, average, and high ability levels. The interview protocol used with these students was nearly identical to one used to further explore the RSPS (Henk & Melnick, 2004) .\nThe interviews indicated new items should be piloted that dealt with the following more specific secondary factors: vocabulary/word meanings, text and task difficulty, focus and concentration, volunteering to read and answer questions, interest/desire to read, confidence, and expressive reading as an indicator of understanding. These aspects of school-based literacy had not been mentioned by younger children in the intermediate grades during their interviews. Accordingly, new items were devised to address them, again stated positively and in straightforward terms. As a result, all items being considered for the RSPS2 qualified as clear, developmentally appropriate even for older learners, and not likely to confound the scales as negative items have been shown to do (Melnick & Gable, 1990) .\nWhen responding to the RSPS2, students are instructed to read each statement and rate how much they agree or disagree with it. Ratings are made using a 5-point Likert scale (in which 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree). Because the number of items changes according to the scale (PR = 16; OC = 9; SF = 9; PS = 12), the maximum possible scores differ for each scale, respectively (PR = 80; OC = 45; SF = 45; PS = Association and permission has been granted for this version to appear in e-Publications@Marquette.

"}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "The initial item pool consisted of all the appropriate items from the original RSPS as well as several that had been generated based on the student interviews. In all, some 66 items were used for the content review of items. The list of statements, as well as the conceptual definitions for each of the four categories, was presented to 56 graduate students in reading. An additional category called \"Other\" was available for the graduate students to use when undecided. In the content review, they were asked to place each item in the category in which it seemed to fit best and to indicate how well they thought it fit. The feedback received in this judgmental process resulted in five items being dropped.\nThe remaining 61 items were piloted with 488 students in grades 7 and 8. A factor analysis was performed on the data to see how well the predicted scales emerged for each category. Overall, the fit of the model was promising, but it indicated the existence of five factors instead of four. The scales for Progress (PR), Observational Comparison (OC), and Physiological States (PS) performed largely as expected, but the Social Feedback items clustered into two scales: one for teacher feedback and one that included feedback from parents and classmates. An inspection of the item characteristics indicated that fully 14 items did not contribute much to the instrument. Dropping these items made the scales cluster better and caused their corresponding reliabilities to remain constant or increase.\nAt this point, we anticipated that Social Feedback would hold together as a scale both conceptually and empirically when we expanded our data collection. For the final instrument, the reliabilities measured as follows: Progress (0.93), Observational Comparison (0.91), Social Feedback (0.84), and Physiological States (0.95). These results were welcome, because each coefficient exceeded the 0.70 threshold desired for an affective scale while reflecting the expected categories.\nAfter the revisions indicated by the first pilot (n = 488) had been made, an additional 2,542 students in grades 7 through 10 in several urban, suburban, and rural school districts responded to the final instrument (total n = 3,030). Further reliability analyses indicated scale alphas ranging from 0.87 to 0.95, with all items contributing to the overall scale reliability. Table 1 displays the internal consistency reliabilities for each scale. The subsequent factor analysis indicated the existence of each of the expected categories.\nMoreover, as Table 2 indicates, the mean scores and standard deviations for each scale were similar across grades, and the corresponding standard errors were desirably low. Students reported the highest relative reader self-perceptions on the Progress scale (61.2 of the maximum possible 80, mean = 3.83) followed by Physiological States (31.0 of 45, mean = 3.44), Social Feedback (29.7 of 45, mean = 3.30), and Observational Comparison (39.7 of 60, mean = 3.31). Stated another way, the students' average response of nearly 3.51 per item indicated their overall tendency to think of themselves as capable readers."}, {"section_title": "Administration and Scoring", "text": "It takes about 20 to 25 minutes for students to complete the RSPS2. The teacher should begin by explaining the purpose of the instrument and then work through the example (See Figure 2) . Additional examples should be used if necessary so that all students understand what to do. The teacher should emphasize to the students that they should be as honest as possible and that there are no right answers. They should also be encouraged to ask questions about any aspect of the instrument they do not understand.\nTo score the RSPS2, the evaluator should sum the raw scores for each of the four scales. A scoring sheet is provided in Figure 3 to assist with the calculations. For each student, the completed RSPS2 form should be placed alongside the scoring sheet, and the evaluator then transfers the student's responses to each item from the RSPS2 using the numerical scoring key (e.g., SA = 5; SD = 1). When all responses have been recorded, the evaluator totals the number in each column to get a raw score for each of the four scales.\nTeachers who want more precise norming data than provided in the bottom section of Figure 3 should refer to Table 3. Table 3 provides the percentile rankings for scores on each scale for intervals of every five percentile points.\nThe bottom section of Figure 3 provides a snapshot of norming data that can be used for interpreting students' scores. The normal range for each scale is indicated by any score within the average range. Scores that fall within the low percentile range are cause for concern. By contrast, scores that fall within the above-average or high percentile ranges would indicate uncommonly high reader selfperceptions."}, {"section_title": "An Example From the Classroom", "text": "Soon after the school year began, Ms. Heath, an eighth-grade language arts teacher, administered the RSPS2 to her English class. She knew very little about this group of students except that their reading-ability levels were mixed. From past experience, she suspected that their beliefs about themselves as readers could affect their motivation to read in her class.\nConsequently, she wanted to identify those students who might be at risk affectively and to make classroom adjustments that would benefit them individually and the group as a whole. Using the RSPS2, she could gain a general sense of how the group felt about themselves as readers and become aware of particular students whose scores on the four scales were noticeably poorer. She also planned to administer the RSPS2 at the end of year to determine if stronger reader selfperceptions occurred in light of the climate for literacy learning in her classroom.\nAs a group, her students' mean scores on the Observational Comparison and Social Feedback scales fell in the average range, but the mean scores for Progress and Physiological States were low. It pleased Ms. Heath that her students felt they were performing on a par with classmates and that the input they received from teachers, parents, and peers was affirming.

For students to benefit from her reading class, she knew that they would need to see evidence of their progress and come to view reading as an inherently satisfying activity.\nResponding to the results, Ms. Heath began by creating a classroom context that honored all forms of print and offered choice in a wide variety of text genres. She also planned to provide her students with more explicit literacy feedback, initially using students' reading logs to offer specific statements of progress and arranging a schedule of one-on-one conferences with each student every two weeks. These conferences allowed her to support her students' independent reading growth while learning what topics they were passionate about. Her hope was to search out and recommend reading materials based on individual interests.\nThe profiles of two of her students, Sarah and George, were worrisome. Sarah's RSPS2 profile showed an average score for Progress and slightly below average score for Physiological States. Her scores were well below average for Observational Comparison and Social Feedback, and because Sarah was hesitant to respond during comprehension discussions, Ms. Heath wondered if she felt uncomfortable offering ideas in front of peers.\nShe continued observing Sarah and also planned actions to increase her confidence. First, she would quietly provide her with a question or two prior to a large group discussion to allow Sarah extra time to think about her responses. In addition, Ms. Heath planned to begin Literature Circle based on student choice and hoped that the smaller group and appealing genre would bolster Sarah's confidence with peers.\nUnlike Sarah, all of George's RSPS2 scores were low, and his achievement data indicated a serious reading problem. He was new to the building, and Ms. Heath knew that he had previously received reading intervention. When Ms. Heath asked him to support his answers to comprehension questions by reading aloud relevant portions of the text, he struggled to do so. His classmates then became impatient, because they were clearly more proficient and confident in their reading. Soon he started exhibiting discomfort with almost every reading task. As a struggling reader, his low reader self-image had been shaped over a long period, and his recent experiences made matters worse.\nBased on George's records, the RSPS2 data, and her early observations, Ms. Heath took several actions. First, she requested that he receive a formal reading evaluation. She wanted to collaborate with the school's reading specialist on ways to increase George's reading proficiency. From an interview, she learned that he was a sports fan and enjoyed reading the newspaper. She suggested that he participate in the current events Literature Circle where the newspaper, magazine, and Web articles would be decided by the group and where she could make sure George's interests were honored. Lastly, she set aside a weekly meeting time to help him select independent reading materials.\nIn effect, the RSPS2 provided Ms. Heath with valuable insights regarding the reading self-efficacy of her students. She learned about the class as a whole and quickly identified several students who needed her immediate attention. But most important, Ms. Heath used the tool to begin conversations with her less-engaged readers at a time when nurturing competence and confidence was critical.\nBeyond these conversations, she knew that adjustments needed to be made to the classroom climate and in the way individual students engaged in literacy events. Because specific institutional strategies do not match up with the RSPS2 scales per se, Ms. Heath knew her role would be to shape the literacy environment in general terms, creating a healthy classroom atmosphere in which students' reading self-perceptions could become more positive. With that goal in mind, she provided students with concrete evidence of their personal progress in reading and made efforts to demonstrate that their performances compared favorably with those of classmates. She also worked to ensure that students received affirming feedback, and she strove to make their engagements with text pleasurable enough to derive gratification from them.\nAs a secondary educator, she saw value in devising more meaningful and considerate ways to communicate reading progress to her students, and she modified public classroom practices involving oral reading and comprehension checks. She paid closer attention not only to grouping students for success, peer support, and enjoyment but also to the complexity of reading materials she assigned. In addition, she became more sensitive to indirect signals about students' reading performance and counseled the class and even parents about the importance of providing constructive feedback. Overall, she tried to make students more comfortable during the act of reading."}, {"section_title": "A Final Word", "text": "Our expectation is that the Reader Self-Perception Scale 2 will be useful across a wide array of literacy situations. Extensive norming of the instrument has occurred, providing evidence of validity and reliability. Consequently, the tool can provide meaningful affective literacy data for teachers, administrators, parents, and possibly even the students themselves. One note of caution is that the RSPS2 should be used only in grades 7 through 10, not in previous or subsequent levels where it has not been normed.\nIt will be up to RSPS2 users to decide how the instrument might be ideally applied and interpreted for their purposes. Although the instrument provides a general indication of a student's self-perceptions as a reader, it does not yield specific self-evaluations of reading skills and strategies that students might make as part of regular classroom instruction. Neither does the scale address specific word-analysis techniques or comprehension abilities such as prediction, imagery, self-regulated learning, retelling proficiency, and critical reflection. Despite its limitations, and regardless of whether the RSPS2 comes to be regarded primarily as an assessment, instructional, or research tool, the instrument has the potential to become a widespread measure of an important affective index for literacy."}, {"section_title": "Take Action", "text": "Steps for Immediate Implementation \uf0b7 Use the RSPS2 to gain insights into instructional adjustments that might benefit the whole class and individual students. \uf0b7 Consider students' results in tandem with reading achievement and attitude measures for more complete, richer, and tailored literacy profiles.\n\uf0b7 Note the changes in RSPS2 scores over time to track how students' perceptions are changing.
