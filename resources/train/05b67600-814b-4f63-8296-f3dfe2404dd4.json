[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The literature on human capital, and its positive effects on individuals and regional economies, is now vast. The linkages between human capital and migration have also found a fertile ground in recent years especially in Europe where many studies have focused on interregional migration of graduates and highly skilled individuals. However, the literature on this phenomenon in the USA is less developed. Using the SESTAT database from NSF, this paper aims at contributing to the understanding of inter-state migration behavior of graduates in the USA and its effects on their career outcomes. It builds on the existing literature not only by focusing specifically on the US context, but also incorporating into the empirical model a correction for the possible selection bias that arises from the dual relationship between migration propensity and human capital endowment. Our estimated Mincerian earning equations, corrected for migrant self-selectivity, show that indeed repeat migration is associated with higher average salaries, while late migration is associated with a salary penalty. As for the other control variables, our results are consistent with what has been found in the labor economics literature. Female workers suffer from a salary penalty, while experience, level of education and employer size are all associated with higher average salaries.

Human capital is beneficial not only to individuals but to society overall. Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988) , proved that human capital is one of the driving forces of economic development and that it generates positive externalities which go above and beyond individual benefits.\nAlthough many researchers focused on the direct impact of human capital, measured by formal education, on wages and growth, less is known about the relationship between migration and human capital and the role of migration-especially for educational purposes-plays in future career paths after graduation. Migration itself can be seen as a form of investing in human capital. By migrating, people acquire knowledge and experience, which increase their stock of human capital (Faggian, 2005) . It is also interesting to note that education appears to significantly increase an individual's tendency to migrate (Faggian et al., 2007) , suggesting that migration and education may be complementary rather than substitute forms of investing in human capital.\nThis complementarity becomes clear when looking at high school leavers and college graduates. The period immediately before or after a lengthy investment in human capital is when migration propensity is at its peak. High school leavers use migration as a way to select the best higher education institution, hence maximizing their investment in human capital. College graduates use migration to find the best job matching their acquired human capital, hence maximizing its returns.\nWhile several contributions from Europe (Faggian and McCann 2009 and Faggian et al. 2007a , b, 2013 for the UK; Venhorst et al. 2010 Venhorst et al. , 2011 for the Netherlands; Iammarino and Marinelli 2011 , Marinelli 2012 , and Dotti et al. 2012 for Italy; Haapanen and Tervo 2006 for Finland) and more recently Australia (Corcoran et al. 2010 ) focused on student and graduate mobility, the contributions from the USA are still rather limited. Franklin (2003) shows that, in the case of the United States in the period covered by the 2000 Census, younger individuals (aged [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] ) with a college degree were much more mobile than their peers without a degree. This analysis, though, was at [3] the aggregate-not individual-level and focused on macro-level patterns of movement rather than individual determinants and consequences. This paper, using the SESTAT database by the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims at filling this gap in the US literature by studying the inter-state migration behavior of college graduates and its effects on their career. It builds on the existing literature not only by focusing specifically on the US context, but also incorporating into the empirical model a correction for the possible selection bias that arises from the (dual) relationship between migration propensity and the initial level of human capital.\nBy estimating Mincerian earning equations, augmented with migration variables, we find that indeed more migratory graduates have higher average salaries even after controlling for endogenous selection. As for the other control variables, our results are consistent with what has been found in the labor economics literature. Female workers suffer from a salary penalty, while experience, level of education and employer size are all associated with higher average salaries. The labor market also rewards different fields of study differently.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief literature review of the topic, followed by the empirical framework in Section 3. Section 4 describes the data and variables used in the analysis. Section 5 discusses the main results and finally Section 6 offers some concluding remarks and possible ways forward. Sjaastad (1962) was the first to acknowledge that migration can be considered an investment activity, which has costs and renders returns. Individuals who migrate are supposed to do so because they expect the returns from migration to outweigh the costs, at least in the long run."}, {"section_title": "THEORETICAL BACKGROUND", "text": "Following Hart (1975) , this can be formalized by equation (1). Assuming a potential migrant wants to move from region i to region j, the movement will occur only if the expected value of utility derived from the net present value of their expected returns (Ri) in the origin region i (origin) is less than that in the destination region j minus the costs associated with relocation (Cij): [4] { [ ](0)} < { [ ](0)} \u2212 { (0)}\nwhere the zero in parenthesis simply means that earnings and cost are evaluated at the present time (t = 0). As Sabot (1987) showed, there seems to be a positive interaction between education and migration, so that the net benefits of migrating for highly educated individuals are proportionately higher than those for less educated ones.\nThe reasons for such an interaction lie on both the returns and costs sides. On the returns side, migration allows educated individuals to find a better job match to fully exploit their skills (see Harmon et al., 2000; Di Cintio and Grassi, 2013; Jewell and Faggian, 2014) . On the costs side, education makes individuals more capable of finding and processing information (DaVanzo, 1983) , less reliant on the support network of family and friends-hence reducing their psychological moving costs (DaVanzo and Morrison, 1981 )-and more adaptable to new living conditions and cultural environment (Levy and Wadycki, 1974) . Moreover, there is also a considerable learning process in migrating.\nYoung adults who migrate away from home to get an education, are more likely to move again after graduating. Faggian et al. (2007a, b) show that, in the UK, previous migration (away from the parental domicile to university location) is one of the strongest predictors for subsequent migration (from university to job location). Murphy-Lejeune (2002) uses the idea of mobility capital to describe how students with mobility experience develop a taste for it and, as a result, they are much more likely to work in a different location later on in life.\nThe complex relationship between education and migration makes it difficult to exactly disentangle the effects of migration on individual welfare (e.g. measured by labor income). The problem of self-selection is crucial. If individuals with a higher migration propensity are also the ones with higher innate abilities and skills, then returns to migration could be over-estimated in a traditional model that does not correct for this. Roy (1951) was the first to acknowledge the problem of self-selection of individuals into different occupations according to their skills. In the late 70s, 80s the idea of selfselection became more common in the labor economics literature (Willis and Rosen, 1979;  [5] Heckman and Sedlacek 1985) . However, it was not until the Borjas' 1987 paper published in the American Economic Review that the idea was applied to (international) migration.\nBorjas presented a simple parametric two-sector Roy model to discuss the relationship between self-selection and the earnings of immigrants in the USA. His main insight was that people migrating from an origin country, say Mexico, to the USA are not randomly drawn from the population of that country. In deciding whether to migrate or not, each individual follows a maximization procedure comparing the net benefits at the origin and at destination. Three are the possible outcomes of the model: positive hierarchical sorting, negative hierarchical sorting and refugee sorting. Positive hierarchical sorting occurs when immigrants are (skill-wise) positively selected from the source country population distribution and hence they end up with above the mean earnings in the host country.\nNegative sorting is the opposite case. Refugee sorting is the special case where highly skilled individuals are discriminated in the origin country, and hence they are underperforming, but they end up with above mean earnings in the host country where they can exploit their full potential.\nFew years after his contribution on international migration, Borjas (1992) also applied the Roy theoretical framework to the study of internal migration in the USA.\nBorjas sees the Roy model as alternative to the Hicks-Sjaastad model in that \"the Hicks-"}, {"section_title": "Sjaastad model emphasizes the fact that mean income levels differ across regions, and these income differentials (net of migration costs) generate unidirectional migration", "text": "flows\", while the Roy model \"stresses regional differences in the returns to skills (as well as regional' differences in mean income)\" and they are ultimately these skill-price differentials that \"determine the skill composition of migration flows\" (p. 160). Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), he finds that individuals are more likely to migrate the greater is the mismatch between their skill endowments and the returns paid to skills in their native state. Moreover, skilled workers seem to benefit from locations with greater skill dispersion.\nWhile we agree with the Borjas' point that returns to skills, as emphasized by Roy, should take central stage in the study on internal migration flows, we are not in total agreement with him in seeing the Roy model as an alternative to the more traditional human capital migration model \u00e0 la Sjaastad (1962) . In fact, the two seem more [6] complementary than substitutable. Self-selection can be incorporated in a framework still based on the traditional human capital migration model. In this respect, our approach is similar to Abreu et al. (2015) , although their paper studied the joint effect of changing location and industry on graduate salaries, while we are focusing on the effect of migration.\nNot only we believe that migrants might have different characteristics than nonmigrants (that might affect also their future salary), but in addition we believe that different 'types' of migrations should also be distinguished. Following Faggian et al. (2007a, b) we classify graduates according to their 'sequential migration' behavior which is the result of two separate migration choices: the first one from domicile to university and the second one, after graduation, from university to first job location. The combination of these two migration decisions gives raise to five different 'sequential migration typologies' ( Figure   1 )."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Figure 1: Sequential migration typologies. Source: Jewell and Faggian (2014) Repeat migrants (RE) are the most migratory group changing location for both study and work purposes. Return migrants (RT) also move twice, but the second movement is to return to their original location. University 'stayer' (US) and late migrants (LM) are complementary to each other. The former move to study but then stay in the university location to enter the labor market; the latter do not move away to study, but then move away to work. Non-migrants (NM) never moved.\nThe basic hypothesis to be tested in this paper is whether a higher migration propensity is associated, on average, with higher salaries. Not only, by correcting for selectivity issues, we also want to test whether the higher salaries are truly a function of the willingness to move to find a more appropriate job or whether it is simply the case that the most migratory people are also the most capable. Previous studies from the UL (Jewell and Faggian, 2014) have shown that repeat and late migrants are the most successful in the labor market. However, they did not test for the issue of migrant self-selectivity.\nGenerally, migration studies classify individuals into migrants and non-migrants.\nHowever, this means that they do not distinguish between, repeat, return and late migrants -who all migrate to work-on one side and university stayers and non-migrants-who do not migrate to work-on the other. Several studies, going back to DaVanzo (1983) to the more recent work by Faggian et al. (2006 Faggian et al. ( , 2007a for the UK, show that repeat and return migrants, for instance, have different characteristics and salaries, so grouping them would conceal some interesting patterns."}, {"section_title": "EMPIRICAL STRATEGY", "text": "The theoretical work highlighting the importance of self-selection was pivotal for all the empirical work that followed. The Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979) and the use of instrumental variables for consistent estimation when endogeneity is present, were a response to the realization that self-selection (and endogeneity) could potentially create serious biases in results. However, one of the limitations of the standard Heckman selection model is that it assumes a dichotomous selection process. In the first stage individuals can only belong to one of two categories, 0 (non-participation) or 1 (participation) and their probability to belong to each category is estimated via a probit model. Deb and Trivedi's (2006) \"multinomial treatment effects model\" extends the Heckman model to allow for a multi-categorical (polychotomous) selection effect in the first stage.\n[8]\nWe apply the Deb and Trivedi's model to the case of migrant selection by estimating, in the first stage, each individual's choice among a set of possible mutually exclusive choices (\"treatment\"). In our case the choices are the five sequential migration categories (j=1,2,3,4,5): repeat migrant, return migrant, university stayer, late migrant and non-migrant. University stayer is selected as base category. The indirect utility (V) associated with the j-th treatment for the i-th individual can be expressed as:\nzi is a vector of exogenous variables (with the associated parameters \u03b1j and i.i.d. The probability of choosing a sequential migration category can be modeled as a mixed multinomial logit (MML):\nThe results from the first stage MML are then incorporated in the second stage outcome equation, in our case a Mincerian earning equation with the logarithm of annual salaries as dependent variable.\n2 2 Notice that, as Deb and Trivedi (2006) discuss, the model requires normalization restrictions on the scale of each choice and on the variance-covariance parameters. The last condition can be met\n, where is a vector of observable individual characteristics, are the dummy variables defining the migration choice (as before) and is the correction terms from the first stage.\nThe model parameters can be estimated using maximum simulated likelihood (MSL).

The base category is individuals which did not change either.\n[13]\nPrestigious occupations: Finally, we controlled for occupations which are normally linked to a certain social 'status', such as doctors, lawyers, astrophysicists etc. 4 We followed this approach, because research has shown that people, upon deciding which major to choose for college, they take into consideration expected earnings and certain occupations in society earn more on average (Arcidiacono et. al., 2012 , Berger, 1988 , Montmarquette et al., 2002 ."}, {"section_title": "Job field:", "text": "The NSF survey includes a series of dummy variables for certain fields of work such as: computers and applications, development and design, management and sales, applied research, and teaching.

While most of the variables included overlap with the variables describe above, some additional variables are also included. These variables, which are believed to influence the migratory behavior of individuals without directly affecting their final salary, allow us to identify the model. These are:\nParental education: Parental education not only affects the chances of an individual entering college, it might also affect the location of that college. First, individuals coming from a household of highly educated individuals are more likely to have the financial means to migrate to study if they so wish. Second, parents might try to send their children to the same institution they attended.\nChildren: the number of children is also strongly related to chances of migrating.\nIt might also affect salary but only through the effect on the hours worked (and we are restricting our analysis to full-time workers) and the occupation chosen (which we controlled for directly)\nPull-factors at college location: we also controlled for a series of characteristics of the college locations which might increase the chances of students migrating there.

Return migrants are only 5% of the sample. Females are 35% of the sample, which is comparable with other studies on STEM subjects (Cech et al., 2013) . The mean salary is about $ 77,420, which is higher than the average U.S. GDP per capita ($48,377) . 5 This was expected, as we are selecting individuals with very high levels of human capital.\nAs far as the field of study is concerned, 29% of the individuals was in social sciences, 24% in Biology/Agriculture/Environment, 16% in Physical and related sciences, 15% in Engineering, about 7% in Mathematics and Computer Science, about 6% in subjects related to science and engineering and only 2% in subjects not-related to science and engineering. Interestingly, the majority of graduates in our sample (72%), works for large employers with 500 or more employees. "}, {"section_title": "Main results", "text": "Results of our multi-treatment model (MNMT) are reported in Table 2 for both the whole sample (Model 1) and doctorate holders only (Model 2). Although we present the results for both the OLS and the MNMT, we will be focusing on the MNMT results as the exogeneity test (also reported in 1.5%). However, now both repeat migration and return migration are more favorable than non-migrating at all (7.1 and 7.6% respectively). While the coefficients on repeat migrants for doctorate holders conform with the findings by previous contributions, such as Jewell and Faggian (2014) for the UK, the result on late migrants is somewhat surprising. Late migration has been found to be the second most \"rewarding\" migration strategy after repeat migration in the UK, which is contrary to our results for the USA.\nTo check whether this was a context-specific problem or a selectivity issue we compared the results on Table 2 with standard OLS model not corrected for selectivity. While most of the results are the same for the selectivity-corrected and the uncorrected model, the coefficient on late migration is not significant anymore. This, together with the positive and significant coefficient of the late-migration selection term (\u03bb late-migrant), points to a positive hierarchical sorting \u00e0 la Borjas (1987) . In other words, the higher salary for late migrants is not due to late migration itself but to the self-sorting of the \"best\" [16] individuals into the late migrant group. The opposite seems to apply for Ph.D. holders who are either repeat or return migrants. Model 3 shows evidence of negative sorting (negative and significant coefficients on \u03bb for both repeat and return migrants). Although significant in both models, the selectivity-corrected salary differential for Ph.D. holders repeat migrants (around 7.1%) is higher than the uncorrected one (5.1%) meaning thatgiven their characteristics-migration is particularly beneficial to these individuals. found in other studies, although it is common to find higher values in STEM subjects than other subjects (Jewell and Faggian, 2014) . The salary penalty for women in STEM has been subject of discussion for quite few years, and several reports have been produced on the topic (e.g., Cech et al. 2013) . Surprisingly, ethnic minorities (Asians and Afro-American) are doing better than Caucasian in our sample. This is contrary to what is generally found for the whole population and it might mean that education (especially in more science-oriented topics) is particularly beneficial to these minorities. This result should be granted further investigation in the future because of its possible policy implications.\nAs for education-related variables, individuals graduating from one of the top 25\nhigher education institution are doing better in the labor market, with a salary about 6%\nhigher (and up to 6.7% for Ph.D. holders). This is consistent with both the human capital theory (better universities provide for a better education) and the signaling theory \u00e0 la Spence (1971) which points to the fact that employers take a degree from a more prestigious university as a \"signal\" for higher individual abilities. Also, consistent with the human capital theory, are the results on the highest degree achieved. Masters, Ph.D.s\nand Professional all have a salary premium over Bachelors and it is a substantial one (going from 22.1% for Masters to an astounding 51.2% for professionals). As for the subject studied, all subjects do better than social sciences, except physical sciences (negative coefficient but significant at 10. Also in the line of the human capital theory is the higher salary (by about 3.5%) of individuals who benefitted from governmental funds. As stated previously, only the best students are selected for these grants, so they can be seen as another signal for their abilities.\nLastly, the job-related controls show an advantage of working in industry vis-\u00e0-vis academia. Russo (2010) finds that salaries in academia are on average 30% less than those in industry in North America. Similarly, we find that working in industry pays about 13.2% more, and working in academia about 18.1% less, than working in the [20] governmental sector. So the difference between academia and industry can be estimated as about 31%, even after controlling for all the other factors included in our model.\nPrestigious occupations offer an extra \"reward\" of about 3% although only significant at 10% significance level. As for employer size, it seems that the bigger the better. The salary monotonically increases with the size of the company, with the largest employers (more than 500 employees) giving, on average, an annual salary about 45.6% higher than small companies with less than 25 employees. Different reasons might be behind this result. Small firms are much less likely than large firms to provide their employees and their managers with formal training (Storey, 2004) . There might also be some peer and learning effects (Cornelissen et al., 2013) . Among the different sectors, teaching is the lowest paid, while management and sales, development and design and applied research are paid the most. Finally, keeping the same type of job is associated with a wage premium, while changing sector gives a salary penalty (at least in the short-run. This is compatible with the idea that some of the human capital accumulated during the working life is \"specific\", i.e., it cannot be transferred to other jobs or sectors and hence is not rewarded."}, {"section_title": "First-stage results", "text": "First-stage results are reported in \"Appendix\" (Table 4 Although we are not entering in a detailed discussion of the sign and magnitude of the independent variables, most results follow expectations. For example, black\nAmericans are less likely to be repeat, late migrants or university stayers than nonmigrants. On the opposite, parental education increases the likelihood of being repeatmigrants (hence having a higher migration propensity) and so does have governmental support or being older. These factors reduce the financial constraints that might hamper a migration movement. Also worth noting is that female graduates are less likely to be repeat or late migrants. While Faggian et al. (2007a, b) found the same result for late [21] migration in the UK, they also found that female graduates were actually more likely to be repeat migrants than their male counterpart. However, their sample was restricted to very young individuals who were interviewed only 6 months after graduations. As such, family commitment and the dual-body problems were not affecting their results nearly as much. Another interesting result is that Ivy League schools are less likely to produce university stayers, i.e., graduates who stay locally after finishing their degree.\nThis result is also in line with the findings for the UK that more prestigious universities cater for the whole country and not just the local labor market. As such, their graduates are the most mobile."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our study represents a first attempt to shed light on the phenomenon of sequential graduate migration in the USA and its relationship with labor market success. While several studies on the topic have been published in Europe, little is known for the USA still.\nBy using a multi-treatment model to correct for possible selectivity issues, we assess the effect of the two combined migration decisions, i.e. migrating to study and migrating to work, on the annual average salary of degree holders. We found that different migration behaviors are associated with either a salary increase or a salary penalty.\nSpecifically, repeat migrants have a salary premium of about 6% while late migrants a salary penalty of over 16%. This holds after controlling for possible hierarchical sorting \u00e0 la Borjas (1987) . In fact, we find that selectivity or sorting does matter. The correction factors in the multi-treatment model are significant for all the migration categories, although the strongest for repeat and late migrants. In particular, we found that late migrants suffer from positive hierarchical sorting, while repeat migrants suffer from negative hierarchical sorting. As such, repeat migrants are doing better, and late migrants much worse, than what expected without a control for selectivity.\nDespite being just an initial analysis, the current contribution opens up the way for a series of future extensions with important policy implications. Firstly, the issue of gender differences should be addressed more specifically. It would be interesting to see [22] if gender-specific multi-treatment models give different results on the significant parameters and whether the optimal migration strategies are different between the two genders. The same can be said with regard to ethnicity. One of the most counter-intuitive results of our analysis is that ethnic minorities do better than other ethnic groups once selectivity is corrected for. This is contrary to what previously found in the literature for the general population (i.e., not just highly educated individuals) and without selectivity-correction. If highly-educated individuals belonging to ethnic minorities manage to more than compensate for possible discriminatory factors, this would be good news for the proponents of education as a means for upper social mobility.\nAll in all, the link between migration and career paths of highly educated individuals is of paramount importance not only for individuals but also for regional economic performance and more studies are needed on the topic in North America.
