A review of 8 studies in 6 countries [1] found a global prevalence of 7.1% (95% CI 6.8-7.4) in people aged 65 years and older, with rates being twice as high in the illiterate versus literate population. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for most cases of dementia. Similar results are published for Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela in a review done in developing countries by the world federation research group [2] . In Chile, the reported prevalence of dementia in the SABE study was 8.1% in the total sample, with higher rates among women (8.9%) compared to men (6.9%) and 22 .8% in illiterate women [3] . In a representative sample of older urban Chileans, the rates were 7.3% in the total sample but 25.5% among people aged 80 years and older [4] .\nSeveral epidemiological longitudinal studies have shown that obesity in midlife is a risk factor for dementia [5, 6] . Obesity may increase the risk of cognitive impairment by actions at both central and peripheral levels. Vascular health and neurodegeneration have been linked to insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation, dyslipidemia and diabetes, especially for its effect on the brain microcirculation. However, new hypotheses have recently arisen, linking adipose tissue to this association [7] . Although the mechanisms are not clearly elucidated, various pathways mediated by the action of adipokines in certain brain regions have been proposed.\nGrowing evidence on the effect of leptin is emerging. Experimental studies show that leptin modulates structural and functional changes in the hippocampus and improves memory. In leptin-deficient rats, lower brain volume and disruption of hypothalamic pathways have been demonstrated [8] . More importantly, in vitro studies have shown that infusion of leptin reduces \u03b2-amyloid secretion and leptin treatment in leptin-deficient rats reduces levels of \u03b2-amyloid in the brain [9, 10] . Leptin reduces the activity of \u03b2-secretase and increases the APOE-dependent uptake of \u03b2-amyloid in neurons [11] . Paradoxically, leptin levels are increased in obesity, and in accordance with experimental studies in rats, leptin also increases with aging [12] [13] [14] .\nThe actions of leptin are mediated by the leptin receptor (OB-R) belonging to the family of class I cytokine receptors [15, 16] . There are leptin receptors in hypothalamic neurons and neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus [17] . Furthermore, the presence of a soluble receptor (sOB-R), which represents the main leptin binding activity, has been demonstrated in peripheral blood [18, 19] and reflects the density of the membrane OB-R [20] .\nThe maintenance of high levels of adiposity besides high leptin levels suggests an alteration of leptin action in obese older adults. Leptin resistance would be produced by an alteration of transport across the blood-brain barrier or intrinsic resistance of the sensitive neurons of the hypothalamus, hippocampus and other brain regions [21] . Therefore, the determination of leptin resistance is crucial to study the association between leptin and dementia. Leptin resistance has been studied by the free leptin index (FLI) highlighting the importance of leptin availability for leptin action.\nIn this context, the current study estimated the independent contribution of leptin availability for developing dementia."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Follow-up of the subjects recruited for the Santiago de Chile SABE study [22] and the ALEXANDROS study was designed to study the trajectories of disability associated with obesity in older Chileans [23] .

Mean age was 60 years (SD 3.3 years), 8 .7% of the sample lived alone and 60% had less than 8 years of education, which was similar in both men and women. A high proportion of the sample was obese, with rates being higher in women [37.9% (33.33-42.37 )] compared to men [26.5% (20.13-32.90) ]. The frequency of hypertension was 46.5%, that of diabetes was 16.5% and that of depression was 29.6%, similar in both men and women.\nLeptin and sOB-R levels were higher in women (leptin 27.26 \u00b1 15.58 ng/ml; sOB-R 37.55 \u00b1 22.7 ng/ml) than in men (leptin 11.31 \u00b1 9.04 ng/ml; sOB-R 26.858 \u00b1 15.87 ng/ml; p < 0.001). FLI and adiponectin were also higher in women than in men (0.999 \u00b1 0.925 vs. 0.564 \u00b1 0.557, p < 0.001, and 12.91 \u00b1 5.3 vs. 29.14 \u00b1 3.59 ng/ml, p < 0.001).\nAs of June 30, 2015, the incident cases of dementia were 42 (64.3% women) out of 667. The mean age of the cases was higher than that of noncases (67.4 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 65.88 \u00b1 3.02 years, p < 0.01), with a higher proportion having <8 years of education among the subjects with dementia versus those without dementia (83.3 vs. 59.3%, p = 0.02) as shown in table 2 .\nLeptin concentration was not different between the groups; however, sOB-R was higher in subjects with dementia compared to those without dementia (44.94 \u00b1 23.97 vs. 33.73 \u00b1 21.13 ng/ml, p = 0.0012) and FLI was lower in demented compared to nondemented subjects (0.69 \u00b1 0.86 vs. 0.88 \u00b1 0.85, p = 0.081). No differences between the demented and nondemented group were observed regarding hypertension or diabetes at baseline, although the proportion of depression at baseline was higher among incident cases compared to noncases. Differences in nutritional state were observed mainly in the proportion of people with a BMI <20 among the incident cases ( table 2 ) .\nIn table 3 , the plasma leptin, sOB-R and FLI concentration by BMI and waist circumference categories are shown.

Neither obesity, measured by BMI or waist circumference, hypertension nor diabetes were related to greater odds of dementia; however, depression at baseline remained a significant risk factor (hazard ratio = 4.33; 95% CI 1.94-7.49) for dementia. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this cohort study of community-living people aged 60 years and older in Santiago de Chile, we found that low leptin availability -represented by a high sOB-R and a high FLI -is a risk factor for dementia. sOB-R, the stronger binding activity of leptin, has been shown to modulate plasma leptin [28] regulating the bioavailability of free leptin.\nThe neuroprotective action of leptin has been demonstrated in animal models and has been ascribed to leptin's role in neuroprotection and neurogenesis in the hippocampus [29] . On the other hand, a disorder in leptin signaling at the hippocampus has been observed in AD patients by the same authors. The 8 years of follow-up of the Framingham cohort have shown that leptin is inversely related to AD and directly associated with markers of brain health [30] .\nParadoxically, a number of epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity, characterized by high levels of circulating levels of leptin [31] , increases the risk of dementia and is associated with damage of the brain structure and a decrease in the brain volume [30] . In the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [32] , the authors have shown that a high BMI is associated with a faster decline in memory and executive function over time. However, longitudinal studies are not conclusive. A study carried out in men in Australia looking for an association with incident AD [33] did not find an association. Insights for these apparent contradictory results are highlighted by the study of the trajectories of dementia by BMI over time in the cardiovascular health study [5] where midlife obesity was associated with higher dementia risk but BMI after 65 years was inversely related with incident dementia. Concordant results were obtained in a twin study [34] conducted in Sweden among 8,534 twins aged 65 years and older, where overweight and obesity at midlife independently increased the risk of AD and vascular dementia. Similar results were observed in a 27-year follow-up study conducted among 10,276 people registered in a health care delivery organization from California [6] , where obesity in midlife increased the risk of dementia independently of comorbid conditions.\nWe did not find an association between dementia and obesity measured by BMI or waist circumference. The Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) [35] found a lower risk of cognitive impairment in relation to high levels of leptin at the 10-year follow-up only in people with no abdominal obesity but not in subjects with a large waist circumference (men >40 in; women >35 in). However, our results are concordant with the higher availability of free leptin in people without dementia in both obese and nonobese subjects. The higher FLI and lower leptin sOB-R concentrations in obese people than in normal or underweight subjects mean that in this cohort the obese were not leptin resistant. Moreover, in the same cohorts, obese participants have higher survival and lower disability than normal and underweight subjects [36, 37] . On the other hand, among the incident cases of dementia, we found a significantly higher proportion of low weight at baseline compared to subjects who did not develop dementia. This finding is similar to what has been found in some studies showing a weight decrease preceding the appearance of AD [6] and in people with incipient AD [38] , suggesting that the weight decrease is another sign of early brain dysfunction. A limitation of our study is that the diagnosis of dementia was done with a screening test [26] ; therefore, it is possible that some people with incipient dementia were not detected at baseline. However, the screening test has proved to have high sensitivity and specificity and is used in many Latin American countries for population studies [22] .\nAnother limitation is that we do not have obesity data at midlife; therefore, we are unable to determine if earlier obesity is a risk factor for dementia. The longitudinal design and the length of the follow-up (15 years) are the principal strengths of the study.\nThe relationship between obesity and dementia is complex, considering that both obesity and aging are associated with pathophysiological changes through which brain damage can be caused. Although we did not find an association between obesity and dementia, other studies in younger cohorts are needed to assess the effect of demographic origin on that association. The huge lifestyle changes of the Latin American population that have occurred in the past three decades [39] , with a high prevalence of obesity and sedentary behavior in all age groups [40] , should have important implications for the future health of an aging society with an increasing burden of dementia, in which the prevalence of obesity and overweight reaches almost half of the population.\nAlthough it was not the focus of the current research, this study confirms the importance of depression in older people. The fourfold adjusted risk of dementia in people with depression at baseline compared with people not having depression highlights the importance to detect and treat depression in older people."}]
