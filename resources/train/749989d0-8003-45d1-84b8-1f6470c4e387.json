[5] [6] [7] [8] However, the percentage of elementary students that usually walked or biked to school decreased from 49% in 1969 to 13% in 2009. 9 The \"walking school bus\" (WSB) approach encourages groups of children to walk to and from school along a fixed route with an adult chaperone; such programs have been well-received by parents and community members 10 and nonexperimental studies have shown improved physical activity outcomes for WSB programs. 11, 12 Recently, the first randomized controlled trial of the WSB model showed that the program significantly increased 4th graders' accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily and the percentage of trips made by active commuting. 13 To date, no studies have examined the nationwide prevalence of school-organized WSB programs, nor the factors associated with such programs. This study assessed the prevalence of WSB programs in public elementary schools and examined whether programs varied by demographics, district policies related to safe, active routes to school, and state laws that facilitate walking to school. We hypothesized that WSB programs would be more common where relevant district policies and state laws supported safe and active transportation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "These analyses use data gathered during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school years. Data were collected at the school level, district level, and state level. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"section_title": "School-Level Data Collection", "text": "Surveys were mailed to the principal at each school with a request that the survey be completed by the principal or other staff with knowledge of school practices pertaining to student health. Surveys were gathered primarily during the second-half of each school year, between January and June. A $100 incentive was offered to the respondent or school for returning the survey. Survey response rates were 61.8% Survey Measures. The survey was developed to evaluate topics relevant to childhood obesity and specific items were created by the research team based on a review of existing literature. To assess school-organized WSB programs, 1 survey item asked \"does your school organize a walking school bus where children walk to school together?\" with a yes/no response. Prior research has indicated that a variety of factors are barriers to active commuting, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] thus, a set of 7 Likert-type items asked respondents to indicate to what extent each of the following barriers may prevent 3rd-grade students from walking/biking to school: 1) school is too far away, 2) traffic danger, 3) bad weather, 4) crime, 5) lack of sidewalks, 6) no bike racks, and 7) no crossing guards. Items were anchored to the 3rd grade because of the likelihood that some issues (eg, traffic danger or distance) may be more of a barrier for younger children. Response options were 1 = not at all, 2 = to a little extent, 3 = to some extent, 4 = to a great extent, and 5 = to a very great extent. The distribution on these items was not normal (ie, for several variables, more than 50% of cases responded \"not at all\"), so items were collapsed to binary variables where 1 = to a great or a very great extent, versus 0 = not at all, to a little extent, or to some extent.\nSchool Sampling and Weighting. The nationally representative samples were developed at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, using sampling frames based on datasets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Because elementary schools vary in grade composition (eg, K-3rd grade, 2nd-5th grade), all schools were required to include a 3rd grade. Public schools from all contiguous U.S. states were eligible for sampling. School weights were adjusted for potential nonresponse bias by modeling every school's propensity to respond. Data were weighted to provide inference to US public elementary schools.\nSchool Contextual Factors. To control for school-level factors that could confound the associations between school policies and district policy or state law, schoollevel demographic data were obtained from the NCES Common Core of Data for the corresponding school year."}, {"section_title": "District-Level Policies", "text": "At the district level, congressionally mandated school district wellness policies and other relevant policies were collected via internet searches with telephone/e-mail follow-up to verify complete policy collection and to obtain policies, if they existed, that were not available online. District policies were obtained or verified to not exist, respectively across the 2 years, in 99.3%, and 97.0%, of all schools that returned surveys. Districts were considered to have a policy for a given school year if it was in effect as of the day after Labor Day (proxy for the first day of the school year). Two trained coders independently assessed and then compared whether the policy addressed safe and active routes to school. The WSB model was one type of policy provision that districts included as examples of policies addressing safe, active routes to school. In cases where the 2 coders did not agree, they met to discuss the policy and, if consensus could not reached, a third coder (policy lead for the project and a study coauthor) made a final decision. The policies were coded using an ordinal coding scheme as follows: required (coded as a 2), encouraged (coded as a 1), and not addressed (coded as a 0). Due to the limited prevalence of the policies on this topic, for these analyses the policy variable was collapsed to compare strong policies (1) versus weak policies or no policy (0).\nState-Level Laws. State statutory and administrative (regulatory) laws (hereafter collectively referred to as \"state laws\") were compiled by UIC researchers using primary legal research techniques. 19, 20 State laws were obtained through keyword searches using the state law databases available by subscription from commercial legal research services, Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis. The statutory indices and the table of contents for the statutes and administrative laws for each state also were reviewed to ensure complete capture from the keyword searches. State laws effective as of January 1 for 2009 (for 2008-2009 school year data) and 2010 (for 2009-2010 school year data) were reviewed to determine whether they required or encouraged: 1) sidewalks to be maintained or constructed around schools; 2) crossing guards around schools; 3) traffic control measures (eg, speed humps, traffic calming devices) around schools; and/or 4) speed zones around schools. Where required, laws were coded as 2; where encouraged or suggested, laws were coded as 1; and where not addressed, laws were coded as 0. For these analyses, each variable was collapsed into a binary variable to compare required (1) versus not required or no law (0)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Analyses were conducted in STATA/SE v10.0 and accounted for the clustering of schools within districts and states.\nRelationships between state law, district policy, and the presence of a walking school bus program (WSB) were examined with a series of multivariate logistic regression models including dummy variables to control for covariates of school size, race/ethnicity, percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, locale, region, and year of data collection. First, district policy was included in a model alone (with covariates) to predict presence of a WSB. Second, each of the 4 state law variables was entered separately (with covariates). Third, each of the 7 school-level administrator-perceived barriers was entered separately (with covariates). Finally, a model containing demographic covariates and all other variables that were significant (at P < .05) was tested. Results are presented only from this final model. When entered alone in a logistic regression (with covariates), district policy was significantly associated with the presence of a WSB program (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.07-6.99, P < .05). When entered alone, having a state law pertaining to crossing guards around schools was significantly associated with the presence of a school-organized WSB program (OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.39-5.88, P < .01), but none of the other state law variables were significant. None of the administratorperceived barriers were significant. In the final model (see Table 1 ), district policy regarding safe active routes to school and state law requiring crossing guards were both significantly associated with school-organized WSB programs (Ps < .05)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Several demographic characteristics were significant in the final model. Adjusting for other covariates, school-organized WSB programs were more common in the Northeast (OR = 2.94, P < .01) and the West (OR = 2.79, P < .01) versus the South. Rural schools were significantly less likely to organize a WSB than were urban schools (OR = .27, P < .05), and schools with a majority of Latino students were significantly less likely to organize a WSB than were schools with predominantly White students (OR = 0.22, P < .05)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Although school-organized WSB programs are a relatively new and uncommon approach to encouraging active commuting, these programs are increasing in prevalence. As of 2009-2010, 6.2% of public elementary schools nationwide organized a WSB. This is lower than the prevalence of elementary school participation in other programs designed to increase children's active transportation, such as Safe Routes to School (SRTS); in 2007 to 08, 15% of public elementary students attended a school that participated in SRTS or a similar program. 21 In 2009-2010, school-organized WSB programs were significantly more common in the Northeast (10.4% of schools) and West (7.9%) compared with the South (2.9%). Programs were less common at majority Latino schools than at predominantly White schools (1.8% vs. 8.3% in 2009-2010) .\nFew states had laws requiring crossing guards, traffic calming, or construction of sidewalks near schools; however, having a state law requiring crossing guards was positively associated with having a school-organized WSB. Schools in states with a law requiring crossing guards had more than twice the odds of organizing a WSB than did schools in states without a law. This is consistent with work showing that crossing guards can facilitate or inhibit walking and/or biking to school. 14, 22 Furthermore, it is consistent with prior research examining linkages between state laws and school practices that found that having state laws requiring crossing guards increased the odds of schools allowing all students to bike to school, and reduced the odds of schools reporting that no students walk/bike to school. 23 District policy pertaining to safe and active transportation was significantly and positively associated with the odds of schools organizing a WSB. Even after controlling for state law, having a strong district policy was associated with a more than doubling of the odds of organizing a WSB.\nAdministrator perceptions regarding barriers to active transportation were not significantly associated with whether schools organized a WSB. Despite the significant association between WSB programs and laws pertaining to crossing guards, the school-level variable regarding lack of crossing guards as a perceived barrier to active commuting was not associated with WSB programs. Although weather, crime, distance and other issues have been reported as perceived barriers to active commuting, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] these were not associated with schools organizing a WSB. Distance is likely a contributor to the significantly lower prevalence of WSBs in rural schools, because catchment areas tend to be larger in rural schools.\nThere are limitations to this study. As with any selfreport survey, there is the potential for response bias, although we do not expect that this was particularly problematic for the walking/biking-related questions given that we pretested the survey to verify comprehension, face validity, clarity and feasibility of completing the questions. The wording of the survey item addressed WSB programs organized by the school; programs organized by outside groups or parents may have been excluded, resulting in an underestimation of the prevalence of WSB programs. In addition, the WSB definition involves adult chaperones to accompany children to and from school, but the survey item did not include this specification, thus it is possible that child-only groups may have been incorrectly considered as WSB programs.\nThis was a cross-sectional analysis and, as such, we cannot infer that state laws or district policies caused schools to organize a WSB; however, given that the laws did not change over the 2 years, we would not expect the results to change markedly with a longitudinal design. The prevalence of strong district policies pertaining to safe and active transportation did not change over the 2 years, and the significant association between district policies and school practices suggests that schools may be organizing WSB programs as a way to meet these requirements.\nNonexperimental intervention studies have shown positive outcomes for WSB programs. 11, 12 Furthermore, the first randomized controlled trial of a WSB recently demonstrated substantial and significant increases in children's active commuting to school and minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; 13 therefore, these programs hold promise for promoting physical activity. Some evidence suggests that long-term sustainability may be a challenge for WSB programs 24 because of the need for adult chaperones to accompany children on the way to school; however, an evaluation of parent satisfaction with WSB programs suggests much enthusiasm for the strategy. 10 Given epidemic rates of childhood obesity, and the promise of WSB programs, state lawmakers and school boards are advised to consider the potential of state laws and district policies in promoting active transportation to school."}]
