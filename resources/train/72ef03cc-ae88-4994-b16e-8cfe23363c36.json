This report is the third in a series based on findings about young children's early experiences with school from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the ECLS-K selected a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the fall of 1998 and is following these children through the spring of fifth grade. The study collects information directly from the children, their families, teachers, and schools. The full ECLS-K base-year sample is comprised of approximately 22,000 children who attended about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year. The first two reports, America's Kindergartners (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000) and The Kindergarten Year (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001), provided a national picture of the knowledge and skills of children at kindergarten entry and across the kindergarten year. Both reports revealed that while first-time kindergartners are similar in many ways, their knowledge and skills differ in relation to their age at school entry, race/ethnicity, health status, home educational experiences, and child care histories. This report presents a picture of these children as first-graders.' The first two reports laid the foundation for a basic understanding of children's achievement across the kindergarten year. This report continues the story by providing information about children's knowledge and skills in the first-grade year. The report looks at children's school performance in terms of their reading and mathematical knowledge and skills. To address the multifaceted nature of children's development, this report relates children's reading and mathematical knowledge and skills to child, family, and school characteristics. Whereas prior reports (i.e., The Kindergarten Year) specifically addressed the gains children made in reading and mathematics across the school year, this report will focus more on the status of children's reading and mathematics achievement in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. Taking a broad view of child development, the report explores how children's literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status at kindergarten entry relate to their spring kindergarten and first grade reading and mathematics knowledge and skills. First-graders refers to first-time kindergartners who were promoted to first grade in the fall of 1999.

Recognizing numbers (i.e., math skills) and recognizing letters (i.e., reading skills) both represent a child's ability to understand that symbols have meaning.

The report uses data from the ECLS-K to address the following questions: What reading and mathematics knowledge and skills do children demonstrate in the spring of first grade? Do children's knowledge and skills differ by certain child, family, and school characteristics? What is the relationship of children's early literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status as they enter kindergarten to their spring kindergarten and first grade reading and mathematics achievement? In particular, how do the following resources relate to children's spring kindergarten and spring first-grade achievement: proficiency in recognizing letters, being read to at least three times a week, proficiency in recognizing numbers and basic shapes, proficiency in the mathematical concept of relative size, demonstrating a positive approach to learning often or very often, and being in very good to excellent general health? vi What reading and mathematics knowledge and skills do children demonstrate in the spring offirst grade? Do children's knowledge and skills differ by certain child, family, and school characteristics? What Children Know When children begin kindergarten, 67 percent recognize their letters. By the spring of kindergarten, most (95 percent) know the letters of the alphabet; and after 2 years of school, essentially all children (100 percent) can recognize the letters of the alphabet. At kindergarten entry, about one-third (31 percent) of children understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning of words and about one in six children (18 percent) understand the letter-sound relationship at the end of words. By the spring of kindergarten, about three-quarters (74 percent) of children make the letter-sound connection at the beginning of words and just over half (54 percent) of children make this connection at the ending of words. By the spring of first grade, almost all children have mastered these reading skills (98 and 94 percent, respectively) (figure A). By the spring of first grade, about five in six children (83 percent) recognize common words by sight (sight words), and about one-half (48 percent) of children understand words in context (compared to 14 and 4 percent, respectively, in the spring of kindergarten) (figure A, table 1). viil 0 Estimates reflect children assessed in English in all three rounds of data collection and who entered kindergarten for the first time in the fall of 1998 and were promoted to first grade in the fall of 1999.

What Children Know, by Child, Family, and School Characteristics Differences in children's achievement (as represented by their overall achievement score) by their family's poverty status, race/ethnicity, and school type persist from kindergarten through the spring of first grade. However, children's overall reading and mathematics achievement does not vary by their sex (tables 3 and 4). Differences (or lack of differences) in overall achievement scores only tell part of the story. Another way to think about how certain child and family characteristics relate to their spring achievement is in terms of children's acquisition of specific reading and mathematics knowledge and skills. Whether or not certain groups of children acquire certain skills or sets of skills may add meaning to an overall achievement score difference."}, {"section_title": "ix", "text": "In terms of specific first-grade reading and mathematics skills and knowledge, females are more likely to recognize words by sight and understand words in context than males. Males and females are equally likely to be adding and subtracting; but, in the spring of first grade, males are more likely than females to solve problems that require multiplication and division. Simply stated, by the spring of first grade, females are more likely to be reading and males are more likely to be successful at advanced mathematical operations (i.e., multiplication and division) (tables 1 and 2). When considering the poverty status of children's families from the kindergarten year, first-graders from nonpoor families are more likely to recognize words by sight than first-graders from poor families. The same is true for addition and subtraction. Moreover, about twice as many first-graders from nonpoor families are proficient at understanding words in context and performing multiplication and division as first-graders from poor families (tables 1 and 2). There are also differences by children's race/ethnicity. White children are more likely than Black or Hispanic children to recognize words by sight, understand words in context, solve addition and subtraction problems, and solve multiplication and division problems by the spring of first grade. Asian children are more likely than Black or Hispanic children to recognize words by sight, understand words in context, and solve multiplication and division problems. In the spring of first grade, Hispanic children are more likely than Black children to demonstrate proficiency in these particular reading and mathematics areas (tables 1 and 2). What is the relationship of children's early literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status as they enter kindergarten to their spring kindergarten and first grade reading and mathematics achievement? Children who recognize their letters, who are read to at least three times a week, who recognize their basic numbers and shapes, and who demonstrate an understanding of the mathematical concept of relative size as they enter kindergarten demonstrate significantly higher overall reading and mathematics knowledge and skills (in terms of an overall scale score) in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade than children who do not have these resources. The same pattern is true for children who frequently demonstrate a positive approach to learning and who are in very good to excellent health as they enter kindergarten (tables 6 and 7). An analysis of the specific skills children acquire shows that children who recognize their letters, who are read to at least three times a week, who recognize their basic numbers and shapes, and who demonstrate an understanding of the mathematical concept of relative size as they enter kindergarten are more likely to understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words, read words by sight, and understand words in context by the spring of first grade (figure C, table 8). In mathematics, children who recognize their letters, who are read to at least three times a week, who recognize their basic numbers, and shapes, and who demonstrate an understanding of the mathematical concept of relative size as they enter kindergarten are more likely to understand the mathematical concept of ordinality and sequence, successfully solve addition and subtraction problems, and successfully solve multiplication and division problems.

Children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills that differ by child, family, and school characteristics at the beginning of kindergarten persist into the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. The findings in this report also suggest the beginnings of differences in children's reading and mathematics performance by their sex. By the spring of first grade, females are more likely to be reading, whereas males are more likely to be proficient at advanced mathematics (i.e., multiplication and division). The longitudinal nature of the ECLS-K will enable researchers to track these differences in terms of children's third and fifth grade reading and mathematics performance. Children who begin kindergarten with certain resources seem to be at an advantage. Children who demonstrate early literacy skills and who come from a positive literacy environment, who possess a positive approach to learning, and who enjoy very good or excellent general health seem to perform better xi i 1 5 after 1 and even 2 years of formal schooling than children who do not have these resources. Specifically, these children perform better in spring kindergarten and spring first-grade reading and mathematics. This third report from the ECLS-K, in conjunction with America's Kindergartners and The Kindergarten Year, provides descriptive information on young children's achievement across kindergarten and first grade. The ECLS-K will continue to follow these children into third and fifth grades. The study will provide researchers not only with an understanding of how children's early literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status at kindergarten entry shape their later achievement but also of how these resources need to be maintained and further developed for continued scholastic success. The valuable information collected through this study will help us better understand the early education and elementary school experience of our nation's children.  Children's Reading and Mathematics Achievement   in Kindergarten and First Grade Children's experiences with school are almost as varied as the children themselves. Children's early education sets the tone for their later learning. Therefore, it is important to capture information on children's initial interactions with school; that is, their kindergarten and first grade years. This report is the third in a series based on findings about young children's early experiences with school from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). The ECLS-K is a multisource, multimethod study that focuses on children's early education beginning with kindergarten. The design of the ECLS-K has been guided by a framework of children's development and schooling that emphasizes the interaction between the child and family, the child and school, the family and school, and the family, school, and community. The ECLS-K includes measures of children's health status, socioemotional, and student achievement and their family, school/classroom, and community environments. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the ECLS-K selected a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the fall of 1998 and is following these children through the spring of fifth grade. The study collects information directly from the children, their families, teachers, and schools. The full ECLS-K base-year sample is comprised of approximately 22,000 children who attended about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year. The first report, America's Kindergartners (West, Denton and Germino Hausken 2000), provided a national picture of the knowledge and skills of beginning kindergartners. It revealed that while first-time kindergartners are similar in many ways, differences exist in their knowledge and skills in relation to their age at school entry, race/ethnicity, health status, home educational experiences, and child care histories. The differences found at school entry were consistent with the differences in other national studies of older children (e.g., National Assessment of Educational Progress, National Education Longitudinal Study of 1998). The Kindergarten Year (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001), the second report, showed that children considered at-risk for school failure acquired many of the basic skills in reading and mathematics during their first year of school that they did not have when they began the kindergarten year. Consequently, by the spring of kindergarten, the majority of these children knew their letters, numbers, and shapes; about half made the connection between letter and sound at the beginning of words; and almost three-quarters ' understood the mathematical concept of relative size (e.g., out of two objects, identify which object is longer). However, these same children fell behind their more advantaged classmates. Specifically, across the kindergarten year, the gap between disadvantaged children and other children widened in more . advanced reading (e.g., recognizing words by sight) and mathematics skills (e.g., adding and subtracting). This report, the third in the series, opens with a picture of these same children as first-graders. Reading to children is shown to have a positive effect on children's literacy outcomes (Denton, Reaney, and West 2001;Snow, Burns and Griffin 1998). Through experience with books, children gain important exposure to written language. They begin making connections between the spoken word and the printed word (Beck and Juel 1999). Policymakers contend that it is important to read to your child (Lyon 1999). America's Kindergartners (West et al. 2000) provided important information about the frequency with which the average parent reads to his/her young child. About 45 percent of parents report reading to their children every day, whereas 80 percent of parents report reading to their children at least three times a week. Do children who are read to at least three times a week perform better in kindergarten and first grade than children who are read to less than three times a week? In addition to their emergent reading skills (i.e., recognizing letters) and exposure to literacy activities (i.e., being read to), children who understand their numbers and shapes are on the road to math literacy. It is important to note that math is not simply about numbers and numerical mathematical operatidns. Mathematics knowledge and skills also include the ability to draw inferences, see relationships and reason logically (National Research Council 1989). Consequently, young children who possess an understanding of numbers, shapes and a basic ability to conceptualize objects as they enter kindergarten may be at an advantage in terms of both their reading and mathematics learning. America's Kindergartners (West et al. 2000) revealed that the majority of children recognized basic numbers and shapes as they entered kindergarten and about three in five understood the concept of relative size (e.g., comparing nonstandard units of measure). Consequently, does the ability to recognize basic numbers and shapes and the mastery of the concept relative size relate to children's spring reading and mathematics achievement in kindergarten and first grade?\nAs children enter kindergarten for the first time, they bring with them different sets of knowledge and skills. Some children can already recognize the letters of the alphabet and others know their numbers and shapes. The knowledge and skills they bring with them, together with the development of their reading 24 and mathematics knowledge and skills across the early years of school (i.e., kindergarten and first grade), potentially lays the foundation for their later learning and school experiences. Some of the differences in children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills by child, family, and school characteristics that are present as they enter kindergarten persist into the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. For example, poor children consistently score below the national average in both reading and mathematics across the kindergarten year and into the spring of first grade. These results also suggest differences that are beginning to emerge by children's sex. By the spring of first grade, females are more likely to be readingthat is, understanding words in context; whereas, males are more likely to be proficient at advanced mathematicsthat is, multiplication and division. However, some differences do seem to wane. For example, in both reading and mathematics, Hispanic children's scores tend to move upward toward the national mean over these two school years. The longitudinal nature of the ECLS-K will enable researchers to track these differences in terms of children's third and fifth grade reading and mathematics performance. Children who bring certain knowledge and skills with them to kindergarten are likely to be at an advantage in classroom learning compared to their peers who do not possess these resources. The descriptive analyses in this report show that children who have specific cognitive knowledge and skills, are read to frequently, possess positive approaches to learning, and enjoy very good or excellent general health perform better in reading and mathematics than those who do not have these resources. However, it is also important to appreciate that the relationship of these resources to children's reading and mathematics achievement across kindergarten and first grade were explored without controlling for other possible intervening factors, such as the poverty status of the family. Yet, even when the basic relationship of these resources to children's reading and mathematics achievement across kindergarten and first grade were explored while controlling for the family's poverty status and children's race/ethnicity, significant relationships still existed. The descriptive analyses included in this report are intended to address certain hypotheses in the research concerning early childhood development (e.g., children who are read to frequently do better). At the same time, the analyses are intended to point to the need for more complex models. Such models would explore the direct and indirect effects of children's beginning kindergarten knowledge and skills to their later achievement. Specifically, it is important for researchers and policymakers to understand what works for which children. Therefore, future analyses will consider the experiences of poor minority children versus nonpoor minority children, or poor children who are read to frequently versus nonpoor children who are read to frequently. Finally, a deeper understanding of why some children demonstrate and possess early 25 4 2 literacy skills, approaches to learning, and sound general health as they enter kindergarten and others do notand the ways in which schools and teachers build upon these resourcesis warranted. This third report from the ECLS-K, in conjunction with America's Kindergartners and The Kindergarten Year, provides descriptive information on young children's achievement across kindergarten and first grade. The ECLS-K will continue to follow these children into third and fifth grades. The study will provide researchers not only with an understanding of how children's early literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status as they enter kindergarten shape their later achievement but also how these resources need to be maintained and further developed for continued scholastic success. Moreover, future reports based on the ECLS-K will explore the potential influences of specific classroom and school factors (e.g., class size, full-day and part-day kindergarten programs, teacher characteristics, school environment) and additional home influences (e.g., parenting style, parent involvement) on children's scholastic success. The valuable information collected through this study will help us better understand the early education and elementary school experience of our nation's children."}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Learning", "text": "The development of young children is multidimensional; it needs to be conceptualized in terms of cognitive aspects such as reading and mathematics, and how they approach learning. Accordingly, when looking at the process by which children develop as learners, it is important to understand how they approach learning. Skills such as paying attention and persisting at tasks are important skills in the learning process (Schunk and Zimmerman 1996). These skills are integral to how children approach The reading assessment included questions designed to measure basic skills (letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds), vocabulary (receptive vocabulary, as in \"point to the picture of the cat\"), and comprehension (listening comprehension, words in context). Comprehension items were targeted to measure skills in initial understanding, developing interpretation, personal reflection, and demonstrating critical stance (evaluative judgments about the text, such as recognizing implausible events). The mathematics assessment items were designed to measure skills in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and problemsolving. Approximately one-half of the mathematics assessment consisted of questions on number sense and number properties and operations. The remainder of the assessment included questions in measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and patterns, algebra, and functions. Each of the mathematics assessment forms contained several items for which manipulatives (e.g., blocks) were available for children to use in solving the problems. Paper and pencil were also offered to the children to use for the appropriate parts of the assessment. In this report, information on children's overall reading and mathematics knowledge and skills are presented as a standardized t-score.6 T-scores provide norm-referenced measurements of achievement that is, estimates of achievement level relative to the population as a whole. A high t-score mean for a particular subgroup indicates that the group's performance is high in comparison to other groups. It does not mean that group members have mastered a particular set of skills, only that their performance level is greater than a comparison group. Similarly, a change in t-score means over time reflects a change in the group's status with respect to other groups. Consequently, t-scores are not ideal for indicating gains in achievement. In addition to the standardized overall achievement score (i.e., t-score) for reading and mathematics, specific proficiency scores were calculated.' These proficiency scores represent a progression of skills. The reading assessment contained fiVe proficiency levels (from easiest to most difficult): (1) recognizing letters (identifying upper and lower case letters by sight); (2) understanding the letter-sound relationship at the beginning of words (identifying the letter that represents the sound at the beginning of a word); 3understanding the letter-sound relationship at the end of words (identifying the letter that represents the sound at the end of a word); (4) recognizing words by sight (reading simple words aloud); and (5) understanding words in context (listening comprehension and reading simple text passages). The mathematics assessment also contained five proficiency levels: (1) numbers and shapes refers to a cluster of items that measures reading numerals, recognizing shapes, and counting to 10; (2) relative size refers to a cluster of items that measure reading numerals, counting beyond 10, sequencing patterns, and using nonstandard units of length to compare objects; (3) ordinality refers to items that measure number sequence, reading two-digit numerals, identifying the ordinal position of an object, and solving a word problem; (4) addition and subtraction refers to a cluster of items which measure calculating sums up to 10 and relationships of numbers in sequence; and (5) multiplication and division involves items that measure problemsolving using multiplication and division and number patterns. Children's proficiency in specific reading and mathematics skills was calculated in two different ways. First, to estimate the percentage of the total population who can demonstrate specific skills, proficiency probability scores were utilized (i.e., a score that is the probability a child would have passed the proficiency level). These scores refer to IRT-based probabilities, and are continuous (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1). They are estimates based on overall performance rather than counts of actual item responses. Second, to determine a dichotomous (e.g., yes or no) cut-point of whether a specific child is proficient in a specific skill, the specific items in a cluster (i.e., proficiency area) were utilized. For each proficiency level, a score of 1 was assigned to children who correctly answered at least three of the four items in the cluster, and a score of 0 was given if at least two items were incorrect or \"don't know.\" Both the continuous score and the dichotomous score reference the exact same set of assessment items. Due to the slight computational difference, the estimates produced by these scores do not exactly match (see tables 1 and 2 versus table 5). The continuous proficiency probability scores maximize the amount of information the ECLS-K captured on children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills (through an IRT model, information is provided on every item in the assessment battery). Therefore, this report utilizes the proficiency probability scores when presenting information on children's reading knowledge and skills. The dichotomous proficiency scores, in this report, are only used to determine, in a yes/no fashion, whether a child demonstrated a specific reading and mathematics skill at kindergarten entry (e.g., table 5).\nAs children enter kindergarten for the first time, about three in five (58 percent) often to very often exhibit behaviors associated with a positive approach to learning (e.g., show eagerness to learn, persist at tasks), according to their teachers (table 5). A positive approach to learning is part of a successful learning experience. Children who frequently exhibit a positive approach to learning as they begin kindergarten do better in spring kindergarten and first grade reading and mathematics than children who exhibit these behaviors less frequently (i.e., the former have higher mean t-scores). Moreover, children who frequently exhibit a positive approach to learning are more than twice as likely as other children to score in the top 25 percent in reading and mathematics at the spring of kindergarten and first grade (tables 7 and 8). In terms of children's specific reading skills, children who frequently demonstrate behaviors associated with a positive approach to learning as they enter kindergarten are more likely than children who less frequently demonstrate such a positive approach to learning to understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words as they are completing kindergarten, and are more likely to master 22 sight words and words in context as they are completing first grade (table 8). A similar pattern occurs in mathematics (table 9). Children who frequently demonstrate a positive approach to learning are more likely to have mastered the set of skills associated with ordinality/sequence by the spring of kindergarten (70 versus 43 percent, respectively). And by the spring of first grade, these children are more likely than other children to be proficient in addition and subtraction and multiplication and division (84 versus 64 percent, 34 versus 16 percent; respectively) (table 9)."}, {"section_title": "Children's Approaches to Learning", "text": "Teachers provided information on how the children approach learning. Teachers were asked to respond to a series of questions, asking about the frequency with which the specific sampled children in their classrooms demonstrated certain behaviors. The approaches to learning scale measures behaviors that affect the ease with which children can benefit from the learning environment. It includes six items that rate the child's attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, flexibility, and organization. In this report, information about the frequency of such behaviors is presented in terms of often/very often versus sometimes/never.\nFor each ECLS-K sample child they taught the teachers completed a child-specific questionnaire that collected information on the child's social knowledge and skills. Teachers reported on the frequency with which children demonstrated particular behaviors (e.g., approaches to learning). Teachers rated the frequency of children's behaviors as never, sometimes, often, or very often. To present the behaviors in terms of their basic frequency (e.g., frequent versus infrequent), the categories were collapsed into never/sometimes and often/very often.

Further, since this report provides information on children's early reading achievement, and the reading assessment was administered in English, the analyses in this report are limited to those children who were administered the English reading assessment. To achieve consistency in the sample across rounds (i.e., fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten and spring first grade), the analyses in this report are limited to those children who were assessed in English in all three rounds of data collection.

In this report, a standardized representation of the scale score (i.e., t-score) is used. T-scores provide a norm-referenced measure of performance that can be used as an indicator of the extent to which a specific group of children (e.g., males versus females) ranks higher or lower than the national average and how this relative ranking changes over time. The ECLS-K reading and mathematics t-scores are designed to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 (when all scores from the complete sample of children are in the analysis). In this report, however, the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade mean t-scores are 51 (tables 3 and 4). This is because the analyses in this report are limited to children in the ECLS-K who entered kindergarten for the first time in the fall of 1998, were promoted on time to first grade, and were assessed in English at all three points in time. In reading and mathematics, differences in children's achiniement by their family's poverty status, their race/ethnicity, and their school type persist from kindergarten through the spring of first grade. However, children's reading and mathematics achievement does not vary by their sex (tables 3 and 4). In both reading and mathematics, children who are poor (i.e., come from families with incomes below the poverty threshold13) consistently score about a half-standard deviation below the national average (i.e., 5 to 7 points). At all three points in time, their achievement is significantly lower than that of nonpoor children (tables 3 and 4). Racial/ethnic differences also exist in children's kindergarten and first grade reading and mathematics achievement. In both reading and mathematics, White children typically score near the national average (i.e., 51). The one exception is in fall kindergarten math. White children enter kindergarten with a mean score about 3 points above the national average. The picture for Black children is slightly different from that of White children. In reading, Black children enter kindergarten 3 points below the national average, and remain 3 points below the national average through the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. In math, Black children are also significantly below the national average at all three points in time (i.e., 3 to 4 points) (tables 3 and 4). Hispanic children's reading achievement seems to be moving upward toward the mean:4 When Hispanic children enter kindergarten they score significantly lower than the national average in reading (4 points), but by the spring of first grade they are on par with the national average (i.e., within 1 point). In terms of 13 Poverty is a function of household income and household size. For more information, see the Methodology and Technical Notes section. 14 The children included in the estimates in this report are children who were assessed in English at all three points in time. To explore how including children who demonstrated sufficient English language proficiency to receive the English battery in the spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade (i.e., screened into the battery) would impact the estimates, an example analysis using the reading t-scores was run. Comparing the mean t-scores presented in table 2 for children assessed in English at all three points to the mean t-scores for all children who were screened into the English assessment over time, did not yield significant differences. Specifically, the estimates are as follows: mean t-score fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, spring first grade for children assessed in English at all points in time-51, 51, 51, respectively; mean tscore fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, spring first grade for children who screened in over time-51, 51, 51, respectively. Further, the same nonsignificant finding is true in terms of specific racial/ethnic groups (e.g., the estimates are as follows: mean t-score fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, spring first grade for Hispanic children assessed in English at all points in time-47, 49, 50, respectively; mean t-score fall kindergarten, spring kindergarten, spring first grade for Hispanic children who screened in over time-47, 48, 49, respectively.

In reading, Asian children consistently are about a half-standard deviation above the national average (3 to 5 points). In mathematics, Asian children are above the national average during their kindergarten year; but by the spring of first grade, they are within 2 points of the national average (tables 3 and 4). A slightly different way to think about racial/ethnic differences is to compare the groups to one another, versus comparing the groups to the national average. When the achievement of the different racial/ethnic groups is compared, White and Asian children score significantly higher than Black children in reading and mathematics at all three points in time (tables 3 and 4). Children's reading and mathematics achievement also differs by school type during their kindergarten year. Children who attended private schools during the kindergarten year enter kindergarten scoring significantly higher in reading and mathematics than the national average, and maintain this difference through the spring of first grade (tables 3 and 4). 15 For a more detailed analysis of children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills at the beginning of kindergarten and across the kindergarten year, refer to America's Kindergartners (West et al. 2000) and The Kindergarten Year (West et al. 2001). 16 An existing analysis based on the ECLS-K explores the possible sex and age interaction associated with the scholastic performance of young children during kindergarten. The analysis revealed no significant interactions (Reaney, West, and Denton, 2000). When considering the poverty status of children's families during the kindergarten year, first-graders from nonpoor families are more likely to recognize words by sight than first-graders from poor families. The same is true for addition and subtraction. Moreover, about twice as many first-graders from nonpoor families are proficient at understanding words in context and performing multiplication and divisiOn (the more complex skills) as first-graders from poor families (tables 1 and 2). Differences by children's race/ethnicity are also apparent. White children are more likely than Black or Hispanic children to recognize words by sight, understand words in context, solve addition and subtraction problems, and solve multiplication and division problems. Asian children are more likely than Black or Hispanic children to recognize words by sight, understand words in context, and solve multiplication and division problems. In the spring of first grade, Hispanic children are more likely than Black children to demonstrate proficiency in these particular reading and mathematics areas'7 (tables 1 and 2). The differences in specific knowledge and skills by school type echo the differences described above in children's overall reading and mathematics scores. In the spring of first grade, children who attended private school during their kindergarten year are more likely than children who attended public school during their kindergarten year to demonstrate proficiency in sight words, words in context, addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. They were also more likely to be proficient in these skills when they entered kindergarten (tables 1 and 2). What is the relationship between children's early literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status as they enter kindergarten and their spring kindergarten and first grade reading and mathematics achievement? In order to answer this question, this section of the report examines three sets of relationships: (1) the relationship of children's reading and mathematics literacy at kindergarten entry to their spring kindergarten and first grade achievement; (2) the relationship of children's approaches to learning at kindergarten entry to their spring kindergarten and first grade achievement; and (3) the relationship of children's general health at kindergarten entry to their spring kindergarten and first grade achievement (see table 5 for information on children's literacy, approaches to learning, and general health). Children's spring kindergarten and spring first grade reading and mathematics achievement is presented in two ways. First, children's spring kindergarten and spring first grade overall reading and mathematics achievement (i.e., t-scores) is examined by children's early literacy, approaches to learning, and general health status as they began kindergarten. In addition to reporting children's mean 27 percent versus 14 percent; for spring first grade, 27 percent versus 16 percent). Also, children who are proficient in their numbers and shapes and the mathematical concept of relative size are more likely to score in the top 25 percent in reading than those who do not possess these skills as they enter kindergarten (for spring kindergarten proficiency in numbers and shapes, 26 percent versus 1 percent; relative size, 37 16 3 3 percent versus 5 percent; for spring first grade proficiency in numbers and shapes, 26 percent versus 2 percent; relative size, 37 percent versus 6 percent) (figure 3, table 6). Children's ability to recognize their letters as they begin kindergarten, the fact that they are read to at least three times a week as they enter kindergarten, their ability to recognize basic numbers and shapes, and their understanding of the mathematical concept of relative size all relate to their spring kindergarten and first grade mathematics achievement. Children who have these resources score significantly higher in mathematics in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade (i.e., a higher mathematics t-score) than their peers who do not have these skills. Once again, this difference is as much as one standard deviation higher than those children who do not have these resources. In terms of the test score distribution, students with these resources are significantly more likely to score in the top 25 percent in both the spring of kindergarten and first grade than children without these resources ( figure 4, table 7). 3 4   "}, {"section_title": "3 6", "text": "Children who were read to at least three times a week as they entered kindergarten are more likely to have mastered the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words before they leave kindergarten than children who are not read to at least three times a week (figure 7).

By the spring of first grade, children who recognized their basic numbers and shapes and understood the mathematical concept of relative size as they entered kindergarten are more than two times as likely to be proficient in addition and subtraction and multiplication and division (figure 9, table 9). A similar relationship is found for spring kindergarten and first grade reading skills (table 8).

Children reported to be in very good to excellent health as they enter kindergarten (\"healthier children\") are more likely to score in the top 25 percent in reading and mathematics in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade than children in less than very good health. Further, healthier children are more likely than children in less than very good health to understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words by the spring of kindergarten. Healthier children are also more likely than children in less than very good health to recognize words by sight and understand words in context by the spring of first grade ( figure 10, table 8). Children's general health also relates to their mathematics achievement. Children reported to be in very good to excellent general health as they enter kindergarten are more likely to demonstrate greater proficiency in ordinality/sequence and addition/subtraction by the spring of kindergarten than children in less than very good health.

The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 100 primary sampling units (PSU) from a national sample of PSUs. The PSUs were counties and county groups. Public and private schools were then selected within the PSUs, and children were sampled from the selected schools. Public schools were selected from the Common Core of Data, a public school frame, and private schools were selected from a private school frame developed from the Private School Survey.'8 Approximately 23 kindergartners were selected on average in each of the sampled schools. In the spring of first grade, the sample was freshened to reflect children who did not attend kindergarten during the 1998-99 school year. While all students still enrolled in their base-year schools were recontacted, only a 50 percent subsample of base-year students who had transferred from their kindergarten school was followed. For information on freshening procedures and subsampling of transfer children (i.e., movers), refer to the ECLS-K First Grade Public-Use Data Files User's Manual.

This translates into a weighted response rate of 74 percent for the base year of the study.

Nearly all (99.4 percent) of the schools that participated in the fall of the base year also participated in the spring. The child base-year completion rate was 92 percent (i.e., 92 percent of the children were assessed at least once during kindergarten). The parent base-year completion rate was 89 percent (i.e., a parent interview was completed at least once during kindergarten).

Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities at the school and child levels and adjusts for school, child, teacher, and parent nonresponse. The first stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the sampled primary sampling units (PSUs) equal to the inverse of the PSU probability of selection:9 The second stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the schools sampled within PSUs. The base weight for each sampled school is the PSU weight multiplied by the inverse of the probability of selecting the school. The base weights for eligible schools are adjusted for nonresponse. These adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. The base weight for each child in the sample is the school nonresponse adjusted weight for the school the child attends, multiplied by a post-stratified within-school student weight (total number of students in the school, divided hy the number of students sampled in the school). The parent panel weight (P124W0), which is the weight used to produce the estimates found in this report, is the base child weight adjusted for nonresponse to the parent interview at each round of data collection. Only those cases with completed parent interviews in both fall and spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade are included in these weighting procedures. Again, these adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. This weight sums to the population of all children who attended kindergarten in the fall of 1998. In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed, because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-K, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected, if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. Replication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the actual sample design used in the ECLS-K. A form of the jackknife replication method (JK2) using 90 replicates was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report, using WesVarPC. The jacklcnife methods were used to estimate the precision of the estimates of the reported national percentages and means."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation.

To guard against errors of inference based on multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure was used to correct significance tests for multiple contrasts.

The assessment included two cognitive domains (reading and mathematics). The ECLS-K battery used a two-stage assessment approach, in which the first stage in each domain contained a routing test that determined a child's approximate skills. According to the child's performance on the routing test, the child was administered the appropriate skill level assessment for that domain (the second stage). The reading and mathematics assessments had three skill levels. In each round, children were administered the routing stage and the appropriate skill level stage in the fall of kindergarten, the spring of kindergarten, and the spring of first grade. To ScaleScores. Item Response Theory (IRT) was employed to calculate scores that could be compared regardless of which second stage form a student completed. The items in the routing test, plus a core set of items shared among the different second stage forms, made it possible to establish a common scale. IRT uses the pattern of right, wrong, and omitted responses to the items actually administered in a test, and the difficulty, discriminating ability, and \"guess-ability\" of each item, to place each student on a continuous ability scale. It is then possible to estimate the score the student would have achieved if all of the items in all of the test forms had been administered. The reliability of the estimates of reading and mathematics, fall and spring kindergarten and spring first grade scores, are as follows (IRT-based theta): reading = .9, mathematics = .9. The standardized scores used in this report are transformations of the IRT theta (ability) estimates, rescaled to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 using cross-sectional sample weights for fall and spring kindergarten and spring first grade. Proficiency level probability scores. Proficiency scores provide a means of distinguishing status or gain in specific skills within a content area from the overall achievement measured by the IRT scale scores. Clusters of four test questions having similar content and difficulty were included at several points along the score scale of the reading and mathematics tests. A student was assumed to have mastered a particular level of proficiency, if at least three of the four items in the cluster were answered correctly, and to have failed at this level, if two or more items were wrong. Clusters of items provide a more reliable test of proficiency than do single items, because of the possibility of guessing. It is very unlikely that a student who has not mastered a particular skill would be able to guess enough answers correctly to pass a fouritem cluster. The nature of the two-stage test is that not all children receive all items. To calculate proficiency estimates for all children, an IRT model was employed. For the purpose of IRT calibration, the item clusters were treated as single items. The hierarchical nature of the skill sets justified the use of the IRT model in this way. Gains in probability of mastery at each proficiency level allow researchers to study not only the amount of gain in total scale score points but also where along the scale different children are making their largest gains in achievement during a particular time interval. In reading, the proficiency levels are naMed as follows: (1) letter recognitiOn, (2) beginning sounds, ending sounds, (4) sight words, and (5) words in context. Letter recognition is as it soundsthe ability of 31 children to recognize their letters. Beginning sounds and ending sounds refer to children's ability to understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and at the ending of words. Sight words refers to children's ability to recognize whole words by sight and read them aloud. Words in context refers to children's ability to read simple short passages of text with a missing word, and insert the correct missing word. In mathematics, the proficiency levels are named as follows (their names reflect the most complex mathematical construct contained in the proficiency): (1) number and shape, (2) relative size, 3ordinality and sequence, (4) add/subtract, and (5) multiply/divide. Number and shape refers to children's ability to recognize single-digit numbers and basic shapes. Relative size refers to children's ability to count beyond 10, recognize the sequence in basic patterns, and compare the relative size of objects. Ordinality and sequence means that children can recognize two-digit numbers, identify the next number in a sequence, and identify the ordinal position of an object. Addition and subtraction means children can perform simple addition and subtraction problems.

Income was compared to Census poverty thresholds, which vary by household size. Households whose income fell below the appropriate threshold were classified as poor. The thresholds were based on 1998 Census information, where a household of four with a total household income below $16,655 was considered to be in poverty. Prior to calculating poverty status, household income was imputed. Children's race/ethnicity. The race/ethnicity composite was constructed from two parent-reported variables: ethnicity and race.
