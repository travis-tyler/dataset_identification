Possible reasons include the use of disease-specific gene panels and uncertain genetic yield, despite promising signals for yield using comprehensive approaches (Blauwendraat et al. 2018) . We sought to assess the diagnostic yield and burden of variants implicated in neurodegenerative disease with genome sequencing and C9orf72 expansion testing in cases of early-onset dementia.\nPatients were selected from the Memory Disorders Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Inclusion criteria were clinician-diagnosed early-onset dementia. When possible, unaffected parents were included as participants to allow filtering for de novo variants in patients without a family history (a fruitful approach in pediatric genetic disorders [Vissers et al. 2010; Bowling et al. 2017] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] [Chesi et al. 2013; Steinberg et al. 2015] ). In addition, unaffected siblings past the age of onset of the patient were enrolled as participants when possible for variant filtering and segregation.\nBefore starting the analysis, we set criteria for return of results to patients. First, we used the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria for pathogenicity (Richards et al. 2015) to identify highly penetrant causal variation. For moderately penetrant variants, we set criteria to return (i) APOE \u03b54 status for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), (ii) any variant with a disease-associated odds ratio >2 in multiple reports as an \"established risk variant,\" or (iii) one strong report with a disease-associated odds ratio >2 with replication included in the study design as a \"likely risk variant.\""}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical Presentation and Family History", "text": "Prior clinical diagnoses for patients included EOAD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other unspecified dementias. Twenty-one patients were female and 11 were male. Twenty-eight self-reported Caucasian, four self-reported African-American, and all reported non-Hispanic ethnicity. The mean age of onset was 54 (range 41-76). Ten patients had ages of onset in their 40s, 17 in their 50s, four in their 60s, and one in his 70s. Two of the patients with onset in their 60s had an age of onset below age 65 (a typically used threshold for earlyonset dementia [Lambert et al. 2014] ). The three patients with onset after 65 were included based on clinician discretion. The patient with onset in the 70s had uncertainty in the reported onset date and an unusual leukoenceophalopathy presentation (in which NOTCH3 variants of unknown significance [VUSs] were identified), and all three patients with ages of onset after 65 had strong family history (modified Goldman score of 1 or 1.5 as defined below).\nIn addition to enrolling patients, we also enrolled reportedly unaffected family members for variant filtering and segregation analyses. Thirty-one unaffected relatives were enrolled, 29 of whom had genome sequencing (two were only checked for variants by Sanger). Only two families had complete trios (mother, father, and proband) to allow for searching for de novo variants, of which none of interest was identified. In total, 20 unaffected siblings, nine unaffected parents, and two unaffected cousins were enrolled.\nA strong family history of dementia was reported for 50% of patients (16/32), whereas 37.5% (12/32) had some family history, and 12.5% (4/32) had no reported family history. Our definition of family history is based on a modification of a four-point scoring system first put forward by Goldman et al. (2005) in which we modified the score as follows: (1) At least three people in two generations affected with EOAD, FTD, or ALS, with one person being a first-degree relative of the other two; (1.5) same as (1) but with LOAD (late-onset Alzheimer's disease) instead of EOAD; (2) at least three relatives with dementia or ALS but in whom criteria for autosomal dominant inheritance were not met; (3) a single affected first-or seconddegree family member with early-onset dementia or ALS; (3.5) a single affected first-or second-degree family member with late-onset dementia or ALS; or (4) no contributory family history or unknown family history. We considered a score of 1 or 1.5 as strong family history, a score of 2, 3, or 3.5 as some family history, and a score of 4 as no reported family history. All family history information is listed alongside phenotype and variant information in Supplemental Table 1.

We provide a summary below, with detail on the ACMG evidence codes for variants provided in the Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details.\nAn APP Pathogenic Variant in Two Siblings. Two siblings with ages of onset in the midto-late 40s and a family history of EOAD suggestive of dominant inheritance harbored a pathogenic variant in APP (NM_000484.3:c.2149G > T, p.(Val717Phe)), a well-established Figure 1 . Summary of genomic analysis results for 32 patients with early-onset or familial dementia. Pathogenic variants were observed in APP (x2), C9orf72 (x3), and MAPT (x3). A likely pathogenic variant was observed in CSF1R. Five patients were APOE \u03b54 homozygous, with four of these patients also harboring additional risk variants in AKAP9, GBA, PLD3, and TREM2. Two patients were APOE \u03b54 heterozygous and had additional risk variants in SORL1 and TREM2. Two patients had variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in MAPT and NOTCH3. For six patients, the only returnable finding was APOE \u03b54 heterozygosity. Eight patients had no returnable findings. . This variant is an example of one that would have been identified on commonly used panels for genetic testing for EOAD. C9orf72 Expansion Carriers. Testing for a pathogenic G 4 C 2 hexanucleotide expansion at the C9orf72 locus associated with ALS and FTD was ordered for 30 of 32 patients (with two excluded for technical reasons, see Methods). GeneDx conducted a repeat-primed PCR test with 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity (Akimoto et al. 2014 ) to detect C9orf72 expansions. As a technical aside, C9orf72 expansions were not detectable using ExpansionHunter (Dolzhenko et al. 2017) or STRetch (Dashnow et al. 2018) in genome sequencing libraries prepared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification assessed here. ExpansionHunter detects C9orf72 expansions in PCR-free genome preparations (Dolzhenko et al. 2017) , so PCR-free genome preparations or secondary testing (such as testing conducted by GeneDx here) is necessary for detection of C9orf72 expansions (and would also be necessary for other repeat expansions). Three patients with FTD (one of whom also had ALS) with ages of onset in the 40s and 50s harbored a pathogenic expansion in C9orf72 (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details)."}, {"section_title": "Results of early-onset dementia genome sequencing", "text": "C O L D S P R I N G H A R B O R"}, {"section_title": "Molecular Case Studies", "text": "Some studies have suggested that additional contributing alleles could lower age of onset and/or alter clinical presentation for C9orf72 expansion carriers (van Blitterswijk et al. 2012 Pottier et al. 2015; Giannoccaro et al. 2017; Farhan et al. 2018) . Consistent with this, all three C9orf72 expansion carriers harbored other possibly contributory variants.\nOne carrier had three additional variants that may be contributory: an \"established risk\" stop gained variant in ABCA7 (NM_019112.3:c.5035G > T, p.(Glu1679 * )), one APOE \u03b54 allele, and a VUS in PSEN1 (NM_000021.3:c.103C > T, p.(Arg35Trp)) (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). These variants may have contributed to the patient's family history of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including ALS and EOAD.\nAnother carrier had a different \"established risk\" variant in ABCA7 (NM_019112.3: c.2126_2132delAGCAGGG, p.(Glu709fs * 86)) (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details), along with memory symptoms and a family history of AD, consistent with a possible contributory role of ABCA7.\nThe third carrier had two VUSs in ARSA, associated with recessive metachromatic leukodystrophy (discussed further in Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details).\nA MAPT Pathogenic Variant in Three Alzheimer's Disease Patients. Three patients with EOAD (one patient also exhibited FTD signs) with ages of onset in the mid-50s to early 60s harbored a pathogenic variant in MAPT (NM_005910.5:c.1216C > T, p.(Arg406Trp)). Although MAPT pathogenic variants are typically associated with FTD (Cruts et al. 2012) , this variant has been reported in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) in multiple studies (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). This variant would not have been detected on many AD-specific panels, which often test for only APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.\nAll three of these patients exhibited a possible contribution from another allele, just as in C9orf72 expansion carriers. One patient had a loss-of-function \"established risk\" variant in ABCA7 (NM_019112.3:c.2126_2132delAGCAGGG, p.(Glu709fs * 86)). Another patient had a VUS in APP (NM_000484.3:c.1090C > T, p.(Leu364Phe)). The third patient had a loss-offunction splice variant in GRID2IP (NM_001145118.1:c.429 + 2T > G), which, although not yet firmly associated with EOAD and thus not yet returnable, was implicated in a recent large sequencing study (Raghavan et al. 2018) .\nThe presence of this rare variant in three individuals enrolled at the same clinic suggests they may share a common ancestor. However, none of these individuals is aware of any extended family members participating in the study. Furthermore, the patients are not detectably related by the software used for routine checks of close familial relationships (KING).\nA CSF1R Variant in an FTD Patient. A patient presenting with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) harbored a likely pathogenic variant in CSF1R (NM_005211.3:c.2699G > A, p.(Arg900Lys)) (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). Patients with variants in CSF1R can present with bvFTD, but the underlying pathology of pathogenic CSF1R variants is leukoencephalopathy (Rademakers et al. 2011; Stabile et al. 2016) . Consistent with this, this patient had white matter abnormalities on MRI, with frontal-predominant confluent white matter hyperintensity ( Fig. 2A ) and global atrophy ( Fig. 2B-D) . This variant would not have been detected on typical panels testing for FTD.\nAPOE \u03b54 with TREM2, AKAP9, and GBA Risk Variants. In two cases with EOAD beginning in the late 40s, we observed a risk allele in TREM2 and one or two APOE \u03b54 alleles. The first was TREM2 (NM_018965.3:c.140G > A, p.(Arg47His)) (Guerreiro et al. 2013; Jonsson et al. 2013 ) with one APOE \u03b54 allele. This TREM2 variant was returned as an \"established risk variant.\" Second, we observed TREM2 (NM_018965.3:c.259G > A, p.(Asp87Asn)) (Guerreiro et al. 2013 ) (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details) with two APOE \u03b54 alleles. This TREM2 variant was returned as a \"likely risk variant.\"\nIn an African-American patient with features of both EOAD and FTD, we observed two APOE \u03b54 alleles along with a variant in AKAP9 previously reported to increase risk in African-Americans (NM_005751.4:c.7638A > G, p.(Ile2546Met)) (Logue et al. 2014) . In this case, despite being observed in only one study with replication, the specificity of this variant disease association to African-American ethnicity and additional functional data (Ikezu et al. 2018) provided enough evidence to return this as an \"established risk variant.\"\nA patient with EOAD with onset in the mid-50s harbored GBA (NM_000157.3:c.1448T > C, p.(Leu483Pro) [previous nomenclature, p.(Leu444Pro)]) and two APOE \u03b54 alleles, originally associated with Lewy body disorders (Mata et al. 2008) , but later also with mixed dementia with Lewy bodies and AD (Tsuang et al. 2012; Nalls et al. 2013 ). Because of this and a recent association with accelerated cognitive decline (Liu et al. 2016 ), we returned this as a \"likely risk variant.\"\nVPS13C Predicted Loss of Function with APOE \u03b54. A patient with mixed symptoms of AD and FTD with onset in the late 60s harbored VPS13C (NM_020821.2:c.10954C > T, p.(Arg3652 * )) and two APOE \u03b54 alleles. A patient with EOAD with onset in the late 40s had VPS13C (NM_020821.2:c.1988delC, p.(Thr663fs * 2)), a variant in PLCD1 (NM_006225.3: c.631C > T, p.(Arg211Trp)), and one APOE \u03b54 allele. Only APOE \u03b54 was reported back to these patients because of uncertain contribution of the other variants to the phenotype. Homozygous loss of VPS13C is associated with early-onset Parkinson's (Schormair et al. 2018 ). We do not know the significance of the observation of one loss-of-function allele here, although unpublished studies have reported an association between heterozygous loss of function in VPS13C and FTD (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). PLCD1 was proposed as a candidate gene for AD in one study (Shimohama et al. 1998 ). Observing two loss-of-function variants in VPS13C in this small cohort leads us to speculate that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in VPS13C may contribute to early-onset dementia.\ngeographical area, with controls reporting a family history of dementia excluded. These controls are healthy unaffected parents from a childhood disease study in which de novo mutations are the most common cause of disease (Bowling et al. 2017) , making these parents reasonably representative population controls. Genome sequencing data from these controls was produced in the same manner (depth, sequencing technology, processing pipelines, etc.) as the primary data for this study. We set criteria for qualifying variants as follows: (1) TREM2 or GBA missense or loss-of-function variants with CADD > 20 and population frequency <0.5% in both gnomAD (Lek et al. 2016) and TOPMed Bravo (NHLBI 2018), (2) ABCA7, SORL1, TBK1, or GRN loss-of-function variants with CADD > 20 and population frequency <0.5%, (3) the specific PLD3 and AKAP9 variants observed here because their associations are for single alleles, (4) missense-only variants with CADD > 20 and population frequency <0.01% for SORL1, CSF1R, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT, (5) expansion carriers in C9orf72, and (6) APOE \u03b54 alleles. We recognize that this may contain bias because these filtering criteria were selected after analysis of cases. However, we attempted to mitigate this by selecting reasonable thresholds that would catch variants not identified in this study but that would still have been considered if they had been identified. For example, we did not observe any variants meeting these criteria in TBK1 or GRN but included them here because of their important role in disease. We also included C9orf72 carriers without information on if any are present in the control population, but this is a reasonable assumption (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details).\nVariants meeting the criteria described are highly enriched in cases, whereas unaffected family members are intermediate between cases and population controls (Fig. 4A) . Intriguingly, there is no enrichment of APOE \u03b54 alleles in the absence of other qualifying alleles in this cohort for cases versus population controls, although the distribution of APOE \u03b54 alleles is detectably different between population controls and unaffected family members (Fig. 4B) . In contrast, the presence of APOE \u03b54 alleles in combination with another qualifying variant is highly enriched in cases (and also enriched in unaffected family members), regardless of whether Mendelian variants are included in the calculation (Fig. 4C) or excluded (Fig.  4D) . The odds ratios for APOE \u03b54 alleles in combination with another qualifying variant in cases without a Mendelian cause versus population controls suggests that the presence of rare variants increases odds ratios approximately multiplicatively over those typically reported for APOE \u03b54 alone (typically reported: \u223c2.5 for one APOE \u03b54 allele, with a rare variant, 5.5; 10-15 for two APOE \u03b54 alleles, with a rare variant, 39.1), see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details on APOE) (Fig. 4D) .\nBecause we observed a clear enrichment of multiple qualifying alleles in cases versus controls, we asked if multiple qualifying alleles were associated with a lower age of onset. Age at onset did not significantly correlate with number of implicated alleles (numbers based on qualifying variants used for Fig. 4 ), but trends were in the direction of lower age of onset with more implicated alleles (Spearman's r = \u22120.2189, P = 0.2288 for all alleles [Supplemental Fig. 1A ], Spearman's r = \u22120.3664, P = 0.0856 when excluding cases with Mendelian contributors [Supplemental Fig. 1B] ). Because the small number of samples in this study may lead to a false-negative observation, we analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (2208 cases), and age at enrollment did significantly correlate with implicated alleles based on the same filtering criteria (Spearman's r = \u22120.2072, P < 0.0001 [ Supplemental Fig. 1C] ).\nvariants despite a small cohort size. The degree to which additional alleles contribute in dominant cases cannot be assessed without larger cohorts to evaluate effects on age of onset or other variables. However, given that other studies have made similar observations in ALS/FTD (van Blitterswijk et al. 2012 Pottier et al. 2015; Giannoccaro et al. 2017; Farhan et al. 2018) , this phenomenon clearly warrants further investigation.\nIn cases in which a dominant pathogenic variant was not present, there was enrichment for multiple established alleles outside of APOE \u03b54 homozygosity alone contributing to disease risk. Although the odds ratios for this observation are compelling (5.5 for an established rare risk variant along with one APOE \u03b54 allele and 39.1 for an established rare risk variant along with two APOE \u03b54 alleles; Fig. 4D ) we recognize that the small sample size in this study limits their interpretability. Future studies with larger sample sizes, and ideally future studies A B C D Figure 4 . Multiple variants in neurodegeneration-associated genes are often observed in early-onset dementia, with a critical role for rare variants acting in combination with APOE \u03b54. Note that for all panels, \u03b54/\u03b5 * indicates either \u03b54/\u03b53 or \u03b54/\u03b52 (mostly \u03b54/\u03b53). Also for all panels, cases N = 31 (32 probands excluding 1 sibling from an affected sibling pair), controls N = 542, and unaffected family members of cases N = 29. All comparisons are by exact conditional Cochran-Armitage trend test unless otherwise specified. (A) Qualifying candidate alleles associated with neurodegeneration (see text for criteria) are highly enriched in cases (P = 9.2 \u00d7 10 \u221212 ). Unaffected family members are intermediate between cases and controls (P = 0.01 vs. cases, P = 0.001 vs. controls). (B) Presence of APOE \u03b54 alone, in the absence of any other qualifying variants, is not enriched in cases (P = 0.57). Unaffected family members show a significantly different APOE \u03b54 allele distribution from controls (P = 0.026) but not cases (P = 0.97). (C) Presence of APOE \u03b54 along with at least one qualifying rare variant (including Mendelian variants) is highly enriched in cases (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ). Enrichment over controls is also observed in unaffected family members (P = 5.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), but unaffected family members are not statistically distinguishable from cases (P = 0.055). (D) Presence of APOE \u03b54 along with at least one qualifying rare variant (excluding Mendelian variants) is highly enriched in cases (P = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) and also enriched in unaffected family members (P = 5.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), but unaffected family members are not distinguishable from cases (P = 0.84). The odds ratio for presence of one APOE \u03b54 allele along with one qualifying rare variant in cases versus controls is 5.5 (P = 0.01 by Fisher's exact test, 95% CI 1.2-19.3). The odds ratio for presence of two APOE \u03b54 alleles along with one qualifying rare variant in cases versus controls is 39.1 (P = 9.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 by Fisher's exact test, 95% CI 5.3-447.5). \nwith a prospective design, are required to more precisely determine the effect of presence of multiple established risk alleles on lifetime risk for dementia. The observation that unaffected family members exhibited either an intermediate number of possibly contributory variants or an enriched number compared to population controls, but not distinguishable from cases, is expected for moderate-penetrance variants and highlights why we strongly emphasize not pursuing testing for unaffected family members when we return risk variant information. Possible explanations for why unaffected family members do not exhibit segregation include known incomplete penetrance of risk alleles, other genetic contributors not currently annotated as conferring risk, environmental influences, and variable age of onset (i.e., some currently unaffected family members may go on to develop disease in the future, as age-of-onset spreads with risk alleles can be as high as 24 yr [Louwersheimer et al. 2017] ).\nEvery case with a moderately penetrant risk variant established by case-control studies identified in this cohort also harbored one or two APOE \u03b54 alleles, emphasizing the importance of APOE \u03b54. In addition, although detectable differences were minimal between cases and unaffected family members, no unaffected family members harbored two APOE \u03b54 alleles along with a qualifying rare variant. That observation, along with the high odds ratio versus population controls (39.1; Fig. 4D ), suggests a well-established rare variant contributor along with two APOE \u03b54 alleles confers a high level of risk, and that individuals harboring such a combination of variants should be closely monitored.\nFuture efforts in the analysis of large cohorts should include analysis of level of risk when rare risk variants are present-for example, by incorporation of signal from rare variation in established risk genes into polygenic risk scores. Several groups have begun developing polygenic risk scores for AD (Escott-Price et al. 2015; Desikan et al. 2017) , but these scores are based solely on common variation. This is, of course, a reasonable approach because it maximizes reproducibility, as considering rare variants could lead to an overtrained model. However, although rare variants are rare individually, aggregation approaches may provide replicable and meaningful signals if incorporated for key genes in which rare variants are now established to confer risk for AD, such as ABCA7, SORL1, and TREM2. Similarly, although large FTD genetic studies are not as progressed as those for AD, we can begin to consider genes in which variation in a polygenic risk score may be informative for FTD, such as TBK1 (Cirulli et al. 2015) , MFSD8 (Geier et al. 2019) , DPP6, UNC13A, and HLA-DQA2 (Pottier et al. 2019) .\nThis study adds support for an oligogenic model in cases of early-onset dementia, emphasizing that comprehensive genetic approaches are valuable for research studies and could hold value clinically in the future. Mendelian diagnostic yield in this population was 28%, with an additional 22% of patients harboring risk-increasing variants that, in combination with APOE \u03b54, likely account for most of the genetic contribution to their symptoms. Genome sequencing is able to identify relevant variation in conditions with high genetic heterogeneity, nonspecific phenotypes, or established risk factors that do not follow a clear Mendelian pattern, and allowed for the identification of cryptic genotype-phenotype relationships that likely would have been missed by panel testing. However, we note that for future studies, substantially more samples could be evaluated for lower cost using arrays with high coverage of neurodegeneration associated variants and/or targeted sequencing of more comprehensive panels with known genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases (both of which are commercially available) if the goal is not to discover new variants, but to more precisely measure the level of risk when multiple established risk variants are present. This lower cost would be helpful for case-control studies but would be especially important in a prospective study design in which the hit rate for carriers of multiple risk variants outside of APOE \u03b54 homozygosity is expected to be low. For example, only 3.0% of controls in this study harbor multiple contributory alleles meeting the criteria we described for inclusion in Figure 4D outside of APOE \u03b54 homozygosity (which contributes an additional 3.3%). In addition to potential prospective studies that would benefit from rare variant information, efforts are currently ongoing to recruit patients for clinical trials based on APOE \u03b54 status (Langbaum et al. 2019) . Incorporation of information about established rare variant risk factor status could be helpful for efforts such as these.\nIn addition to the research value of this study, it had value for patient care as well-for example, by allowing for referral of families to the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network and studies such as the ALLFTD study (a natural history study of FTD) if an actionable variant was identified. Furthermore, although return of risk variants to patients is controversial, in this study we qualitatively observed that patients and their caregivers were generally appreciative of receiving findings even if they were not definitive. We acknowledge that our study conditions were ideal for such an observation: The clinicians involved were deeply knowledgeable about genetic contributions to dementia and the role of risk variants, and the patients were informed at study enrollment and at return of results about limitations of risk variant observations if they were identified. Furthermore, participants had access to genetic counseling services through the study to help clarify the potential significance of results. Future studies to quantitatively evaluate clinician, patient, and caregiver responses to risk variant information are needed. We conclude that application of more comprehensive genetic assessment (including genome sequencing, if appropriate) could aid in interpretation of early-onset dementia cases currently and will continue to grow in utility as future studies designed to both more comprehensively define levels of risk based on the presence of multiple risk alleles and also to study clinician, patient, and caregiver responses to such information are conducted.\n\nChildren with Developmental Delay).

Intriguingly, rare variants meeting these criteria were observed only in patients who also carried one or two APOE \u03b54 alleles, the most common moderately penetrant risk allele for AD (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). In all cases, APOE \u03b54 alleles were returned as \"established risk variants.\" The presence of one APOE \u03b54 allele was returned as likely only a small contributor to symptoms, whereas the presence of two APOE \u03b54 alleles or one or two APOE \u03b54 alleles in combination with a rare moderately penetrant risk variant was returned with language indicating that such a combination of variants is likely to explain a large portion of the genetic contribution to symptoms (but with the caveat that family members should not be presymptomatically tested given incomplete penetrance). We continue with detail on some cases falling into this category.\nA Case with APOE \u03b54 Homozygosity along with Variants in PLD3, APP, and ABI3. In a patient with EOAD whose symptoms began in the late 40s with enrolled unaffected parents, we observed an example of how EOAD may occur from a combination of inherited alleles from each parent, consistent with previous observations that EOAD can appear recessive in nature (Wingo et al. 2012) . The patient had two APOE \u03b54 alleles (returned as \"established risk,\") a PLD3 variant (NM_012268.3:c.694G > A, p.(Val232Met)) (returned as \"likely risk,\"), an APP variant (NM_000484.3:c.742G > A, p.(Asp248Asn)) (returned as a VUS), and a private variant in ABI3 (NM_016428.2:c.290T > A, p.(Val97Glu)) (not returned but predicted damaging by PolyPhen-2 [Adzhubei et al. 2010] and SIFT [Ng and Henikoff 2003] , with a CADD score of 33) (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). The ABI3 variant was not returned to the patient because of insufficient evidence to consider the variant as a returnable VUS or risk variant, but is highlighted because a different coding variant in ABI3 (NM_012268.3:c.1124T > C, p.(Ser209Phe)) (Sims et al. 2017 ) was associated with AD in a rigorous case-control study with an odds ratio of 1.4, yet is not predicted to be as damaging (CADD = 13.5) and is relatively common in population databases (allele frequency of 0.6%). Therefore, we speculate that perhaps the variant we observed could have an effect of similar or greater magnitude given its higher predicted deleteriousness and absence from population databases. One of the APOE \u03b54 alleles with the variants in PLD3 and APP was inherited from a parent with neurologic symptoms but not EOAD. The other parent harbored an APOE \u03b54 allele and the ABI3 variant and did not have neurologic symptoms. This case serves as an example of how EOAD may arise with either no family history or limited family history of late-onset disease.\nA Case with APOE \u03b54 Heterozygosity and a SORL1 Variant. An individual with EOAD with onset in the mid 50s and a strong family history of AD had one APOE \u03b54 allele and a variant in SORL1 (NM_003105.5:c.314T > C, p.(Met105Thr)). Although SORL1 variants are not completely penetrant, loss-of-function variants in SORL1 confer one of the highest levels of risk for AD outside of dominant pathogenic variants and APOE. Loss-of-function SORL1 variant carriers in cases from a recent study (Raghavan et al. 2018 ) are present at an odds ratio of \u223c4 compared to population databases, a likely underestimate given that some individuals in population databases may develop AD. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis suggests the odds ratio for loss-of-function SORL1 variants could be as high as 12.3 for all AD and 27.5 for EOAD (Campion et al. 2019) .\nFor the SORL1 variant identified here, we checked independent data sets for replication, and observed one M105T carrier in one study (Sassi et al. 2016) , three M105T carriers in Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) exomes (Bis et al. 2018) , and two M105T carriers in ADSP genomes (one in an AD case and in one a mild cognitive impairment case) with no controls harboring the variant in any of these data sets. No other carriers were identified in cases or controls in four other studies (see Supplemental ACMG Pathogenicity Evidence Details). In addition to these four studies, there is one record in ClinVar from GeneDx (RCV000489328.1), but it lacked a denominator of the number of cases tested and thus was not considered in calculating the replication statistic. Taken together, SORL1 M105T is observed six times out of 13,390 AD cases compared to 11 of 189,196 individuals at a population level for a replication-only odds ratio of 7.7 (P = 0.0005 by Fisher's exact test). This variant did not completely segregate with disease in four family members of our patient. However, the age-of-onset range for similar variants in SORL1 can be up to 24 yr (Louwersheimer et al. 2017) , which is wider than the age differences between the family members we genotyped, suggesting that this segregation analysis may not be completely informative. Considering all of the evidence, we returned this variant to the patient as a VUS (it could also be considered a \"likely risk variant\"). Modeling suggests M105T is a highly conserved residue (Fig. 3A) in which change to a threonine may create a PLK1 kinase site that may disrupt function (Fig. 3B) Scores at each codon were assessed with 100% conservation receiving a score of 1, with addition of a score for codon selection (score of 0 if dN-dS of site is below mean, 0.25 for sites with values above the mean to one standard deviation above the mean, 0.5 for sites greater than one standard deviation but below two standard deviations, 1 for sites greater than two standard deviations). A score of 2 is maximal, suggesting an amino acid that is 100% conserved with codon wobble indicative of a high selection rate at the position. The values were then placed on a 21-codon sliding window (combining values for 10 codons before and after each position) to identify conserved motifs within the gene.

Colors are based on 135 species alignments fed into ConSurf such that colors indicate (gray) not conserved, (yellow) conserved hydrophobic, (red) conserved polar acidic, (blue) conserved polar basic, (green) conserved hydrophilic. Note that the M105T variant leads to a predicted gain of a PLK1 kinase target site in SORL1.
