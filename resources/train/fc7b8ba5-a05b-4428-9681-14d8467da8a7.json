Background", "text": "Skill-biased technological change is believed to have progressively raised returns to college graduates since the 1970s. Given that graduate training is a heavy user of the information technologies believed to be a major source of technological innovations, one would expect that technological factors should have had a similar impact, if not a stronger impact on post-graduate earnings as on bachelor's degree earnings. The rising graduate degree premium over the bachelor's degree premium in the 1990s might be a signal that graduate training has particularly benefited by skill-biased technical changes, although one might then have expected the premium to have risen earlier in the information technology adoption process. To assess the role of technological change in explaining rising returns to graduate training, we focus on the role of quantitative skills on observed returns. Several studies have documented changes in the returns to quantitative skills in the 1980s. Murnane, Willett and Levy (1995) found that rising returns to mathematics skills can explain a substantial fraction of the observed increase in returns to college between 1978 and 1986. The effect was stronger for women than for men. Grogger and Eide (1995) and Levine and Zimmerman (1995) also reported that standardized mathematics scores or having taken more mathematics classes had a significant positive impact on women's wages but not men's wages. The mechanism by which mathematical skills influence wages is not clear. It is likely that stronger quantitative skills are complementary with the use of information technologies that are widely suspected to have raised worker productivity and wages. However, quantitative skills may also affect the type of training individuals receive. Willis and Rosen (1979), Murnane, Willett and Levy (1995) and Taber (2001) all found that stronger mathematical skills in high school increased the likelihood of attending college. Paglin and Rufolo (1990) found that quantitative skills influenced choice of graduate major. There is a presumption that quantitative and verbal skills increase in importance as the education level rises, and so changes in the value of these skills would be expected to affect the market for post-graduate training as well. Our review of the literature that concentrated on lower levels of education suggests that two effects are potentially at work: 1) Rising returns to cognitive skills may have increased the opportunity costs of attending graduate school, limiting incentives to pursue post-graduate education in the areas where the returns are rising the most rapidly. Consequently, the most able students opt not to pursue graduate education in favor of capturing returns to those skills in jobs they can acquire with a bachelor's degree. 2) The marginal product of cognitive skills may have risen atypically in post-graduate training, raising the returns to graduate training relative to lower education levels. These two possibilities would have opposite effects on incentives to attend graduate school and on observed wages. The former would suggest that the observed wage differentials between graduate and undergraduate degree holders would understate the true returns to graduate education because the earnings of those stopping at the bachelor's degree exceed the opportunity costs of those who attended graduate school. The latter would suggest the most able would attend graduate school, suggesting that the observed wage differential between graduate and undergraduate degree holders is an upward biased measure of the returns to graduate school. The latter argument would also potentially explain why we see rising graduate degree premia in the 1990s relative to earnings at the bachelor's degree level. Even before we examine why returns to graduate training may have changed, we must document the returns to that training. There are many studies that examine incentives to enter individual majors and the returns to those decisions. However, more general studies of returns to graduate education are rare. 1 The main advantage to a general study of returns to graduate education for our purposes is that if one of the phenomena we wish to examine is how quantitative skills sort individuals across degrees, we need to have the sample cover the universe of students and not just a specific field or major. In addition, it is easier to compare estimated returns to an education level to the literature on returns to high school or college that do not distinguish by field than it is to compare returns to a specific graduate degree in, say, law or sociology. A frequent challenge for studies measuring returns to schooling is that individuals are not randomly assigned to different schooling levels. If schooling choices are driven by individual comparative advantage, then the returns will reflect, at least in part, that nonrandom sorting of individuals across education levels. A large literature has developed assessing the impact on measured returns to schooling of various procedures aimed at controlling nonrandom sorting across school levels. A common tactic has been to use measures of parental education or other family background measures as instruments for education levels. Other instruments have included distance to school or other measures of school costs. As reviewed by Card (1999), these studies routinely obtain higher estimated returns to schooling when employing instrumental variables than they obtained using ordinary least squares. However, these instruments are often challenged. For example, commonly used family background variables (Willis and Rosen (1979), Altonji and Dunn (1996), Deschenes (2002)) may be correlated with unmeasured ability, rendering them invalid. 2 Another large body of research has utilized data on twins to better control for unmeasured ability. Interestingly, results based on twins are similar to the findings reported from instrumental variables using family background or school attributes as instruments. While this does not validate the use of instrumental variables, it at least suggests that instrumental variables can approximate the results obtained from presumably better controls for missing ability."}, {"section_title": "II. Estimation Model", "text": "Our analysis begins with the standard log-earnings framework: where ln y i is the observed earnings of the i th individual; S i is the observed schooling level, taken as a vector of dummy variables with the value of one indicating the individual's highest degree earned; X i is a vector of individual characteristics; : i is an individual-specific ability component that influences earnings; and u i is a random error term that is uncorrelated with S i , X i and : i . The If : i is not observable by the econometrician, then (1) becomes where the error term g i will include both purely random components and unmeasured individual ability. If that ability is correlated with schooling success, then exclusion of : i from the estimating equation will lead to E(S i g i ) = E(S i : i $ : ) \u2260 0, and so the estimates of $ s and $ x will be subject to missing variables bias. In our application, individuals decide between stopping at the bachelor's degree or continuing on for additional schooling. The choice set at the time the individual finishes undergraduate training includes four schooling levels: Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate and Professional degree (mainly law or medicine). These choices are denoted respectively by subscripts B, M, D, and P. For simplicity, we consider these choices mutually exclusive, and so we only consider the choice of the highest degree earned. This avoids complications related to sequential educational choices. The schooling decision involves selecting the option that maximizes expected utility. This can be written as where S li is the expected utility from schooling choice l. Although the utility levels are not observable, we can observe how the elements of S li affect the probability of selecting schooling choice l. Suppose that the individual selects schooling level S i at least in part on the basis of expected earnings at that education level. Then the individual will use knowledge of X i and : i to forecast what he expects to earn from each of the four educational choices. Suppose also that there is a vector Z i that contains factors that shift the individual's taste for or cost of schooling choice l. Then expected utility from each choice S li can be approximated by This endogeneity bias is caused by the joint selection of years of schooling with the expected returns from that schooling. A large literature on returns to schooling suggests that both of the two sources of bias, missing measures of ability and endogeneity of the schooling choice, are likely to hold, although the biases are often small. 3 However, we cannot infer from the past literature that there would be small biases in the context of estimated returns to post graduate education. Consequently, we need to derive a mechanism to address the two potential sources of bias. 4 To solve the problem, we follow two strategies commonly employed in the literature. First, we use family background measures as elements of Z i that are believed to alter the probability of continuing in school but that should not be directly related to what individuals earn after completing school. We assume the E(Z i V i ) = 0. However, as argued by Card (1999), family background measures may not solve the problem if they are correlated with excluded individual ability, even if they do not directly affect earnings. Therefore, we also propose measures of individual ability to include in equations (1) and (2). Let individual ability be given by 3: where : jk is the average level of ability for an individual in major j of vintage k and 0 ij is an individual-specific ability component that only becomes known to the individual after entering graduate school. The specification in (3) presumes that the individual decides on whether to pursue graduate school based on the level of preparation provided by his major at the time he is in school. Skill content of majors can change over time, and so variation in : jk across successive cohorts of graduates from major j can affect the graduate school entry decision. However, the dollar value of idiosyncratic success in the graduate program, 0 in , only becomes apparent after entry and does not affect the graduate school decision. Elements of Z i can still serve as legitimate instruments for years of schooling provided that Inserting equation 3into equation 2, we obtain (4) If the . il are drawn independently from an extreme value distribution, then (4) can be estimated using multinomial logit. The parameter estimates will generate predicted probabilities that individual i will select any of the four options S Bi , S Mi , S Di , and S Pi . Three of these are inserted into (1) in place of the endogenous S i to generate unbiased estimates of $ s under the maintained hypothesis that E(Z i v li ) = E(Z i 0 ij ) = 0. 6 This two-step procedure is inefficient because it does not incorporate the sampling errors in the parameter estimation of the multinomial logit estimates of (4) into the estimation of the log earnings equation 1. We correct the second-stage standard errors using a bootstrapping procedure in which the two-step estimation was replicated 100 times, sampling with replacement, and sampling variation in the resulting estimates used to compute the second-stage standard errors. If major-specific skills at the bachelor's degree level are increasing in market value, then they will tend to lower incentives to pursue graduate work in that field. Conversely, majors whose skills are falling in value at the bachelor's level will have disproportionately high numbers of graduate students. If this sorting effect drives lower earning bachelor's degree recipients into graduate school and drives higher earning bachelor's degree recipients out of graduate school, it would tend to depress estimated returns to graduate work. If true, then least squares estimates of the returns to graduate school that ignored the role of major-specific ability measures would tend to understate the true returns. Our empirical work provides evidence consistent with this sorting story."}, {"section_title": "III. Data", "text": "The primary data source for this study is the Scientist and Engineer Statistics Data Measures of : jk include a vector of dummy variables indicating bachelor's degree major. We also know the year of graduation. This allows us to append information on the average GRE mathematics and verbal score for the college major in the year of graduation. 7 The GRE scores are used to approximate the skill content of the major. These measures are not fixed over time, as can be seen in Figure 2. Average verbal scores rose until 1975 and then fell thereafter. Average quantitative scores rose about 12 percent until 1975, retreated slightly over the next ten years, and then resumed modest growth. These changes may reflect changes in the composition of foreign graduate students taking the GRE. We computed the proportion of foreign doctorate recipients by major for each year in the sample period, using data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates. We then regressed the GRE scores by major on the proportion of foreign doctoral graduates in the major six year earlier. 8 The residual represents changes in the skill content of college graduates holding fixed the proportion of foreign test takers. These corrected GRE time paths are also shown in Figure   2. The corrected verbal GRE path is very similar to the uncorrected path. However, the corrected quantitative GRE path shows a much steeper decline in average scores after 1975 and a much steeper rebound after 1986. 9 The time series of average GRE scores does not demonstrate a systematic improvement in the quality of GRE test takers over time, suggesting that rising quality of graduate degree holders is not the explanation for the pattern of rising returns to graduate school in Figure 1. The GRE scores also varied across majors, genders, races, and education levels. This variation provides cross-sectional variation in the skill content of bachelor's degree recipients. As shown in Table 2, students whose highest degrees were at the bachelor's level were in majors with the highest quantitative scores and the lowest verbal scores. This is consistent with the speculation that the sorting into graduate school may be based in part on cognitive skill content of majors as proxied by GRE scores. Undergraduate majors in the sciences and engineering had markedly higher average quantitative scores while Engineering and Business had markedly lower average verbal scores. If returns to these skills have changed over time, there will be asymmetric changes in the relative incentives to seek post-graduate training across majors. Because demographic groups concentrate in different majors, there is cross-sectional variation in major GRE scores by race, ethnicity and gender. Men tended to be in majors with higher average quantitative GREs and marginally lower verbal GREs. Asians also concentrate in majors with high quantitative and low verbal scores. Together, the time series and cross-sectional variation in GRE scores should be sufficiently large to assess whether changes in cognitive skills developed in undergraduate programs have a role in explaining changes in the returns to post-graduate education in the United States. We proceed to that exercise in the next section."}, {"section_title": "IV. Estimation Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Schooling Choices", "text": "Our primary interest is in deriving estimates of equation 1, but we also have an interest in assessing how bachelor degree recipients decide to continue on in school. Results from the weighted multinomial logit estimation of the schooling choice equation are reported in Table 3. The estimation uses stopping education at the bachelor's degree as the reference group, and so positive (negative) signs suggest an increased (decreased) probability of the educational choice relative to stopping at the B.A. level. Family background variables are highly significant in influencing the choice of whether or not to pursue and advanced degree. As mother's and father's education levels rise, the probability of seeking an advanced degree increases. The effect is strongest at the PhD level. B.A. recipients who grew up in rural areas are less likely to pursue an advanced degree. U.S. citizens are less likely to seek a Master's or doctorate but are more likely to pursue a professional degree. Asians are more likely than whites to pursue a Master's or Ph.D., while Hispanics and Blacks are less likely to pursue the doctorate. GRE scores have an interesting impact on the probability of pursuing a higher degree. Undergraduates in majors with higher verbal scores and lower quantitative scores are more likely to pursue the doctorate or professional degrees. The standard deviation of GRE scores in the major tend to reinforce the effects of the mean scores: higher standard deviation of GRE verbal scores raises the likelihood of pursuing the doctorate, while increasing the standard deviation of the quantitative score lowers the likelihood of pursuing the doctorate. If changes in returns to these skills over time also had an impact on educational choices, we should find that the impacts vary with year of graduation. There is some evidence that higher GRE verbal scores have an increased impact on PhD or Professional degree entry for more recent cohorts (those with the least labor market experience). However, the impact of the quantitative score has not changed over time. If returns to quantitative skills have risen over time, the impacts must have been neutral across education levels. Our main results concerning the impact of changing cognitive skills on graduate school choice are illustrated in Figures 3-5, using the results from Table 3. The simulations are carried through to 1993 because all necessary information was available, although the parameter estimates are based on data just through 1986. The most dramatic changes are due to changes in the GRE quantitative score. As shown in Figure 3, the proportion of students stopping at the bachelor's degree rises and falls with the average quantitative GRE score, while the likelihood of seeking doctoral or professional degrees is negatively related to the quantitative GRE. The result from Table 3 that the marginal impact does not vary across graduation cohorts suggests that this is a result of rising quantitative skills and not rising returns to those skills. Because verbal scores raise the likelihood of seeking advanced degrees, rising GRE verbal scores in the 1960s and 1970s tended to increase the likelihood of entering graduate school. However, the erosion in verbal skills indicated by the steady decline in average GRE verbal scores since 1975 have tended to reverse that effect. By 1993, most of the increase in predicted probability of seeking advanced degrees associated with verbal skills had disappeared. Putting the two effects together, we show in Figure 5 that changes in quantitative skills increased the probability of seeking a doctorate until 1978 and then the probability began a slow, steady decline. The probability of stopping at the bachelor's degree level began to rise at the end of the 1980s. Since that time, the probability of seeking a professional degree has fallen the most for the post graduate educational options. Table 4 contains the Ordinary Least Squares and Two-stage estimation of the log earnings equation 1. Both sets of results correct for sample weights. Least squares estimates of returns to graduate education are positive and significant. However, the implied annual returns are small. Assuming a Master's program takes two years and a PhD program takes 6, implied annual returns are only 5.9% and 4.3% respectively. 10 Annualized returns to professional degrees are more reasonable at 15.1%, assuming a four year program. There is a significant positive return to GRE mathematics scores, but no measurable return to verbal skills."}, {"section_title": "B. Estimated Returns to Post Graduate Education", "text": "There is a significant premium for postgraduate degrees in business and a significant discount for postgraduate degrees in the sciences. Controlling for the likely endogeneity of the schooling choices raises the measured returns to advanced degrees. The implied annual return to a Master's degree rises to 10.1%, and the returns to a Ph.D. rises to 13.9%, very similar to instrumental variable estimates of the returns to a year of education obtained at lower levels of education. The annualized return to a professional degree rises to 23.3%. 11 Returning to the two alternative possibilities discussed at the beginning of the paper, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that students who would be atypically successful in graduate school are actually more likely to halt their education at the bachelor's level. Consequently, average earnings of bachelor's degree recipients overstate the opportunity cost faced by those opting to pursue advanced degrees. Our assessment is that the sorting is most easily observed when examining the role of the average GRE quantitative score. As indicated before, higher average GRE quantitative scores actually lower the probability of pursuing graduate education, even though strong quantitative skills are presumed to increase the likelihood of success in graduate school. Consequently, atypically strong graduate school prospects are actually less likely to pursue graduate training. We can illustrate the impact of changing GRE scores on observed returns to schooling. We simulate how GRE scores alter log earnings directly and indirectly through their implied impact on the probability of receiving an advanced degree illustrated earlier in Figure 5. The results of the simulation are shown in Figure 6. The direct effect of increases in the GRE quantitative score is to raise earnings, although the coefficient is no longer precisely estimated. There was little direct effect of the verbal score on earnings. The rise in average GRE scores also lowers the likelihood of attending graduate school, which counteracts the positive direct returns to quantitative scores. The GRE verbal score does have an impact on earnings through its influence on post graduate training. However, when GRE scores start to slide, the resulting earnings retreat to just 2% above their 1963 level. The summed effects of the changes in GRE scores is a modest increase in average earnings across all college graduates. These are the average earnings effects, but they can be used to motivate the hypothesized sorting effect discussed above. Those who do not go on to graduate school are drawn atypically from the upper tail of the GRE quantitative distribution and the lower tail of the GRE verbal distribution, both of which are expected to raise their earnings. On the other hand, those who go on to graduate school are drawn disproportionately from the lower tail of the quantitative GRE distribution and from the upper tail of the GRE verbal distribution, both of which lower their opportunity costs of graduate school. Consequently, the observed premium of average earnings for post graduate degree holders over bachelor's degree recipients understates the true returns to graduate school. Correcting for the sorting raises the estimated returns, as found in Table 4."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "Returns to advanced degrees are positive and significant. Least squares estimates are quite low, on the order of 5% per year. Estimates increase in magnitude after controlling for likely endogeneity of the choice of pursuing an advanced degree, with estimated returns of comparable size to those estimated for schooling more generally. The findings of downward bias in least squares estimates of returns to graduate education are similar to findings in other settings. Our study points out an interesting role for cognitive skills in the market for advanced degrees. Students in majors with higher average quantitative GRE scores are less likely to attend graduate school, even though such students presumably are more likely to be successful in graduate education. The opposite happens for verbal skills-students in majors with higher average verbal GRE scores are more likely to attend graduate school. This leads to a sorting effect whereby students whose cognitive skills would suggest lower earnings at the bachelor's level are more likely to attend graduate school. This sorting effect appears to be part of the cause of the downward bias in estimated returns to graduate education-the average earnings of those who do not go to graduate school overstate the opportunity costs of graduate education for those who do pursue advanced degrees. These conclusions are subject to the usual caveat that our instruments may not be valid, although we do try to control for unmeasured ability to a greater extent than has been possible in most studies. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that to the extent that remaining unmeasured ability is important and correlated with our measures of family background variables, our results may still be subject to biases that we cannot control with the data at hand.
