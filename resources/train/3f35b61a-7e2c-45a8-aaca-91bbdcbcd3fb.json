[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT. The professional literature in mathematics education is replete with calls to use tasks that are 'authentic', 'relevant' and related to 'real life' and the 'real world'. Such activities are frequently advocated for their potential to motivate and engage students, but evidence of their ability to do so is rarely presented. This paper examines evidence in relation to the effectiveness of context problems in achieving their intended purposes and thereby contributing to enhanced student participation, engagement and achievement in mathematics education. It is argued that context problems are not a panacea and that categorising problems as contextualised or de-contextualised is less helpful than the consideration of more salient aspects of tasks that impact on their effectiveness. Such aspects also relate to the purposes for and affordances and limitations of particular tasks in relation to the purposes they are intended to serve, along with attention to the contexts in which students learn mathematics. Examples of theoretical and empirical programs built on these considerations are reviewed in terms of their potential to enhance participation, engagement and achievement in school mathematics."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Concern over declining participation in mathematics and related disciplines is widespread in developed countries. For example, the United States Department of Education (2008) cited a decline in the percentage of US students studying for degrees in the science, mathematics, engineering and ICT from 32% to 27% in the decade from 1994 and warned that failure to address the problem of undersupply of people qualified in these disciplines represented a threat to the nation's economy.\nThe Australian Academy of Science (2006) has warned of an inadequate and declining supply of trained mathematicians and a severe shortage of adequately trained graduates in mathematics and statistics. Similarly, the Committee for the Review of Teaching and Teacher Education (2003) acknowledged the need to have more people qualified in mathematics, science and ICT. These problems can be traced back to declining participation in the study of mathematics beyond the years in which it is compulsory. The percentage of Australian university students graduating with mathematics or statistics qualifications in 2003 was just 40% of the Organisation for Economic Development average (Australian Academy of Science, 2006) and is related to declining enrolments in year 12 studies of advanced mathematics (Committee for the Review of Teaching and Teacher Education, 2003) . Earlier still it is known that many students disengage with mathematics learning in the middle years of schooling (Sullivan, Tobias & McDonough, 2006) .\nMonitoring achievement in mathematics using national testing regimes is also commonplace. In the USA, the National Assessment of Education Progress annually tests students in grades 4, 8 and 12, while in Australia, the National Assessment Program: Literacy and Numeracy collects data annually on the achievements of students in grades 3, 5, 7 and 9. International comparisons such as the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study and the Program for International Student Assessment provide achievement data in 4-and 3-year cycles, respectively (Griffin & Callingham, 2006) .\nEarly disengagement with the subject is certainly not helpful in terms of enhancing mathematics achievement, and it appears that capturing students' interest is major attraction of context problems for teachers. Professional journals for teachers of mathematics routinely present innovative tasks, the vast majority of which relate to a context that is considered likely to appeal to students. The purpose of this paper is not to criticise such tasks but rather to examine the reasons for which they are promoted and the evidence in relation to the extent to which they contribute to ends for which they are intended. Finally, an attempt is made to draw attention to features of problems that are arguably more salient in terms of the enhancing student achievement, engagement and participation in mathematics, than whether or not they are presented in a context.\nThe paper begins with a synthesis of the purposes found in relevant literature for the inclusion of context problems in school curricula and relates these to the concerns for participation, engagement and achievement. Evidence concerning the extent to which context problems achieve those purposes which are most directly aligned with these goals is reviewed, leading to a discussion of arguably more fruitful focusses and directions in relation to context problems in terms of enhancing achievement, engagement and participation in mathematics education."}, {"section_title": "Terminology", "text": "Terms such as 'authentic', 'real life' and 'situated' are used in the literature and reflect different degrees of distinctiveness from problem presentations that rely entirely on mathematical symbols. Whereas 'real life' may describe word problems in which the mathematics is presented"}]
