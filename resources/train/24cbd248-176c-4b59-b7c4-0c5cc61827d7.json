[{"section_title": "", "text": "F oreign institutions and U.S. research universities play large roles in the baccalaureate education of U.S.trained science and engineering (S&E) doctorate recipients. 2 In 2011, about one-third (35%) of individuals earning S&E doctorates from U.S. universities held bachelor's degrees from foreign institutions, and 29% earned bachelor's degrees from U.S. doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity 3 (table 1). Other doctorate-granting universities, master's colleges and universities, and baccalaureate colleges combined to account for another 28%. Among U.S. S&E doctorate recipients, the proportion with a foreign bachelor's degree increased 4 percentage points from 2002 to 2011, while the proportion with a bachelor's degree from a U.S. institution declined slightly over this period for each type of institution. Public universities with very high research activity are prominent in the baccalaureate training of U.S. S&E doctorate recipients, as reflected in the ranked list of U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions (table 2). Of the top 20 U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions for 2002-11 S&E doctorate recipients, 19 are research universities with very high research activity, including 15 public institutions. Of the top 50 U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions for 2002-11 S&E doctorate recipients, approximately two-thirds are public institutions, and only 1, Brigham Young University, is not a research university with very high research activity.  2,560  167  10,960  2,302  2006  31,778  8,470  2,918  2,873  2,716  169  12,233  2,399  2007  33,977  8,693  2,983  3,024  2,892  174  13,082  3,129  2008  34,927  9,457  3,185  3,048  2,863  198  13,054  3,122  2009  35,560  10,027  3,384  3,261  3,098  175  12,790  2,825  2010  35,234  10,245  3,320  3,314  3,061  163  12,096  3,035  2011  36,654  10,555  3,606  3,437  3,229  178  12,721  2,928 a Includes high research activity and doctoral/research universities.

The institutional-yield ratios increased for all four types of institutions over this period, and research universities with very high research activity and other doctorate-granting universities showed the largest increases. When institutional rankings are determined according to the institutionalyield ratio based on S&E doctorate recipients rather than the absolute counts of S&E doctorate recipients, the list of top U.S. baccalaureateorigin institutions changes dramatically (table 4). Nine of the top 20 U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions of 2002-11 S&E doctorate recipients are baccalaureate colleges, 10 are research universities with very high research activity, and only 1 of the top 20 (New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology) is a public institution. Of the top 50 U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions ranked by the institutional-yield ratio, 27 are baccalaureate colleges and 21 are research universities with very high research activity). Only 3 of the institutions appearing on the top 20 list of table 2 also appear in the top 20 of table 4: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Stanford University."}, {"section_title": "Historically Black Colleges and Universities", "text": "In 2011, 24% of black S&E doctorate recipients 6 received their bachelor's degree from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), the second   "}, {"section_title": "Institutional-Yield Ratio Based on Black S&E Doctorate Recipients", "text": "As noted earlier in this report, institutional rankings based on absolute numbers of S&E doctorate recipients may not fully reflect the relative contributions of particular types of institutions in the training of S&E doctorate recipients.

In every year from 2002 to 2011, research universities with very high research activity had the highest institutional-yield ratio based on blacks with S&E doctorates. The institutional-yield ratio of HBCUs has been equal to or greater than that of baccalaureate colleges every year since 2005. Over the years 2002 to 2011, HBCUs are the only type of baccalaureate-origin institution that has shown an upward trend (albeit slight) in institutional-yield ratio based on blacks with S&E doctorates. Determining the institutional rankings on the institutional-yield ratio based on blacks with S&E doctorates, rather than on the absolute counts of black S&E doctorate recipients, generates a very different list of top producing baccalaureate-origin institutions (  . Data collected by the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Survey of Earned Doctorates are used to report the numbers of S&E doctorate recipients between 2002 and 2011. Data from the Department of Education's Completions Survey provide the numbers of bachelor's degrees awarded between 1993 and 2002, 9 years prior to each year of doctoral degree data."}, {"section_title": "The 2010 version of the Carnegie", "text": "Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's Basic Classification scheme for colleges and universities categorizes academic institutions on the basis of highest degree conferred, level of degree production, and research activity. Institutions that award at least 20 doctoral degrees per year are called doctorate-granting universities, and are distributed among three subgroups based on the level of research activity: research universities with very high research activity, research universities with high research activity, and doctoral/research universities (for the purposes of this InfoBrief, the latter two subgroups are combined into a single category, called \"other doctorate-granting universities\"). Master's colleges and universities are institutions that award at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees per year. Baccalaureate colleges are institutions that award fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees per year and at which baccalaureate degrees are at least 10% of all undergraduate degrees. See http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/ for more information on the Carnegie classification scheme. 5. Nine years was the median time from receipt of bachelor's degree to doctorate award for S&E doctorate recipients between 2002 and 2011. Time to degree was shorter in physical sciences (7.7 years) and in engineering (8.0 years) than in life sciences (8.6 years) and social sciences (9.9 years). Explorations of the data with 8-and 10-year lags produced similar results. 6. The analysis in this section is limited to U.S. citizens and permanent residents as data on bachelor's degrees awarded by race or ethnicity are not provided for temporary residents. In this InfoBrief, \"black\" is used interchangeably with \"black or African American.\""}]
