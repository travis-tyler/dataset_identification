[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Negative symptoms of psychosis do not respond to the traditional therapy with first-or secondgeneration antipsychotics and are among main causes of a decrease in quality of life observed in individuals suffering from the disorder. Minocycline, a broad-spectrum tetracyclic antibiotic displaying neuroprotective properties has been suggested as a new potential therapy for negative symptoms. In the two previous clinical trials comparing minocycline and placebo, both added to the standard care, patients receiving minocycline showed increased reduction in negative symptoms."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Psychosis leads to a significant decrease in a person's quality of life [1] , with negative symptoms contributing the most to impaired functional outcome [2] . Negative symptoms -reduction in emotional and social responsiveness, motivation, speech and movement [3] -respond the least to known antipsychotic treatments among all psychotic symptoms [4] . Their initial severity, together with duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and cognitive impairments, is the best predictor of an individual's subsequent impairment in quality of social and occupational functioning [5] . Their positive correlation with DUP links their aetiology to a neuropathic process progressing with continuance of untreated psychosis [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . This hypothesis has led to an interest in neuroprotection during early stages of psychosis as a potential therapeutic target for negative symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Efficacy of minocycline for negative symptoms of psychosis", "text": "A broad-spectrum tetracyclic antibiotic, minocycline has neuroprotective properties, which could prevent the accumulation of negative symptoms in psychosis [12] [13] [14] [15] while improving the prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic or ischaemic central nervous system (CNS) insults [16] [17] [18] [19] . Due to its lipophilic properties, it has exceptional potential for blood-brain barrier penetration [20] . It is also marked by its relatively low toxicity [21] .\nTwo double-blind randomised placebo-controlled studies of minocycline as a neuroprotective agent for negative symptoms of psychosis have been completed [14, 15] . The first was a 2-centre study in Brazil and Pakistan supervised by the University of Manchester with 144 participants [14] . The second, completed in Tel Aviv, Israel, recruited 70 relapsed patients with schizophrenia [15] . Both studies found significant treatment effects on negative symptoms with adjunctive minocycline. In the first trial, significant treatment effects were observed at 6 months, and in the second trial at 3 months. Furthermore, the 2-centre trial demonstrated that therapeutic effects were sustained at 12 months. No other trials investigating the efficacy of minocycline for negative symptoms have been registered in UK or US databases. However, to assess the extent and mechanism of the benefit of minocycline for negative symptoms in psychosis, a trial with a larger cohort is needed."}, {"section_title": "Mechanism of action of minocycline on negative symptoms", "text": "Although the effectiveness of minocycline in treating negative symptoms has been identified, its mechanism of action remains unresolved [22] . Three possible mechanisms of action have been posited: 1) Neuroprotection against grey matter loss: minocycline may directly prevent neurodegeneration of grey matter in individuals with psychosis. Its neuroprotective properties have been shown in stroke [21, 23] , Parkinson's disease [24, 25] , cerebral ischaemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis [26] . In psychosis, loss of grey matter occurs early in the course of the disease [27] [28] [29] [30] , is associated with DUP [31] and predicts diminished functional outcome [32] . By preventing grey matter loss, minocycline may limit negative symptoms. 2) Anti-inflammatory action: the anti-inflammatory properties [33, 34] of minocycline may prevent neural changes associated with the action of microglia and cytokines in psychosis [35] . The inflammatory response as a mechanism of schizophrenia has been suggested by studies demonstrating microglial activation [35, 36] . The gene variants associated with risk of schizophrenia have been linked to increased levels of circulating cytokines [37] . A correlation between negative symptoms and levels of IL-10 cytokine has been observed in untreated psychosis [38] . Increased levels of IL-6 appears in medicationna\u00efve patients with first episode of psychosis [39] and acutely relapsed inpatients [40] , whereas elevated levels of IL-6 at the age of 9 doubles the risk of developing psychosis later in life [41] . Minocycline may reduce cytokine levels during psychosis thereby limiting negative symptoms. 3) Stabilisation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors: minocycline may improve impaired function of the NMDA glutamate receptor which is thought to display impairment in schizophrenia [42] . Ketamine, which blocks NMDA receptors and causes dysfunctional release of glutamate [43, 44] , evokes schizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy individuals [45] . Minocycline can block ketamine action [46] , thus potentially stabilising glutamate release in NMDA receptors [47] . Minocycline may limit negative symptoms either through direct action on glutamate release or through prevention of glutamate neurotoxicity on neuronal branching and glial cells [48] . Although not observable in vivo, this can be examined by the association between NMDA receptors and working memory [49, 50] .\nThe three mechanisms of action of minocycline may operate separately or jointly. Each represents a potential target for neuroprotectection, effective only when neurodegenerative processes are active and their adverse effects limitable. Thus, minocycline is likely to be observed as being most effective in the early stages of psychosis."}, {"section_title": "Benefits and risks of treatment with minocycline", "text": "The treatment of psychosis with minocycline may benefit patients by reducing their negative symptoms and, consequently, their difficulties in social and occupational function [5] . This treatment may also reduce the dose of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) necessary to stabilise a patient's health, thus decreasing potential side-effects of APDs such as weight gain [4] . Finally, new targets for the treatment of psychosis may be discovered [51] , which could elucidate the pathophysiology of psychosis and potential biomarkers of increased risk of developing it.\nTreatment with minocycline has been associated with vestibular disturbances, gastro-intestinal upset and fatigue [52] [53] [54] . Nevertheless, our previous study [14] did not find any such link. Minocycline use has also been associated with the development of a systemic lupus erythematosus -like syndrome [55] with, however, an estimated incidence of 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years [56] . Patches of discolouration on teeth and skin have also been observed during long-term therapy with minocycline [57, 58] . In our previous study [14] , three people in each treatment arm reported hyper-pigmentation, but only those in the minocycline arm withdrew from the trial. This was the only noted side-effect withdrawal.\nThe risks and side-effects observed during minocycline treatment are less severe than those associated with the available antipsychotic drugs, which include extrapyramidal symptoms [59] [60] [61] , metabolic problems and sedation [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . It is estimated that adding minocycline to standard treatment will have similar effect-size as was observed with a benefit of second-generation APDs over older APDs [62, 69] ."}, {"section_title": "Rationale and aims of the BeneMin trial", "text": "Finding an effective treatment for negative symptoms in psychosis is of paramount importance due to their role in post-morbid functional outcome [2] .

MH2) In comparison to placebo, minocycline diminishes inflammatory action in the CNS thereby reducing negative symptoms. Decreased numbers of circulating cytokines in peripheral blood, and potentially reduced grey and white matter neurodegeneration and micro lesions in the CNS, are observed as the result of minocycline treatment. MH3) In comparison to placebo, minocycline improves function of NMDA glutamate receptors and restores optimal levels of glutamate in the CNS, observed through improved cortical function of working memory.

EPI N-back via blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast will be used to test the neural function associated with the working memory network (dorsolateral-prefrontal, anterior cingulate and parietal cortices) [95] and, thus, NMDA receptors [49, 50] , whereas EPI resting state will be applied to observe the default network (medial temporal, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) [96, 97] . Both sequences will be used to examine functional connectivity, and be merged at acquisition into one sequence to test endogenous neural dynamics recovery from cognitive effort [98] .\nN-back task In the N-back task, a well-established method for observing the working memory network [99] , the participant presses a button corresponding to the number observed N images previously.

Each block will contain an instruction image (3,750 ms) followed by 15 quasi-randomised trials comprising an image presenting the number (250 ms) and a blank image (1,500 ms) ( Figure 3 ). The response can be given when either the number or the blank image are presented. Reaction times and response accuracy are recorded. After the task has finished an image will appear instructing the participant to close their eyes for the remaining part of the sequence.\nMulti-centre MRI reproducibility Multi-centre imaging studies are an effective way to reach a target sample size in a clinical trial within a manageable time-frame. However, due to technical and setting differences between MRI scanners, the question of reproducibility and comparability of data arises. In BeneMin the MRI data will be collected in six MRI centres ( [100] , a multicentre imaging project aiming at standardisation of MRI across sites and manufacturers, and conducted a calibration study [71] prior to the trial. The calibration study, in which 12 healthy volunteers were scanned repeatedly in 5 different MRI centres with a protocol similar to ours, showed that between-centre differences accounted for 10% of variation in structural MRI and less than 10% in functional MRI, whereas centre-by-individual interaction was on the level of < 5%. In BeneMin the specifications for each sequence are:\n1) MPRAGE/SPGR: voxel size of approximately 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm 3 , phase encode on the anterior-posterior plane, whole brain recorded; 2) PD/T2: voxel size of approximately 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3 mm 3 , phase encode on the right-left plane, whole brain recorded; 3) EPI: TR = 2,000 ms, 748 three-dimensional volumes, voxel size of approximately 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4.5 mm 3 , slices aligned to AC-PC axis, phase encode on the anterior-posterior plane, whole brain recorded.\nThese parameters have been fixed as their variations cannot easily be compensated during analysis.

Therapy with minocycline can potentially prevent irreparable neurodegenerative changes observed in the early stages of psychosis, which are proposed as a cause of negative symptoms.
